            <li>so I&#x27;m not the best at it</li>
            <li>Practice makes perfect with these, but they are the funnest in the world to do!!</li>
            <li>so practice makes perfect!</li>
            <li>Love the look!!!</li>
            <li>I really loved this nail polish and the design it makes!</li>
            <li>but the colors are beautiful.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m not the best at painting my nails), but it came out really nice.  </li>
            <li>This nail polish works great.</li>
            <li>Love it!!</li>
            <li>and she likes it and looks good also...</li>
            <li>I love this color!</li>
            <li>My magnet doesn&#x27;t make as nice a design</li>
            <li>even though I have cured all the layers just like I do on my own nails, and no matter what it just doesn&#x27;t stay on her....</li>
            <li>The polish is a nice coloring and</li>
            <li>Nails done with this polish/method are cool and easy to do, but they will never look as awesome as the stock image.</li>
            <li>Very cool!</li>
            <li>I have gotten so many compliments on all the colors I have tried with Gelish and I love it!</li>
            <li>I was really impress how beautiful it turned out.</li>
            <li>please PLEASE give us more colors.</li>
            <li>What I have learned is that the polish creates a better design than the lacquer.</li>
            <li>This is a fun polish and is good quality like the rest of the gelish polishes.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get lots of comments.</li>
            <li>I would not use the magnet for more than 5 seconds because after that it all starts to blend together</li>
            <li>The polish itself is a bit more burgundy and the swirling effect with colors</li>
            <li>The magnet they sent on the polish top didn&#x27;t even work</li>
            <li>so I had to go and grab one off the fridge which worked much better.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Both the Magneto polishes I&#x27;ve used have been easy to apply - just two coats.  </li>
            <li>It wears for more than 2 weeks and still looks like it is fresh from the salon.</li>
            <li>I use all Gellish products, UV light, follow directions to the \\&quot;T\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I ended up using only one good coat and it swirled much better, but like I said I used a fridge magnet.</li>
            <li>When I learned of these magnetic polishes I wanted to experiment with them, but they all looked so cool</li>
            <li>The magnet design is so cool</li>
            <li>but it is a cool design</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just tried this color on my own nails last night and so far so good.</li>
            <li>Not how it works in real life, as most things go.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re not in a hurry, doing the magnet process can be cool if it works out</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would like to see more magnetic designs, such as zig zag, and more color options.</li>
            <li>Lots of fun, it&#x27;s unique, and the results are really pretty.</li>
            <li>far as quality/durability of polish, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>and I have to try them on right away...</li>
            <li>I love that this comes with matching regular polish because then I can make my toes to match.</li>
            <li>I was able to get the desired effect of this polish by simply holding the magnet over the nail by propping the ledge on the cuticle.</li>
            <li>I got so many compliments on this and the blue.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t look exactly like the picture</li>
            <li>so hopefully once I get all those products than maybe the Gelish polish will work better than the regular polish.</li>
            <li>This polish is sooooo pretty.</li>
            <li>You really cannot leave the magnet above it for more than 3 seconds or it will all slog together, but just try again with another coat.</li>
            <li>Also, and very important (it took me three tries before figuring this out), you have to use the magnet immediately after you paint a nail.</li>
            <li>It really gives it a 2-tone effect then.</li>
            <li>The shipping is really fast, I just got the package today</li>
            <li>HAHA...</li>
            <li>I painted one nail and immediately grabbed the magnet and held the whole thing over my nail for a couple of seconds, any longer</li>
            <li>Of course, much as some other people have mentioned, I can never get mine to look like the stock picture, it is more waves, not the angled designed....</li>
            <li>The magneto colors seems to be a little more durable than most of my other gelish colors.</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t think its worth the price especially since it doesn&#x27;t really work out as well as is pictured.</li>
            <li>The color is a little more brown than what the picture depicts.</li>
            <li>and I also wipe them with the soft cloth I clean my glasses with to polish them up during the day (especially after I put on lotion).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I happened across their new magneto product and had to gve it a try.</li>
            <li>I also use 2 coats of the top it off to give it that extra shiny wet look</li>
            <li>The Electric Metal Lover color is a pretty sparkly cherry red.</li>
            <li>The only time I have had problems with peeling is when I didn&#x27;t apply the polish over the tips of my nails correctly, but this is my first time doing the gelish kit at home</li>
            <li>They are not created equal for sure, I have some that chip within a day or two, which is infuriating, but the magnetos are fantastic!</li>
            <li>I have the black magneto as well, which is my favorite, but this red is a close second.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard ording online when the colors aren&#x27;t true.</li>

            <li> others, sometimes I wish the gelish didn&#x27;t last so long because I want to do my nails once a week now!</li>
            <li> Also, the directions tell you to put one coat, have it dry than add another coat and then use the magnet.</li>
            <li> You can just wipe the polish down with the nail brush and start again though...as I&#x27;ve had to do several times!</li>
            <li> I will likely use another of my reds as the base coat and then top with the magnetic polish.</li>
            <li> The magnet is difficult at first</li>
            <li> I will recommend to anyone, beside if you compare to other seller at amazon, this is the cheapest place you can get!</li>
            <li> I would defintely get some other colors of this nail polish!</li>
            <li> The other darker colors and reds have been a little streaky, but not this one.  </li>
            <li> For me, very active with hands, 1 week max.</li>
            <li> This color didn&#x27;t do well with the magnet, but I believe it&#x27;ll take a little practice.</li>
            <li> On a bad note, and this is probably just because of my daughters nails, I have done  her nails twice now, and each time the next day the color just completely peels off...</li>
            <li> Not sure why they included lacquer and gel; I would have just preferred to buy the gel.</li>
            <li> Unless they labeled the bottle wrong Electric Metal Lover is NOT a red.  </li>
            <li> They do not peel or crack with the three or four coats I&#x27;ve done, hard as a rock!&lt;br /&gt;Please</li>
            <li> Hmmm...maybe a white or pink base coat...</li>
            <li> tends to darken rather than lighten, at least in my case.</li>
            <li> And I mean, a nail.</li>
            <li> Instructions were very poor, for what you paid for it, it was not worth it.</li>
            <li> Was skeptical before purchasing because of some of the reviews.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love that this comes with matching regular polish because then I can make my toes to match. The magnet is difficult at first but I found videos on you tube that show how to do it. I tried to experiment to get different looks but it only seems to work the one way. Very cool!</li>
            <li> This only the second time I&#x27;ve used the gelish system so I&#x27;m not the best at it but I&#x27;ve gotten lots of compliments on it.  Took me about an hour to do because I kept messing up (I&#x27;m not the best at painting my nails), but it came out really nice.  I placed the magnet over the nail for about 8-10 seconds.  I also use 2 coats of the top it off to give it that extra shiny wet look and I also wipe them with the soft cloth I clean my glasses with to polish them up during the day (especially after I put on lotion).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like others, sometimes I wish the gelish didn&#x27;t last so long because I want to do my nails once a week now!</li>
            <li> I simmply adore Gelish. It wears for more than 2 weeks and still looks like it is fresh from the salon. I happened across their new magneto product and had to gve it a try. All of the girls at the salon were huddled around me all ooohing and ahing watching the pattern appear. Lots of fun, it&#x27;s unique, and the results are really pretty.</li>
            <li> Practice makes perfect with these, but they are the funnest in the world to do!! You really cannot leave the magnet above it for more than 3 seconds or it will all slog together, but just try again with another coat. They do not peel or crack with the three or four coats I&#x27;ve done, hard as a rock!&lt;br /&gt;Please please PLEASE give us more colors. I want orange Tigger nails!!!! Try it with Gelish Structure for even tougher nails.</li>
            <li> My magnet doesn&#x27;t make as nice a design but the colors are beautiful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several women comment on my nails - they want to know how I did it. Nails done with this polish/method are cool and easy to do, but they will never look as awesome as the stock image. I&#x27;ve tried, a lot! What I have learned is that the polish creates a better design than the lacquer. See my image, uploaded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as quality/durability of polish, it&#x27;s okay. For me, very active with hands, 1 week max. I use all Gellish products, UV light, follow directions to the \\&quot;T\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would like to see more magnetic designs, such as zig zag, and more color options.</li>
            <li> My wife never does her nails but bought this and now she does it herself everyother week and loves it, saves me a ton of cash and she likes it and looks good also...</li>
            <li> I was able to get the desired effect of this polish by simply holding the magnet over the nail by propping the ledge on the cuticle. Not sure why they included lacquer and gel; I would have just preferred to buy the gel.</li>
            <li> The color is a little more brown than what the picture depicts. It&#x27;s hard ording online when the colors aren&#x27;t true.</li>
            <li> This is a fun polish and is good quality like the rest of the gelish polishes.  That being said...don&#x27;t expect the color to appear as it does online. I ordered the Electric Metal Lover thinking I was going to get a red polish and if the label did say it was EML, I would have sworn they sent me Drawn Together--the purplish one. Unless they labeled the bottle wrong Electric Metal Lover is NOT a red.  I will likely use another of my reds as the base coat and then top with the magnetic polish. It really gives it a 2-tone effect then. Hmmm...maybe a white or pink base coat...</li>
            <li> This Magneto technology is so neat.  I got so many compliments on this and the blue.  I will be purchasing the Slate soon.</li>
            <li> When I learned of these magnetic polishes I wanted to experiment with them, but they all looked so cool - I couldn&#x27;t decide witch one to buy!! The Electric Metal Lover color is a pretty sparkly cherry red. This color didn&#x27;t do well with the magnet, but I believe it&#x27;ll take a little practice. The magnet design is so cool and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get lots of comments. Love it!! This color did need 2 coats to cover to opaque. Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Was skeptical before purchasing because of some of the reviews.  I have had no problems at all with the magnet step.  Love the look!!!</li>
            <li> I love this color! I have the black magneto as well, which is my favorite, but this red is a close second. The magneto colors seems to be a little more durable than most of my other gelish colors. They are not created equal for sure, I have some that chip within a day or two, which is infuriating, but the magnetos are fantastic!</li>
            <li> This nail polish works great. Doesn&#x27;t look exactly like the picture but it is a cool design and I got complimented on it by the girls that do gelicures at the salon I go to</li>
            <li> The shipping is really fast, I just got the package today and I have to try them on right away... I was really impress how beautiful it turned out. I will recommend to anyone, beside if you compare to other seller at amazon, this is the cheapest place you can get! So it&#x27;s a deal!..</li>
            <li> Did not like the product at all.  Instructions were very poor, for what you paid for it, it was not worth it. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I really loved this nail polish and the design it makes! Of course, much as some other people have mentioned, I can never get mine to look like the stock picture, it is more waves, not the angled designed....although someone mentioned in another color of this type of polish that they are going to try to hold the magnet at different angles, so i think I will try that next time. I would not use the magnet for more than 5 seconds because after that it all starts to blend together and you get no design (someone else mentioned that as well). You can just wipe the polish down with the nail brush and start again though...as I&#x27;ve had to do several times! On a bad note, and this is probably just because of my daughters nails, I have done  her nails twice now, and each time the next day the color just completely peels off...even though I have cured all the layers just like I do on my own nails, and no matter what it just doesn&#x27;t stay on her....I&#x27;ve just tried this color on my own nails last night and so far so good. The only time I have had problems with peeling is when I didn&#x27;t apply the polish over the tips of my nails correctly, but this is my first time doing the gelish kit at home so practice makes perfect! I have gotten so many compliments on all the colors I have tried with Gelish and I love it! The only thing is that I want to change the color every week! HAHA... I would defintely get some other colors of this nail polish!</li>
            <li> So I just got the nail polish today and tried it out. The picture does not equate to the actual coloring of the polish. On the picture you&#x27;ll see sort of maroon colors with a lighter and darker colors mixed in with a curving motion. Not how it works in real life, as most things go. The polish itself is a bit more burgundy and the swirling effect with colors tends to darken rather than lighten, at least in my case. Also, and very important (it took me three tries before figuring this out), you have to use the magnet immediately after you paint a nail. And I mean, a nail. Its not like you can paint them all and then go back and have it swirl, no you have to paint one nail and immediately grab the magnet and hold it over. The magnet they sent on the polish top didn&#x27;t even work so I had to go and grab one off the fridge which worked much better. Also, the directions tell you to put one coat, have it dry than add another coat and then use the magnet. I found that using two coats didn&#x27;t work in creating the magnetic effect. I ended up using only one good coat and it swirled much better, but like I said I used a fridge magnet. I painted one nail and immediately grabbed the magnet and held the whole thing over my nail for a couple of seconds, any longer and it just didn&#x27;t create the effect as well. You also won&#x27;t get the same effect on every nail, each nail is different I&#x27;ve found. The polish is a nice coloring and it you&#x27;re not in a hurry, doing the magnet process can be cool if it works out but over all, to me (and I do have the time to do it) I just don&#x27;t think its worth the price especially since it doesn&#x27;t really work out as well as is pictured. I&#x27;m saving up to get the Gelish products and nail dryer so hopefully once I get all those products than maybe the Gelish polish will work better than the regular polish.</li>
            <li> This polish is sooooo pretty. I like it with and without the magnet effects.  Both the Magneto polishes I&#x27;ve used have been easy to apply - just two coats.  The other darker colors and reds have been a little streaky, but not this one.  I love it.</li>
