    <ol>
            <li>Perfect size!  </li>
            <li>This was one of the best products that i ever bought for my skin.</li>
            <li>Its great!</li>
            <li>It does the work - and perfect for traveling - yet</li>
            <li>This is a good brush to use for exfoliation!</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s a good size.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s like a good scrub.  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Cleans up nice.</li>
            <li>but I kind of like it that way.</li>
            <li>This thing fits in your hand nicely and does the job.  </li>
            <li>my skin feels so soft after my shower when I use this :D   </li>
            <li>Better than a wash cloth.</li>
            <li>I am glad i went ahead and bought this.</li>
            <li>The plastic part with the bristles attached shattered into many pieces after one use.  </li>
            <li>The thing is though that its actually the perfect size when using it on your face.  </li>
            <li>okay....</li>
            <li>Product arrived on time as promised with no quality or shipping issues, Love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Personally I&#x27;ve found this to be much better than any exfoliant, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love the concept</li>
            <li>Invest in a better quality face brush.</li>
            <li>better results than a washcloth</li>
            <li>cuz i can just hold it between my fingers easily</li>
            <li>I apply very light pressure and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, but I feel that I&#x27;m still getting a good clean.</li>
            <li>this little brush is great!</li>
            <li>This makes it perfect for gentle scrubbing you need for daily use.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>This brush is small, but I feel it&#x27;s the perfect size for my face.  </li>
            <li>I liked my cleanser, so I didnt want to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li>clean it once a week by letting it soak in an alcohol solution for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Nice and soft.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t believe I would love this brush so much.</li>
            <li>It has a sturdy plastic handle and the bristles are soft yet effective.</li>
            <li>and  it really makes my skin feel lovely and refreshed.</li>
            <li>Its great for day-to-day dead skin removal.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have a huge face</li>
            <li>The bristles are gentle and overall the product has a good life</li>
            <li>But, it does make just a drop of my face wash go much further, and exfoliates nicely.</li>
            <li>Worth the money in my book.</li>
            <li>I use it right with my original cleanser, and it actually helped clear up my skin more.  </li>
            <li>When I got it, I&#x27;m like, it&#x27;s so small, but when you are actually using it on your face, it&#x27;s the perfect size.  </li>
            <li>Anymore then that, i actually found that it was drying my face out more.  </li>
            <li>This facial brush is better as a nail brush.</li>
            <li>Personal preference I am sure.</li>
            <li>I cannot say how good the brush is because it is not comfortable to use</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling very soft and clean afterwards.</li>
            <li>The bristles are very gentle/soft, yet do the job right.</li>
            <li>So far i am not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I had one of these back in the day and the bristles were nice and thick, allowing for a nice lathering.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s a great, inexpensive way to give your face a mini scrub down on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>I really like this brush for keeping in the shower to exfoliate my face.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use it so it doesn&#x27;t affect my usage.</li>
            <li>But, in fact, it helps slough off dead skin and circulate the blood, so that your skin can renew itself faster and look more fresh.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft and very gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>and I use this for daily exfoliation with a mild soap.  </li>
            <li>Nice but smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li>Plus it seems respectfully sturdy, (just dont abuse the bristles, theres instructions on the little tag</li>
            <li>I paid more for this little brush than ones with handles...</li>
            <li>I keep it in my shower right next to my cleanser, and use it about two times a week.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice little facial brush.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I tried The Body Shop Tea Tree Oil Face Scrub with the Body Shop Rounded Handle Facial Brush and could see a visible difference and much smoother softer skin in one application.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and was worried that using this brush would irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t really know why I would need anything bigger.</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that in the past, the brush used to have a longer, more sturdy handle but The Body Shop has opted to use this tiny-handle version instead.</li>
            <li>oh, and the little handle is cool.</li>
            <li>The bristles are too long to really offer the leverage needed.</li>
            <li>No hard scrubing necessary.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are pretty soft too for a gentle everyday (or every other day) exfoliation.</li>
            <li>I just lather the soap on my face like usual, use the brush to gently scrub (the bristles are very soft!), then use a wash cloth to wipe off all the soap.  </li>
            <li>This time I can&#x27;t even get a good lather or exfoliation because the bristles are so thin and spaced apart that it&#x27;s essentially pointless.  </li>
            <li>after a while I realized it&#x27;s actually easier to perform the scrubbing motion; the wrist does the circular motion instead of the whole arm as you would with a typical long-handle brush.  </li>
            <li>This bristles are soft enough for everyday use but firm enough to leave your face clean.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> This bristles are soft enough for everyday use but firm enough to leave your face clean.  </li>
            <li> Bristles are just right for my combination skin, and I was only a little pink after using.&lt;br /&gt;Great price for exfoliation if you can&#x27;t afford the electronic face polishers.</li>
            <li> It is a little on the small size but it feels comfortable in my hand when i use it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this facial brush to help remove dead skin cells, the brush is very soft and not over abrasive.</li>
            <li> I can not say how long this brush will last</li>
            <li> Did not last a long time.</li>
            <li> They are too long to scrub with and they don&#x27;t lather well at all.</li>
            <li> Having combination skin, I find that this brush feels too harsh on some areas of my face and too soft on others.</li>
            <li> I say little because it is pretty small</li>
            <li> so you wouldn&#x27;t want to use it unless its dry anyway.</li>
            <li> The brush handle is a little small, but it works very well.</li>
            <li> The thing is a bit smaller compared to the common facial brush with the long handle.  </li>
            <li> it was a descent size, but this is very tiny and almost look like a toy for little girls with dolls to play with -</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this if you have extreme dry skin or flaking.</li>
            <li> This thing is about the size of a quarter and the bristles are quite rough.</li>
            <li> My only issue with it is I have no where to leave it in the shower; it&#x27;s too small to hang and sometimes fall off the shower rack.  </li>
            <li> When i ordered this i did read all the other reviews and thought to get it anyways.</li>
            <li> I was getting tired of having a face scrub and a normal face wash.</li>
            <li> Way too small for facial!</li>
            <li> Do not order unless you plan to use other than on your face.</li>
            <li> Facial brush a little small, diameter about the size of a quarter.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too rough, but tough enough</li>
            <li> This brush is about the size of a half dollar.</li>
            <li> Got 2 from the store - buy one, get one half off.  </li>
            <li> I had very uneven rough and bumpy skin tone from sun damage.</li>
            <li> I bought this in order to exfoliate everyday.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this brush for everyday use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is basically impossible after first use without bending out bristles.</li>
            <li> It is not too small where i feel like i wasted my money.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brush is small, yes, (about the diameter of a silver dollar) but it&#x27;s for your face</li>
            <li> A bit small to hold on to, but does the trick.  </li>
            <li> Definitely not impressed with this facial brush.</li>
            <li> Small but not TOO small.</li>
            <li> but this brush is so small that it is not encouraging to use.</li>
            <li> Works well, but is hard to hold.</li>
            <li> My reaction, like everyone eles when i got this brush was that its very small.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m serious no joke.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product because my face was getting dull and was peeling, so i needed an exfolierator!  </li>
            <li> It still works, but it&#x27;s just a bit awkward to hold.</li>
            <li> For those who don&#x27;t want to shell out a $150 for a bulky clarisonic this isn&#x27;t bad (granted you&#x27;ll have to do some manual labor).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this in order to exfoliate everyday.  I have combination skin and I use this for daily exfoliation with a mild soap.  This bristles are soft enough for everyday use but firm enough to leave your face clean.  The brush is small, yes, (about the diameter of a silver dollar) but it&#x27;s for your face so it&#x27;s a good size.  My only issue with it is I have no where to leave it in the shower; it&#x27;s too small to hang and sometimes fall off the shower rack.  I would recommend this brush for everyday use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a firmer boar&#x27;s hair brush for once per week exfoliation.</li>
            <li> A bit small to hold on to, but does the trick.  Cleans up nice. No hard scrubing necessary.  Better than a wash cloth.</li>
            <li> When i ordered this i did read all the other reviews and thought to get it anyways. I just recieved the brush yesterday in the mail and used it to wash my face last night and this morning. It is a little on the small size but it feels comfortable in my hand when i use it. It is not too small where i feel like i wasted my money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I am glad i went ahead and bought this. It turns whatever face wash you have into a scrub. I was getting tired of having a face scrub and a normal face wash. I use The Body Shop Tea Tree face wash. So far i am not disappointed. I can not say how long this brush will last but i will give an update when i feel it has lost it&#x27;s effectiveness. It also came with a protective case to cover the brush while not in use which i thought was a plus. I have a feeling i will keep this as a part of my personal hygiene routine.</li>
            <li> The brush handle is a little small, but it works very well. I use it with my regular facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> I had very uneven rough and bumpy skin tone from sun damage. I tried The Body Shop Tea Tree Oil Face Scrub with the Body Shop Rounded Handle Facial Brush and could see a visible difference and much smoother softer skin in one application.</li>
            <li> I had one of these back in the day and the bristles were nice and thick, allowing for a nice lathering.  I don&#x27;t know if the quality of the product has dropped dramatically or what.  This time I can&#x27;t even get a good lather or exfoliation because the bristles are so thin and spaced apart that it&#x27;s essentially pointless.  You end up getting it in your eyes and all over everything.  Definitely not impressed with this facial brush.</li>
            <li> Perfect size!  When I got it, I&#x27;m like, it&#x27;s so small, but when you are actually using it on your face, it&#x27;s the perfect size.  It&#x27;s not too rough, but tough enough it&#x27;s like a good scrub.  I would recommend it!</li>
            <li> my skin feels so soft after my shower when I use this :D   and I use it on my neck and chest too. My skin feels smoother, softer, brighter and overall healthier. Plus it seems respectfully sturdy, (just dont abuse the bristles, theres instructions on the little tag it comes with)  oh, and the little handle is cool. I like it cuz i can just hold it between my fingers easily so no complaints there. Totally recommend!</li>
            <li> This brush is about the size of a half dollar. Maybe it gives the size on the site, but I was expecting it to be bigger. Works well, but is hard to hold. Wish it was bigger.</li>
            <li> Got 2 from the store - buy one, get one half off.  The plastic part with the bristles attached shattered into many pieces after one use.  You get what you pay for...</li>
            <li> I really like this brush for keeping in the shower to exfoliate my face. Its great for day-to-day dead skin removal. I would not recommend this if you have extreme dry skin or flaking. Like a peeling sunburn for example. The bristles are too long to really offer the leverage needed. This makes it perfect for gentle scrubbing you need for daily use.&lt;br /&gt;This brush comes with a topper to put into. This is basically impossible after first use without bending out bristles. I don&#x27;t really use it so it doesn&#x27;t affect my usage. Topper does not have a hole in it or anything so there is no drainage so you wouldn&#x27;t want to use it unless its dry anyway. Could be helpful for travel.</li>
            <li> wish it was bigger. this thing is too tiny!  its like a scrub brush for a babies face. try to used face pads instead.</li>
            <li> The thing is a bit smaller compared to the common facial brush with the long handle.  Initially it felt more difficult to use, but after a while I realized it&#x27;s actually easier to perform the scrubbing motion; the wrist does the circular motion instead of the whole arm as you would with a typical long-handle brush.  I would prefer if they had a slightly bigger version with stiffer bristle.</li>
            <li> Facial brush a little small, diameter about the size of a quarter.  Was hoping it was bigger.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because my face was getting dull and was peeling, so i needed an exfolierator!  I liked my cleanser, so I didnt want to buy a new one.  My reaction, like everyone eles when i got this brush was that its very small.  The thing is though that its actually the perfect size when using it on your face.  I keep it in my shower right next to my cleanser, and use it about two times a week.  Anymore then that, i actually found that it was drying my face out more.  I use it right with my original cleanser, and it actually helped clear up my skin more.  This was one of the best products that i ever bought for my skin.</li>
            <li> I had no idea this was a THREE PACK of brushes. And I ordered two! Thats okay....this little brush is great! Nice and soft. Small but not TOO small. Its great! Product arrived on time as promised with no quality or shipping issues, Love it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the little-bitty handle.</li>
            <li> It not big enough for my hands. That all i have to say on this. i don&#x27;t have anything else to say.</li>
            <li> Wow! Didn&#x27;t believe I would love this brush so much. It&#x27;s so soft and very gentle on the skin. I would mos def recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> This brush is small, but I feel it&#x27;s the perfect size for my face.  My pores are clearer and smaller than they&#x27;ve ever been from using this.  I just lather the soap on my face like usual, use the brush to gently scrub (the bristles are very soft!), then use a wash cloth to wipe off all the soap.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Bought this product because I look body shop product but this brush is so small that it is not encouraging to use. I cannot say how good the brush is because it is not comfortable to use</li>
            <li> For those who don&#x27;t want to shell out a $150 for a bulky clarisonic this isn&#x27;t bad (granted you&#x27;ll have to do some manual labor).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this to wash my face before bed. The bristles are gentle and overall the product has a good life span.&lt;br /&gt;Personally I&#x27;ve found this to be much better than any exfoliant, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot.&lt;br /&gt;I clean it once a week by letting it soak in an alcohol solution for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> This is a good brush to use for exfoliation! It has a sturdy plastic handle and the bristles are soft yet effective.</li>
            <li> I ordered this facial brush to help remove dead skin cells, the brush is very soft and not over abrasive.</li>
            <li> I purchased this thinking it was a descent size, but this is very tiny and almost look like a toy for little girls with dolls to play with - I&#x27;m serious no joke.  It does the work - and perfect for traveling - yet I still had to purchase a descent size one to use in my bathroom</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. This facial brush is better as a nail brush. Way too small for facial! Should be returned. Do not order unless you plan to use other than on your face.</li>
            <li> I love the concept but it&#x27;s so much smaller than what I thought. I paid more for this little brush than ones with handles... Personal preference I am sure.</li>
            <li> I have been using The Body Shop face brush for years (10+). The bristles are very gentle/soft, yet do the job right. I have sensitive skin and was worried that using this brush would irritate my skin. But, in fact, it helps slough off dead skin and circulate the blood, so that your skin can renew itself faster and look more fresh. It leaves my skin feeling very soft and clean afterwards. I use it with [[ASIN:B0019EYDKY The Body Shop Vitamin E Cream Cleanser Regular - 6.7 fl oz]] and  it really makes my skin feel lovely and refreshed. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that in the past, the brush used to have a longer, more sturdy handle but The Body Shop has opted to use this tiny-handle version instead. It still works, but it&#x27;s just a bit awkward to hold. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a great, inexpensive way to give your face a mini scrub down on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> This thing is about the size of a quarter and the bristles are quite rough. They are too long to scrub with and they don&#x27;t lather well at all. Meh</li>
            <li> Nice but smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> Bristles are just right for my combination skin, and I was only a little pink after using.&lt;br /&gt;Great price for exfoliation if you can&#x27;t afford the electronic face polishers.</li>
            <li> Did not last a long time. Invest in a better quality face brush.</li>
            <li> Having combination skin, I find that this brush feels too harsh on some areas of my face and too soft on others. But, it does make just a drop of my face wash go much further, and exfoliates nicely.</li>
            <li> This is a nice little facial brush. I say little because it is pretty small but I kind of like it that way. I don&#x27;t really have a huge face so I don&#x27;t really know why I would need anything bigger.The bristles are pretty soft too for a gentle everyday (or every other day) exfoliation. Worth the money in my book.</li>
            <li> better results than a washcloth</li>
            <li> This thing fits in your hand nicely and does the job.  I apply very light pressure and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin, but I feel that I&#x27;m still getting a good clean.</li>
