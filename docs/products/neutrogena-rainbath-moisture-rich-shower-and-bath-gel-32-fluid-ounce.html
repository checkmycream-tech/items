            <li>/&gt;and love the moisture formula for the drying winters.  </li>
            <li>I love this scent and the moisturizing of this Neutrogena Rainbath.</li>
            <li>It is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Love this body wash.  </li>
            <li>Most all shower gels and washes &amp;#34;strip&amp;#34; the skin of moisture.</li>
            <li>I then apply Neutrogena Light Sesame Body Lotion and I am set!</li>
            <li>It has a refreshing aroma that is not at all flowery.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>favorite gel - I use it every day.</li>
            <li>Have repurchased this many times.</li>
            <li>Outstanding.  </li>
            <li>My favorite Rainbath</li>
            <li>I love this product and I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>This soap is very nice, a small amount suds up nice, rinses off well, and leaves a very light, pleasant scent on skin.  </li>
            <li>Ocean Mist is my favorite, it is light and refreshing - does not smell too fruity/girly or manly.&lt;br /&gt;Pear</li>
            <li>Nice lather, and love the large pump bottle.  </li>
            <li>I love all Rainbath body washes, they are wonderful for a few reasons:  </li>
            <li>Amazon has good deals on this, but you can also find it in some brand name stores, or bulk warehouse stores - however their options for scent and volume tend to fluctuate so coming back to Amazon is always a nice option if those fail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I feel very clean and my skin feels very soft,  after a shower with this product love it!</li>
            <li>I love the way this stuff smells, it&#x27;s light in fragrance and leaves you with a clean, fresh scent!</li>
            <li>Love the fresh scent.</li>
            <li>This is a nice change, very beach-like marine scent.  </li>
            <li>I used this shower gel in conjunction with Neutrogena&#x27;s Light Body Lotion and oil-free moisturizer for combination skin.</li>
            <li>It makes my shower so comfortable and relaxing.</li>
            <li>Has a good masculine smell.  </li>
            <li>Nice easy pump action to make life easier while bathing.</li>
            <li>I tried this after using the Neutrogena Original Scent.  </li>
            <li>love, love, love - can&#x27;t this in drug stores or the big box places like Costco or BJs</li>
            <li>It leaves you clean.</li>
            <li>Works great, has a nice smell, not overpowering, but I personally prefer the original sesame Neutrogena scent, and would not buy it again only for that reason.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena still the one I turn to for non-itch, clean, fresh products.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and was just as described.</li>
            <li>The large size pump makes it so easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy and gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>It just looks pretty in our shower!</li>
            <li>Love this soap because it is so mild on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>- light green, also a wonderful scent, light enough that you can&#x27;t smell the fruit scent too much after your shower (if concerned about</li>
            <li>/&gt;Original - darker amber color, definitely more masculine scent.</li>
            <li>Wow, love this product</li>
            <li>It works great for my dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I am pretty excited that I decided to use Neutrogena products as they are really reasonably priced on Amazon and are of a higher quality that some higher priced products.</li>
            <li>Wow, this is my favorite new shower gel.</li>
            <li>the after effects)&lt;br /&gt;Pomegranate - dark red, another good scent but a little stronger smell &amp; a more fruity smell than Pear&lt;br /&gt;Moisture Rich - darker blue, a good scent that smells good but a little too on the manly side for me.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Price Point - It&#x27;s definitely a more expensive body wash, but volume wise</li>
            <li>We purchased a different variety of this product (ocean mist) - it&#x27;s just not the same - this version is way more rich and moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>my skin is very soft after I get out of the shower and smells fresh.</li>
            <li>Large bottle size with pump</li>
            <li>Pretty much like most other body</li>
            <li>Neutrogena is my soap of choice, does not dry out my skin, and always feel clean and refreshed after using it</li>
            <li>It really does feel and look silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Leaves skin silky smooth, especially when paired with an after bath moisturizer.</li>
            <li>that it&#x27;s more moisturizing than the other Rainbath products.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the yellow Neutrogena shower gel for years and this year upgraded to the moisture rich shower gel.  </li>
            <li>I like the clean blue color and sleek packaging of this product as well.</li>
            <li>The scent does not smell decent.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>so this is really easy to place in the shower and use without having to worry about refilling too often or worrying about bar soap getting gross, and no bottle cap to lose or constantly open/close.</li>
            <li>I like it because it has exactly the right consistency (not to thin) such that none gets wasted, and this particular scent (the blue) is very very light and nice.</li>
            <li>(Nothing too heavy -- just clean smelling.)</li>
            <li>better.)&lt;br /&gt;Ocean Mist - light blue (not to be confused with the darker blue color of the Moisture Rich)</li>
            <li>Our whole family -male and female use it!</li>
            <li>I have found my new regiment and absolutely HANDS DOWN recommend you try this product!</li>
            <li>Not too strong or too weak.  </li>
            <li>it is worth the expense since a little does go a long way.  </li>

            <li> it is worth the expense since a little does go a long way.  </li>
            <li> Considering it seems to instantly remove any crepiness on my hands and body, I wonder what it will do long term?!</li>
            <li> Not sure what all the fuss is about this product - it&#x27;s nice, but not incredible.</li>
            <li> Lasts a LONG time...........</li>
            <li> After reading multiple reviews and recommendations, I finally decided to try a few of Neutrogena&#x27;s skin and bath products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am curious to see how it effects my skin long term, as I have lost over 20 lbs.</li>
            <li> I have only used handmade bar soap in the past that is shea butter based, as that is the only thing that has kept my skin moisturized.</li>
            <li> but I need to use much less of it than I do other body washes to get the same amount of lather.</li>
            <li> Really is not one of my favorites at all.  </li>
            <li> but I find the smell to be a little harsh especially compared to the other options.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am 45, have begun menopause and have seen some changes in my skin regarding dryness and slight crepiness - OH</li>
            <li> It may seem a little costly</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the little things that make this product even</li>
            <li> The only thing was the botlle when it arrived was all dripping out of the bottle and the pump was broken.</li>
            <li> It has no residue or heavy scent.  </li>
            <li> (It&#x27;s the little things!)  </li>
            <li> And again not many products come in a array of scents in this volume and the convenient pump.  </li>
            <li> I find my skin is less likely to itch in the cold weather</li>
            <li> This scent and size is hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Also hard to find sometimes.</li>
            <li> Unlike other expensive soaps it does not sting on my lady parts.</li>
            <li> It is a little expensive though.</li>
            <li> I wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> NO! : (&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
    </ol>

It may seem a little costly but I need to use much less of it than I do other body washes to get the same amount of lather. It smells nice, too. (Nothing too heavy -- just clean smelling.) I like the clean blue color and sleek packaging of this product as well. It just looks pretty in our shower!</li>
            <li> This scent and size is hard to find in stores. Love it!</li>
            <li> Very refreshing and excellent shower gel.  I also use it for every day hand soap.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Smells good, lathers and spreads good, moisturizes good, nice settling after smell as well. I will buy again... It is a little expensive though. Unlike other expensive soaps it does not sting on my lady parts.</li>
            <li> Great product &amp; price!</li>
            <li> Works great, has a nice smell, not overpowering, but I personally prefer the original sesame Neutrogena scent, and would not buy it again only for that reason.</li>
            <li> Not the item as pictured.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena is my soap of choice, does not dry out my skin, and always feel clean and refreshed after using it</li>
            <li> I love all Rainbath body washes, they are wonderful for a few reasons:  Large bottle size with pump so this is really easy to place in the shower and use without having to worry about refilling too often or worrying about bar soap getting gross, and no bottle cap to lose or constantly open/close. (It&#x27;s the little things!)  All of their body washes work well, and a bonus is that there are so many scents to choose from, (again..it&#x27;s the little things that make this product even better.)&lt;br /&gt;Ocean Mist - light blue (not to be confused with the darker blue color of the Moisture Rich) Ocean Mist is my favorite, it is light and refreshing - does not smell too fruity/girly or manly.&lt;br /&gt;Pear - light green, also a wonderful scent, light enough that you can&#x27;t smell the fruit scent too much after your shower (if concerned about the after effects)&lt;br /&gt;Pomegranate - dark red, another good scent but a little stronger smell &amp; a more fruity smell than Pear&lt;br /&gt;Moisture Rich - darker blue, a good scent that smells good but a little too on the manly side for me.  Not offensive or cologne overkill smell, but a stronger scent I would associate to be more masculine&lt;br /&gt;Original - darker amber color, definitely more masculine scent. Really is not one of my favorites at all.  Still a good body wash but I find the smell to be a little harsh especially compared to the other options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price Point - It&#x27;s definitely a more expensive body wash, but volume wise it is worth the expense since a little does go a long way.  And again not many products come in a array of scents in this volume and the convenient pump.  Amazon has good deals on this, but you can also find it in some brand name stores, or bulk warehouse stores - however their options for scent and volume tend to fluctuate so coming back to Amazon is always a nice option if those fail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a wonderful product that is worth it.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> This is a repeat purchase</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a neutrogena guy when it comes to skincare so it sure was a good buy. It is a good buy.</li>
            <li> Been using this product/variety for years. Easy and gentle on the skin. Has a very light and pleasant fragrance. Also hard to find sometimes.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena still the one I turn to for non-itch, clean, fresh products.  Have used rainbath for 20+ years&lt;br /&gt;and love the moisture formula for the drying winters.  Our whole family -male and female use it!</li>
            <li> I love this scent and the moisturizing of this Neutrogena Rainbath. It is my favorite. I wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> Works well, but I wasn&#x27;t fond of the smell.</li>
            <li> Feels good and smells very fresh!</li>
            <li> Like Neutrogena bath products.  Value is excellent for the price.</li>
            <li> Awesome.  Where is the 40 oz?</li>
            <li> Been using Neutragena, for years. Love the fresh scent. It leaves you clean. Will plan to keep using it.</li>
            <li> Love this body wash.  I have used it for years and this was a great price.  Service was excellent.</li>
            <li> I feel very clean and my skin feels very soft,  after a shower with this product love it!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and was just as described. Excellent. Will use vendor again.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, this body wash IS moisturizing! I have only used handmade bar soap in the past that is shea butter based, as that is the only thing that has kept my skin moisturized. Most all shower gels and washes &amp;#34;strip&amp;#34; the skin of moisture. I am 45, have begun menopause and have seen some changes in my skin regarding dryness and slight crepiness - OH NO! : (&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not this body wash....my skin is very soft after I get out of the shower and smells fresh. I then apply Neutrogena Light Sesame Body Lotion and I am set! My skin feels great, looks great (super soft and no crepiness). It really does feel and look silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am curious to see how it effects my skin long term, as I have lost over 20 lbs. and have a bit of &amp;#34;stretch marks&amp;#34; around my hips and buttocks and will add to this review after I use the product for about a month to see if there is any improvement with that. Considering it seems to instantly remove any crepiness on my hands and body, I wonder what it will do long term?! I am pretty excited that I decided to use Neutrogena products as they are really reasonably priced on Amazon and are of a higher quality that some higher priced products.</li>
            <li> It a good shower gel I always liked. So, I bought a bigger bottle. It&#x27;s a very good price.</li>
            <li> I have been using neutrogena for years. The only thing was the botlle when it arrived was all dripping out of the bottle and the pump was broken.</li>
            <li> It has a refreshing aroma that is not at all flowery.&lt;br /&gt;My favorite gel - I use it every day.</li>
            <li> I tried this after using the Neutrogena Original Scent.  This is a nice change, very beach-like marine scent.  Nice lather, and love the large pump bottle.  Have repurchased this many times.</li>
            <li> Cleans well, smells great !</li>
            <li> SMELLS WONDERFUL...I do not like the gold stuff.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance of this body soap!  Not too strong or too weak.  Has a good masculine smell.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> The scent does not smell decent.</li>
            <li> Outstanding.  My favorite Rainbath</li>
            <li> This is good also but I wanted the Neutrogena Ocean Mist body gel got this instead. Still would like the Ocean Mist. The bottle came open in the box it was shipped in as well.</li>
            <li> The hubby and I use this - one bottle of body wash in the shower, saves a lot of clutter.  It doesn&#x27;t smell too &amp;#34;girlie&amp;#34; for him, and I like that it&#x27;s more moisturizing than the other Rainbath products.  Lasts a LONG time...........&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  We purchased a different variety of this product (ocean mist) - it&#x27;s just not the same - this version is way more rich and moisturizing.  Lesson learned.</li>
            <li> My wife got me using this soap. It cleans well, smells good and leaves no soap film on the tub to be cleaned. Got one coming every 4 months.</li>
            <li> I love this product and buy it whenever it is on any kind of a sale.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the yellow Neutrogena shower gel for years and this year upgraded to the moisture rich shower gel.  It has no residue or heavy scent.  I find my skin is less likely to itch in the cold weather so it serves my purpose.</li>
            <li> This bodywash...I am not one to write reviews. I have been using the same bath and beauty products for bout 2 years and was looking to update my beauty regiment. After reading multiple reviews and recommendations, I finally decided to try a few of Neutrogena&#x27;s skin and bath products. This bodywash is freaking AMAZING!  It lathers beautifully, coats well for shaving and rinses quick and clean. I love the way this stuff smells, it&#x27;s light in fragrance and leaves you with a clean, fresh scent! I used this shower gel in conjunction with Neutrogena&#x27;s Light Body Lotion and oil-free moisturizer for combination skin. I have found my new regiment and absolutely HANDS DOWN recommend you try this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena Rainbath for probably 20 years now and I love it!</li>
            <li> This soap is very nice, a small amount suds up nice, rinses off well, and leaves a very light, pleasant scent on skin.  Will continue to buy.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I love this product and I would recommend it to everyone. It is a great smelling shower gel and you don&#x27;t have to use a lot of it for it to work.</li>
            <li> I love it. It makes my shower so comfortable and relaxing. Recommend it.</li>
            <li> The bottle was leaking when arrived.</li>
            <li> Wow, love this product</li>
            <li> love, love, love - can&#x27;t this in drug stores or the big box places like Costco or BJs</li>
            <li> Nice easy pump action to make life easier while bathing. Leaves skin silky smooth, especially when paired with an after bath moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!!  It works great for my dry sensitive skin.</li>
