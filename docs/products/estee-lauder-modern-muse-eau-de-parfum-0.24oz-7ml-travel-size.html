            <li>Best pricing I found was on Amazon.</li>
            <li>This scent was not what I was expecting in a really good way!!</li>

            <li>great product..</li>
            <li>Whenever I wear it to the office, I have people asking me what I&#x27;m wearing because my office smells so nice!</li>
            <li>Then there is an after scent that reminds me of a wonderful, rich soap!</li>
            <li>I love this scent!  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s ok, but if she likes it so do I!</li>
            <li>I love good perfumes and this one didn&#x27;t disappoint.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a wonderful, soft fragrance.</li>
            <li>So if any women wants to look good, sound good, feel good, and SMELL GOOD also, try Modern Muse.  </li>
            <li>Love this perfume.  </li>
            <li>I love this scent...</li>
            <li>Will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>When I got a sample of this, I found I enjoyed wearing it.</li>
            <li>and I just fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>Grown and sexy....</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance.  </li>
            <li>you feel free like its you and the world!</li>
            <li>but I dont know for sure if this on is .24 oz or not</li>
            <li>rich, but not over powering...woodsy, yet floral - but not too sweet...musk, but not over done or &#x27;70&#x27;s style!</li>
            <li>After I got a free sample online my wife started to love this smelly stuff....</li>
            <li>It was subtle and sexy and I am impressed at how Estee Lauder&lt;br /&gt;continues</li>
            <li>Not too overbearing, with nice soft lingering scent.</li>
            <li>I love the fragrance of Modern Muse.  </li>
            <li>I personally don&#x27;t think it smells good at all .</li>
            <li>Its smells clean and fresh and it lasts all day  </li>
            <li>Crisp and light.</li>
            <li>This fragrance is absolutely irresistible!!</li>
            <li>Fresh smell my husband loves this on me</li>
            <li>Very sophisticated smell, def not a young teenie bopper smell.</li>
            <li>I rarely wear perfume, but a sample in a magazine caught my attention.</li>
            <li>the folks behind the scenes formulating some really exquisite scents.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so fresh and flowery.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a breath of fresh air.</li>
            <li>Has a very modern scent.</li>
            <li>and I do like it very much.</li>
            <li>The only way to use it is to remove the top and splash it on myself.</li>
            <li>But she loves it so much she asked for a large bottle this year!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;a not too sweet and has a professional aroma.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bottle is small, but much larger than many of the others I&#x27;ve tried...which is nice...it allows you to truly sample this lovely perfume before you spend a substantial amount on a full size bottle.</li>
            <li>The only problem I have is the top - it is not a spray, and the top does not screw down, it is just a stopper type.</li>
            <li>An improvement on Modern Muse would be to have a spray attachment on the bottle, or have a cap that screws on.</li>
            <li>I was really drawn to it.</li>
            <li>to build on the former foundations of success with</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re new inventions of fragrance...</li>
            <li>Smells amazing very subtle</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My wife likes this perfume so if she likes it I like it</li>
            <li> Love this perfume.  Its smells clean and fresh and it lasts all day  now I need a Big bottle when I can afford it LOL  Will buy Again</li>
            <li> The photography made the item look bigger, so therefore, when it came in the mail I was disappointed. It was for a Mother&#x27;s Day gift.</li>
            <li> I love good perfumes and this one didn&#x27;t disappoint.  Not only did I receive the item purchased, but I received it earlier than initially stated.</li>
            <li> I love this scent...I&#x27;m not sure how to describe it...rich, but not over powering...woodsy, yet floral - but not too sweet...musk, but not over done or &#x27;70&#x27;s style! Then there is an after scent that reminds me of a wonderful, rich soap! The bottle is small, but much larger than many of the others I&#x27;ve tried...which is nice...it allows you to truly sample this lovely perfume before you spend a substantial amount on a full size bottle. You just can&#x27;t go wrong with Estee Lauder!</li>
            <li> The smell is perfect. Not too overbearing, with nice soft lingering scent.</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance of Modern Muse.  It is being worn all day and night and not being tired of.  It&#x27;a not too sweet and has a professional aroma.&lt;br /&gt; So if any women wants to look good, sound good, feel good, and SMELL GOOD also, try Modern Muse.  You&#x27;ll definitely be&lt;br /&gt;pleased.  I am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seesee Davis&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s.  An improvement on Modern Muse would be to have a spray attachment on the bottle, or have a cap that screws on. The cap&lt;br /&gt;  slides off the travel size I purchased.</li>
            <li> I love this scent!  The value of the product was great as well.</li>
            <li> Has a very modern scent. Crisp and light. Wanted the travel size just to find out if I wanted the big bottle. Will be ordering more. The only problem I have is the top - it is not a spray, and the top does not screw down, it is just a stopper type. Do not think I would want to use this for travel unless it was in purse and placed upright.</li>
            <li> After I got a free sample online my wife started to love this smelly stuff....I think it&#x27;s ok, but if she likes it so do I!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found a scent I could stand wearing in a very long time. When I got a sample of this, I found I enjoyed wearing it. It was very subtle. I was a bit afraid to go for a large bottle because in the past I found the full size versions are stronger than the samples. So I bought this mini size to give it a try. The scent is the same and I do like it very much. The bottle, however, is not what is pictured here and it doesn&#x27;t have a spray. The only way to use it is to remove the top and splash it on myself. I find this inconvenient and I&#x27;m even more annoyed by the product I received because it seems like a bait and switch. I&#x27;d buy a big bottle but not here, because I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d get.</li>
            <li> I personally don&#x27;t think it smells good at all . It smelled much different in the magazine. Not impressed at all.</li>
            <li> Fresh smell my husband loves this on me</li>
            <li> Absolutely obsessed with this perfume! Was an accident how I came across it , smelling it in one of those samples they put in a magazine at my mom&#x27;s house and I just fell in love with it. Very sophisticated smell, def not a young teenie bopper smell.</li>
            <li> great product.. I hope I get some for Christmas..</li>
            <li> I rarely wear perfume, but a sample in a magazine caught my attention. I was really drawn to it. I put the sample away for a few days and brought it out periodically over the next 2 weeks to see if this was something I really wanted. It was!  Best pricing I found was on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This scent was not what I was expecting in a really good way!! It was subtle and sexy and I am impressed at how Estee Lauder&lt;br /&gt;continues to build on the former foundations of success with they&#x27;re new inventions of fragrance...Wonderful!!  And congratulations&lt;br /&gt;to the folks behind the scenes formulating some really exquisite scents.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is absolutely irresistible!! Grown and sexy....</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need alot to have it go a long way.  Whenever I wear it to the office, I have people asking me what I&#x27;m wearing because my office smells so nice!</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance.  It&#x27;s so fresh and flowery.  It&#x27;s like a breath of fresh air.</li>
            <li> everything she makes its golden,makes you feel such a lady wearing her fragrance you feel free like its you and the world!</li>
            <li> Smells amazing very subtle</li>
            <li> My daughter asked for this lperfume last year for Christmas.  It came in a very small bottle.  But she loves it so much she asked for a large bottle this year!  It&#x27;s a wonderful, soft fragrance.</li>
            <li> It did got here on time but I dont know for sure if this on is .24 oz or not</li>
            <li> Very small bottle but I like the product.</li>
