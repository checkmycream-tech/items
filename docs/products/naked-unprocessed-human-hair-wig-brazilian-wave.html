            <li>Overall for the price i received at not too many complaints, I haven&#x27;t done anything to it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for almost 3 months now, and it looks like it will last for many more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The wig was pretty</li>
            <li>probably what you would expect for the price, might be better if you add extra tracks to it</li>
            <li>br /&gt;It looked very wiggy when I first got it, but I cut the \\&quot;scalp\\&quot; out and turned it into a u-part wig</li>
            <li>Hair much shorter than 16&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>Hair is very skimpy</li>

            <li>Its very itchy and I wont be wearing that without a soft wig cap</li>
            <li>instead N plan to add a few extension to it to have a more fuller look N length..</li>
            <li>It looks very natural doesn&#x27;t tangle ,</li>

            <li>but I lightened it to medium blonde and it has just barely held up.  </li>

            <li> but I lightened it to medium blonde and it has just barely held up.  </li>
            <li> Grey hairs in hair AND not as thick and full as picture.</li>
            <li> I dyed it black and it looks very natural on me.</li>
            <li> Like i said, I&#x27;ve read other customers complaining about the pic that the seller displayed here, I totally agree with them being different to my expectation.....</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant when I was told that it was the last one, but it was cheaper</li>

            <li> But it was not true to length.</li>
            <li> everyday look&lt;br</li>

            <li> There is also very little shedding</li>
            <li> N was planning on exchanging it for the 20 inch length but based on a few negative reviews I&#x27;ve read about returning this product with difficulties</li>
            <li> However, my complaint is about the thinness of it</li>
            <li> The hair was too thin and did notlike the color.</li>
            <li> What a disappointment; the hair on this wig is so skimpy, thin and limp all around the wig; the layering on this wig was unnecessary so it affects the way the wig hang</li>
            <li> HIGHLY disappointing</li>
            <li> but the way the hair is cut makes this awkward.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t give this a 5 star ratings because I was a bit disappointed with the length</li>
            <li> Very disappointed 😡</li>

            <li> Love it. Look natural</li>
            <li> Ok! I&#x27;ve bought the 16 inches in this wig but seemed like a 10 inch N wasn&#x27;t 2 plz or happy about it at all anyway I&#x27;m gonna be truthful N honest here about this product.. I definitely love the texture of it. Its soft, flexible N falls nicely Doesn&#x27;t seemed to tangled so far.. Got it 3 days ago before the original delivery time.. Gave it a thumb up for that.. 👍.. So far I haven&#x27;t experienced any shedding of hair from it N I believed its 100% human hair.. However, my complaint is about the thinness of it N was planning on exchanging it for the 20 inch length but based on a few negative reviews I&#x27;ve read about returning this product with difficulties, I&#x27;ve just changed my mind in keeping it instead N plan to add a few extension to it to have a more fuller look N length.. Couldn&#x27;t give this a 5 star ratings because I was a bit disappointed with the length N thinness of it.. Like i said, I&#x27;ve read other customers complaining about the pic that the seller displayed here, I totally agree with them being different to my expectation..... But with that, its a good wig.....</li>
            <li> The hair is extremely soft but the length isn&#x27;t what I thought it would be. Overall for the price i received at not too many complaints, I haven&#x27;t done anything to it yet so we&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> Hair much shorter than 16&#x27;.  Hair is very skimpy especially the bang and shedding already on day 1.  One star for color and one for texture and I over rated it!!!! Very disappointed 😡</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product !!! It looks very natural doesn&#x27;t tangle , and it&#x27;s very easy to maintain.  I received the product very quickly and I feel it was money well spent!!!</li>
            <li> I wash it one time  as the directions told me to and it was never the same and it tangles a lot i would not recommend this product but the shipping was really fast.</li>
            <li> Wig did not look like the picture at all. I had a hard time trying to style it.&lt;br /&gt;Had good texture and feels soft. But, not what the picture portrayed.</li>
            <li> I ordered this same wig from another seller, and it was good also. I bought this one from Beauty shoppers, and it came to me very fast and it was what I expected. I was a little hesitant when I was told that it was the last one, but it was cheaper so I took a chance, but it was just as they other two were. Happy with it.</li>
            <li> The hair is soft and the quality is there. There is also very little shedding but this must be the scantiest head of hair I have seen on a wig till now. I had to add some tracks from a weave just to cover the scalp sufficiently. The length is ok but this can hardly be said to be a full 16 inches all round. I also cant say very much for the quality of the cap. Its very itchy and I wont be wearing that without a soft wig cap ever.&lt;br /&gt;I almost returned it because It seemed to be less than expected but I kept it because I decided to use the fixes I mentioned above.&lt;br /&gt;Altogether acceptable for the lower price</li>
            <li> This is not 16 inches. It is 12 inches. If the length is a big deal for you don&#x27;t buy this wig</li>
            <li> It was shorter than expected for a 16 inch, but i love the hair and i am very happy with my purchase. Money well spent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marie</li>
            <li> Great quality! I use it for work to cover up my mowhawk. I dyed it black and it looks very natural on me.</li>
            <li> The hair was too thin and did notlike the color.</li>
            <li> This is a very, very, very good quality wig.  If you like wigs that look natural and not wiggy this is the wig for you.  I dyed mine a deep burgundy similiar to a J99 color.  Looks great.  No shedding so far and very soft.  It holds curls very well and the lenght is perfect.  I just ordered another one in a 18&amp;#34; just to have one slightly longer and I plan to color that one Honey Blonde.  Check out my Pinterest board for pictures. (leslie bethune)</li>
            <li> very soft and natural looking, will definetly buy again. just what i was looking for. thank you :)</li>
            <li> Brazilian hair wig. The human hair wig was full and beautiful! Natural to my hair at one time! Loved it! Will recommend it to friends and family.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m happy with this wig and I&#x27;m planning to buy it many more times in the future! I&#x27;ve had it for almost 3 months now, and it looks like it will last for many more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Very natural looking&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful wavy texture&lt;br /&gt;Holds a curl fairly well&lt;br /&gt;Great everyday look&lt;br /&gt;Minimal tangling&lt;br /&gt;Barely any shedding&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not as full as it is in the picture&lt;br /&gt;It looked very wiggy when I first got it, but I cut the \\&quot;scalp\\&quot; out and turned it into a u-part wig</li>
            <li> What a disappointment; the hair on this wig is so skimpy, thin and limp all around the wig; the layering on this wig was unnecessary so it affects the way the wig hang/lay; I will never order it again; I can&#x27;t believe its Brazilian Hunan hair.</li>
            <li> Length is not at all as stated! Grey hairs in hair AND not as thick and full as picture. HIGHLY disappointing</li>
            <li> I wear this wig under a hat, I do not wear it without a hat, because it looks like a wig.  there is no parting space, you can see tracks if you do part it. It bubbles up at the top like most wigs do. Since I paid over $100.00 I do get use out of it under hats.</li>
            <li> I would NEVER RECOMMEND this product to anyone. The picture is completely different from what you&#x27;re sent. A shaggy 10\\&quot; wig is what you get. The picture is DECEIVING. The return is hectic and 20% is taken out plus you pay the shipping by UPS, FEDEX, OR DHL. You have to wait for at 21 days or more for their decision on whether you&#x27;ll be refunded or replaced . Your lucky if you get either one! Waste of money and time. Unreliable company!!!!</li>
            <li> The wig was pretty but it was really thing. Took color well and did not shed much. But it was not true to length. Said was a16inch looked more like a 12 inch</li>
            <li> much shorter than it appears in the photo with really strange layers -- most of the hair is chin length at best with one long shaggy layer in back.  some tracks are actually made of super short hair (1 inch) though I don&#x27;t know why.  the texture was good out of the box. it took a lot of work but I lightened it to medium blonde and it has just barely held up.  the closure piece doesn&#x27;t seem to be virgin -- lightened to a different color with lighter roots, as if it had been colored before.  probably what you would expect for the price, might be better if you add extra tracks to it but the way the hair is cut makes this awkward.</li>
            <li> Love this wig.  Soft and lots of body.  Wish the hair on my head was like this wig?</li>
