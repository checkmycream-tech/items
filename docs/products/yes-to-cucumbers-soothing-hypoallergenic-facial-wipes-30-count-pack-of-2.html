            <li>I am very happy with them and glad I found them on sale.  </li>
            <li>These take off make up and have a pleasant scent, however they didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li>Wonderful clean smell!</li>
            <li>They do a fairly good job of removing make-up--foundation and blush, but not eye make-up</li>
            <li>Good quality fabric, doesn&#x27;t leave fibers all over your face like the cheaper ones.  </li>

            <li>Smells good too.</li>
            <li>They do a good job at removing just about all of my makeup.  </li>
            <li>This product is perfect for after work to get my make up off and clean my face.</li>
            <li>Maybe this product works best for those who just need a quick wipe of the face and for those who don&#x27;t wear makeup.</li>
            <li>Very refreshing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great, for those who can use it. :)</li>

            <li>To Inc., in stores or on their own website.</li>
            <li>Honestly its a 4.5.</li>
            <li>Kind of greasy.</li>
            <li>They contain no alcohol and are effective.</li>
            <li>Like this okay, good for when traveling, in a pinch.  </li>
            <li>The wipes smell nice and don&#x27;t cause any breakouts on my skin.</li>
            <li>It removes very well and is made with very good ingredients!</li>
            <li>They make your face feel clean and are great when washing your face isn&#x27;t an option.</li>
            <li>These are a great way to quickly clean and freshen your face.</li>
            <li>These are great for a quick cleaning, or removing makeup.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is light and pleasant.. not overpowering at all.  </li>
            <li>These work great and have a pleasant, light fresh scent.</li>
            <li>Mild and yet very effective.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re by far the best!</li>
            <li>A fresh scent, and attractive packaging.</li>
            <li>Not in a refreshing Noxema kind of way....</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, which is why I thought these &amp;#34;soothing cucumber&amp;#34; wipes were going to be perfect.</li>

            <li>Easy to carry anywhere!</li>

            <li>This is a good clean wipe.  </li>
            <li>it feels really good and gets your skin clean.</li>
            <li>Great on hot days, too.</li>
            <li>was delighted to find the full size packets on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;they are super for traveling!!</li>
            <li>These are great, though, I actually prefer the blueberry one because it feels more refreshing, but these cucumber ones are great</li>
            <li>Great product love it soo much!</li>
            <li>They work fabulously and are perfectly refreshing!</li>
            <li>Very good for sensitive skin and still helps any break outs...</li>
            <li>another huge plus, I save money on them using subscribe and save!</li>
            <li>However, it does an excellent job, and cost is not a deal breaker for me personally.</li>
            <li>Its the only one that doesn&#x27;t leave my face oily and smells awesome.</li>
            <li>My sister is allergic to a lot of different beauty products and this product works great for her too!</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I love the Grapefruit wipes, buyer beware on these.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re ok.</li>
            <li>I will for sure keep buying them.</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>so glad that I tried these and now always have some on hand at home and in my travel bag.  </li>
            <li>Ordered them as Christmas gifts for wife and daughters, absolutely love them.  </li>
            <li>I love these wipes.</li>
            <li>These are my favorite wipes</li>
            <li>Love these things.</li>
            <li>I mostly use them before bed to remove makeup.</li>
            <li>we are glad we chose this one</li>
            <li>they are wasteful, but I love these wipes.</li>
            <li>I love that this product is mostly organic ingredients.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s a wipe</li>
            <li>Of all the Facial wipes I have tried this and the Grapefruit are the best.</li>
            <li>I love these wipes.</li>
            <li>Equate is MUCH better.</li>
            <li>I love the Amazon subscribe &amp; save option too...</li>
            <li>This is my favorite face wipe and has been for about five years now.</li>
            <li>Many of the options are too oily, too pricey, or scratchy.</li>
            <li>I love these wipes.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent.  </li>
            <li>The price is substantially better than in the stores too.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love them.</li>

            <li>and I love them.</li>
            <li>I just love these towelettes.</li>
            <li>at removing make up, love the cucumber smell.  </li>
            <li>Cucumber/Coconut wipes much more than that of the Yes to Grapefruit wipes.</li>
            <li>There are too many nights when I get in bed without washing my face, now I have these for those moments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love the super-light yet refreshing fragrance of cucumbers.</li>
            <li>I can see how this could be beneficial to refreshing skin, but as a form of makeup removal?</li>
            <li>It works well to take off make up, but I don&#x27;t love the smell.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed these wipes.  </li>
            <li>This keeps the moisture at the top wipe, so the one you pull out will have the most moisture.</li>
            <li>okay using it on my eye area.  </li>
            <li>Refreshing to use a couple of times a day just because.</li>
            <li>Oil of Olay cleanising cloths (that require you to add water to each cloth) are the better option for makeup removal.</li>
            <li>love it .</li>
            <li>I love these moist towlettes.  </li>
            <li>I love these wipes, I&#x27;ve been using them for years.</li>
            <li>this is probably my favorite product on amazon.</li>
            <li>Love the wipes.</li>
            <li>They smell more chemically.</li>
            <li>Don,t use any thing else on my face love them</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>I love the smell.</li>
            <li>My skin still feels wonderful the next morning.</li>
            <li>As always, Amazon offers them at a good price!</li>
            <li>/&gt;These felt great on my skin, the wipe itself has a very light cucumber scent, and is very soft.  </li>
            <li>NIce face wash, with a clean scent.  </li>
            <li>Removes make up and leaves my skin very clean.</li>
            <li>They also smell very clean.</li>
            <li>The smell warms you up and makes you feel very clean.</li>
            <li>whatever... makes you feel super clean and nice and smell nice too.</li>
            <li>As long as you have a moisturizer to pair with, this product is awesome for removing makeup.</li>
            <li>These face wipes are nice as they do leave the face feeling clean, but there is a strong perfume/fragrance to them (not cucumbers).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is great for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>I was able to clean off the daily grime easily, without experiencing any redness or irritation which is awesome.</li>
            <li>These are a good quick, easy way to clean your face.</li>
            <li>Very soothing and works great for getting my face clean.</li>
            <li>Great for my combination sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Great for my sensitive skin as well.</li>
            <li>I have quite sensitive skin and have been happy with these.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, so I thought this would be great, but it&#x27;s just alright.</li>
            <li>and they do a good job and hold up very well even with semi-scrubbing.</li>
            <li>They smell so good, and I really feel they remove a lot of impurities from my face.  </li>
            <li>The smell is nice and right before bed</li>
            <li>texture of the wipes is smooth and very pleasant to the touch, and they do smell fantastic, but the last thing I want is to smell like a cucumber but look like a tomato.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>yes, they can irritate a LITTLE bit SOMETIMES but for the most part they are wonderful!</li>
            <li>Try the other ones too, they&#x27;re all great!</li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t easily wash your face.</li>
            <li>The did ok at getting my face clean</li>
            <li>(the wipes are in a pouch, easy to pack and won’t spill), or if you are in a hurry after a workout, etc.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy</li>
            <li>She loves using them, they are easy and hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li>So refreshing and quickly clean my face.</li>
            <li>I love to have that clean, washed feeling however.</li>
            <li>I love the cucumber scent and the way it leaves my skin feeling clean.</li>
            <li>and I feel much better, clean, etc.</li>
            <li>They smell wonderful and are gentle on my skin - as well as my three year old&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li>I love having these pads to clean my face at night so that I do not have to use water to wash my face.</li>
            <li>Rather strong &amp;#34;cucumber&amp;#34; scent.</li>
            <li>The cloths are strong and substantial.  </li>
            <li>Bright red, hot, burning and honest to God, swollen even!</li>
            <li>Works very well and is very refreshing.</li>
            <li>Nice fresh &amp; clean smell.</li>
            <li>cool and refreshing wipes fit the bill and have been a godsend.</li>
            <li>It tingled a bit, which I decided was fine....</li>
            <li>what will make some people have reactions is just fine for others.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is mild and refreshing.</li>
            <li>Super refreshing to use; it&#x27;s summer now</li>
            <li>For the most part, pretty good product, if I wipe my whole face with a sheet, I can feel it after, like a residue.</li>
            <li>I absolutely freaking love these!</li>
            <li>The Yes to Cucumber face wipes are a quick and easy way to clean your face and have a refreshing cucumber scent.</li>
            <li>I made the mistake of getting free Proactiv two years ago even though my face was fine.</li>
            <li>product and very much regret it!!</li>
            <li>I love face wipes for removing makeup, but these make the skin around my eyes burn and my cheeks turn bright red.  </li>
            <li>I find that they work great for that, though I tend to only wear a light application when I do wear makeup.  </li>
            <li>The plastic cover snaps shut and keeps the towelettes from drying out, which is great since I only use maybe five of these a week</li>
            <li>so I thought these would be great especially after seeing a beauty guru I follow on youtube rave about them.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of cucumber, and the towelletes really do smell wonderful (fresh and energizing), but overall this product just didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Whoever designed how they are folded into the package should be struck soundly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll look for another brand that is cruelty free.</li>
            <li>I got these wipes on sale and haven&#x27;t used the entire package, but they work great with my skin (combination).  </li>
            <li>great facial wipes to remove make up.  </li>
            <li>I store any kind of wipe package this way and it really helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cleans thoroughly, moisturizes effectively but gently.</li>
            <li>However, I did see this buy 1 get 1 free at Ulta at a cheaper price.</li>
            <li>i really enjoy these wipes.</li>
            <li>Great to have when you&#x27;re on the go (especially at the gym).</li>
            <li>fantastic product- must have if you travel.</li>
            <li>These are fantastic.</li>
            <li>These are just fantastic for your face.  </li>
            <li>The cucumber might not be great for sensitive skin, however I love the smell and they really remove makeup and cleanse.</li>
            <li>They take make up off easily and are also a great way to make your face feel refreshed after a long day.</li>
            <li>I love using these wipes before I run, I just leave the pack right on my treadmill and boom</li>
            <li>The YESto line is very nice - especially with the cleansers.  </li>
            <li>They are moist enough to do a good job and feel cool and refreshing.</li>
            <li>With such high reviews and promises on the package of being calming and hypoallergenic, I thought these would be awesome.</li>
            <li>super easy</li>
            <li>These are very gentle on your skin, that is my favorite part about them.  </li>
            <li>so fresh and clean feeling and smelling!</li>
            <li>Easy on my children&#x27;s skin and more than anything, will really leave your skin feeling refreshed and revived.</li>
            <li>I love to use these first and then use my Purity and then put on moisturizer</li>
            <li>I love these soo much!</li>
            <li>But these are also great for freshening up while camping, after the gym, long road trips, traveling, etc.</li>
            <li>I got these for when I was travelling because I was concerned about not having sufficient facilities to clean my face.</li>
            <li>Burts bees and many others and this product is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>The towelettes leave my face feeling clean and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>They clean well</li>
            <li>They are effective and I like how they smell, but I only use them when I don&#x27;t have anything else, and I won&#x27;t buy more.</li>
            <li>Just clean skin.</li>
            <li>They leave your face feeling clean without residue.</li>
            <li>I have avoided face cleansing wipes for years because they never seem to get my face completely clean and they always seem to leave some sort of soapy residue that I have to wash off</li>
            <li>Leaves your face feeling clean and tightens up your pores.</li>
            <li>I want my face to feel clean, not covered with something else.</li>
            <li>They just make my face feel clean when I don&#x27;t have access to running water and face wash</li>
            <li>My skin always feels so refreshed &amp; clean after using these.  </li>
            <li>I keep them on my nightstand and use one every night before taking my contacts out to remove all my makeup and clean my hands before removing my contacts.  </li>
            <li>great for dry, oily, or acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>These are very nice - high quality towelettes and they really make my skin feel fresh.  </li>
            <li>Always use these-they&#x27;re not super strong if you&#x27;re using them for makeup remover towelettes but they&#x27;re great for a post-gym face wipe.</li>
            <li>They come out of the pouch moist and cool and are soothing on the skin.</li>
            <li>They did a good job of removing makeup, in my opinion, but I ended up with red, burning, irritated skin.</li>
            <li>, quick way to clean your face which helps prevent breakouts.</li>
            <li>I wear full coverage face makeup</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t because it doesn&#x27;t feel true.</li>
            <li>These work well for my combination skin, leaving it soft and nicely balanced, with no sticky residue as some wipes can.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They leave my face feeling cool and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>also: a really pleasant scent that doesn&#x27;t overwhelm of even linger for long.</li>
            <li>To wipes, I really liked my Grapefruit and on more than one occasion they doubled as hand or desk wipes (I&#x27;m a student, some people are pretty gross on campus).</li>
            <li>and I can imagine that some eyeliners are harder to remove than others, but mine is also pretty &amp;#34;stay put&amp;#34; and this does a very good job of cleaning up my face, even when I have more make up on than usual... and skin also feels good.</li>
            <li>My skin feels fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>These wipes leave you feeling soo fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>They also work well if you just want your face to feel fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>This product was fine the first couple of times I used it, but then it started to burn.</li>
            <li>I would suggest sticking with baby wipes to be honest - removes make up and nice on your skin without being harsh.</li>
            <li>It goes away quickly.</li>
            <li>Luckily I did a test on my wrist before wiping my face, felt a tingling sensation</li>
            <li>looks super</li>
            <li>It did not burn my eyes, but I wear contacts and I am used to many different eye drops, touching my eyes, etc</li>
            <li>While they are quite moist, I do like to wet them with a bit of additional water from the sink to make them most effective</li>
            <li>They are quick and disposable.</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of the YesTo product line and these facial towelettes are an easy fuss free way to keep my skin fresh and clean!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them and haven&#x27;t found anything else I like better.  </li>
            <li>i would highly recommend, this is my favorite product of all yes to products.</li>
            <li>Here in the heat of the desert they are a true breath of fresh air</li>
            <li>Plus, less than $10 for two packs is a great price.</li>
            <li>Really cool and refreshing on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>To products before, most of them I like well enough, I&#x27;ve never hated any until now.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve been using them for several years &amp; am so glad!</li>
            <li>Scent is nice and light and they don&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t dry my skin or cause breakouts, which is the most important!</li>
            <li>but my face doesn&#x27;t feel as clean as it did with my first order.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, it makes my skin feel refreshed, although it sometimes burns a little after using these wipes, may just be the material it is made out of</li>
            <li>I can use these everyday, and they keep my skin looking great.</li>
            <li>WOW,  I  am glad to read</li>
            <li>Leaves your face feeling tingling fresh.</li>
            <li>The wipes are soothing, don&#x27;t hurt my eyes even if I kind of scrub my eyelashes, and they have been so helpful with relieving allergy symptoms after I come in from outside.</li>
            <li>, don&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin, remove makeup and allow me to go without moisturizer most of the time.</li>
            <li>The towelettes are nice and big.</li>
            <li>I love these wipes for my face, I was being cheap and decided to try the store brand facial wipes.</li>
            <li>I started using more natural products after learning about chemicals like phthalates that are put in beauty products.  </li>
            <li>The scent only seems to be on the wipe and does not linger on skin, which is nice.</li>
            <li>I love how soft they are</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a facial wipe that cleanses better, consider Blum Naturals Exfoliating wipe, which has little beads that help clean -- and it also has a great orange scent.</li>
            <li>These smell very fresh and clean, and the towelettes themselves are very soft and soothing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually not incredibly picky about beauty products like this, because I&#x27;m really lucky to have perfect skin even into my 30s.</li>
            <li>I just wanted a sensitive wipe for quick and easy skincare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use these right after the gym to wipe my face, chest and arms.</li>
            <li>generally use generic brands or Ponds make-up wipes and have always had a great experience.  </li>
            <li>Being a huge fan of the YES TO products, I was super excited to try out their Cucumber Facial Towelettes.</li>
            <li>These are great facial wipes -- but can be used for more than just the face; I sometimes use several as a quick clean-up when there isn&#x27;t enough time to shower.</li>
            <li>Made my face turn bright red and burn, and my skin isnt usually sensitive.</li>
            <li>It is quick and cleans my oily skin very well.</li>
            <li>Overall a great product, will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li>I have been using Yes facewipes for about three months now, and not only is it cheap, but it is fantastic.</li>
            <li>good smell, don&#x27;t sting, don&#x27;t dry my skin out, no icky chemicals.</li>
            <li>but this has not bothered me very much in that respect.  </li>
            <li>I read the glowing reviews and wanted to like it very very much.</li>
            <li>normally just wash my face with hot water and a clean washcloth before going to bed, but started using these instead.  </li>
            <li>It gets my makeup off easily and leaves my skin feeling fresh and not dry.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lot better than the wipe/towelette packages that only have a sticky flap to press over the opening (these have the sticky flap, too, but also the plastic door).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>She is stubborn and still is trying to use them but has to rinse them underwater first to get some of the stuff out.</li>
            <li>ugh) it was a hot day</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try grapefruit next, since I love the convenience of the towelettes.</li>
            <li>I think they will be okay for in the morning when I wake up and need to remove oil from my face but definitely not for taking off makeup.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite of the 3 facial cloths I&#x27;ve tried (</li>
            <li>the only ones I like better are the MAC wipes - but - considering the price difference this one has become a staple in my house.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried pretty much all the general ones that most stores carry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
            <li>I keep some in my desk at work, some in my car, and this summer will be keeping some in the fridge for hot days.</li>
            <li>Also, whenever I use them, if feels refreshing for a split second, then my face BURNS for about 3 minutes afterwards.</li>
            <li>I remember to wipe the gross make-up off before I start my run &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>First it burned while I used it.</li>
            <li>I love these facial towelettes.</li>
            <li>My sister and I run out pretty regularly, so I&#x27;m pretty intrigued by this amazon \\&quot;subscribe and save\\&quot; deal.</li>
            <li>These wipes are highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>I love having these next to my bed.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I love these towelettes for freshening up during the day and especially at the beach/pool.</li>
            <li>Love these, I will definitely continue to buy them!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I need after a workout or flight.</li>
            <li>Hydrating, cleansing, and refreshing in between facial washings!</li>
            <li>(however I&#x27;ve done this with most facial wipes I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li>You really don&#x27;t need water!</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t completely remove eye makeup (but that is not my primary need for these)</li>
            <li>To products for a few years now and have loved them, so I wanted to try these out for myself and see how they were.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is good enough to get the makeup off my face but gentle and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>They easily remove foundation and grime, but take a little more to remove waterproof maskara and eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my face feeling clean without leaving residue like many other wipes.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin; the wipes do not dry out my cheeks, but they definitely clean my oily forehead and nose!</li>
            <li>It was ok the first couple of wipes, feels nice but no different from other wipes.</li>
            <li>The price is right, and I really like the product.</li>
            <li>And the scent is soft &amp; fresh!</li>
            <li>We absolutely love these wipes – they are great for everything: feeling sick and sweaty, getting rid of malicious orders, just cleaning your face at night and having the nice spa scent of a cucumber facial.</li>
            <li>I have such a hard time finding this product in the store, it&#x27;s so great that I could order it online when I need it!</li>
            <li>They are convenient and clean your face, but DO NOT use them near your eyes.</li>
            <li>The wipes remove my make up easily and do not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>makes me skin feel soft and clean.</li>
            <li>It not only cleans but does not clog pores and it keeps my skin looking great with no breakouts or other issues.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve tried pretty much every brand of wipe out there.</li>
            <li>first started using these wipes because I was looking for something gentle.</li>
            <li>Not exactly my favorite product, so choose wisely.</li>
            <li>My skin looks better, my face definitely feels better, and I didn&#x27;t get any of the burn described by some other reviewers (though I have used tea tree oil before, so perhaps I knew</li>
            <li>I have acne-prone, combination skin that is more oily in the summer and a bit dry in the winter.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m particularly lucky or if it&#x27;s just that my skin isn&#x27;t that sensitive after all.</li>
            <li>It took the makeup off easily (foundation only) but it burned and irritated my skin.</li>
            <li>It is plenty large for removing all of my makeup.  </li>
            <li>The cucumber is fine for the amount of makeup I have to take off; I follow with various toners or acids on cotton balls and very rarely do I get any extra makeup off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice much of a smell when I use these, either.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just wish they didn&#x27;t put quite so much fragrance.</li>
            <li>This is definitely not an alcohol free or moisturizing</li>
            <li>Got these for free as part of a promotion on  jet blue-</li>
            <li>I have combination sensitive skin, and I did not experience that, for what it’s worth.</li>
            <li>Very refreshing!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really thought these would be a soothing cleansing wipe</li>
            <li>Gentle to the skin.</li>
            <li>I really like that the packs are resealable</li>
            <li>and I thought these would be gentle.</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t really like the way they smell or the way my skin feels after I use them.</li>
            <li>I really like to smell</li>
            <li>/&gt;Second, they don&#x27;t remove make-up very well, so expect to look like a rabid raccoon after trying to get your mascara off with these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think much of it until I used them too.</li>
            <li>I have tried the cucumber, grapefruit and tomato versions, and all have been acceptable, though the tomato &amp; grapefruit version are MUCH \\&quot;wetter\\&quot; than these.</li>
            <li>It sounds petty, but these cloths aren&#x27;t cheap and I only NEED one at a time.</li>
            <li>Very good.tton boll on the lid.</li>
            <li>Also, it doesn&#x27;t really cleanse well.  </li>
            <li>and they made his face sting and burn after only one light use.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my face really refreshed.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear much makeup, but I do use these wipes for removal from time to time, and I don&#x27;t have a problem with it at all.  </li>
            <li>And I wake up with a very oily face</li>
            <li>Also it does take off makeup really well despite the review that says the contrary.</li>
            <li>I bought this specifically for makeup removal, I had to use soap and water every time to really get the makeup off.</li>
            <li>The cucumber is very soothing.  </li>
            <li>My whole face stung and my eyes burned like fire.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed the texture of the wipe, it isn&#x27;t rough like some of them, so I felt</li>
            <li>Then I apply Burt&#x27;s Bees Intense Hydration cream.</li>
            <li>Removes make up really well.</li>
            <li>I ended up using the whole pack</li>
            <li>reasonably well&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>you can really FEEL the difference.</li>
            <li>I needed a gentle product that doesn&#x27;t strip my face of oils since I am on accutane for acne.  </li>
            <li>This product is absolutely evil.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>These towelettes work very well.</li>
            <li>least it smells good?</li>
            <li>I highly recommend to anyone who just wants a quick clean or someone with really dry skin.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like these, as they are designed for sensitive skin, not tested on animals and priced right.</li>
            <li>They have just the right amount of moisture to cleanly wipe the day&#x27;s grime off your face without dripping or being too dry.  </li>
            <li>I thought it was pretty ironic that these are some of the only beauty products I own that actually irritate my skin, as they are supposedly for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin, and I am always hesistant to try new things on it.</li>
            <li>and it has made me more reluctant to try some of their other products.</li>
            <li>I like it better than any of the other commerical wipes out there - including Neutrogena, Aveeno and Garnier...</li>
            <li>I like many of the other products from this brand</li>
            <li>Lastly, they leave my skin feeling sticky/clammy, not at all clean.  </li>
            <li>These facial towelettes leave a residue on my hands and face after I use it that makes it feel not as clean as I would like.</li>
            <li>It was my first time trying this product, and I gave it an Okay rating because it felt a bit harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li>i use them on the occasional night at home when i don&#x27;t feel like doing the full night-time skin care routine &amp; they work like a charm.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re pretty sensitive</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>It was definitely a great deal, but I&#x27;ve gone back to other facial towelettes.</li>
            <li>Part of my typical night-time skin care routine includes using an astringent/toner, which I do after removing make-up with these wipes, and that always results in more make-up removal.</li>
            <li>Decent customer service when they apologized and offered to send a voucher to get something else that worked for me.</li>
            <li>overall, I think these are OK for travelling, for example, when you don’t want to lug along a separate facial cleanser</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought these in-store multiple times and love them - they&#x27;re great for when you&#x27;re up too early or going to bed too tired to want to actually wash your face.</li>
            <li>I have tried many but these are the only facial cleaning wipes I like.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s just going to be different for everyone (like most facial products).</li>
            <li>My skin goes red and gets super irritated</li>
            <li>I find the wipes to be particularly helpful for removing makeup at the end of the day without drying out my face.  </li>
            <li>I particularly like how these have a plastic lid to help retain the moisture in the pack.</li>
            <li>but the rating was high and i use yes to tomatoes moisturizer with no problem</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend AAAA</li>
            <li>immediately there was an intolerable burning, the kind i only felt one other time while using Clinique</li>
            <li>The other scents in this line might be a better bet if you have really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are gentle on the skin and dry quickly without leading to drying or cracking.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin - the only way I don&#x27;t break out is by using these wipes to clean my face, and the Na-PCA moisturizer.</li>
            <li>then i gently used the wipes to clear the excess makeup</li>
            <li>It did sting the first few times I used it, but after about 7 days or so, it stopped stinging and a I saw a huge improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, so this was a real shocker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and am very cautious with what I use on my face.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t bother me much, as I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and I bought this product because it specifically says it is for sensitive skins and is non-irritating, and gentle.</li>
            <li>yes to blueberries day cream and serum for a few months now and LOVE them</li>
            <li>skin looks better after using for a few weeks.</li>
            <li>For you references, this wipes are for normal skin, you will feel a burning sensation if you don&#x27;t have a normal skin.</li>
            <li>I just used them and then looked at myself in the mirror to see distinct red marks all over my face, accompanied by a burning sensation.</li>
            <li>Trying to find the perfect makeup remover towels can be a long and expensive process.  </li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of different brands of facial wipes, and these are by far my favorite ones.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The extra couple of dollars is worth it, trust me.</li>
            <li>have fairly normal skin.  </li>
            <li>I really like how gentle these cloths are and they don&#x27;t leave my face sticky or shiny like other wipes, just soft and clean.</li>
            <li>They smell nice and are so soft, they aren&#x27;t abrasive like some other similar wipes.</li>
            <li>Also, they work well at removing eye makeup without a huge struggle like I&#x27;ve found with other brands.</li>
            <li>IF they come out with a new formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I swiped my skin with a wipe from a brand new package and immediately I felt like my face was on fire.  </li>
            <li>My mom tried to use them after i gave up on the pack and didnt want to throw away a huge pack with only 5 wipes used and the same thing happened to her.</li>
            <li>Have been using these for years - between exfoliating regularly and using these at night, my skin has been clean and balanced as this does not dry skin out.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Very surprised for a &amp;#34;hypoallergenic &amp;#34; product.</li>
            <li>I do have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>so my skin is very sensitive.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and have combination skin problems.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>They feel sudsier than usual ( normally not), they don&#x27;t smell the same, and most importantly they have turned my face red and mildly irritated.</li>
            <li>I received these as part of my birchbox subscription and they were the first thing i actually wanted to</li>
            <li>My only reason they don&#x27;t get a solid 5 is if I use them for multiple days in a row (more than 6)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried wipes from about a dozen different brands, including some other &amp;#34;Yes To&amp;#34; ones (which I did not like at all, mostly because of the scent).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure they actually remove all my make-up, but I love the smell!</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to rinse unlike many other facial towelettes</li>
            <li>However, these towelettes have been fine to use around my eyes -- usually quite gentle, in fact.  </li>
            <li>My face feels clean when using it not sticky like other face wipes can leave it.</li>
            <li>I read reviews of various towelettes on EWG&#x27;s Cosmetics Database and was surprised to see that other brands I&#x27;d been using contained ingredients that were not considered safe.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not very good about washing my face (I know, shame on me) mostly because I haven&#x27;t had a problem with acne or break outs.  </li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and even when I use towelettes for sensitive skin, it still stings.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also way more red AFTER I used these, and it hardly works on my eye makeup (and I don&#x27;t wear much!)</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m trying to figure out what ingredient or ingredient combination in these is causing my severe reaction because I plan to stay far, far away from it!</li>
            <li>YesTo has become my go-to brand for certain personal care items.  </li>
            <li>I have never had a reaction to face wipes before, and I have used many different brands from the natural burts bees wipes to the less natural Neutrogena.</li>
            <li>Smells fantastic, but burns a little after I wipe my face with it.</li>
            <li>They remove most of my make-up but need a little extra help for my waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li>/&gt;BTW, the other brand that works super well and doesn&#x27;t inflame the flaky/red patches is the Burt&#x27;s Bees sensitive formula, the one in the all-white package with a cotton boll on the lid.</li>
            <li>do feel refreshing and does not leave my skin dry or oily after using, but the wave of burning/stinging sensation every time I use it means I will be seeking other makeup remover wipes.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if it were a little more natural and didn&#x27;t have all the fake cucumber scent.</li>
            <li>This has helped my skin stay clear.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my skin clear.  </li>
            <li>They have helped clear up my face.</li>
            <li>have somewhat sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I applied my lush makeup remover</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used about 5 so far and so far, no.  </li>
            <li>I have no clue how this cucumber line can be marketed to sensitive skin</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t even have sensitive skin and these just hurt.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Do not put anywhere near your eye area.</li>
            <li>It literally burned my skin, I have fairly sensitive skin, but &amp;#34;soothing cucumber&amp;#34; didn&#x27;t set off any alarms for me in the store.</li>
            <li>Also, because these wipes are so soft, they do not exfoliate.</li>
            <li>I too do not have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have used it for years because I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I think Yes to Carrots have another line for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>5 minutes after using them, my skin would get very irritated, red and itchy.</li>
            <li>They remove stubborn eye makeup completely without stinging or burning.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I would think that if this product is meant for sensitive skin, that it shouldn&#x27;t burn.</li>
            <li>also have dryish, sensitive skin and have had no problems with these.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, maybe be cautious.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think that I have sensitive skin, but these make my face burn...</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive, acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>No phthalates with the Yes to brand!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I doubt they are as natural as they claim to be.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>So far not a fan of the Yes</li>
            <li>My 14 year old acne averse daughter swears by the yes to line.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin but no problems using these.</li>
            <li>Not an overpowering smell which is good because I don&#x27;t like random smells.</li>
            <li>They are also a nice big size towelette which are also thick and soft.</li>
            <li>so I put them in the fridge for a cool wipe down after the gym.</li>
            <li>Not only do these calm those, they don&#x27;t create them and they smell much nicer than other face wipes.</li>
            <li>Leaves no yucky residue behind, unlike other towelettes I&#x27;ve used, and the scent is nice and fresh smelling.</li>
            <li>They are so gentle that they can be used pretty much anywhere on the body, and I do mean anywhere.</li>
            <li>I break out if I try to clean my face everyday.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even have sensitive skin, just normal with the occasional hormonal area breakouts...</li>
            <li>I have had very sensitive skin and have had a hard time finding wipes that I would enjoy.</li>
            <li>I do not know if the new ingredients are better or worse for you</li>
            <li>I typically use them in conjunction with another facial cleanser, but use these primarily when I wear makeup.  </li>
            <li>I stopped using them and my skin has gone back to normal.</li>
            <li>My skin is back to normal now.</li>
            <li>They are gentile enough to use to get off mascara and versatile enough to be used on the whole face.  </li>
            <li>I only use them at night, and in the winter my face gets pretty cold after using them, but other than that they are great.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually actually have very sensitive skin, but these wipes burn my face when I use them.</li>
            <li>and they are the only product I&#x27;ve ever used that doesn&#x27;t make my sensitive skin break out!</li>
            <li>After using them only 3 nights in a row, I noticed my skin was extreamly soft and just looked healthier!</li>
            <li>They smell wonderful, they&#x27;re damp enough to not cause a lot of friction, they take off my mineral foundation and any residue left under my eyes from removing my eye makeup, the material itself is sturdy and thick and doesn&#x27;t leave any fibers behind.  </li>
            <li>But the &amp;#34;Yes To Cucumber&amp;#34; towelettes received high ratings, so now this is one of the only facial towelettes I will be using from now on.</li>
            <li>Any towelettes that are for sensitive skin don&#x27;t clean enough and I feel greasy a few hours later.</li>
            <li>To brand in general.</li>
            <li>Especially if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>DEFINITELY don&#x27;t recommend for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>According to Environmental Working Group&#x27;s Skin Deep website they are low in hazardous and unhealthy ingredients&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>I get in my car and the first thing I do is pop one out to give my face a wipe down.</li>
            <li>,it got super red and itchy and it dried out my face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m one of those people who aren&#x27;t tired right up to actually falling asleep, so this cleanse is right on my nightstand.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you have normal, combo, or dry skin</li>
            <li>I thought at first maybe I was just allergic but other reviewers are saying the same...</li>
            <li>They are very big and you only need one for complete makeup removal.</li>
            <li>My skin does not dry out</li>
            <li>and I really like these for a quick cleaning when I&#x27;m too tired to wash my face properly.</li>
            <li>They are large wipes too so you can afford to rub your face and even venture down to jaw line, neck,</li>
            <li>These are not wet enough to take off all your makeup.</li>
            <li>so the whole package lasts for a month and a half.  </li>
            <li>Any towelettes that aren&#x27;t for sensitive skin dry me out.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, dry skin</li>
            <li>I got these for myself because I have sensitive skin to a point that, if I&#x27;m not wearing sun screen and I&#x27;m outside too long</li>
            <li>they will continue to show up at my door on a regular basis so I have no excuse!</li>
            <li>These are quality and less expensive than the equivalently good alternatives.</li>
            <li>other thing I really like is the size -- if you need to rub a little bit to get all your eye makeup off, you can constantly move to a fresh area of the towelette, or switch to the other side (the sides are equivalent in terms of texture), so you can actually get the makeup off instead of moving it around.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll get a rash or if I use certain cleansers with harsh chemicals and what not I also get a rash sort thing that burns.</li>

            <li> This is the latest product I tried in my seemingly never-ending search for the perfect makeup remover.  </li>

            <li> I am very happy with them and glad I found them on sale.  </li>
            <li> These take off make up and have a pleasant scent, however they didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li> Wonderful clean smell!</li>
            <li> They do a fairly good job of removing make-up--foundation and blush, but not eye make-up</li>
            <li> Good quality fabric, doesn&#x27;t leave fibers all over your face like the cheaper ones.  </li>
            <li> I used the Yes to Blueberries towelettes and loved them. . .</li>

            <li> Smells good too.</li>
            <li> They do a good job at removing just about all of my makeup.  </li>
            <li> This product is perfect for after work to get my make up off and clean my face.</li>
            <li> Maybe this product works best for those who just need a quick wipe of the face and for those who don&#x27;t wear makeup.</li>
            <li> Very refreshing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great, for those who can use it. :)</li>
            <li> very satisfied with the product</li>

            <li> and I thought it felt very refreshing.  </li>
            <li> I am very happy about that and the fresh scent and efficiency to remove my make up, including mascara.</li>
            <li> Very refreshing and cleansing.</li>

            <li> My favorite!</li>
            <li> and I hadn&#x27;t been thrilled with those because they made my eyes water a bit.  </li>
            <li> Nice when you&#x27;re on the go.</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable and these are excellent in removing foundation and all makeup.  </li>
            <li> I have rosacea and have been trying to find a nice wipe that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> To Inc., in stores or on their own website.</li>
            <li> Honestly its a 4.5.</li>
            <li> Kind of greasy.</li>
            <li> They contain no alcohol and are effective.</li>
            <li> Like this okay, good for when traveling, in a pinch.  </li>
            <li> The wipes smell nice and don&#x27;t cause any breakouts on my skin.</li>
            <li> It removes very well and is made with very good ingredients!</li>
            <li> They make your face feel clean and are great when washing your face isn&#x27;t an option.</li>
            <li> These are a great way to quickly clean and freshen your face.</li>
            <li> These are great for a quick cleaning, or removing makeup.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is light and pleasant.. not overpowering at all.  </li>
            <li> These work great and have a pleasant, light fresh scent.</li>
            <li> Mild and yet very effective.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re by far the best!</li>
            <li> A fresh scent, and attractive packaging.</li>
            <li> Not in a refreshing Noxema kind of way....</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, which is why I thought these &amp;#34;soothing cucumber&amp;#34; wipes were going to be perfect.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Easy to carry anywhere!</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;ve been doing an exceptional job; they&#x27;re also pretty good at removing lip stains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yes is so refreshing and clean!!</li>
            <li> This is a good clean wipe.  </li>
            <li> it feels really good and gets your skin clean.</li>
            <li> Great on hot days, too.</li>
            <li> was delighted to find the full size packets on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;they are super for traveling!!</li>
            <li> These are great, though, I actually prefer the blueberry one because it feels more refreshing, but these cucumber ones are great</li>
            <li> Great product love it soo much!</li>
            <li> They work fabulously and are perfectly refreshing!</li>
            <li> Very good for sensitive skin and still helps any break outs...</li>
            <li> another huge plus, I save money on them using subscribe and save!</li>
            <li> However, it does an excellent job, and cost is not a deal breaker for me personally.</li>
            <li> Its the only one that doesn&#x27;t leave my face oily and smells awesome.</li>
            <li> My sister is allergic to a lot of different beauty products and this product works great for her too!</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I love the Grapefruit wipes, buyer beware on these.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re ok.</li>
            <li> I will for sure keep buying them.</li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> so glad that I tried these and now always have some on hand at home and in my travel bag.  </li>
            <li> Ordered them as Christmas gifts for wife and daughters, absolutely love them.  </li>
            <li> I love these wipes.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite wipes</li>
            <li> Love these things.</li>
            <li> I mostly use them before bed to remove makeup.</li>
            <li> we are glad we chose this one</li>
            <li> they are wasteful, but I love these wipes.</li>
            <li> I love that this product is mostly organic ingredients.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s a wipe</li>
            <li> Of all the Facial wipes I have tried this and the Grapefruit are the best.</li>
            <li> I love these wipes.</li>
            <li> Equate is MUCH better.</li>
            <li> I love the Amazon subscribe &amp; save option too...</li>
            <li> This is my favorite face wipe and has been for about five years now.</li>
            <li> Many of the options are too oily, too pricey, or scratchy.</li>
            <li> I love these wipes.  </li>
            <li> I love the scent.  </li>
            <li> The price is substantially better than in the stores too.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> I love these.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love them.</li>
            <li> It does remove MOST of the cosmetics and dirt from my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a package of these just about everywhere important!  </li>
            <li> I love the packaging, I love the ease of use, I love the scent, I love how well it works to remove oil</li>
            <li> and I love them.</li>
            <li> I just love these towelettes.</li>
            <li> at removing make up, love the cucumber smell.  </li>
            <li> Cucumber/Coconut wipes much more than that of the Yes to Grapefruit wipes.</li>
            <li> There are too many nights when I get in bed without washing my face, now I have these for those moments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Love the super-light yet refreshing fragrance of cucumbers.</li>
            <li> I can see how this could be beneficial to refreshing skin, but as a form of makeup removal?</li>
            <li> It works well to take off make up, but I don&#x27;t love the smell.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed these wipes.  </li>
            <li> This keeps the moisture at the top wipe, so the one you pull out will have the most moisture.</li>
            <li> okay using it on my eye area.  </li>
            <li> Refreshing to use a couple of times a day just because.</li>
            <li> Oil of Olay cleanising cloths (that require you to add water to each cloth) are the better option for makeup removal.</li>
            <li> love it .</li>
            <li> I love these moist towlettes.  </li>
            <li> I love these wipes, I&#x27;ve been using them for years.</li>
            <li> this is probably my favorite product on amazon.</li>
            <li> Love the wipes.</li>
            <li> They smell more chemically.</li>
            <li> Don,t use any thing else on my face love them</li>
            <li> I love these.</li>
            <li> I love the smell.</li>
            <li> My skin still feels wonderful the next morning.</li>
            <li> As always, Amazon offers them at a good price!</li>
            <li> /&gt;These felt great on my skin, the wipe itself has a very light cucumber scent, and is very soft.  </li>
            <li> NIce face wash, with a clean scent.  </li>
            <li> Removes make up and leaves my skin very clean.</li>
            <li> They also smell very clean.</li>
            <li> The smell warms you up and makes you feel very clean.</li>
            <li> whatever... makes you feel super clean and nice and smell nice too.</li>
            <li> As long as you have a moisturizer to pair with, this product is awesome for removing makeup.</li>
            <li> These face wipes are nice as they do leave the face feeling clean, but there is a strong perfume/fragrance to them (not cucumbers).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is great for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I was able to clean off the daily grime easily, without experiencing any redness or irritation which is awesome.</li>
            <li> These are a good quick, easy way to clean your face.</li>
            <li> Very soothing and works great for getting my face clean.</li>
            <li> Great for my combination sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Great for my sensitive skin as well.</li>
            <li> I have quite sensitive skin and have been happy with these.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, so I thought this would be great, but it&#x27;s just alright.</li>
            <li> and they do a good job and hold up very well even with semi-scrubbing.</li>
            <li> They smell so good, and I really feel they remove a lot of impurities from my face.  </li>
            <li> The smell is nice and right before bed</li>
            <li> texture of the wipes is smooth and very pleasant to the touch, and they do smell fantastic, but the last thing I want is to smell like a cucumber but look like a tomato.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> yes, they can irritate a LITTLE bit SOMETIMES but for the most part they are wonderful!</li>
            <li> Try the other ones too, they&#x27;re all great!</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t easily wash your face.</li>
            <li> The did ok at getting my face clean</li>
            <li> (the wipes are in a pouch, easy to pack and won’t spill), or if you are in a hurry after a workout, etc.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy</li>
            <li> She loves using them, they are easy and hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li> So refreshing and quickly clean my face.</li>
            <li> I love to have that clean, washed feeling however.</li>
            <li> I love the cucumber scent and the way it leaves my skin feeling clean.</li>
            <li> and I feel much better, clean, etc.</li>
            <li> They smell wonderful and are gentle on my skin - as well as my three year old&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> I love having these pads to clean my face at night so that I do not have to use water to wash my face.</li>
            <li> Rather strong &amp;#34;cucumber&amp;#34; scent.</li>
            <li> The cloths are strong and substantial.  </li>
            <li> Bright red, hot, burning and honest to God, swollen even!</li>
            <li> Works very well and is very refreshing.</li>
            <li> Nice fresh &amp; clean smell.</li>
            <li> cool and refreshing wipes fit the bill and have been a godsend.</li>
            <li> It tingled a bit, which I decided was fine....</li>
            <li> what will make some people have reactions is just fine for others.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent is mild and refreshing.</li>
            <li> Super refreshing to use; it&#x27;s summer now</li>
            <li> For the most part, pretty good product, if I wipe my whole face with a sheet, I can feel it after, like a residue.</li>
            <li> I absolutely freaking love these!</li>
            <li> The Yes to Cucumber face wipes are a quick and easy way to clean your face and have a refreshing cucumber scent.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of getting free Proactiv two years ago even though my face was fine.</li>
            <li> product and very much regret it!!</li>
            <li> I love face wipes for removing makeup, but these make the skin around my eyes burn and my cheeks turn bright red.  </li>
            <li> I find that they work great for that, though I tend to only wear a light application when I do wear makeup.  </li>
            <li> The plastic cover snaps shut and keeps the towelettes from drying out, which is great since I only use maybe five of these a week</li>
            <li> so I thought these would be great especially after seeing a beauty guru I follow on youtube rave about them.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of cucumber, and the towelletes really do smell wonderful (fresh and energizing), but overall this product just didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Whoever designed how they are folded into the package should be struck soundly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll look for another brand that is cruelty free.</li>
            <li> I got these wipes on sale and haven&#x27;t used the entire package, but they work great with my skin (combination).  </li>
            <li> great facial wipes to remove make up.  </li>
            <li> I store any kind of wipe package this way and it really helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cleans thoroughly, moisturizes effectively but gently.</li>
            <li> However, I did see this buy 1 get 1 free at Ulta at a cheaper price.</li>
            <li> i really enjoy these wipes.</li>
            <li> Great to have when you&#x27;re on the go (especially at the gym).</li>
            <li> fantastic product- must have if you travel.</li>
            <li> These are fantastic.</li>
            <li> These are just fantastic for your face.  </li>
            <li> The cucumber might not be great for sensitive skin, however I love the smell and they really remove makeup and cleanse.</li>
            <li> They take make up off easily and are also a great way to make your face feel refreshed after a long day.</li>
            <li> I love using these wipes before I run, I just leave the pack right on my treadmill and boom</li>
            <li> The YESto line is very nice - especially with the cleansers.  </li>
            <li> They are moist enough to do a good job and feel cool and refreshing.</li>
            <li> With such high reviews and promises on the package of being calming and hypoallergenic, I thought these would be awesome.</li>
            <li> super easy</li>
            <li> These are very gentle on your skin, that is my favorite part about them.  </li>
            <li> so fresh and clean feeling and smelling!</li>
            <li> Easy on my children&#x27;s skin and more than anything, will really leave your skin feeling refreshed and revived.</li>
            <li> I love to use these first and then use my Purity and then put on moisturizer</li>
            <li> I love these soo much!</li>
            <li> But these are also great for freshening up while camping, after the gym, long road trips, traveling, etc.</li>
            <li> I got these for when I was travelling because I was concerned about not having sufficient facilities to clean my face.</li>
            <li> Burts bees and many others and this product is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> The towelettes leave my face feeling clean and refreshed.  </li>
            <li> They clean well</li>
            <li> They are effective and I like how they smell, but I only use them when I don&#x27;t have anything else, and I won&#x27;t buy more.</li>
            <li> Just clean skin.</li>
            <li> They leave your face feeling clean without residue.</li>
            <li> I have avoided face cleansing wipes for years because they never seem to get my face completely clean and they always seem to leave some sort of soapy residue that I have to wash off</li>
            <li> Leaves your face feeling clean and tightens up your pores.</li>
            <li> I want my face to feel clean, not covered with something else.</li>
            <li> They just make my face feel clean when I don&#x27;t have access to running water and face wash</li>
            <li> My skin always feels so refreshed &amp; clean after using these.  </li>
            <li> I keep them on my nightstand and use one every night before taking my contacts out to remove all my makeup and clean my hands before removing my contacts.  </li>
            <li> great for dry, oily, or acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> These are very nice - high quality towelettes and they really make my skin feel fresh.  </li>
            <li> Always use these-they&#x27;re not super strong if you&#x27;re using them for makeup remover towelettes but they&#x27;re great for a post-gym face wipe.</li>
            <li> They come out of the pouch moist and cool and are soothing on the skin.</li>
            <li> They did a good job of removing makeup, in my opinion, but I ended up with red, burning, irritated skin.</li>
            <li> , quick way to clean your face which helps prevent breakouts.</li>
            <li> I wear full coverage face makeup</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t because it doesn&#x27;t feel true.</li>
            <li> These work well for my combination skin, leaving it soft and nicely balanced, with no sticky residue as some wipes can.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They leave my face feeling cool and refreshed.  </li>
            <li> also: a really pleasant scent that doesn&#x27;t overwhelm of even linger for long.</li>
            <li> To wipes, I really liked my Grapefruit and on more than one occasion they doubled as hand or desk wipes (I&#x27;m a student, some people are pretty gross on campus).</li>
            <li> and I can imagine that some eyeliners are harder to remove than others, but mine is also pretty &amp;#34;stay put&amp;#34; and this does a very good job of cleaning up my face, even when I have more make up on than usual... and skin also feels good.</li>
            <li> My skin feels fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> These wipes leave you feeling soo fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> They also work well if you just want your face to feel fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> This product was fine the first couple of times I used it, but then it started to burn.</li>
            <li> I would suggest sticking with baby wipes to be honest - removes make up and nice on your skin without being harsh.</li>
            <li> It goes away quickly.</li>
            <li> Luckily I did a test on my wrist before wiping my face, felt a tingling sensation</li>
            <li> looks super</li>
            <li> It did not burn my eyes, but I wear contacts and I am used to many different eye drops, touching my eyes, etc</li>
            <li> While they are quite moist, I do like to wet them with a bit of additional water from the sink to make them most effective</li>
            <li> They are quick and disposable.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of the YesTo product line and these facial towelettes are an easy fuss free way to keep my skin fresh and clean!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them and haven&#x27;t found anything else I like better.  </li>
            <li> i would highly recommend, this is my favorite product of all yes to products.</li>
            <li> Here in the heat of the desert they are a true breath of fresh air</li>
            <li> Plus, less than $10 for two packs is a great price.</li>
            <li> Really cool and refreshing on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> To products before, most of them I like well enough, I&#x27;ve never hated any until now.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using them for several years &amp; am so glad!</li>
            <li> Scent is nice and light and they don&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry my skin or cause breakouts, which is the most important!</li>
            <li> but my face doesn&#x27;t feel as clean as it did with my first order.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, it makes my skin feel refreshed, although it sometimes burns a little after using these wipes, may just be the material it is made out of</li>
            <li> I can use these everyday, and they keep my skin looking great.</li>
            <li> WOW,  I  am glad to read</li>
            <li> Leaves your face feeling tingling fresh.</li>
            <li> The wipes are soothing, don&#x27;t hurt my eyes even if I kind of scrub my eyelashes, and they have been so helpful with relieving allergy symptoms after I come in from outside.</li>
            <li> , don&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin, remove makeup and allow me to go without moisturizer most of the time.</li>
            <li> The towelettes are nice and big.</li>
            <li> I love these wipes for my face, I was being cheap and decided to try the store brand facial wipes.</li>
            <li> I started using more natural products after learning about chemicals like phthalates that are put in beauty products.  </li>
            <li> The scent only seems to be on the wipe and does not linger on skin, which is nice.</li>
            <li> I love how soft they are</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a facial wipe that cleanses better, consider Blum Naturals Exfoliating wipe, which has little beads that help clean -- and it also has a great orange scent.</li>
            <li> These smell very fresh and clean, and the towelettes themselves are very soft and soothing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually not incredibly picky about beauty products like this, because I&#x27;m really lucky to have perfect skin even into my 30s.</li>
            <li> I just wanted a sensitive wipe for quick and easy skincare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use these right after the gym to wipe my face, chest and arms.</li>
            <li> generally use generic brands or Ponds make-up wipes and have always had a great experience.  </li>
            <li> Being a huge fan of the YES TO products, I was super excited to try out their Cucumber Facial Towelettes.</li>
            <li> These are great facial wipes -- but can be used for more than just the face; I sometimes use several as a quick clean-up when there isn&#x27;t enough time to shower.</li>
            <li> Made my face turn bright red and burn, and my skin isnt usually sensitive.</li>
            <li> It is quick and cleans my oily skin very well.</li>
            <li> Overall a great product, will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> I have been using Yes facewipes for about three months now, and not only is it cheap, but it is fantastic.</li>
            <li> good smell, don&#x27;t sting, don&#x27;t dry my skin out, no icky chemicals.</li>
            <li> but this has not bothered me very much in that respect.  </li>
            <li> I read the glowing reviews and wanted to like it very very much.</li>
            <li> normally just wash my face with hot water and a clean washcloth before going to bed, but started using these instead.  </li>
            <li> It gets my makeup off easily and leaves my skin feeling fresh and not dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot better than the wipe/towelette packages that only have a sticky flap to press over the opening (these have the sticky flap, too, but also the plastic door).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> She is stubborn and still is trying to use them but has to rinse them underwater first to get some of the stuff out.</li>
            <li> ugh) it was a hot day</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try grapefruit next, since I love the convenience of the towelettes.</li>
            <li> I think they will be okay for in the morning when I wake up and need to remove oil from my face but definitely not for taking off makeup.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite of the 3 facial cloths I&#x27;ve tried (</li>
            <li> the only ones I like better are the MAC wipes - but - considering the price difference this one has become a staple in my house.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried pretty much all the general ones that most stores carry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
            <li> I keep some in my desk at work, some in my car, and this summer will be keeping some in the fridge for hot days.</li>
            <li> Also, whenever I use them, if feels refreshing for a split second, then my face BURNS for about 3 minutes afterwards.</li>
            <li> I remember to wipe the gross make-up off before I start my run &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> First it burned while I used it.</li>
            <li> I love these facial towelettes.</li>
            <li> My sister and I run out pretty regularly, so I&#x27;m pretty intrigued by this amazon \\&quot;subscribe and save\\&quot; deal.</li>
            <li> These wipes are highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> I love having these next to my bed.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I love these towelettes for freshening up during the day and especially at the beach/pool.</li>
            <li> Love these, I will definitely continue to buy them!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I need after a workout or flight.</li>
            <li> Hydrating, cleansing, and refreshing in between facial washings!</li>
            <li> (however I&#x27;ve done this with most facial wipes I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> You really don&#x27;t need water!</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t completely remove eye makeup (but that is not my primary need for these)</li>
            <li> To products for a few years now and have loved them, so I wanted to try these out for myself and see how they were.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is good enough to get the makeup off my face but gentle and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> They easily remove foundation and grime, but take a little more to remove waterproof maskara and eyeliner.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling clean without leaving residue like many other wipes.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin; the wipes do not dry out my cheeks, but they definitely clean my oily forehead and nose!</li>
            <li> It was ok the first couple of wipes, feels nice but no different from other wipes.</li>
            <li> The price is right, and I really like the product.</li>
            <li> And the scent is soft &amp; fresh!</li>
            <li> We absolutely love these wipes – they are great for everything: feeling sick and sweaty, getting rid of malicious orders, just cleaning your face at night and having the nice spa scent of a cucumber facial.</li>
            <li> I have such a hard time finding this product in the store, it&#x27;s so great that I could order it online when I need it!</li>
            <li> They are convenient and clean your face, but DO NOT use them near your eyes.</li>
            <li> The wipes remove my make up easily and do not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> makes me skin feel soft and clean.</li>
            <li> It not only cleans but does not clog pores and it keeps my skin looking great with no breakouts or other issues.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve tried pretty much every brand of wipe out there.</li>
            <li> first started using these wipes because I was looking for something gentle.</li>
            <li> Not exactly my favorite product, so choose wisely.</li>
            <li> My skin looks better, my face definitely feels better, and I didn&#x27;t get any of the burn described by some other reviewers (though I have used tea tree oil before, so perhaps I knew</li>
            <li> I have acne-prone, combination skin that is more oily in the summer and a bit dry in the winter.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m particularly lucky or if it&#x27;s just that my skin isn&#x27;t that sensitive after all.</li>
            <li> It took the makeup off easily (foundation only) but it burned and irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> It is plenty large for removing all of my makeup.  </li>
            <li> The cucumber is fine for the amount of makeup I have to take off; I follow with various toners or acids on cotton balls and very rarely do I get any extra makeup off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice much of a smell when I use these, either.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just wish they didn&#x27;t put quite so much fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is definitely not an alcohol free or moisturizing</li>
            <li> Got these for free as part of a promotion on  jet blue-</li>
            <li> I have combination sensitive skin, and I did not experience that, for what it’s worth.</li>
            <li> Very refreshing!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really thought these would be a soothing cleansing wipe</li>
            <li> Gentle to the skin.</li>
            <li> I really like that the packs are resealable</li>
            <li> and I thought these would be gentle.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t really like the way they smell or the way my skin feels after I use them.</li>
            <li> I really like to smell</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second, they don&#x27;t remove make-up very well, so expect to look like a rabid raccoon after trying to get your mascara off with these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think much of it until I used them too.</li>
            <li> I have tried the cucumber, grapefruit and tomato versions, and all have been acceptable, though the tomato &amp; grapefruit version are MUCH \\&quot;wetter\\&quot; than these.</li>
            <li> It sounds petty, but these cloths aren&#x27;t cheap and I only NEED one at a time.</li>
            <li> Very good.tton boll on the lid.</li>
            <li> Also, it doesn&#x27;t really cleanse well.  </li>
            <li> and they made his face sting and burn after only one light use.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my face really refreshed.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear much makeup, but I do use these wipes for removal from time to time, and I don&#x27;t have a problem with it at all.  </li>
            <li> And I wake up with a very oily face</li>
            <li> Also it does take off makeup really well despite the review that says the contrary.</li>
            <li> I bought this specifically for makeup removal, I had to use soap and water every time to really get the makeup off.</li>
            <li> The cucumber is very soothing.  </li>
            <li> My whole face stung and my eyes burned like fire.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed the texture of the wipe, it isn&#x27;t rough like some of them, so I felt</li>
            <li> Then I apply Burt&#x27;s Bees Intense Hydration cream.</li>
            <li> Removes make up really well.</li>
            <li> I ended up using the whole pack</li>
            <li> reasonably well&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> you can really FEEL the difference.</li>
            <li> I needed a gentle product that doesn&#x27;t strip my face of oils since I am on accutane for acne.  </li>
            <li> This product is absolutely evil.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> These towelettes work very well.</li>
            <li> least it smells good?</li>
            <li> I highly recommend to anyone who just wants a quick clean or someone with really dry skin.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like these, as they are designed for sensitive skin, not tested on animals and priced right.</li>
            <li> They have just the right amount of moisture to cleanly wipe the day&#x27;s grime off your face without dripping or being too dry.  </li>
            <li> I thought it was pretty ironic that these are some of the only beauty products I own that actually irritate my skin, as they are supposedly for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin, and I am always hesistant to try new things on it.</li>
            <li> and it has made me more reluctant to try some of their other products.</li>
            <li> I like it better than any of the other commerical wipes out there - including Neutrogena, Aveeno and Garnier...</li>
            <li> I like many of the other products from this brand</li>
            <li> Lastly, they leave my skin feeling sticky/clammy, not at all clean.  </li>
            <li> These facial towelettes leave a residue on my hands and face after I use it that makes it feel not as clean as I would like.</li>
            <li> It was my first time trying this product, and I gave it an Okay rating because it felt a bit harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li> i use them on the occasional night at home when i don&#x27;t feel like doing the full night-time skin care routine &amp; they work like a charm.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re pretty sensitive</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> It was definitely a great deal, but I&#x27;ve gone back to other facial towelettes.</li>
            <li> Part of my typical night-time skin care routine includes using an astringent/toner, which I do after removing make-up with these wipes, and that always results in more make-up removal.</li>
            <li> Decent customer service when they apologized and offered to send a voucher to get something else that worked for me.</li>
            <li> overall, I think these are OK for travelling, for example, when you don’t want to lug along a separate facial cleanser</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought these in-store multiple times and love them - they&#x27;re great for when you&#x27;re up too early or going to bed too tired to want to actually wash your face.</li>
            <li> I have tried many but these are the only facial cleaning wipes I like.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s just going to be different for everyone (like most facial products).</li>
            <li> My skin goes red and gets super irritated</li>
            <li> I find the wipes to be particularly helpful for removing makeup at the end of the day without drying out my face.  </li>
            <li> I particularly like how these have a plastic lid to help retain the moisture in the pack.</li>
            <li> but the rating was high and i use yes to tomatoes moisturizer with no problem</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend AAAA</li>
            <li> immediately there was an intolerable burning, the kind i only felt one other time while using Clinique</li>
            <li> The other scents in this line might be a better bet if you have really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are gentle on the skin and dry quickly without leading to drying or cracking.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin - the only way I don&#x27;t break out is by using these wipes to clean my face, and the Na-PCA moisturizer.</li>
            <li> then i gently used the wipes to clear the excess makeup</li>
            <li> It did sting the first few times I used it, but after about 7 days or so, it stopped stinging and a I saw a huge improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, so this was a real shocker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and am very cautious with what I use on my face.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t bother me much, as I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and I bought this product because it specifically says it is for sensitive skins and is non-irritating, and gentle.</li>
            <li> yes to blueberries day cream and serum for a few months now and LOVE them</li>
            <li> skin looks better after using for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> For you references, this wipes are for normal skin, you will feel a burning sensation if you don&#x27;t have a normal skin.</li>
            <li> I just used them and then looked at myself in the mirror to see distinct red marks all over my face, accompanied by a burning sensation.</li>
            <li> Trying to find the perfect makeup remover towels can be a long and expensive process.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of different brands of facial wipes, and these are by far my favorite ones.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The extra couple of dollars is worth it, trust me.</li>
            <li> have fairly normal skin.  </li>
            <li> I really like how gentle these cloths are and they don&#x27;t leave my face sticky or shiny like other wipes, just soft and clean.</li>
            <li> They smell nice and are so soft, they aren&#x27;t abrasive like some other similar wipes.</li>
            <li> Also, they work well at removing eye makeup without a huge struggle like I&#x27;ve found with other brands.</li>
            <li> IF they come out with a new formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I swiped my skin with a wipe from a brand new package and immediately I felt like my face was on fire.  </li>
            <li> My mom tried to use them after i gave up on the pack and didnt want to throw away a huge pack with only 5 wipes used and the same thing happened to her.</li>
            <li> Have been using these for years - between exfoliating regularly and using these at night, my skin has been clean and balanced as this does not dry skin out.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Very surprised for a &amp;#34;hypoallergenic &amp;#34; product.</li>
            <li> I do have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> so my skin is very sensitive.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have combination skin problems.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> They feel sudsier than usual ( normally not), they don&#x27;t smell the same, and most importantly they have turned my face red and mildly irritated.</li>
            <li> I received these as part of my birchbox subscription and they were the first thing i actually wanted to</li>
            <li> My only reason they don&#x27;t get a solid 5 is if I use them for multiple days in a row (more than 6)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried wipes from about a dozen different brands, including some other &amp;#34;Yes To&amp;#34; ones (which I did not like at all, mostly because of the scent).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure they actually remove all my make-up, but I love the smell!</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to rinse unlike many other facial towelettes</li>
            <li> However, these towelettes have been fine to use around my eyes -- usually quite gentle, in fact.  </li>
            <li> My face feels clean when using it not sticky like other face wipes can leave it.</li>
            <li> I read reviews of various towelettes on EWG&#x27;s Cosmetics Database and was surprised to see that other brands I&#x27;d been using contained ingredients that were not considered safe.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very good about washing my face (I know, shame on me) mostly because I haven&#x27;t had a problem with acne or break outs.  </li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and even when I use towelettes for sensitive skin, it still stings.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also way more red AFTER I used these, and it hardly works on my eye makeup (and I don&#x27;t wear much!)</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m trying to figure out what ingredient or ingredient combination in these is causing my severe reaction because I plan to stay far, far away from it!</li>
            <li> YesTo has become my go-to brand for certain personal care items.  </li>
            <li> I have never had a reaction to face wipes before, and I have used many different brands from the natural burts bees wipes to the less natural Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic, but burns a little after I wipe my face with it.</li>
            <li> They remove most of my make-up but need a little extra help for my waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li> /&gt;BTW, the other brand that works super well and doesn&#x27;t inflame the flaky/red patches is the Burt&#x27;s Bees sensitive formula, the one in the all-white package with a cotton boll on the lid.</li>
            <li> do feel refreshing and does not leave my skin dry or oily after using, but the wave of burning/stinging sensation every time I use it means I will be seeking other makeup remover wipes.</li>
            <li> It would be nice if it were a little more natural and didn&#x27;t have all the fake cucumber scent.</li>
            <li> This has helped my skin stay clear.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my skin clear.  </li>
            <li> They have helped clear up my face.</li>
            <li> have somewhat sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I applied my lush makeup remover</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used about 5 so far and so far, no.  </li>
            <li> I have no clue how this cucumber line can be marketed to sensitive skin</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t even have sensitive skin and these just hurt.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Do not put anywhere near your eye area.</li>
            <li> It literally burned my skin, I have fairly sensitive skin, but &amp;#34;soothing cucumber&amp;#34; didn&#x27;t set off any alarms for me in the store.</li>
            <li> Also, because these wipes are so soft, they do not exfoliate.</li>
            <li> I too do not have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have used it for years because I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I think Yes to Carrots have another line for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> 5 minutes after using them, my skin would get very irritated, red and itchy.</li>
            <li> They remove stubborn eye makeup completely without stinging or burning.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I would think that if this product is meant for sensitive skin, that it shouldn&#x27;t burn.</li>
            <li> also have dryish, sensitive skin and have had no problems with these.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, maybe be cautious.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that I have sensitive skin, but these make my face burn...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive, acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> No phthalates with the Yes to brand!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I doubt they are as natural as they claim to be.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> So far not a fan of the Yes</li>
            <li> My 14 year old acne averse daughter swears by the yes to line.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin but no problems using these.</li>
            <li> Not an overpowering smell which is good because I don&#x27;t like random smells.</li>
            <li> They are also a nice big size towelette which are also thick and soft.</li>
            <li> so I put them in the fridge for a cool wipe down after the gym.</li>
            <li> Not only do these calm those, they don&#x27;t create them and they smell much nicer than other face wipes.</li>
            <li> Leaves no yucky residue behind, unlike other towelettes I&#x27;ve used, and the scent is nice and fresh smelling.</li>
            <li> They are so gentle that they can be used pretty much anywhere on the body, and I do mean anywhere.</li>
            <li> I break out if I try to clean my face everyday.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have sensitive skin, just normal with the occasional hormonal area breakouts...</li>
            <li> I have had very sensitive skin and have had a hard time finding wipes that I would enjoy.</li>
            <li> I do not know if the new ingredients are better or worse for you</li>
            <li> I typically use them in conjunction with another facial cleanser, but use these primarily when I wear makeup.  </li>
            <li> I stopped using them and my skin has gone back to normal.</li>
            <li> My skin is back to normal now.</li>
            <li> They are gentile enough to use to get off mascara and versatile enough to be used on the whole face.  </li>
            <li> I only use them at night, and in the winter my face gets pretty cold after using them, but other than that they are great.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually actually have very sensitive skin, but these wipes burn my face when I use them.</li>
            <li> and they are the only product I&#x27;ve ever used that doesn&#x27;t make my sensitive skin break out!</li>
            <li> After using them only 3 nights in a row, I noticed my skin was extreamly soft and just looked healthier!</li>
            <li> They smell wonderful, they&#x27;re damp enough to not cause a lot of friction, they take off my mineral foundation and any residue left under my eyes from removing my eye makeup, the material itself is sturdy and thick and doesn&#x27;t leave any fibers behind.  </li>
            <li> But the &amp;#34;Yes To Cucumber&amp;#34; towelettes received high ratings, so now this is one of the only facial towelettes I will be using from now on.</li>
            <li> Any towelettes that are for sensitive skin don&#x27;t clean enough and I feel greasy a few hours later.</li>
            <li> To brand in general.</li>
            <li> Especially if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> DEFINITELY don&#x27;t recommend for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> According to Environmental Working Group&#x27;s Skin Deep website they are low in hazardous and unhealthy ingredients&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> I get in my car and the first thing I do is pop one out to give my face a wipe down.</li>
            <li> ,it got super red and itchy and it dried out my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those people who aren&#x27;t tired right up to actually falling asleep, so this cleanse is right on my nightstand.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have normal, combo, or dry skin</li>
            <li> I thought at first maybe I was just allergic but other reviewers are saying the same...</li>
            <li> They are very big and you only need one for complete makeup removal.</li>
            <li> My skin does not dry out</li>
            <li> and I really like these for a quick cleaning when I&#x27;m too tired to wash my face properly.</li>
            <li> They are large wipes too so you can afford to rub your face and even venture down to jaw line, neck,</li>
            <li> These are not wet enough to take off all your makeup.</li>
            <li> so the whole package lasts for a month and a half.  </li>
            <li> Any towelettes that aren&#x27;t for sensitive skin dry me out.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, dry skin</li>
            <li> I got these for myself because I have sensitive skin to a point that, if I&#x27;m not wearing sun screen and I&#x27;m outside too long</li>
            <li> they will continue to show up at my door on a regular basis so I have no excuse!</li>
            <li> These are quality and less expensive than the equivalently good alternatives.</li>
            <li> other thing I really like is the size -- if you need to rub a little bit to get all your eye makeup off, you can constantly move to a fresh area of the towelette, or switch to the other side (the sides are equivalent in terms of texture), so you can actually get the makeup off instead of moving it around.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll get a rash or if I use certain cleansers with harsh chemicals and what not I also get a rash sort thing that burns.</li>
            <li> They are one of the only facial cleansing wipes seem to actually leave my face clean without irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> other than this, I can recommend them as having worked well for those who are sensitive and don&#x27;t need to take off a ton of face</li>
            <li> I have not had the stinging/irritation problem that other reviewers mention, though I do have fairly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m left reaching gingerly into the package, feeling around for the seam and lifting while gently shaking while also holding the rest down with my other hand, OR shoving the extra one or two that come out back into the package in a damp wad.</li>
            <li> They were moist and soft and stayed that way down to the last wipe.  </li>
            <li> Well, I am pretty much as sucker for all Yes to Cucumber products.  </li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I have been buying these towelettes regularly for a long time now.</li>
            <li> He borders on oily skin, though not sensitive, but these definitely didn&#x27;t work for him.</li>
            <li> so I am not very sensitive to things like that.  </li>
            <li> It takes awhile to get all my mascara off, but that is really typical being that I smother my lashes pretty heavily.  </li>
            <li> If you want the UPC or other mystery #&#x27;s from the back of this pkg, if you&#x27;ve had similar probe, msg me thru amazon here</li>
            <li> Then it left a film on my skin unlike any other facial towelettes I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear a ton of makeup; generally just eyeliner, mascara, and lip balm, with BB cream if I&#x27;m goin&#x27; out and want a little extra.</li>
            <li> I usually like the Yes to lines and had high hopes but this did strange things to my skin.</li>
            <li> My face gets warm but doesn&#x27;t burn too bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m partial to wipes and towelettes because of the convenience -- both remover product and applicator in one (no running out of cotton balls or cotton pads at a different time than the remover product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I found that it was too harsh for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll just take the time to wet a washcloth and use a drop of my Shea Moisture Shampoo or John Masters Organics Zinc &amp; Sage Shampoo with Conditioner or Mineral Fusions shampoo or Boscia Facial Cleanser.</li>
            <li> That goes a long way in my book.</li>
            <li> I looked like I been out in the sun way too long.</li>
            <li> this product would be nice, except the odor make me sick.</li>
            <li> Well, the package and name couldn&#x27;t be more wrong!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so used to other products and having to SCRUB SCRUB away at my face for it to actually work.  </li>
            <li> and I finally figured out that I was getting infections in the eye due to this product.</li>
            <li> Other reviews have mentioned a burning sensation but I definitely don&#x27;t get that.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use any other brand of facial wipes!  </li>
            <li> I look in the mirror and it looked like I had either sat out in the sun all day long or consumed an insane amount of alcohol (Asian glow, lol).  </li>
            <li> I get the occasional zit or dry patch but other than that I never have skin issues.  </li>
            <li> You couldn&#x27;t see bumps or anything, but the texture was very strange.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry skin out.</li>
            <li> so they don&#x27;t dry out.</li>
            <li> the smell and that my skin isn&#x27;t dry after use.</li>
            <li> they make my skin slightly  dry, and irritated.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t use a lot of products because they either dry out my skin</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think my skin is getting dry or anything like that</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and found that these don&#x27;t irritate or cause my skin to dry out.  </li>
            <li> They seal up well, so they don&#x27;t dry out before they can be used.</li>
            <li> I have combination to dry skin that is acne prone, and I have issues with blackheads on my chin.  </li>
            <li> made my face dry and blotchy</li>
            <li> They also don&#x27;t dry my face like soap</li>
            <li> They remove excess oil, but don&#x27;t dry</li>
            <li> I bought these because I discovered my Grapefruit ones had dried out (with only two left,</li>
            <li> I was rather disappointed because I know many people rave about these wipes and the line in general, but I will be trying something else instead.</li>
            <li> They suck at removing makeup, and they made my face burn every single time after/during use.</li>
            <li> The click open hard cover is sturdy and well designed and definitely lasts through the entire package use.  </li>
            <li> The scent is noticeably different, not fresh and no longer with a cucumber scent.</li>
            <li> also work pretty well if I am too lazy to use my usual face wash</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen a single pimple since!</li>
            <li> These are not good for sensitive skin at all!!</li>
            <li> Oddly, this does not happen with the other varieties, only the cucumber.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> I had no makeup on, had spent all afternoon running about</li>
            <li> I have absolutely no complaints.</li>
            <li> After a couple of weeks I noticed my skin started to become strangely rough.</li>
            <li> I only wash my face with water in the morning as washing twice a day is too harsh for my skin, so these wipes save me at night.</li>
            <li> They are a bit rough on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been curious about the</li>
            <li> These wipes stay moist for at least a couple of months in the packaging, as long as you carefully close the inner tab to seal it shut.</li>
            <li> I thought it might have been because i was mixing the 2 different products that caused the bad reaction which in hindsight makes no sense because lush is 100% organic and yes to cucumbers is suppose to be 95% natural</li>
            <li> I ended up giving them to my daughter in law who later told me that when she bought these in the past, she didn&#x27;t feel like they cleaned her face well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Edited to add: I notice that some other reviewers had problems with itching and burning.</li>
            <li> , I haven&#x27;t tried any other their other scents yet</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s just due to the cucumber.</li>
            <li> Like the other reviewers stated, these burn my face.  </li>
            <li> I do however use these after swatching products on my hands/arms or for spot-cleaning brushes or for other uses</li>
            <li> Some of the other wipes burn your eyes when you&#x27;re taking off your mascara, these don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> But it seems to make my skin a little dry and the&lt;br /&gt;smell</li>
            <li> A little tip for the people who found them too dry:  </li>
            <li> I have uneven skin, sometimes it dry sometimes</li>
            <li> recommend these to anyone with VERY sensitive skin, since I do think that they could be irritating.</li>
            <li> I could use them to remove eyemakeup without irritating my eyes, but I don&#x27;t want to take these anywhere near my eyes!</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was just a bad skin day, but every one makes my face skin (especially around my eyes).</li>
            <li> Not worth the money</li>
            <li> I patted some cold water on my cheeks to calm down the unbearable burning sensation.  </li>
            <li> After the test spot dried, I noticed a very dark and dry outline surrounding the test spot.</li>
            <li> about five seconds after I finished wiping my face and neck down, it was burning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ran</li>
            <li> store the package upside down, with the opening face down.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually like single use products b/c</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really bad at remembering and taking the time to remove my makeup and wash my face every night, but these make it simple and fast.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d previously tried some eye makeup remover pads (circular, in a screw-top canister) from Yes to Cucumbers</li>
            <li> Odd smell.</li>
            <li> but thats typical for me of any towelette</li>
            <li> I get a ton for way less than what I would pay in the store.</li>
            <li> you could even cut them in half and still have plenty of wipe to remove your makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t find the brand I typically use.</li>
            <li> I am partial to wipes because I&#x27;m admittedly lazy about my face.</li>
            <li> but I was afraid it was going to when I first used it.</li>
            <li> to scrub around eyes to get eye makeup off which increases burning to an uncomfortable level&lt;br /&gt;Has a weird texture, almost like a lotion-y instead of wet feel that doesn&#x27;t feel clean to the touch for me</li>
            <li> These wipes make you feel a little tingly</li>
            <li> They can sting a little bit when scrubbing the face</li>
            <li> They irritate a little bit but will go away.</li>
            <li> major gripe I have with these is that it is VERY difficult to grab only one at a time.</li>
            <li> and I had to stop using the product after a few days.</li>
            <li> just dried out).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I use these wipe after running, and when I am too tired to properly wash my face.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not all messy.</li>
            <li> DONT waste your MONEY.</li>
            <li> so I bought a few packets.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use these everyday.</li>
            <li> I use them everyday in addition to a gental cleanser afterward.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I have been using these everyday since February.</li>
            <li> Since I have these on Subscribe and Save with Amazon, I will continue with the 2 month supply that I have now and see how I feel about them in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> you just are too tired to do a the regular cleansing regime.</li>
            <li> But your skin might feel a little stripped, I usually always need a little moisturizer afterward.</li>
            <li> The wipes arnt very wet (in my package at least).</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have that icky tight feeling after using them.  </li>
            <li> My issue is that this was in november and now in april it is way past the 3 weeks it was supossed to take to get here.</li>
            <li> I bought these for the lazy nights where I don&#x27;t wash my make up off and keep them in my nightstand.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what is hypoallergenic about these...</li>
            <li> To start, the packaging is different type of plastic, the pattern looks blurred and copied, the labeling on the package isn&#x27;t the same, and worst of all, the ingredients list is almost completely different.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what the intended purpose was, but they do NOT remove makeup well.</li>
            <li> I came across the sample size of these in a small overstock store.  </li>
            <li> No more &amp;#34;pinkeye!&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I can usually get all my make-up - including eye make-up off with one towelette.</li>
            <li> The burning goes away and there is no redness, but it is just a little irritating.</li>
            <li> Id give a 5 but burns my eyes and sometimes reddens my skin a bit but the least of the YES products.</li>
            <li> I have done Nothing else different, and the weather has not turned cold or windy.</li>
            <li> The product I received was fairly dried out even though the seal hadn&#x27;t been broken.</li>
            <li> It left awful red blotches on  my cheeks.</li>
            <li> After using these one evening before bed my face became seriously inflamed.</li>
            <li> These are so convenient, when you don&#x27;t feeel like washing your face, but at least need to cleanse your skin!  </li>
            <li> Waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> These are thin and didn&#x27;t remove eye makeup.  </li>
            <li> They, however, make my face burn worse than anything else I am every used.</li>
            <li> (I often use when driving home from work or gym - or if I&#x27;m just too tired to wash my face at night.</li>
            <li> The wipes stung my face badly and left me with a horrible, red rash that has STILL not gone away 2 days after use.</li>
            <li> -a little scrubbing is needed if you are wearing a lot of eye makeup, but not too bad.</li>
            <li> I thought I just needed to let my skin get used to it, but in a few days I had a really bad acne breakout.</li>
            <li> is a little artificial!  </li>
            <li> I offered to send the pkg to them so they can see, smell, and use for themselves I am CONVINCED they put the wrong wipes in this</li>
            <li> sorry YES TO,</li>
            <li> Breaks me out without fail.</li>
            <li> Something is seriously wrong with these wipes</li>
            <li> I have tried every expensive product out there trying to fix the problem.</li>
            <li> My skin was flaky and I would randomly break out.</li>
            <li> The only makeup remover/cleansing wipes I&#x27;ve found that don&#x27;t leave a nasty film on my skin afterwards.</li>
            <li> I am especially obsessed with YesTo facial wipes!  </li>
            <li> I use it casually at the office just to freshen up or wake myself up</li>
            <li> It did nothing to take off my eye makeup and was very irritating to my eye area.  </li>
            <li> / when they change the formula, I hope they don&#x27;t add parabens or propylene glycol or any other horrible</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> Also, it stings like crazy.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s sweaty/oily in the summer but dry/wind chapped and cold in the winter. &#x3D;</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they made her break out in a rash!</li>
            <li> Unpleasant smell.</li>
            <li> They work well for removing makeup (although I don&#x27;t wear makeup that is very difficult to remove, so</li>
            <li> They did their job, but made my lips sting really badly.  </li>
            <li> It was so bad that i had to wash my face with ice water.</li>
            <li> Too bad it is an \\&quot;add-on item\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> I had a bad experience with some acne-fighting &#x27;grapefruit&#x27; wipes and I wasn&#x27;t looking for makeup removal (which, it seems, 90% of the face wipes out there</li>
            <li> (sanitizer  dries my skin badly).</li>
            <li> but when I use these my skin just gets this extremely painful feeling</li>
            <li> I was shocked.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed in this one</li>
            <li> Disappointed :(</li>
            <li> Hate this product.</li>
            <li> I hate to be the person that gives something 3/5 when chances are it&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li> I HATE these.</li>
            <li> but it just kept getting worst.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> It looked like a nasty sunburn.</li>
            <li> This is a terrible product, unless you want superficial chemical burns!</li>
            <li> The ingredients in these wipes made my skin burn; it was awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the latest product I tried in my seemingly never-ending search for the perfect makeup remover.  I&#x27;m partial to wipes and towelettes because of the convenience -- both remover product and applicator in one (no running out of cotton balls or cotton pads at a different time than the remover product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d previously tried some eye makeup remover pads (circular, in a screw-top canister) from Yes to Cucumbers and I hadn&#x27;t been thrilled with those because they made my eyes water a bit.  However, these towelettes have been fine to use around my eyes -- usually quite gentle, in fact.  I&#x27;ve been using them to remove mascara and they&#x27;ve been doing an exceptional job; they&#x27;re also pretty good at removing lip stains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the packaging on the larger package sizes (i.e., 30 count).  The plastic cover snaps shut and keeps the towelettes from drying out, which is great since I only use maybe five of these a week so the whole package lasts for a month and a half.  It&#x27;s a lot better than the wipe/towelette packages that only have a sticky flap to press over the opening (these have the sticky flap, too, but also the plastic door).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have somewhat sensitive skin but this has not bothered me very much in that respect.  I don&#x27;t notice much of a smell when I use these, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing I really like is the size -- if you need to rub a little bit to get all your eye makeup off, you can constantly move to a fresh area of the towelette, or switch to the other side (the sides are equivalent in terms of texture), so you can actually get the makeup off instead of moving it around.</li>
            <li> Probably costs a bit more than others, so not the best value.  However, it does an excellent job, and cost is not a deal breaker for me personally.</li>
            <li> My wife will only use these wipes for her face since it doesn&#x27;t make her breakout.</li>
            <li> I would leave 0 stars if I could. I&#x27;ve tried different facial wipes from &amp;#34;yes to&amp;#34; and had no problems but these made my eyes burn for 3 days even after using perscription eyedrops I have for allergies...for referance I didn&#x27;t use them on my eyes and the closest I got was about an inch away. I have sensitive skin so I thought these would be great especially after seeing a beauty guru I follow on youtube rave about them. Decent customer service when they apologized and offered to send a voucher to get something else that worked for me. My issue is that this was in november and now in april it is way past the 3 weeks it was supossed to take to get here. Hate this product. NOT hypoallergenic at all!!!</li>
            <li> Really cool and refreshing on my sensitive skin. Great on hot days, too. Have pack by my bed and one in my purse. Not alcohol based like some products. Doesn&#x27;t dry skin out. Doesn&#x27;t soap up leaving you with urge to find a sink to rinse.</li>
            <li> They did their job, but made my lips sting really badly.  For the most part, pretty good product, if I wipe my whole face with a sheet, I can feel it after, like a residue.</li>
            <li> these are great! i use them on the occasional night at home when i don&#x27;t feel like doing the full night-time skin care routine &amp; they work like a charm. good smell, don&#x27;t sting, don&#x27;t dry my skin out, no icky chemicals. but my favorite use for them is camping and traveling! it&#x27;s the perfect thing to have when you&#x27;re somewhere you can&#x27;t easily wash your face. i&#x27;ve been using them for several years &amp; am so glad!</li>
            <li> Always use these-they&#x27;re not super strong if you&#x27;re using them for makeup remover towelettes but they&#x27;re great for a post-gym face wipe.</li>
            <li> Nice when you&#x27;re on the go. I take these on trips. I just wish they didn&#x27;t put quite so much fragrance. It would be nice if it were a little more natural and didn&#x27;t have all the fake cucumber scent.</li>
            <li> Omgosh I wish i would&#x27;ve read the reviews beforehand but the rating was high and i use yes to tomatoes moisturizer with no problem so i trusted the company. I applied my lush makeup remover then i gently used the wipes to clear the excess makeup immediately there was an intolerable burning, the kind i only felt one other time while using Clinique and i ended up with chemical burns.  I thought it might have been because i was mixing the 2 different products that caused the bad reaction which in hindsight makes no sense because lush is 100% organic and yes to cucumbers is suppose to be 95% natural but i still tried it again alone this time and the burning was still there. It was so bad that i had to wash my face with ice water. Now I have 2 packs of this stuff smh.</li>
            <li> I bought these for the lazy nights where I don&#x27;t wash my make up off and keep them in my nightstand.  I&#x27;ve used about 5 so far and so far, no.  Yes they remove make up but they BURN my eyes, STING my skin/lip and make me itch.  I have no clue how this cucumber line can be marketed to sensitive skin, I don&#x27;t even have sensitive skin and these just hurt.  They feel like a chemical peel or something!  I would suggest sticking with baby wipes to be honest - removes make up and nice on your skin without being harsh.</li>
            <li> Does a great job of removing makeup but you must like the smell of cucumbers, of course. Great for my combination sensitive skin. Definitely cooling on your skin as well. Would be great in summer after working out.</li>
            <li> Have been using these for years - between exfoliating regularly and using these at night, my skin has been clean and balanced as this does not dry skin out.</li>
            <li> Id give a 5 but burns my eyes and sometimes reddens my skin a bit but the least of the YES products.</li>
            <li> I got these for when I was travelling because I was concerned about not having sufficient facilities to clean my face. I found that this did remove makeup and oil. However, I found that it was too harsh for my sensitive skin. It made my skin burn, itch, and turn red. I only tried using these twice before I disposed of them.</li>
            <li> The only non-oily face wipe I have ever used! I have gone through Neutrogena, Burts bees and many others and this product is by far my favorite. Its the only one that doesn&#x27;t leave my face oily and smells awesome. My sister is allergic to a lot of different beauty products and this product works great for her too!</li>
            <li> This product gets great reviews for some reason...I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin but this just burned my face. Do not put anywhere near your eye area. It did nothing to take off my eye makeup and was very irritating to my eye area.  This is definitely not an alcohol free or moisturizing product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least it smells good? Maybe this product works best for those who just need a quick wipe of the face and for those who don&#x27;t wear makeup.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Say yes to blueberries day cream and serum for a few months now and LOVE them so I thought I would give the towelettes a try to take with me on my vacation. The did ok at getting my face clean but they burned like the dickens and I had to stop using the product after a few days. I was really disappointed in this one and it has made me more reluctant to try some of their other products.</li>
            <li> Made my face turn bright red and burn, and my skin isnt usually sensitive. My mom tried to use them after i gave up on the pack and didnt want to throw away a huge pack with only 5 wipes used and the same thing happened to her. She is stubborn and still is trying to use them but has to rinse them underwater first to get some of the stuff out.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and my face loves these make up wipes!!</li>
            <li> These are not good for sensitive skin at all!!</li>
            <li> Got these for free as part of a promotion on  jet blue- my skin is on fire! Wth?? Ouch! Don&#x27;t buy, can&#x27;t use</li>
            <li> These are thin and didn&#x27;t remove eye makeup.  I ended up giving them to my daughter in law who later told me that when she bought these in the past, she didn&#x27;t feel like they cleaned her face well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought the Yes To products before, most of them I like well enough, I&#x27;ve never hated any until now. I bought these because I discovered my Grapefruit ones had dried out (with only two left, ugh) it was a hot day and I needed a wipe. I had no makeup on, had spent all afternoon running about and my face felt gross. I stopped at the local Target, ran in, and this was all they had in stock that wasn&#x27;t some double sized package (remember my regular one had just dried out).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t think twice buying these, I went in specifically for Yes To wipes, I really liked my Grapefruit and on more than one occasion they doubled as hand or desk wipes (I&#x27;m a student, some people are pretty gross on campus). I get in my car and the first thing I do is pop one out to give my face a wipe down. Oh the burns. It literally burned my skin, I have fairly sensitive skin, but &amp;#34;soothing cucumber&amp;#34; didn&#x27;t set off any alarms for me in the store. Initially it was only a tingle, about five seconds after I finished wiping my face and neck down, it was burning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ran back into the store, used the bathroom sink to put out the fire on my face. I got home about an hour later and all anyone could say was &amp;#34;why is your face and neck so red? Are you sunburned?&amp;#34; I had already returned them to the store, the customer service clerk took one look and immediately returned my money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I love the Grapefruit wipes, buyer beware on these.</li>
            <li> These were another Birchbox sample. They come out of the pouch moist and cool and are soothing on the skin. They do a fairly good job of removing make-up--foundation and blush, but not eye make-up (do not use these on your eyes!)--but they do not get all of it. Part of my typical night-time skin care routine includes using an astringent/toner, which I do after removing make-up with these wipes, and that always results in more make-up removal. Also, because these wipes are so soft, they do not exfoliate. That’s not necessarily a drawback, just something to consider if you want to use them regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall, I think these are OK for travelling, for example, when you don’t want to lug along a separate facial cleanser (the wipes are in a pouch, easy to pack and won’t spill), or if you are in a hurry after a workout, etc. But I wouldn’t recommend them as a regular part of a skin care routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited to add: I notice that some other reviewers had problems with itching and burning. I have combination sensitive skin, and I did not experience that, for what it’s worth.</li>
            <li> These face wipes are nice as they do leave the face feeling clean, but there is a strong perfume/fragrance to them (not cucumbers).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are gentle on the skin and dry quickly without leading to drying or cracking.</li>
            <li> Great smell.  Good quality fabric, doesn&#x27;t leave fibers all over your face like the cheaper ones.  And smells soothing and spa like.  Plus healthy ingredients!</li>
            <li> All time favorite face wipes!!!</li>
            <li> I use these right after the gym to wipe my face, chest and arms. Very refreshing!&lt;br /&gt;They also work pretty well if I am too lazy to use my usual face wash-a little scrubbing is needed if you are wearing a lot of eye makeup, but not too bad.</li>
            <li> WOW,  I  am glad to read I wasn&#x27;t  the only one with the red itchy skin and burn feel after using this product.  I have used almost every brand of make up remover facial wipes even the cheapest  ones like $1 one and never had a reaction like this. Tried them for about 3 days to see if maybe it was just me but it just kept getting worst. My face felt like it was on fire ,it got super red and itchy and it dried out my face. Very surprised for a &amp;#34;hypoallergenic &amp;#34; product.</li>
            <li> The cucumber scent is great and as I wrote in another review of towelettes, they are convenient and are great for travel.</li>
            <li> I really thought these would be a soothing cleansing wipe but they are the opposite.  I too do not have sensitive skin but these made my face turn splotchy red and it burned.  I had to wash my face and use calming lotions to stop the burning.  Disappointed :(</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable and these are excellent in removing foundation and all makeup.  I highly recommend them and haven&#x27;t found anything else I like better.  Gentle to the skin.</li>
            <li> I used the Yes to Blueberries towelettes and loved them. . . but they were out of stock at Target, so I decided to give these a try. They&#x27;re ok. They are convenient and clean your face, but DO NOT use them near your eyes. It will burn horrifically. I  will not purchase again. I&#x27;m going to try grapefruit next, since I love the convenience of the towelettes.</li>
            <li> These smell delicious. Perfect to keep in gym locker and in car after working out. Recommended as one of best Allure beauty buys.</li>
            <li> I love this product!! It&#x27;s one of my favorites. It did sting the first few times I used it, but after about 7 days or so, it stopped stinging and a I saw a huge improvement in my skin. I have acne-prone, combination skin that is more oily in the summer and a bit dry in the winter.</li>
            <li> Odd smell. Not worth the money</li>
            <li> These are very nice - high quality towelettes and they really make my skin feel fresh.  I was looking for something to use during my pregnancy and these haven&#x27;t aggravated my skin at all. I will for sure keep buying them. I really like that the packs are resealable so they don&#x27;t dry out.</li>
            <li> These are so convenient, when you don&#x27;t feeel like washing your face, but at least need to cleanse your skin!  And the scent is soft &amp; fresh!</li>
            <li> I buy these in bulk now. They are one of the only facial cleansing wipes seem to actually leave my face clean without irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> Best face wipes ever.  Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Not sure what is hypoallergenic about these... They BURN minutes after using them to the point where I need to rinse my face in a bowl of ice water! They also make my skin red and inflamed. I don&#x27;t even have sensitive skin, just normal with the occasional hormonal area breakouts... but when I use these my skin just gets this extremely painful feeling I cannot get rid of and the redness takes hours to go away...</li>
            <li> I have been using these for over a year, now. I love them. I will say, however, that I do need to rinse my face after using them or I will break out (I have this issue with all facial towelettes I&#x27;ve tried that say rinsing is not necessary). Any towelettes that aren&#x27;t for sensitive skin dry me out. Any towelettes that are for sensitive skin don&#x27;t clean enough and I feel greasy a few hours later. These are the only ones I&#x27;ve found that give me a balance between the two. Plus, less than $10 for two packs is a great price. Too bad it is an \\&quot;add-on item\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and have been trying to find a nice wipe that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. With such high reviews and promises on the package of being calming and hypoallergenic, I thought these would be awesome. They sting my face instantly. At first I thought it was just a bad skin day, but every one makes my face skin (especially around my eyes). I&#x27;m also way more red AFTER I used these, and it hardly works on my eye makeup (and I don&#x27;t wear much!) Lastly, they leave my skin feeling sticky/clammy, not at all clean.  Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> I received these as part of my birchbox subscription and they were the first thing i actually wanted to buy!&lt;br /&gt;They smell amazing!  They do a great job cleaning off my makeup and they are the only product I&#x27;ve ever used that doesn&#x27;t make my sensitive skin break out! I would recommend them to anyone!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I have used it for years because I have sensitive skin.  It not only cleans but does not clog pores and it keeps my skin looking great with no breakouts or other issues.</li>
            <li> The ONLY wipes I use! They&#x27;re by far the best!</li>
            <li> I do have very sensitive skin and I thought these would be gentle. They, however, make my face burn worse than anything else I am every used. I also don&#x27;t really like the way they smell or the way my skin feels after I use them.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like these, as they are designed for sensitive skin, not tested on animals and priced right. They did a good job of removing makeup, in my opinion, but I ended up with red, burning, irritated skin. Also, you can&#x27;t use these on your eyes so you&#x27;re left needing a separate product for eye makeup. Disappointing.</li>
            <li> My face gets warm but doesn&#x27;t burn too bad. The wipes arnt very wet (in my package at least). I think they will be okay for in the morning when I wake up and need to remove oil from my face but definitely not for taking off makeup.</li>
            <li> Works great to remove makeup...even waterproof. Nice fresh &amp; clean smell.</li>
            <li> I have used these for years and loved them.  However, for some reason, they have started BURNING my face.  I don&#x27;t know if the formula was changed or what, but I will now be finding another product from another company to use.</li>
            <li> I was a bit concerned by some of the reviews here, but I&#x27;ve been using the Say Yes To products for a few years now and have loved them, so I wanted to try these out for myself and see how they were.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally just wash my face with hot water and a clean washcloth before going to bed, but started using these instead.  I don&#x27;t wear makeup, but the amount of gunk these pull off of my skin is awesome, and my face feels so refreshed afterwards!  My skin looks better, my face definitely feels better, and I didn&#x27;t get any of the burn described by some other reviewers (though I have used tea tree oil before, so perhaps I knew what to expect).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad that I tried these and now always have some on hand at home and in my travel bag.  Say Yes does it again!</li>
            <li> The YESto line is very nice - especially with the cleansers.  This is my favorite of the 3 facial cloths I&#x27;ve tried (Tomato &amp; Grapefruit being the others) and the smell is wonderful.  I like it better than any of the other commerical wipes out there - including Neutrogena, Aveeno and Garnier... the only ones I like better are the MAC wipes - but - considering the price difference this one has become a staple in my house.</li>
            <li> Burns eyes. Unpleasant smell.</li>
            <li> Leaves your face feeling tingling fresh.</li>
            <li> The towelettes leave my face feeling clean and refreshed.  I really like to smell, I haven&#x27;t tried any other their other scents yet but maybe I will next time.  This is the second time I have reordered.</li>
            <li> Ordered them as Christmas gifts for wife and daughters, absolutely love them.  Have begun seeing them in Walgreens drug stores locally as well at similar prices.  Great brand!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought these in-store multiple times and love them - they&#x27;re great for when you&#x27;re up too early or going to bed too tired to want to actually wash your face. But these packs that I received aren&#x27;t even the same product I&#x27;ve bought in person. To start, the packaging is different type of plastic, the pattern looks blurred and copied, the labeling on the package isn&#x27;t the same, and worst of all, the ingredients list is almost completely different. Amazon didn&#x27;t list the ingredients list on their site, so there was no way to know these were different, but I ended up never even using these things and have just left them sitting in my bathroom (I need to just toss them). I don&#x27;t know where Amazon got these things, but they are not the product that is sold by Yes To Inc., in stores or on their own website.</li>
            <li> I love these wipes. I have eczema so my skin is very sensitive. These wipes make you feel a little tingly but it&#x27;s just due to the cucumber. It goes away quickly. Removes make up and leaves my skin very clean. I have absolutely no complaints. These are my favorite wipes and I&#x27;ve tried pretty much all the general ones that most stores carry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast, quick way to clean your face which helps prevent breakouts.</li>
            <li> I love these wipes! I have them in my gym bag, my nightstand, and my purse.  I have tried numerous brands, and these are the only ones I have found that don&#x27;t seem to leave a greasy film on my skin. My skin feels fresh and clean. I have combination skin; the wipes do not dry out my cheeks, but they definitely clean my oily forehead and nose!</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling clean without leaving residue like many other wipes. They smell great! Also, they work well at removing eye makeup without a huge struggle like I&#x27;ve found with other brands.</li>
            <li> Luckily I did a test on my wrist before wiping my face, felt a tingling sensation but I thought that was what the product was supposed to do ( a la queen helene mint mask) . After the test spot dried, I noticed a very dark and dry outline surrounding the test spot. It looked like a nasty sunburn. I am not allergic to cucumber so something else in these wipes is causing the problem... NOT HYPOALLERGENIC!!!</li>
            <li> A fresh scent, and attractive packaging. It gets my makeup off easily and leaves my skin feeling fresh and not dry. Love em!</li>
            <li> These wipes are perfect. They do a good job of cleaning my face without drying out my skin. The wipes are larger than you would expect, and sturdy enough not to fall apart as you use them. I keep some in my desk at work, some in my car, and this summer will be keeping some in the fridge for hot days. The wipes are soothing, don&#x27;t hurt my eyes even if I kind of scrub my eyelashes, and they have been so helpful with relieving allergy symptoms after I come in from outside. These are now a staple in my home.</li>
            <li> Love these things. They clean well, don&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin, remove makeup and allow me to go without moisturizer most of the time. Great for men and women.</li>
            <li> These are quality and less expensive than the equivalently good alternatives. I mostly use them before bed to remove makeup.</li>
            <li> No stinging or burning sensation for me, and noroblems removing makeup. I&lt;br /&gt;Love the smell and that my skin isn&#x27;t dry after use.</li>
            <li> I have tried many but these are the only facial cleaning wipes I like.  Mild and yet very effective.  Don&#x27;t have to rub to get eye makeup off.  Great for my sensitive skin as well. And they come in travel size as well.</li>
            <li> These wipes leave you feeling soo fresh and clean. They are especially good when prepping my face to get my eyebrows threaded. I pair it with my yes to tomatoes daily repair treatment. I haven&#x27;t seen a single pimple since!</li>
            <li> Great awesome good quality well made we really enjoy it excellent purchase looks super we are glad we chose this one</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually like single use products b/c they are wasteful, but I love these wipes. I carry them with me on vacations and to work. They make your face feel clean and are great when washing your face isn&#x27;t an option. AND they are biodegradable.</li>
            <li> Good product and good price!</li>
            <li> Honestly its a 4.5. They smell wonderful. I use these as makeup remover wipes. I wear full coverage face makeup and they do a good job and hold up very well even with semi-scrubbing. My only reason they don&#x27;t get a solid 5 is if I use them for multiple days in a row (more than 6) they make my skin slightly  dry, and irritated. I have very sensitive skin and have combination skin problems.  Still one of the best cleansing clothes ive used.</li>
            <li> I really like how gentle these cloths are and they don&#x27;t leave my face sticky or shiny like other wipes, just soft and clean.</li>
            <li> I used these religiously , but this last pack I bought there&#x27;s something off. They feel sudsier than usual ( normally not), they don&#x27;t smell the same, and most importantly they have turned my face red and mildly irritated. I have done Nothing else different, and the weather has not turned cold or windy. I called the 888# back of my pkg today, they took my name + address ( no phone though) and said they have to forward it to another dept for \\&quot; follow up\\&quot;. I offered to send the pkg to them so they can see, smell, and use for themselves I am CONVINCED they put the wrong wipes in this&lt;br /&gt;packet!  I just know from being a regular user. If you want the UPC or other mystery #&#x27;s from the back of this pkg, if you&#x27;ve had similar probe, msg me thru amazon here &amp; I&#x27;ll give them to you. I am stymied they were normally so good!</li>
            <li> Feels good. I&#x27;m one of those people who aren&#x27;t tired right up to actually falling asleep, so this cleanse is right on my nightstand.&lt;br /&gt;My skin looks better after using for a few weeks. Good product. Masterful Name.</li>
            <li> I use these wipe after running, and when I am too tired to properly wash my face.  They do a great job and don&#x27;t cause me to break out.</li>
            <li> I got this off the recommendation from Ingrid (The Grid Monster) on youtube and I have been using them to remove my makeup before I use my purity face-wash. They work fabulously and are perfectly refreshing! They can sting a little bit when scrubbing the face but thats typical for me of any towelette and it doesn&#x27;t last long. I love to use these first and then use my Purity and then put on moisturizer but these are so perfect for on the go and traveling. I highly recommend these. I&#x27;m currently trying the Yes to grapefruit towelettes to see if they&#x27;ll help with acne scars and hyper-pigmentation!</li>
            <li> These are the best. So soothing and hydrating</li>
            <li> I love that this product is mostly organic ingredients. I have sensitive skin so I can&#x27;t use a lot of products because they either dry out my skin or I get red spots all over. This product is perfect for after work to get my make up off and clean my face. I love that it&#x27;s a wipe and it&#x27;s not all messy.</li>
            <li> Of all the Facial wipes I have tried this and the Grapefruit are the best. I use daily in the morning and can add soap rinse them and throw them away. I am not a fan of wash clothes, so these work perfectly</li>
            <li> I love these wipes. They take all my make up and they are eco enough. It will be perfect if the wipes were biodegradable (I don&#x27;t think they are). For you references, this wipes are for normal skin, you will feel a burning sensation if you don&#x27;t have a normal skin. I think Yes to Carrots have another line for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> These wipes aren&#x27;t great. I am not sure what the intended purpose was, but they do NOT remove makeup well. Also, whenever I use them, if feels refreshing for a split second, then my face BURNS for about 3 minutes afterwards. I almost never have skin reactions to products, but this s*** stings. They dont smell that great either. DONT waste your MONEY. Equate is MUCH better. Or Garnier.</li>
            <li> Being a huge fan of the YES TO products, I was super excited to try out their Cucumber Facial Towelettes. I love the smell of cucumber, and the towelletes really do smell wonderful (fresh and energizing), but overall this product just didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For one, they make my skin burn. 5 minutes after using them, my skin would get very irritated, red and itchy. And I literally felt like my face was on fire. Nothing like this ever happened to me before, even with the cheapest drugstore make-up removing wipes. I just don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, so this was a real shocker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, they don&#x27;t remove make-up very well, so expect to look like a rabid raccoon after trying to get your mascara off with these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture of the wipes is smooth and very pleasant to the touch, and they do smell fantastic, but the last thing I want is to smell like a cucumber but look like a tomato.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sorry YES TO, but this is a NO-NO.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very good about washing my face (I know, shame on me) mostly because I haven&#x27;t had a problem with acne or break outs.  Well, my friend/Esthetician has convinced me to wash my face at night by introducing me to this product.  It&#x27;s so easy and I don&#x27;t think my skin is getting dry or anything like that so I&#x27;ll stick with it.  I love the Amazon subscribe &amp; save option too...they will continue to show up at my door on a regular basis so I have no excuse!</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic, but burns a little after I wipe my face with it. The burning goes away and there is no redness, but it is just a little irritating. I use it casually at the office just to freshen up or wake myself up (I don&#x27;t wear any makeup, so I don&#x27;t know anything about how well it works with makeup removal).</li>
            <li> I love this product! It works well in taking off makeup, and smells amazing!</li>
            <li> They burn!! I bought several of these in bulk for my wife. She told me that she couldn&#x27;t use them, they burned, and she thought she was allergic. I didn&#x27;t think much of it until I used them too. Yes, they burn. Not in a refreshing Noxema kind of way.... I just used them and then looked at myself in the mirror to see distinct red marks all over my face, accompanied by a burning sensation. This is a terrible product, unless you want superficial chemical burns!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually actually have very sensitive skin, but these wipes burn my face when I use them. They are effective and I like how they smell, but I only use them when I don&#x27;t have anything else, and I won&#x27;t buy more. I thought it was pretty ironic that these are some of the only beauty products I own that actually irritate my skin, as they are supposedly for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I love using these wipes before I run, I just leave the pack right on my treadmill and boom I remember to wipe the gross make-up off before I start my run &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> These facial towelettes leave a residue on my hands and face after I use it that makes it feel not as clean as I would like. They smell good though.</li>
            <li> I usually like the Yes to lines and had high hopes but this did strange things to my skin. First it burned while I used it. Then it left a film on my skin unlike any other facial towelettes I&#x27;ve ever used. I would have to rinse my face afterward, which defeats the purpose. After a couple of weeks I noticed my skin started to become strangely rough. You couldn&#x27;t see bumps or anything, but the texture was very strange. I stopped using them and my skin has gone back to normal. I do not recommend. Wish I had read the reviews before I bought it!</li>
            <li> I love these facial towelettes. I read reviews of various towelettes on EWG&#x27;s Cosmetics Database and was surprised to see that other brands I&#x27;d been using contained ingredients that were not considered safe. But the &amp;#34;Yes To Cucumber&amp;#34; towelettes received high ratings, so now this is one of the only facial towelettes I will be using from now on.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite face wipe and has been for about five years now. I have had very sensitive skin and have had a hard time finding wipes that I would enjoy. Many of the options are too oily, too pricey, or scratchy. The Yes to Cucumber wipes are soft, and moist but not sopping wet. They also smell very clean. They take make up off easily and are also a great way to make your face feel refreshed after a long day. I recommend these to people all the time.</li>
            <li> Great product. Scent is nice and light and they don&#x27;t dry out my skin. I think these will be my go-to from now on.</li>
            <li> I love these wipes.  They smell wonderful, they&#x27;re damp enough to not cause a lot of friction, they take off my mineral foundation and any residue left under my eyes from removing my eye makeup, the material itself is sturdy and thick and doesn&#x27;t leave any fibers behind.  They smell like summer! I love the scent.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin stinky, nor is there residue left over from these.  Just clean skin.</li>
            <li> Excellent for traveling, hospital stays, and keeping by your bedside table for days when you just need to flop into bed but don&#x27;t want to leave the day&#x27;s makeup and dirt on your face.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is mild and refreshing. Haven&#x27;t had any issues with skin reactions. But your skin might feel a little stripped, I usually always need a little moisturizer afterward.</li>
            <li> I am partial to wipes because I&#x27;m admittedly lazy about my face. I don&#x27;t wear a ton of makeup; generally just eyeliner, mascara, and lip balm, with BB cream if I&#x27;m goin&#x27; out and want a little extra. At night, I just want to go to bed. But I get that one&#x27;s face should be cleaned. So I&#x27;ve tried pretty much every brand of wipe out there. Pond&#x27;s? Kind of greasy. Neutrogena? Breaks me out without fail. Olay? Same goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should also note that I have patches on my forehead and cheeks that turn tomato red and/or flake at the slightest provocation, and all the above wipes provoked that response in addition to breaking me out.&lt;br /&gt;This brand of wipe is one of only two brands that doesn&#x27;t do that. I have tried the cucumber, grapefruit and tomato versions, and all have been acceptable, though the tomato &amp; grapefruit version are MUCH \\&quot;wetter\\&quot; than these. If your gripe with these was that they were not moist enough, try those. The cucumber is fine for the amount of makeup I have to take off; I follow with various toners or acids on cotton balls and very rarely do I get any extra makeup off.&lt;br /&gt;The major gripe I have with these is that it is VERY difficult to grab only one at a time. Whoever designed how they are folded into the package should be struck soundly. It sounds petty, but these cloths aren&#x27;t cheap and I only NEED one at a time. So I&#x27;m left reaching gingerly into the package, feeling around for the seam and lifting while gently shaking while also holding the rest down with my other hand, OR shoving the extra one or two that come out back into the package in a damp wad. Oddly, this does not happen with the other varieties, only the cucumber.&lt;br /&gt;But other than this, I can recommend them as having worked well for those who are sensitive and don&#x27;t need to take off a ton of face paint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, the other brand that works super well and doesn&#x27;t inflame the flaky/red patches is the Burt&#x27;s Bees sensitive formula, the one in the all-white package with a cotton boll on the lid. Very good.tton boll on the lid. Very good.</li>
            <li> Trying to find the perfect makeup remover towels can be a long and expensive process.  Especially if you have sensitive skin. I came across the sample size of these in a small overstock store.  The clerk was over the moon about them so I bought a few packets.&lt;br /&gt;They are the best!  They remove stubborn eye makeup completely without stinging or burning.&lt;br /&gt;I was delighted to find the full size packets on Amazon.  The price is substantially better than in the stores too.&lt;br /&gt;All in all...a winner.</li>
            <li> Great great great!!! I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> I got a coupon for these so decided to give them a try.  Like the other reviewers stated, these burn my face.  I love face wipes for removing makeup, but these make the skin around my eyes burn and my cheeks turn bright red.  I have never had a reaction to face wipes before, and I have used many different brands from the natural burts bees wipes to the less natural Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, dry skin and I love these wipes! They remove most of my make-up but need a little extra help for my waterproof mascara. My skin does not dry out and I really like these for a quick cleaning when I&#x27;m too tired to wash my face properly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why, but this product burns my eyes. I guess it is only a makeup remover for foundation and such. It was definitely a great deal, but I&#x27;ve gone back to other facial towelettes. Too bad.</li>
            <li> I love these. They leave your face feeling clean without residue.</li>
            <li> I have been buying these towelettes regularly for a long time now. They work well for removing makeup (although I don&#x27;t wear makeup that is very difficult to remove, so I don&#x27;t know how well it would work for that). They also work well if you just want your face to feel fresh and clean. I use these almost every day.</li>
            <li> Wife uses this every night before heading to bed.  Keep an eye out for subscribe and save for a great bargain.</li>
            <li> We have an 8-year-old daughter that complains about washing her face to the point we almost gave up asking. Then we tried these wipes. They are perfect. She loves using them, they are easy and hypoallergenic. These are now a regular purchase for our family.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for a while .  Very refreshing.</li>
            <li> I use this towelettes every morning. It is quick and cleans my oily skin very well. Just enough moisture and no sticky residue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that two of these wipes takes all of my makeup off of my face at night before I put on my benzoyl peroxide to keep breakouts at bay. It is good enough to get the makeup off my face but gentle and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin. I only wash my face with water in the morning as washing twice a day is too harsh for my skin, so these wipes save me at night.</li>
            <li> This product is great for sensitive skin! It tingles for 10 seconds after. Removes all the days oils. I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these facial cleansing wipes for years now and I absolutely love them. I&#x27;m really bad at remembering and taking the time to remove my makeup and wash my face every night, but these make it simple and fast. They smell nice and are so soft, they aren&#x27;t abrasive like some other similar wipes.</li>
            <li> ...and I&#x27;ve tried A LOT. I use facial towelettes at the gym to remove makeup etc. before I work out. These work great and have a pleasant, light fresh scent. I have not had the stinging/irritation problem that other reviewers mention, though I do have fairly sensitive skin. I think it&#x27;s just going to be different for everyone (like most facial products). I&#x27;ve tried wipes from about a dozen different brands, including some other &amp;#34;Yes To&amp;#34; ones (which I did not like at all, mostly because of the scent).</li>
            <li> These take off make up and have a pleasant scent, however they didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling refreshed. My face felt sticky afterwards each time. I&#x27;ll look for another brand that is cruelty free.</li>
            <li> I use these everyday. They remove make-up well and never burn my eyes when I take off mascara.</li>
            <li> I have avoided face cleansing wipes for years because they never seem to get my face completely clean and they always seem to leave some sort of soapy residue that I have to wash off or I&#x27;ll break out. Which...obviously defeats the purpose of wipes. These are great, though, I actually prefer the blueberry one because it feels more refreshing, but these cucumber ones are great (avoid the grapefruit ones). I&#x27;ve been using these for a month and my skin looks great. Buy through subscribe &amp; Save for the best value.</li>
            <li> Love these! So refreshing and quickly clean my face.</li>
            <li> I hate to be the person that gives something 3/5 when chances are it&#x27;s just me. I have very sensitive skin and it still made me break out. My skin is fair and acne prone. Hope it works out better for anyone reading this!</li>
            <li> These towelettes have a burning effect on my face so I wish I had gotten a different one. They don&#x27;t cause a lasting redness or rash but I was afraid it was going to when I first used it. Also, it doesn&#x27;t really cleanse well.  Still need to cleanser and wash face to remove makeup.</li>
            <li> We absolutely love these wipes – they are great for everything: feeling sick and sweaty, getting rid of malicious orders, just cleaning your face at night and having the nice spa scent of a cucumber facial.</li>
            <li> I break out if I try to clean my face everyday. I love to have that clean, washed feeling however. I can use these everyday, and they keep my skin looking great. Plus great smell!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure they actually remove all my make-up, but I love the smell!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the &amp;#34;yes to cucumbers&amp;#34; SOOTHING hypoallergenic facial towels.&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;- 98% Natural&lt;br /&gt;- Cruelty Free&lt;br /&gt;- Paraben Free&lt;br /&gt;- It does remove MOST of the cosmetics and dirt from my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;- Tingles&lt;br /&gt;- Burns&lt;br /&gt;- Makes my eyes water even when I don&#x27;t apply the wipe to my eyes. (sometimes I like to just wipe the oil from my t-zone or brow pencil from my eyebrows.)&lt;br /&gt;- Leaves a film over my skin. I almost feel as though I have a mask on once I&#x27;m done wiping my face with these.&lt;br /&gt;- It doesn&#x27;t make me feel any cleaner. I always feel like I need to go wash my face.&lt;br /&gt;- They are a bit rough on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally I would list HYPOALLERGENIC FORMULA in the Pro&#x27;s section but I can&#x27;t because it doesn&#x27;t feel true. I would think that if this product is meant for sensitive skin, that it shouldn&#x27;t burn. Or make my eyes water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If / when they change the formula, I hope they don&#x27;t add parabens or propylene glycol or any other horrible ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this formula to anyone and I will NOT be buying them again until MAYBE IF they come out with a new formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll just take the time to wet a washcloth and use a drop of my Shea Moisture Shampoo or John Masters Organics Zinc &amp; Sage Shampoo with Conditioner or Mineral Fusions shampoo or Boscia Facial Cleanser.</li>
            <li> I love these!  I freshen up my face when I don&#x27;t feel like washing with soap and water.  They are the BEST for travel!</li>
            <li> I got these wipes on sale and haven&#x27;t used the entire package, but they work great with my skin (combination).  I typically use them in conjunction with another facial cleanser, but use these primarily when I wear makeup.  I find that they work great for that, though I tend to only wear a light application when I do wear makeup.  I am very happy with them and glad I found them on sale.  That being said, my boyfriend also tried these after I got them and they made his face sting and burn after only one light use.  He borders on oily skin, though not sensitive, but these definitely didn&#x27;t work for him.</li>
            <li> These worked well for me as I was recovering from surgery.  NIce face wash, with a clean scent.  Also good in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite face products!!!  I have a package of these just about everywhere important!  Car, bedroom, desk at work, and of course the bathroom.  These are great for a quick cleaning, or removing makeup.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them for removing any eye makeup.  However, I&#x27;ve never had a problem removing my mineral foundation.  A couple of swipes over my face and I&#x27;m all set.  I have rosacea and found that these don&#x27;t irritate or cause my skin to dry out.  They&#x27;re fantastic!!</li>
            <li> This is a good clean wipe.  Leaves your face feeling clean and tightens up your pores.</li>
            <li> It removes makeup well enough, but it burns. like. heck. I thought at first maybe I was just allergic but other reviewers are saying the same...How is this product still on the market?? It left awful red blotches on  my cheeks.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, which is why I thought these &amp;#34;soothing cucumber&amp;#34; wipes were going to be perfect. Well, the package and name couldn&#x27;t be more wrong! After using these one evening before bed my face became seriously inflamed. Like within a second of using them. Bright red, hot, burning and honest to God, swollen even! I was shocked. Something is seriously wrong with these wipes and I&#x27;m trying to figure out what ingredient or ingredient combination in these is causing my severe reaction because I plan to stay far, far away from it!</li>
            <li> The wipes remove my make up easily and do not dry out my skin. They contain no alcohol and are effective. I recommend them as a makeup remover including eye makeup. They are also a good deal.</li>
            <li> What a delightful way to end my day! Yes to is an eco-friendly company. That goes a long way in my book. Not an overpowering smell which is good because I don&#x27;t like random smells. Great deal. Great for travel. Works very well and is very refreshing.</li>
            <li> My face feels clean when using it not sticky like other face wipes can leave it.</li>
            <li> great facial wipes to remove make up.  I use them everyday in addition to a gental cleanser afterward.  makes me skin feel soft and clean.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and am very cautious with what I use on my face.  This is a great product, it makes my skin feel refreshed, although it sometimes burns a little after using these wipes, may just be the material it is made out of and I&#x27;m so used to other products and having to SCRUB SCRUB away at my face for it to actually work.  Overall a great product, will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> I love the packaging, I love the ease of use, I love the scent, I love how well it works to remove oil/makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But... I kept getting what appeared to be &amp;#34;pinkeye&amp;#34;. My doc and I finally figured out that I was getting infections in the eye due to this product. I stopped using it, and voila! No more &amp;#34;pinkeye!&amp;#34; I have used Yes to Tomatoes eye makeup remover cream, and I still do. So I know it&#x27;s not the manufacturer. It&#x27;s simply something in the product I&#x27;m intollerant to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So for anybody else, I&#x27;d say definitely go for this product. It&#x27;s great, for those who can use it. :)</li>
            <li> I have to start by saying that I&#x27;ve been using these wipes for months and I love them. They comprise the entirety of my Subscribe &amp; Save monthly order!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first started using these wipes because I was looking for something gentle. I had a bad experience with some acne-fighting &#x27;grapefruit&#x27; wipes and I wasn&#x27;t looking for makeup removal (which, it seems, 90% of the face wipes out there aim to do). I just wanted a sensitive wipe for quick and easy skincare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These cool and refreshing wipes fit the bill and have been a godsend. Perfect for my needs. I know that a lot of people are having issues with burning and irritation. I&#x27;ve never had that problem! I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m particularly lucky or if it&#x27;s just that my skin isn&#x27;t that sensitive after all.</li>
            <li> The towelettes are nice and big. I can usually get all my make-up - including eye make-up off with one towelette. The cucumber smell is soothing. The price is right, and I really like the product.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Leaves my face really refreshed.  I only use them at night, and in the winter my face gets pretty cold after using them, but other than that they are great.  My sister and I run out pretty regularly, so I&#x27;m pretty intrigued by this amazon \\&quot;subscribe and save\\&quot; deal. (Any insight on that would help).  I don&#x27;t wear much makeup, but I do use these wipes for removal from time to time, and I don&#x27;t have a problem with it at all.  It takes awhile to get all my mascara off, but that is really typical being that I smother my lashes pretty heavily.  I always use the hypoallergenic ones because they are safest, and my sister has a lot of skin allergies, especially around the lips, and I&#x27;ve never heard her complain about these wipes.</li>
            <li> Very soothing and works great for getting my face clean. Smells good too!</li>
            <li> I bought these on clearance at Target and absolutely love them! I am a huge fan of the YesTo product line and these facial towelettes are an easy fuss free way to keep my skin fresh and clean! I love the cucumber scent and the way it leaves my skin feeling clean.</li>
            <li> I love these wipes for my face, I was being cheap and decided to try the store brand facial wipes. Wasn&#x27;t the same and they burned my skin and I went running back to Yes to Cucumbers brand.</li>
            <li> I just love these towelettes. I use them every day to remove my make up. They are very big and you only need one for complete makeup removal.</li>
            <li> feels amazing in my skin! super easy at removing make up, love the cucumber smell.  very satisfied with the product</li>
            <li> These are great facial wipes -- but can be used for more than just the face; I sometimes use several as a quick clean-up when there isn&#x27;t enough time to shower. The Yes to Cucumber face wipes are a quick and easy way to clean your face and have a refreshing cucumber scent. These work well for my combination skin, leaving it soft and nicely balanced, with no sticky residue as some wipes can. These wipes stay moist for at least a couple of months in the packaging, as long as you carefully close the inner tab to seal it shut. They are made in Israel. These wipes are highly recommended!! In fact, I like them well enough to repurchase regularly with subscribe &amp; save.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Yes to Coconut wipes have a delicious, tropical coconut scent and are also worth considering. I prefer the scents of the Yes to Cucumber/Coconut wipes much more than that of the Yes to Grapefruit wipes. If you&#x27;re looking for a facial wipe that cleanses better, consider Blum Naturals Exfoliating wipe, which has little beads that help clean -- and it also has a great orange scent.</li>
            <li> this product would be nice, except the odor make me sick. had to return this as soon as I used it.</li>
            <li> These face wipes are awesome! I keep a container in my desk drawer at work and one on my nightstand. I love having these next to my bed. There are too many nights when I get in bed without washing my face, now I have these for those moments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have dryish, sensitive skin and have had no problems with these.</li>
            <li> Sometimes in the morning I dont have time to shower or wash my face before taking the kids to school. Yep, gross. And I wake up with a very oily face, I use 1-2 of these and I feel much better, clean, etc. I also use throughout the day at work as I work in a catering kitchen.</li>
            <li> Rather strong &amp;#34;cucumber&amp;#34; scent.</li>
            <li> I found the smell on my skin horrid. I could smell it through out the day.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of getting free Proactiv two years ago even though my face was fine. It destroyed my skin. I have tried every expensive product out there trying to fix the problem. My skin was flaky and I would randomly break out. I have been using Yes facewipes for about three months now, and not only is it cheap, but it is fantastic. My skin is back to normal now. I highly recommend to anyone who just wants a quick clean or someone with really dry skin. Also it does take off makeup really well despite the review that says the contrary.</li>
            <li> some people have reported these don&#x27;t work as well on some mascaras/eye make up. I have to say these work great for me. Obviously everyone&#x27;s make up brand is not the same and I can imagine that some eyeliners are harder to remove than others, but mine is also pretty &amp;#34;stay put&amp;#34; and this does a very good job of cleaning up my face, even when I have more make up on than usual... and skin also feels good. I have quite sensitive skin and have been happy with these. Amazon price is also unbeatable.</li>
            <li> The only makeup remover/cleansing wipes I&#x27;ve found that don&#x27;t leave a nasty film on my skin afterwards. I want my face to feel clean, not covered with something else. Love the super-light yet refreshing fragrance of cucumbers. They just make my face feel clean when I don&#x27;t have access to running water and face wash (I often use when driving home from work or gym - or if I&#x27;m just too tired to wash my face at night. Highly recommend. If you have normal, combo, or dry skin you&#x27;ll definitely want to follow with a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I love these soo much! yes, they can irritate a LITTLE bit SOMETIMES but for the most part they are wonderful! My skin always feels so refreshed &amp; clean after using these.  I am an esthetician &amp; makeup artist &amp; these are my holy grail makeup remover/skin freshening wipes! Will ALWAYS buy again! Try the other ones too, they&#x27;re all great!</li>
            <li> I love these and this line! The cucumber might not be great for sensitive skin, however I love the smell and they really remove makeup and cleanse. If you have sensitive skin, maybe be cautious. They irritate a little bit but will go away. It didn&#x27;t bother me much, as I have sensitive skin. The other scents in this line might be a better bet if you have really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is the stinkiest facial wipe I&#x27;ve ever used! It makes your face smell like a chemical-y baby wipe, and the scent lingers even after washing it off with soap. Also, it stings like crazy. Waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> I like many of the other products from this brand (the grapefruit scrub is great!), so I thought I would like these. I don&#x27;t think that I have sensitive skin, but these make my face burn... I bought these thinking I could use them to remove eyemakeup without irritating my eyes, but I don&#x27;t want to take these anywhere near my eyes! My skin goes red and gets super irritated and I have to wash my face immediately. I always wash my face after using any type of wipe anyways, but I don&#x27;t even have time to remove all the makeup before my face starts tingling. I do however use these after swatching products on my hands/arms or for spot-cleaning brushes or for other uses like that.&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t recommend these to anyone with VERY sensitive skin, since I do think that they could be irritating.</li>
            <li> I can see how this could be beneficial to refreshing skin, but as a form of makeup removal? Don&#x27;t waste your money. This doesn&#x27;t remove the makeup, but it does a great job of smudging it around to make you look like a raccoon. I bought this specifically for makeup removal, I had to use soap and water every time to really get the makeup off. Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> I love these wipes! It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive, acne prone skin. And it doesn&#x27;t break me out.  I remove my makeup, including eyes, with this towelette and then wash my face with my cleanser and continue my bedtime routine.  It works great!</li>
            <li> It works well to take off make up, but I don&#x27;t love the smell. It also irritates my eyes if I get it too close. I have sensitive skin, so I thought this would be great, but it&#x27;s just alright.</li>
            <li> Like this okay, good for when traveling, in a pinch.  But it seems to make my skin a little dry and the&lt;br /&gt;smell is a little artificial!  But, I do use it, but probably won&#x27;t buy it again!</li>
            <li> These are very gentle on your skin, that is my favorite part about them.  They easily remove foundation and grime, but take a little more to remove waterproof maskara and eyeliner.  Smells good too.</li>
            <li> Well, I am pretty much as sucker for all Yes to Cucumber products.  I started using more natural products after learning about chemicals like phthalates that are put in beauty products.  No phthalates with the Yes to brand!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin.  I find the wipes to be particularly helpful for removing makeup at the end of the day without drying out my face.  They are gentile enough to use to get off mascara and versatile enough to be used on the whole face.  The cucumber is very soothing.  I have these wipes on Subscribe and Save because they are cheaper that way than buying in the store.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of different brands of facial wipes, and these are by far my favorite ones.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased two packs of 30 this time, as I am going on a trip and don&#x27;t want to run out;&lt;br /&gt;they are super for traveling!!</li>
            <li> These wipes say &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;. I doubt they are as natural as they claim to be. I HATE these. They suck at removing makeup, and they made my face burn every single time after/during use.</li>
            <li> I absolutely freaking love these! I use these for everything! Removing makeup and grime from the day, yes of course. But these are also great for freshening up while camping, after the gym, long road trips, traveling, etc. They are so gentle that they can be used pretty much anywhere on the body, and I do mean anywhere. Leaves no yucky residue behind, unlike other towelettes I&#x27;ve used, and the scent is nice and fresh smelling. These are a must in any overnight bag, car dashboard, etc. They seal up well, so they don&#x27;t dry out before they can be used. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also another huge plus, I save money on them using subscribe and save! I get a ton for way less than what I would pay in the store. I&#x27;ve never had any defective packages. I&#x27;m very happy with these!</li>
            <li> This product was fine the first couple of times I used it, but then it started to burn. My whole face stung and my eyes burned like fire. My face was totally red too. I looked like I been out in the sun way too long. Don&#x27;t use this product!!!</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed these wipes.  They were moist and soft and stayed that way down to the last wipe.  A little tip for the people who found them too dry:  store the package upside down, with the opening face down.  This keeps the moisture at the top wipe, so the one you pull out will have the most moisture. I store any kind of wipe package this way and it really helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These felt great on my skin, the wipe itself has a very light cucumber scent, and is very soft.  The scent only seems to be on the wipe and does not linger on skin, which is nice. I really enjoyed the texture of the wipe, it isn&#x27;t rough like some of them, so I felt okay using it on my eye area.  It is plenty large for removing all of my makeup.  It removed my eye makeup with ease, even my mascara (haven&#x27;t tried it on waterproof mascara.)  It did not burn my eyes, but I wear contacts and I am used to many different eye drops, touching my eyes, etc so I am not very sensitive to things like that.  It tingles your skin and like another reviewer said, feels like you have just used a toner.  The tingling stuck around 2-3 minutes and I thought it felt very refreshing.  These would be great to use in summer time.  I like the price here, and the package contains a lot for the price. you could even cut them in half and still have plenty of wipe to remove your makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I keep them on my nightstand and use one every night before taking my contacts out to remove all my makeup and clean my hands before removing my contacts.  Then I apply Burt&#x27;s Bees Intense Hydration cream. My skin feels soft and smooth.  I have combination to dry skin that is acne prone, and I have issues with blackheads on my chin.  This has helped my skin stay clear.  As a mom to two, anything to simplify the bedtime routine is great!</li>
            <li> Sane ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But also: a really pleasant scent that doesn&#x27;t overwhelm of even linger for long. Refreshing to use a couple of times a day just because. Removes make up really well. Cleans thoroughly, moisturizes effectively but gently. Altogether a GREAT product.</li>
            <li> It was my first time trying this product, and I gave it an Okay rating because it felt a bit harsh on my skin. It definitely cleans and leaves the skin feeling refreshed. However, after every use, it would leave my cheeks a bit red. I believe it might have been the cucumber that would also make my skin feel tighter, firmer. Not exactly my favorite product, so choose wisely.</li>
            <li> Love this product! It&#x27;s perfect for my sensitive skin. However, I did see this buy 1 get 1 free at Ulta at a cheaper price. I would purchase this again on Amazon with 2 day shipping!</li>
            <li> If you take the yes boxes that are different cucumbers, grapefruit, blueberries etc.&lt;br /&gt;ALL OF THE INGREDIENTS ARE THE SAME!!!!!Marketing strategies by yes.</li>
            <li> I used to get the Walmart brand of makeup wipes then I came across these.  Some of the other wipes burn your eyes when you&#x27;re taking off your mascara, these don&#x27;t.  Great product!</li>
            <li> These are a great way to quickly clean and freshen your face.</li>
            <li> This was my second order of these face wipes. They still take off my makeup well but my face doesn&#x27;t feel as clean as it did with my first order.</li>
            <li> I bought these as a gift for my sister, who is a fitness instructor.  I figured they would be great to toss in her gym bag and use in between classes.  Unfortunately, they made her break out in a rash!</li>
            <li> i really enjoy these wipes. so fresh and clean feeling and smelling! Here in the heat of the desert they are a true breath of fresh air sometimes when you are out running errands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been curious about the Yes To Carrots line for awhile and one day I saw this product on sale so I grabbed them. I love how soft they are and they work great on removing make up. I have uneven skin, sometimes it dry sometimes it oily and these towels do tend to make my face oily so after I use them I will wash my face with a cleanser and that helps alot. After using them only 3 nights in a row, I noticed my skin was extreamly soft and just looked healthier! I can&#x27;t wait to try out more of the companies products!</li>
            <li> I love these towelettes for freshening up during the day and especially at the beach/pool. They smell wonderful and are gentle on my skin - as well as my three year old&#x27;s skin. I prefer using these for hands instead of santizer (sanitizer  dries my skin badly). I would not, however, recommend these for makeup removal. These are not wet enough to take off all your makeup. Oil of Olay cleanising cloths (that require you to add water to each cloth) are the better option for makeup removal.</li>
            <li> made my face dry and blotchy</li>
            <li> I got these for myself because I have sensitive skin to a point that, if I&#x27;m not wearing sun screen and I&#x27;m outside too long I&#x27;ll get a rash or if I use certain cleansers with harsh chemicals and what not I also get a rash sort thing that burns. Not only do these calm those, they don&#x27;t create them and they smell much nicer than other face wipes. They are large wipes too so you can afford to rub your face and even venture down to jaw line, neck, whatever... makes you feel super clean and nice and smell nice too. Very good for sensitive skin and still helps any break outs...</li>
            <li> Love these, I will definitely continue to buy them! Great to have when you&#x27;re on the go (especially at the gym). Only con is that they leave a sticky residue on your face. As long as you have a moisturizer to pair with, this product is awesome for removing makeup.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I need after a workout or flight. Hydrating, cleansing, and refreshing in between facial washings!</li>
            <li> I use these in the evening to remove the majority of my face makeup before washing my face. While they are quite moist, I do like to wet them with a bit of additional water from the sink to make them most effective (however I&#x27;ve done this with most facial wipes I&#x27;ve tried so it&#x27;s a personal preference). I particularly like how these have a plastic lid to help retain the moisture in the pack. The wipes smell nice and don&#x27;t cause any breakouts on my skin. Other reviews have mentioned a burning sensation but I definitely don&#x27;t get that. I will be repurchasing these.</li>
            <li> I love these make up remover wipes! They dont break me out!! Love the smell!! My favorite! Highly recommend AAAA ++++</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and I was looking for something to take off my makeup with but these wipes were not for my skin. The ingredients in these wipes made my skin burn; it was awful. I was rather disappointed because I know many people rave about these wipes and the line in general, but I will be trying something else instead.</li>
            <li> fantastic product- must have if you travel. Easy on my children&#x27;s skin and more than anything, will really leave your skin feeling refreshed and revived.</li>
            <li> Do NOT use this product!!! I have sensitive skin and I bought this product because it specifically says it is for sensitive skins and is non-irritating, and gentle. The wipes stung my face badly and left me with a horrible, red rash that has STILL not gone away 2 days after use. I went to the store and bought a different, well-known brand that I won&#x27;t name here because I&#x27;m not trying to sell anything, but it was a bit more expensive but didn&#x27;t burn my face and give me a rash. The extra couple of dollars is worth it, trust me. BEWARE.</li>
            <li> love it . removed makeup with one wipe</li>
            <li> YesTo has become my go-to brand for certain personal care items.  I am especially obsessed with YesTo facial wipes!  They smell so good, and I really feel they remove a lot of impurities from my face.  I use them in the morning and in the evening and won&#x27;t stop doing so.  I won&#x27;t use any other brand of facial wipes!  As always, Amazon offers them at a good price!</li>
            <li> These are a good quick, easy way to clean your face. They are moist enough to do a good job and feel cool and refreshing.</li>
            <li> I love these moist towlettes.  They have just the right amount of moisture to cleanly wipe the day&#x27;s grime off your face without dripping or being too dry.  They do a good job at removing just about all of my makeup.  Sometimes a trace of waterproof mascara remains.. but everything else is gone.  They leave my face feeling cool and refreshed.  They also don&#x27;t dry my face like soap does so I don&#x27;t have that icky tight feeling after using them.  They remove excess oil, but don&#x27;t dry out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is light and pleasant.. not overpowering at all.  The cloths are strong and substantial.  The click open hard cover is sturdy and well designed and definitely lasts through the entire package use.  It keeps the towlettes moist too.</li>
            <li> I love these wipes, I&#x27;ve been using them for years. The smell is nice and right before bed it feels really good and gets your skin clean. I have oily skin.</li>
            <li> Yes is so refreshing and clean!! I have such a hard time finding this product in the store, it&#x27;s so great that I could order it online when I need it!</li>
            <li> I ended up using the whole pack but I probably won&#x27;t be buying these again. So far not a fan of the Yes To brand in general. DEFINITELY don&#x27;t recommend for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Removes makeup reasonably well&lt;br /&gt;Good smell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Leaves a burning sensation on my skin for a bit after use, almost like an alcohol burn&lt;br /&gt;Have to scrub around eyes to get eye makeup off which increases burning to an uncomfortable level&lt;br /&gt;Has a weird texture, almost like a lotion-y instead of wet feel that doesn&#x27;t feel clean to the touch for me</li>
            <li> Great product love it soo much!</li>
            <li> YES ! i would highly recommend, this is my favorite product of all yes to products. you can really FEEL the difference. great for dry, oily, or acne prone skin. this is probably my favorite product on amazon.</li>
            <li> The product I received was fairly dried out even though the seal hadn&#x27;t been broken.</li>
            <li> These are fantastic. My skin is very sensitive and even when I use towelettes for sensitive skin, it still stings. Those do NOT sting! I am very happy about that and the fresh scent and efficiency to remove my make up, including mascara.</li>
            <li> Very refreshing and cleansing. You really don&#x27;t need water! It removes very well and is made with very good ingredients! On my 5th pack</li>
            <li> I purchased these as a replacement for aveeno wipes.  I needed a gentle product that doesn&#x27;t strip my face of oils since I am on accutane for acne.  These were a cheaper option but did the same job.  if they were the same cost, I&#x27;d purchase aveeno.  I prefer the scent of aveeno and the feeling of the product on my face.</li>
            <li> I read the glowing reviews and wanted to like it very very much. It was ok the first couple of wipes, feels nice but no different from other wipes. It tingled a bit, which I decided was fine....but then it stings and I can&#x27;t finish the last 2 wipes in the package because they burns! For reference, I have combination skin and lives up North so it&#x27;s sweaty/oily in the summer but dry/wind chapped and cold in the winter. &#x3D;(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do feel refreshing and does not leave my skin dry or oily after using, but the wave of burning/stinging sensation every time I use it means I will be seeking other makeup remover wipes.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin, and I am always hesistant to try new things on it. While on vacation, I found myself in need of face wipes and I couldn&#x27;t find the brand I typically use. Since these are labeled hypoallergenic, I decided to give them a try. I was pleasantly surprised! These smell very fresh and clean, and the towelettes themselves are very soft and soothing. I used these every day for 10 days of vacation, and I had no reaction at all. I was able to clean off the daily grime easily, without experiencing any redness or irritation which is awesome. I have never used this line of products before, but I have to say I was definitely impressed.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely evil.&lt;br /&gt;I have fairly normal skin.  I get the occasional zit or dry patch but other than that I never have skin issues.  I could probably scrub my face with a dish sponge and not have a red patch.  I swiped my skin with a wipe from a brand new package and immediately I felt like my face was on fire.  I patted some cold water on my cheeks to calm down the unbearable burning sensation.  I look in the mirror and it looked like I had either sat out in the sun all day long or consumed an insane amount of alcohol (Asian glow, lol).  Unreal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I generally use generic brands or Ponds make-up wipes and have always had a great experience.  I thought I&#x27;d switch to a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; product and very much regret it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually not incredibly picky about beauty products like this, because I&#x27;m really lucky to have perfect skin even into my 30s. It took the makeup off easily (foundation only) but it burned and irritated my skin. I thought I just needed to let my skin get used to it, but in a few days I had a really bad acne breakout. I never get acne. So I tossed these.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why everyone is talking about them burning?  I guess just keep in mind that different products will work for different people - what will make some people have reactions is just fine for others.  I have extremely sensitive skin - the only way I don&#x27;t break out is by using these wipes to clean my face, and the Na-PCA moisturizer. Keeps my skin clear.  Love the wipes.</li>
            <li> November 2013: UPDATE!  I have been using these everyday since February. These used to be made in Israel and now are made in Germany, as per the packaging. And the ingredients are different now. The scent is noticeably different, not fresh and no longer with a cucumber scent. They smell more chemically. I do not know if the new ingredients are better or worse for you, I just know that the listed ingredients are different than what they used to be. Since I have these on Subscribe and Save with Amazon, I will continue with the 2 month supply that I have now and see how I feel about them in a few weeks. Maybe after a while, I will get used to them. I changed from 5 stars to 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;February 2013: I use one of these each night after I wash my face in order to take my eye makeup off. These towelettes work very well.</li>
            <li> My 14 year old acne averse daughter swears by the yes to line. She uses yes to something else in the summer, this is her winter go-to.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. They smell great&lt;br /&gt;2. According to Environmental Working Group&#x27;s Skin Deep website they are low in hazardous and unhealthy ingredients&lt;br /&gt;3. They are great for getting the grime of the day off your face&lt;br /&gt;4. You don&#x27;t need to rinse unlike many other facial towelettes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1) They don&#x27;t completely remove eye makeup (but that is not my primary need for these)</li>
            <li> Super refreshing to use; it&#x27;s summer now so I put them in the fridge for a cool wipe down after the gym. They&#x27;re pretty sensitive but occasionally I feel a bit of a sting. Doesn&#x27;t dry my skin or cause breakouts, which is the most important!</li>
            <li> I love having these pads to clean my face at night so that I do not have to use water to wash my face.</li>
            <li> Caused an allergic reaction on my face, pain and redness.  I have very sensitive skin and this did not work for me.</li>
            <li> Don,t use any thing else on my face love them</li>
            <li> Wonderful clean smell! Easy to carry anywhere!</li>
            <li> These are just fantastic for your face.  The smell warms you up and makes you feel very clean.</li>
            <li> I love these. They have helped clear up my face. I love the smell. They leave my face feeling great. My skin still feels wonderful the next morning. Amazon has the best price I have found</li>
            <li> These towelettes are a staple in my bed stand drawer for those nights you just are too tired to do a the regular cleansing regime. They get all my makeup off with the exception of some stubborn eye makeup products. They are quick and disposable. I have sensitive skin but no problems using these. They are also a nice big size towelette which are also thick and soft. Thumbs up for these towelettes!</li>
