    <ol>
            <li>They arrived in great condition!</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>I get a great shave without any skin irritation.</li>
            <li>It works great.</li>
            <li>Gotta love Amazon.com!!</li>
            <li>It is a good product.</li>
            <li>Good by Norelco</li>
            <li>These new heads are great!</li>
            <li>so it is still more cost effective than blades.</li>
            <li>glad but having problems with charing</li>
            <li>WHICH WILL BE OK AS MY HUSBAND CHANGES HEADS</li>
            <li>Love the razor with the lotion ejection system built in.</li>
            <li>The latest model has a better system.</li>
            <li>Replacement blades cost more than I paid for the razor.</li>
            <li>Love the razor, but I will be damned if I am  paying $100.00+ for these blades.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I found them.</li>
            <li>Husband is a happy camper since he received his new blades.</li>
            <li>These Philips shavers are great for wet shaves after a shower with the use your own favorite shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>They give an excellent shave, razor smooth but takes time and many passes of wet shaving.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t remember if the original blades shaved better along the jaw line).</li>
            <li>The price for new blades and the razor are very good making this a good initial and ongoing value.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and maintain.  </li>
            <li>It is, however, easy to use in the shower, which speeds things up in the morning.  </li>
            <li>it makes it easy.</li>
            <li>I use the normal Nivea shaving lotion, rather than the moistorizing lotion, since it is easy to apply and is more cost effective.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the ability to shave in the shower</li>
            <li>I also didn&#x27;t know that you get the back plate shaving container piece, which was good for me since the original didn&#x27;t work anymore when I would try to fill it with the shaving conditioner.</li>
            <li>Good thing they last 1 full year (see package)</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d be lucky to get a month&#x27;s worth of shaves from a $9 bottle.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;The heads are easy to disassemble and clean and the combs get close enough to the skin that you get a baby-face smooth shave without irritation or pulling hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nothing really exciting about it.</li>
            <li>hairs must be some sort of carbon nano-tube cause they did blunt the blades in round 12 months of light use, but with the replacement all is good.</li>
            <li>Have about 3-4 units in closet not using the shaver right now</li>
            <li>The replacement set works fine, however, I was debating whether to buy this or just get a new electric razor because of the price.</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>which average ~$55.00 and are more readily available.</li>
            <li>This product was exactly as specified.</li>
            <li>When I finally got the correct model number, returned the one that I ordered first in error, I received this product and am enjoying the use of it.</li>
            <li>I bought these for and how it doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space, plus the standing charging unit is a nice addition rather than just charging this laying down somewhere.</li>
            <li>The ID for this product was really tough to find, but once it was, the product itself is great.</li>
            <li>I replaced the heads on my razor at the recommended 1 year mark, there doesn&#x27;t seem to be that much difference.  </li>
            <li>after that you can really &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;see&amp;#34; the diminishing performance.  </li>
            <li>Very pricy product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried every bladed razor imaginable from the Mach 3, Mach 3 Turbo, Mach 3 Fusion, Schick Quattro, to the other disposable units but the Norelco just does a better job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my unit for over 2 years and finally decided that I liked it well enough to invest in a new head.  </li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t get it...why the high price???does Phillips wants us to move to a newer model and make us spend and additional $200 or</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get any skin irritation with the replacement blades and my skin does feel and look smoother than with the old ones, but I do have to pass the razor a couple of times over the jaw line since it doesn&#x27;t get them the first time.</li>
            <li>You can buy a whole new razor every year at this cost.  </li>
            <li>On Amazon I got it for less with free shipping!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done this previously and was satisfied with the improved shaving.</li>
            <li>It took a couple of weeks for my beard to adjust to the new system and also for me to adapt.</li>
            <li>I called Phillips Norelco&#x27;s customer service (800-243-3050) and was informed that the reason for the price hike is more than likely due to the fact that the razor (HS 8420) is no longer being made and neither are the blades.</li>
            <li>The price was higher plus you had to pay for International shipping.</li>
            <li>It comes fully assembled, all you have to do is pull the old one out and install the new one.  </li>
            <li>The blades have worked so far.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d suggest it to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon I finally found the shaver heads I needed for my Norelco Coolskin electric razor.  </li>
            <li>I was looking to order replacement heads from Norelco directly.</li>
            <li>and I get a very close shave, very comparable to the conventional razor.</li>
            <li>The new blades are of a different design and DO NOT shave as well as the old blades.    </li>
            <li>I chafe badly on dry shaves, but with a shaving cream it really works well.</li>
            <li>Sorry that this product is not stocked by many dealers and some charge too much to use.  </li>
            <li>I generally replace the HS85 Shaving Unit every 3 months or so as recommended.</li>
            <li>I wonder why they don&#x27;t produce something that doesn&#x27;t need to be changed so frequently and at such a price, but that&#x27;s the price of the market i guess.</li>
            <li>I would not go back to the old way of shaving.</li>
            <li>I decided to go with these instead of buying a new electric razor since I really like the small size of the razor</li>

            <li> I decided to go with these instead of buying a new electric razor since I really like the small size of the razor</li>
            <li> Not much of a review, but if you have the lotion shaver, this is a good blade replacement, however, this thing is EXPENSIVE!</li>
            <li> I do find odd that my machine is now 4 years old and still &amp;#34;kicking&amp;#34; in fact, these units are still being sold at well over the $200 threshold yet</li>
            <li> felt that it didn&#x27;t give a close enough shave as a wet bladed razor.</li>
            <li> It works better and is less expensive.</li>
            <li> There is a big difference betwen this and other shaving creams when you use it with Norelco razor.</li>
            <li> After 4 months,I would never go back to a conventional shaver.</li>
            <li> Back to sharp blades!  </li>
            <li> After ordering, and after it was shipped, I found the same item at Walmart for half the price.</li>
            <li> A lot of reviews for the Norelco Nivea units have been mixed, some people complained that the heads do not have individual motors and others</li>
            <li> After buying three of the HS85 heads (over 3 years), you have spent the equivalent money of buying another electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Amazon service worked as expected.</li>
            <li> This product performs as expected.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the HS85 for the past 4 years and this is the fourth set of blades that I&#x27;m using.  </li>
            <li> The shaver itself works pretty well, but the Nivea Conditioner that&#x27;s used in it is fairly expensive.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, use in the shower seems to require even more of the expensive Nivea Conditioner (it tends to wash off, even if you take extra care not to get in the water stream).</li>
            <li> This can also be due to the design of the razor and not that these replacement blades fault.</li>
            <li> only negative aspect is the cost.</li>
            <li> Replacing the cutters once a year is enough and I have a thick beard.</li>
            <li> This time, the blades they sent are worse than the ones that are a year old.  </li>
            <li> I like this razor because of the wet/dry option and the gel lubricates my skin which means less irritation while shaving.</li>
            <li> the blades which I started buying at less than $30 are now in some cases reaching the $100 price.  </li>
            <li> I am tired of purchasing a new electric razor ever time the blades dull for my husband.</li>
            <li> I was hestitant to use an electric shaver and especially a wet shaver.</li>
            <li> The old heads lasted for over a year, I don&#x27;t know if this is a random defect or a common problem.</li>
            <li> (Packaging is excessive).</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my Norelco shaver, these worked for 1 month before the mesh that holds the cutting heads bent, and lock up the shaver completely.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for at least the past 7 years.</li>
            <li> HAD A HARD TIME FINDING THE HS85 SHAVING HEAD.</li>
            <li> I am 61 and change is hard at this age, however with the Norelco 8040.</li>
            <li> Kinda sucks these went from $30 to $100</li>
            <li> This product works as expected, nothing bad to say.</li>
            <li> Not Happy</li>
            <li> However, I find the coolskin shaving line to be the least painful method of shaving</li>
            <li> i hate hte replacement baldes are very expensive.</li>
            <li> I hate wasting money.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> i like the electric saver, i started using acidantely... i started likeing it. only thng i hate hte replacement baldes are very expensive.</li>
            <li> glad but having problems with charing</li>
            <li> Replacing the cutters once a year is enough and I have a thick beard. Use the Nivea gel lotion instead of the automatic loader. It works better and is less expensive.</li>
            <li> It is a good product.There is a big difference betwen this and other shaving creams when you use it with Norelco razor.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.  OEM replacement part.  Worked just like one that came with razor.  Nothing really exciting about it.</li>
            <li> I called Phillips Norelco&#x27;s customer service (800-243-3050) and was informed that the reason for the price hike is more than likely due to the fact that the razor (HS 8420) is no longer being made and neither are the blades. He did state that the RQ 12 blades would work with this razor however which average ~$55.00 and are more readily available.</li>
            <li> The blades have worked so far.  I replaced the heads on my razor at the recommended 1 year mark, there doesn&#x27;t seem to be that much difference.  However, I find the coolskin shaving line to be the least painful method of shaving and I&#x27;d suggest it to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The ID for this product was really tough to find, but once it was, the product itself is great. I wonder why they don&#x27;t produce something that doesn&#x27;t need to be changed so frequently and at such a price, but that&#x27;s the price of the market i guess.</li>
            <li> HAD A HARD TIME FINDING THE HS85 SHAVING HEAD. PLACED ORDER FOR 1 AND I RECEIVED TWO WHICH WILL BE OK AS MY HUSBAND CHANGES HEADS ONCE A YEAR SO HE WILL BE SET FOR NEXT YEAR.</li>
            <li> Worked as promised. Just wish Philips Norelco didn&#x27;t stop making this.</li>
            <li> This product works as expected, nothing bad to say. Love the razor with the lotion ejection system built in. Have been using it for at least the past 7 years. The latest model has a better system.</li>
            <li> A lot of reviews for the Norelco Nivea units have been mixed, some people complained that the heads do not have individual motors and others felt that it didn&#x27;t give a close enough shave as a wet bladed razor. My experience (which may differ from yours) has been that the Norelco HS85 heads provide the closest shave I have gotten since I started shaving. I&#x27;ve tried every bladed razor imaginable from the Mach 3, Mach 3 Turbo, Mach 3 Fusion, Schick Quattro, to the other disposable units but the Norelco just does a better job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heads are easy to disassemble and clean and the combs get close enough to the skin that you get a baby-face smooth shave without irritation or pulling hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative aspect is the cost. After buying three of the HS85 heads (over 3 years), you have spent the equivalent money of buying another electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Have not yet installed this product but expect it will be satisfactory and perform as Norelco products do.  Sorry that this product is not stocked by many dealers and some charge too much to use.  Amazon service worked as expected.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Easy to use and maintain.  I get a great shave without any skin irritation.</li>
            <li> I dropped my shaver and one of the heads tended to fall apart so I bought these replacement heads. They give an excellent shave, razor smooth but takes time and many passes of wet shaving. The price for new blades and the razor are very good making this a good initial and ongoing value.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, product as described...  You get the same shaving unit for a fraction of the price you would pay at a local store.</li>
            <li> Not much of a review, but if you have the lotion shaver, this is a good blade replacement, however, this thing is EXPENSIVE! That is why this one is getting 5 stars, but Norelco needs to lower the price on these. Good thing they last 1 full year (see package) so you only have to pay 30 a year. Just watch out for a box that is about 10x larger than the shaving replacement itself (Packaging is excessive).</li>
            <li> The shaver suggests a yearly update of the blades, I agree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hairs must be some sort of carbon nano-tube cause they did blunt the blades in round 12 months of light use, but with the replacement all is good.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon I finally found the shaver heads I needed for my Norelco Coolskin electric razor.  I couldn&#x27;t find the replacement heads in any store so I went online and thankfully found them here.  They arrived in great condition!</li>
            <li> My husband has had his Norelco for a year and we just had to purchase the replacement head.  It works great.</li>
            <li> I was looking to order replacement heads from Norelco directly. The price was higher plus you had to pay for International shipping. On Amazon I got it for less with free shipping! Gotta love Amazon.com!!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t afford to renew at this price.</li>
            <li> Product is as stated. After ordering, and after it was shipped, I found the same item at Walmart for half the price. I hate wasting money.</li>
            <li> I purchased relacement blades for my Norelco shaver. I&#x27;ve done this previously and was satisfied with the improved shaving. This time, the blades they sent are worse than the ones that are a year old.  The new blades are of a different design and DO NOT shave as well as the old blades.    Not Happy</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my Norelco shaver, these worked for 1 month before the mesh that holds the cutting heads bent, and lock up the shaver completely. The old heads lasted for over a year, I don&#x27;t know if this is a random defect or a common problem.</li>
            <li> Have about 3-4 units in closet not using the shaver right now</li>
            <li> I like this razor because of the wet/dry option and the gel lubricates my skin which means less irritation while shaving.</li>
            <li> My husband has used this type of razor for years, because of a skin condition that he has. He finds it fits the need that he has.</li>
            <li> This product performs as expected.  I&#x27;ve been using the HS85 for the past 4 years and this is the fourth set of blades that I&#x27;m using.  As per the instructions the life span to this blades is only a year...after that you can really &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;see&amp;#34; the diminishing performance.  I do find odd that my machine is now 4 years old and still &amp;#34;kicking&amp;#34; in fact, these units are still being sold at well over the $200 threshold yet the blades which I started buying at less than $30 are now in some cases reaching the $100 price.  I just don&#x27;t get it...why the high price???does Phillips wants us to move to a newer model and make us spend and additional $200 or what...??</li>
            <li> Very pricy product.  Replacement blades cost more than I paid for the razor.</li>
            <li> The shaver itself works pretty well, but the Nivea Conditioner that&#x27;s used in it is fairly expensive.  You&#x27;d be lucky to get a month&#x27;s worth of shaves from a $9 bottle.    I have found that the shave from this electric shaver is not as close as a regular 3 or 4 blade safety razor.  It is, however, easy to use in the shower, which speeds things up in the morning.  Unfortunately, use in the shower seems to require even more of the expensive Nivea Conditioner (it tends to wash off, even if you take extra care not to get in the water stream).</li>
            <li> Husband is a happy camper since he received his new blades.</li>
            <li> I generally replace the HS85 Shaving Unit every 3 months or so as recommended. This product was exactly as specified. It does the job quite well.</li>
            <li> When I finally got the correct model number, returned the one that I ordered first in error, I received this product and am enjoying the use of it.</li>
            <li> The replacement set works fine, however, I was debating whether to buy this or just get a new electric razor because of the price. I decided to go with these instead of buying a new electric razor since I really like the small size of the razor I bought these for and how it doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space, plus the standing charging unit is a nice addition rather than just charging this laying down somewhere. I don&#x27;t get any skin irritation with the replacement blades and my skin does feel and look smoother than with the old ones, but I do have to pass the razor a couple of times over the jaw line since it doesn&#x27;t get them the first time. This can also be due to the design of the razor and not that these replacement blades fault. (It&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve had this razor so I can&#x27;t remember if the original blades shaved better along the jaw line). I also didn&#x27;t know that you get the back plate shaving container piece, which was good for me since the original didn&#x27;t work anymore when I would try to fill it with the shaving conditioner.</li>
            <li> I received the Norelco mositorizing shaver for Christmas from my wife. I was hestitant to use an electric shaver and especially a wet shaver. After 4 months,I would never go back to a conventional shaver. I enjoy the ability to shave in the shower and I get a very close shave, very comparable to the conventional razor. It took a couple of weeks for my beard to adjust to the new system and also for me to adapt. I use the normal Nivea shaving lotion, rather than the moistorizing lotion, since it is easy to apply and is more cost effective. I would not go back to the old way of shaving. I am 61 and change is hard at this age, however with the Norelco 8040. it makes it easy.</li>
            <li> These blades are like a tuneup for your electric razor. Just like regular blades electric razors need blades need changing, you only need to do it once a year so it is still more cost effective than blades.</li>
            <li> These Philips shavers are great for wet shaves after a shower with the use your own favorite shaving cream.  I&#x27;ve had my unit for over 2 years and finally decided that I liked it well enough to invest in a new head.  It comes fully assembled, all you have to do is pull the old one out and install the new one.  Back to sharp blades!  I chafe badly on dry shaves, but with a shaving cream it really works well.</li>
            <li> Kinda sucks these went from $30 to $100</li>
            <li> Love the razor, but I will be damned if I am  paying $100.00+ for these blades.  You can buy a whole new razor every year at this cost.  Oh, I believe that&#x27;s what they want.  Good by Norelco</li>
            <li> You have to buy cream applicator as well drives price up.</li>
            <li> I am tired of purchasing a new electric razor ever time the blades dull for my husband. I did not know you could replace the heads. He never shared this with me. I&#x27;m glad I found them. These new heads are great!</li>
