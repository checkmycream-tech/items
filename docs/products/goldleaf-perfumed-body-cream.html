            <li>Love this scent, but use sparingly.</li>
            <li>more I wear this creme, the more I&#x27;m hooked.  </li>
            <li>I use it all the time and love it.</li>
            <li>I have used this product many times.</li>
            <li>Just love the yummy fragrance of Thymes Gold Leaf products.</li>
            <li>Love this soft scent and it&#x27;s a great moisturizer without being greasy.</li>
            <li>I could have taken a day to drive to fine my favorite lotion</li>
            <li>This is one of the most unique fragrances I have had and I thoroughly love it.  </li>
            <li>It is becoming my signature scent.</li>
            <li>I loved the lotion&#x27;s consistency, it is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>BUT NEVER FEELS TOO STRONG A SCENT.  </li>
            <li>The price is high, but oh it smells so good.  </li>
            <li>I first discovered Goldleaf many years ago when it was called Goldleaf and Hydrangea and have enjoyed it on and off ever since.</li>
            <li>This arrived fine no issues.</li>
            <li>It was precisely what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Fresh and sophisticated.</li>
            <li>Goldleaf was the first Thymes scent I ever tried, and it is still my favorite, although I also use others.</li>
            <li>This Item is just as great as the spray cologne and to use it for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Thankyou so much for asking I just love all the items from</li>
            <li>I really have enjoyed the Thymes Body Cream.</li>
            <li>so much just added more of this fragrance to layer.</li>
            <li>Even better, the fragrance lingered on the whole day.  </li>
            <li>So glad I can find them readily on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Clean fresh not overbearing.</li>
            <li>It smelled absolutely delightful--very feminine, clean and light.  </li>
            <li>- :) It is quite a strong fragrance, however, so I always just use the body cream, rather than body cream and cologne at the same time.    </li>
            <li>and I love the scent and how it makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not to love  - it&#x27;s amazing and the scent is long lasting.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually shop impulsively, especially when it&#x27;s a gift, but so many positive Amazon reviews and the product&#x27;s attractive packaging swayed me.</li>
            <li>It is also VERY long-lasting (again, quality product!)</li>
            <li>The packaging is so pretty you will not throw it away.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s definitely the fragrance I like most.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also discovering other Thymes products are just as nice as this one.</li>
            <li>and you only need a little for the beautiful soft smell that is a true signature smell.</li>
            <li>Most creams have alcohol and tend to dry my skin out, but I am content with the results of Thymes body cream.</li>
            <li>Amazon vendors are always prompt and reasonably priced and I have never had a problem.</li>
            <li>Hands feel so soft and the scent is fresh.</li>
            <li>I am ready to order another one, just so I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li>Makes me feel very femine.</li>
            <li>very well she won&#x27;t use anything else, has to have this.</li>
            <li>This is my second bottle of lotion and will be buying more for me and my 85 year old mother.</li>
            <li>I think this is hands down the best creme there is for a sensual smell that is also soft but last and last.</li>
            <li>It is very floral, powdery, and overall not a bad scent, just noticeably old-fashioned (I&#x27;m in my early 20s).</li>
            <li>To make sure I hadn&#x27;t made a mistake, I put a little dab on my hand when the body creme arrived.  </li>
            <li>I first found it in a little specialty gift shop in Dallas where my sister lives and was so excited to find it on Amazon for this price.</li>
            <li>The smell is divine and the body cream is rich and smoothing for this lady&#x27;s very dry hands  </li>
            <li>The scent is not too sweet or flowery, and it keeps even my dry hands moisturized.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to describe it until you use it, but you will love it.</li>
            <li>It is so soft and not drying to the skin.</li>
            <li>That is what I lobe to smell as we lay down for sweet dreams.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it especially for older women.</li>
            <li>It is subtle, as light as the way bath dusting powder smells, only Goldleaf has all-day staying power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Amazing lotion.  The only thing I use in the winter months.</li>
            <li> I like this cream&lt;br /&gt;Smells very good</li>
            <li> Gave it to my friend for Christmas and she loved it!</li>
            <li> It was precisely what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I first discovered Goldleaf many years ago when it was called Goldleaf and Hydrangea and have enjoyed it on and off ever since. It is the perfect fragrance for an \\&quot;evening out\\&quot; and is one my husband recognizes when he smells it. He calls it \\&quot;Holy Hydrangea\\&quot; - :) It is quite a strong fragrance, however, so I always just use the body cream, rather than body cream and cologne at the same time.    Amazon vendors are always prompt and reasonably priced and I have never had a problem.</li>
            <li> Bought as gift.  Appears as advertised.  Have been told it is very nice.</li>
            <li> There was some delay on getting this product but the merchant contacted me to let me know what was going on.  I can&#x27;t tell you how much I love this scent.  It is awesome.</li>
            <li> The price is high, but oh it smells so good.  I keep this luxurious lotion on my desk next to my computer.  The scent is not too sweet or flowery, and it keeps even my dry hands moisturized.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I really have enjoyed the Thymes Body Cream. It is so soft and not drying to the skin. I have an oily skin, and find that this cream does not leave my skin greasy and oily. Most creams have alcohol and tend to dry my skin out, but I am content with the results of Thymes body cream. I would recommend it especially for older women.</li>
            <li> I just got this and could not wait to try it. The packaging is absolutely gorgeous, this would make a charming gift. I loved the lotion&#x27;s consistency, it is very moisturizing. That said, the fragrance is overbearing and it almost gave me a headache. It is also VERY long-lasting (again, quality product!), so I had to wash my arms repeatedley to get it off. Even after that, the scent still lingered in my nose. It is very floral, powdery, and overall not a bad scent, just noticeably old-fashioned (I&#x27;m in my early 20s). It immediately reminded me of my dear grandma, who I can see wearing this scent, so I&#x27;ll be happy to give it to her!</li>
            <li> This is a great body cream and goes really well with the parfum.  One of my favorite scents.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this fragrance. I always get compliments when wearing it.</li>
            <li> Love this soft scent and it&#x27;s a great moisturizer without being greasy.</li>
            <li> I get so many comments on how good it smells.</li>
            <li> I could have taken a day to drive to fine my favorite lotion but instead ordered on Amazon and it&#x27;s delivered to my house. Love it!</li>
            <li> I had some of this Thymes body cream before but thought that Thymes had quit making the Goldleaf fragrance when I could not find it anywhere.  Then I checked Amazon and there it was.  The fragrance is so pleasing and it lasts all day long.  I get lots of compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> This Item is just as great as the spray cologne and to use it for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Thankyou so much for asking I just love all the items from Thymes&lt;br /&gt;Aaltje Rookmaaker (Elly(</li>
            <li> My wife won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>

            <li> I love the Thymes Goldleaf Hand Wash and Body Cream.  The smell is divine and the body cream is rich and smoothing for this lady&#x27;s very dry hands  They look luxurious in our powder room.  I prefer the body cream over the body lotion.  I wish Thymes offered more of their fragrances in body cream</li>

            <li> To me there is luxury item and you only need a little for the beautiful soft smell that is a true signature smell. I love so much just added more of this fragrance to layer. I think this is hands down the best creme there is for a sensual smell that is also soft but last and last. One bottle last a long time.Perfection!

            <li> Love them!!  It was just a little weird that 1 item was delivered &amp; then the other 3 (3) business days later.</li>
            <li> Love this scent, but use sparingly.</li>
            <li> This body cream is great smells so nice and it feels great!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually shop impulsively, especially when it&#x27;s a gift, but so many positive Amazon reviews and the product&#x27;s attractive packaging swayed me. I&#x27;ve never smelled or used Thymes products before, but still bought a bottle.  To make sure I hadn&#x27;t made a mistake, I put a little dab on my hand when the body creme arrived.  It smelled absolutely delightful--very feminine, clean and light.  Even better, the fragrance lingered on the whole day.  It didn&#x27;t take long to repurchase a bottle for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The more I wear this creme, the more I&#x27;m hooked.  The lotion is thick and moisturizing, thanks to aloe vera, honey, bee pollen and other ingredients.  But it&#x27;s definitely the fragrance I like most. It is subtle, as light as the way bath dusting powder smells, only Goldleaf has all-day staying power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both my friend and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product.  That initial impulse purchase has turned me into a repeat buyer.  I&#x27;m also discovering other Thymes products are just as nice as this one.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to love  - it&#x27;s amazing and the scent is long lasting.</li>
            <li> THIS HAS A GREAT SCENT AND STAYS WITH YOU ALL DAY BUT NEVER FEELS TOO STRONG A SCENT.  I HAVE RECEIVED NICE COMPLIMENTS WHEN WEARING THIS.</li>
            <li> Whenever I wear this people tell me how good I smell. I even had a friend say thank you now I know what I&#x27;m getting my wife for a gift. It is becoming my signature scent. Clean fresh not overbearing.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of lotion and will be buying more for me and my 85 year old mother. The scent is timeless and smells great on all ages.</li>
            <li> Wonderful!! I use it all the time and love it. Will continue to buy</li>
            <li> Goldleaf was the first Thymes scent I ever tried, and it is still my favorite, although I also use others. It&#x27;s hard to describe it until you use it, but you will love it. Fresh and sophisticated.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful .  I will continue to buy</li>
            <li> Very rich moisturizer, wonderful.</li>

            <li> I have used this product many times. i love it and the beautiful smell stays with you,  It is a five star product.</li>
            <li> I have used Thymes goldleaf products for quite some time now and I love the scent and how it makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
