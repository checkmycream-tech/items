            <li>Love the light orange fragrance and works well.</li>

            <li>I love using this moisturizer every night, and my skin is (for the first time) glowing!</li>
            <li>Good product, a little heavier lotion but still good.</li>
            <li>Not too light but not oily.</li>
            <li>Going to try to return it and get something else by Murad that is free of parabens.</li>
            <li>Loved this and the price is way cheaper than buying direct from the SPA.  </li>

            <li>received quickly.</li>
            <li>It smells fresh too.</li>
            <li>It is a nice adjunct to the Essential C day time moisture, just without the sunscreen in it.</li>
            <li>Gabe it for stars because any less wouldn&#x27;t be fair since it may just be my skin type that&#x27;s causing it.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells great and isn&#x27;t too thick as to cause breakouts at night.  </li>

            <li>Does not make your skin greasy at all, but it really hidrates.</li>
            <li>I use the whole system and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>My wife loves this stuff - and reasonable pricing</li>
            <li>and I noticed that even though I was using it with the acne line, it was too much for me.</li>

            <li>It really works for me</li>
            <li>use every day &amp; it really works.</li>

            <li>The prices were high at the salon</li>
            <li>after using it for just a few days, i really love it and would use it day or night time.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy and my face looks usually a little red in the morning, but since I have been using this my face has had a much better complexion.</li>
            <li>After a couple of months however, I developed an allergic reaction and had to discontinue my use of all Murad products.</li>

            <li> This stuff smells great and isn&#x27;t too thick as to cause breakouts at night.  I use it over a serum every night.  The orange smell is really pleasant and not overwhelming.  I would definitely recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> this creme smells like being at a spa !  its absolutely gorgeous and i love the results.  i got my free sample (at Sephora, of course) after purchasing the Active C Serum, which is really fabulous as well.  I recommend using them together and i am really happy with the results.   after using it for just a few days, i really love it and would use it day or night time.  High recommended!!</li>
            <li> Love this. Smells good and not oily.</li>
            <li> My skin loves, loves, loves this. It drinks it up. I alternate it with the Active Radiance Serum - one or the other goes on almost every night before bed. My skin has become super smooth, and makeup goes on a lot more nicely.</li>
            <li> Nice feel, a little heavy for my taste and there was an adjustment period where my skin broke out, but just as I was going to give up on it it passed.  Murray products are a great value.</li>
            <li> Love Murad! Great Price!</li>
            <li> love all the products</li>
            <li> Great! Does not make your skin greasy at all, but it really hidrates.</li>
            <li> great price, beat anyone elses. received quickly. would purchase from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Love it!!!  Wish it was more affordable and in larger contanier but it works.</li>
            <li> My order was for murad SPF 15 essential c eye cream, 2 oz&lt;br /&gt;I received .05 oz bottle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frustrated and cheated</li>
            <li> I used several Murad products for a few months, and at first I really liked them. After a couple of months however, I developed an allergic reaction and had to discontinue my use of all Murad products.</li>
            <li> Love the night cream. Feels good on my skin.</li>
            <li> This  product works well with the toner, I use the day and the night moisturizer and am very happy with them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright. I&#x27;m a bigger fan of the day moisture though. It&#x27;s just lighter and feels better on my skin</li>
            <li> I just started using this line and after a week I notice an improvement on my skin.  I use the whole system and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I am a frequent buying of this night cream. Absolutely amazing product. Great on blemish prone skin. Nice citrus fragrance. Not too light but not oily.</li>
            <li> Great product and seller. !</li>
            <li> I ordered this product foe the first time about a month ago.  This product is amazing. I am over 40 and live in the desert, and everything gets very dry, sun exposure is unavoidable.  After about a week of using this night cream, I noticed my skin becoming brighter and softer.  I suffer from malasma and I am very picky about the products I use and this cream is not harsh or irritating to my  hyper pigmentation. I love the fresh citrus smell, and slight tingle on my skin when first applied.  I would and have recommend this product to family and friends</li>
            <li> Loved this and the price is way cheaper than buying direct from the SPA.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff - and reasonable pricing</li>
            <li> I am sure this is a great product for some, but please do not use this if you have oily/breakout prone skin. I do and I noticed that even though I was using it with the acne line, it was too much for me. Going to try to return it and get something else by Murad that is free of parabens. Gabe it for stars because any less wouldn&#x27;t be fair since it may just be my skin type that&#x27;s causing it.</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin soft and moisturized. Love the citrus smell and creaminess of the lotion. Amazon is thirty dollars cheaper than Sephora.</li>
            <li> I love how this makes my face feel before bed. It doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling too oily/moisturized. It has the perfect balance. It smells fresh too.</li>
            <li> Perfect! Fast shipping and perfect product!!</li>
            <li> I love this face cream.  I wear it in the morning and at night . Keeps my skin in great shape, love the soft scent and the vitamin c.  I also use it on my neck because I&#x27;m starting to see skin changes there.</li>
            <li> Product is awesome. Just be careful you order from trusted sellers.</li>
            <li> Favorite face ceam. Love the light orange fragrance and works well. Only drawback is price for size. Doesn&#x27;t last long but still great product. Excellent  outdoor protection and use the whole line. I get lots of compliments on skin.</li>
            <li> It really works for me.  I have very dry sensitive skin and it makes my skin soft.  Glad with my purchase.</li>
            <li> After one night of use my sensitive skin broke out with pimples everywhere. And it smells like straight sage.</li>
            <li> I got started on the Murad line after a consultation with an esthetician. I love all of their products. This moisturizer is lightweight, smells great, and leaves my skin feeling refreshed. It is a nice adjunct to the Essential C day time moisture, just without the sunscreen in it. Would recommend trying this line! In store sales have a satisfaction guarantee, so if you use the product and don&#x27;t like it, you can bring it back for a full refund no matter how much you&#x27;ve used. Not sure if that applies to online purchases. Might be worth trying a sample size first as these are fairly pricey products.</li>
            <li> Great product from Murad. I love the Vitamin C effects of this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I had a facial at massage envy and these are the products they used. The prices were high at the salon so I looked on Amazon. Oh course the prices were better!&lt;br /&gt;I have used clinique for years and am now a murad user.</li>
            <li> I have the day cream and it smells a lot nicer than the night cream. I wont buy again.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer!  It really works for me - keeps my skin moist and seems to be tightening my skin.</li>
            <li> Great product! Use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer .  Only need a small amount to moisturizer entire face. In the morning my face is hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li> use every day &amp; it really works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s and love the murad essential-c line. it moisturizes and helps fade any discolorations without being greasy.  it&#x27;s a great line, you should try it!</li>
            <li> I like this product, I use it at night. Smells really good, wish it was a larger size for the money.</li>
            <li> This stuff is better then I thought it would be. It&#x27;s not greasy and my face looks usually a little red in the morning, but since I have been using this my face has had a much better complexion.</li>
            <li> Great products.  Moisturizes without leaving my face greasy.</li>
            <li> Moisturizer that adds vitamins to the skin for brightening and refreshing!  I love using this moisturizer every night, and my skin is (for the first time) glowing!</li>
            <li> Good product, a little heavier lotion but still good. I use it for a night time moisturizer, works well, doesn&#x27;t cause break outs. Murad makes a good product so I like everything they make.</li>
            <li> great smell and love the way it makes my skin feel when I put it on and when I wake up in the morning.</li>
            <li> Texas winter weather is about as unpredictable as my skin. Humid one day, dry and cold the next. This moisturizer is good at keeping my skin hydrated without being greasy or oily. It&#x27;s a good weight and absorbs quickly. I use it with other Murad products.</li>
            <li> I switched up from using the renewal night cream.  I like this very much - it is very moisturing</li>
