            <li> It was really easy to cut and style but the color was a little to dark and it was kinda shiny.</li>
            <li> it was oddly flat and the bangs were waaaay long</li>

            <li> Maybe I can find a use for Halloween if it lasts that long.  </li>
            <li> (ordered the dark pink wig) Sheds quite a bit, but you don&#x27;t see any difference in the actual wig (no gaps).  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not very hot at all.</li>
            <li> I think the wig stand in the picture probably has a very short small head making the wig appear longer than it is.</li>
            <li> The bangs and hair were a little shorter than I expected.</li>
            <li> not your typical costume wig....</li>
            <li> little oily/heavy with some sort of smoothing product when I got it,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey if you&#x27;re just using it for a one-time halloween costume.</li>
            <li> I did have my hair stylist trim the bangs, they were a little wonky.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t anything flawed with this wig.</li>

            <li> Nice wig, pretty good quality. Works for the costume I needed it for.</li>
            <li> Got here in 3 days! I love this wig! Looks just like the picture!</li>
            <li> This wig fit really great, the fibers were really soft. It was really easy to cut and style but the color was a little to dark and it was kinda shiny. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend if yo were taking pictures with flash but i would buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought the hot pink one for a breast cancer walk I was participating in with my mom. Everyone loved it on me, and said they wished it was my actual hair and not a wig. Great quality. The bangs are super cute, and give it a more realistic look.</li>
            <li> BEST WIG EVER. I have the hot pink wig. People think it&#x27;s my real hair all the time. Wears/breathes very well, it&#x27;s not very hot at all.I did have my hair stylist trim the bangs, they were a little wonky. Brush it before you wear it, and it will look brand new every time.</li>
            <li> Looks great, especially for the price. I was able to flat iron it with no problem, although I did use the low setting just in case. Wore it to Pride SF and waiting for another excuse to wear it again.</li>
            <li> Love this product, only problem is it sheds at first. But everyone who saw me in it loved it. Definitely will purchase in another color</li>
            <li> wore these out for my bachelorette party. they sure do bring attention! I had the hot pink one. This is one of the best wigs I&#x27;ve ever seen in my life. NO KNOTS! It&#x27;s almost unbelievable how soft and smooth it is and stayed all night. not your typical costume wig.... It feels real. would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> The wig is cute and probably looks good on someone younger, like a child, or someone very skinny. The bangs and hair were a little shorter than I expected. I think the wig stand in the picture probably has a very short small head making the wig appear longer than it is. It was a very short bob… I also did not think the wig was as bright as in the photo. but I am not criticizing, just explaining. The wig did not look good on my face, it was a short bob and not a long bob. but it may look good on someone&#x27;s face that is slimmer than mine that looks good with short bangs… Thank you for super fast shipping btw!!!</li>
            <li> I got sooo many compliments on this wig. I bought it for a girls night out. It had a flip to it but was so comfortable and looked awesome!</li>
            <li> I love this wig! It is very soft and great quality for the price! S&amp;h was fast and appropriately packaged!</li>
            <li> Loved the color..cute wig for Halloween</li>
            <li> I love this wig! It was not too hot under it. Being able to adjust it made it all the better fit!</li>
            <li> seriously surprised at how amazing this wig is for the price! I&#x27;m a hairstylist and bought this for a costume party and I was able to completely rework and cut the wig like it was real hair. little oily/heavy with some sort of smoothing product when I got it, but I ran some baby powder through it and it&#x27;s perfect now!</li>
            <li> Just didn&#x27;t look great, was still alright for a night or two but not something I could wear more than that.</li>
            <li> I bought hot pink for a trip I went on for to Jamaica! I must say this wig served it&#x27;s purpose and everyone feel in love with my look I was driving for the night! All eyes were definitely on me.  There isn&#x27;t anything flawed with this wig. If you want to look fabulous and stand out, I&#x27;d suggest you go with this company. The quality is flawless and beautiful....</li>
            <li> Great wig! Got so many compliments!</li>
            <li> It was for my girlfriend but she enjoyed it</li>
            <li> it was oddly flat and the bangs were waaaay long but the wig was soft and i actually was able to tease it for volume!</li>
            <li> OMGosh, the girls had a blast with this wig!!  High quality and I will order more for their parties.....</li>
            <li> Good wig for the price if you&#x27;re planning to wear this out (not just for a cheap costume). It&#x27;s a little pricey if you&#x27;re just using it for a one-time halloween costume. Hair is pretty soft and full, not stringy like most cheap wigs. I got lots of compliments and requests to borrow it.</li>
            <li> Recap - Lady Gaga row 4.  Lasted for the whole show.  Maybe I can find a use for Halloween if it lasts that long.  For now, the wig served its purpose perfectly.  Enjoy.</li>
            <li> These are very nice wigs; very well made and easy to care for. Already have the blue and the write.&lt;br /&gt;Looking to buy at least one more. &#x3D;D</li>
            <li> Bought this for a birthday party.  Was very pleased.  The wig is very soft, and the color/ cut/style is just as pictured.  (ordered the dark pink wig) Sheds quite a bit, but you don&#x27;t see any difference in the actual wig (no gaps).  The bangs are long, but I didn&#x27;t mind, loved wearing it.  Would definitely buy another one.</li>
            <li> could have had more hair</li>
            <li> Looks really nice on, high quality - don&#x27;t bother with drugstore or department store halloween wigs. This one is soooo much better - it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Actually holds up pretty well for the price. I am impressed for a cheap wig.</li>
