            <li>Definitely worth buying for you nail designers.</li>
            <li>with just the right shine I was looking for.</li>
            <li>just as described great quality a must buy for someone looking for these small stones</li>
            <li>Not the exact count of 600 - other then that i was very pleased .</li>
            <li>So pretty.</li>
            <li>product is what it says, pretty</li>
            <li>and it look hot on</li>
            <li>The package was delivered days before the first of the estimated delivery days.</li>
            <li>came in multiple baggies, easy to count, there were in fact 600.</li>
            <li>these shine for a minute but it fades away and looks super uglydo not wasted your money</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very iridescent and jazz up any craft or nail project.  </li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>it looks get when you cover the whole nail in them</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t really look like what&#x27;s pictured.</li>
            <li>then maybe a better review if there are 600pc because that is what I paid for and expected to get.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping,got mine today,,,its</li>
            <li>, look like real crystals.</li>
            <li>However there where not 600 in the bag I contacted them and they fixed te issue right away.</li>
            <li>maybe a little bit more.</li>
            <li>Loved them their very small but look just like pic!</li>
            <li>Because they were a little smaller then expected , but besides that they r nice and pretty , thank u !!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m new to this</li>
            <li>I expected these to have more defined ridges as to actually imitate a diamond.</li>
            <li>I chose that rating because I wasn&#x27;t satisfied with the size I thought they were way to small ...</li>
            <li>These are clear like glass.</li>
            <li>but you can&#x27;t put a clear coat on them</li>
            <li>No where near the advertised amount.</li>
            <li>Had it looked at by professional and they are not crystal.</li>
            <li>However, they&#x27;re smaller and not the same exact color either</li>
            <li>They came two days before expected and looked exactly as they did in the picture.</li>

            <li> Have big black flat backs.. Would not order this particular product again</li>
            <li> these dont dull, which is the reason i bought them, for shiny sparkly nails, thanks!</li>
            <li> It came earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> i counted every single one.</li>
            <li> They are small and they last a while depending on how often you use them.</li>
            <li> not sure however, I definitely recommend these to anyone.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not a fan of the black backing of the stone...</li>
            <li> Not original Swarovski crystals</li>
            <li> The rhinestones are a little closer to 2mm rather than 3mm.</li>
            <li> I ordered a few types of stones from this seller and none of them were the amount they were suppose to be...</li>
            <li> within a few days.</li>
            <li> The small crystals shines like a Swarovski crystal.</li>
            <li> There are six small baggies</li>
            <li> Sad with how small they are,I thought they were going to be bigger.</li>
            <li> it dries dull</li>
            <li> Not really brilliant</li>
            <li> Not too bad doesn&#x27;t shine insanely to me</li>
            <li> The worst!</li>

            <li> Item came on time. It&#x27;s the same like on the picture and I really like it. All of them are the same size</li>
            <li> Faster shipping and the product was like the picture, I buy it for my baby shower invitations and I love it.......,,.........,,,, :)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think there was 600 but was nice</li>
            <li> I love these I would deff buy again also it looks get when you cover the whole nail in them</li>
            <li> Not original Swarovski crystals 👎👎</li>
            <li> Great deal, all there and high quality, plus fast shipping, arrived early! A definite must for nail enthusiasts!</li>
            <li> not shiny it dries dull</li>
            <li> I chose that rating because I wasn&#x27;t satisfied with the size I thought they were way to small ...I figured 3mm seemed big but I&#x27;m new to this and now I know they weren&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Very Shiny , Pretty i Love Them!! i will recommend them ! they are perfect for nails i used them for acrylics</li>
            <li> Love these!! They do Not get dull when placed with glue on your item, sizing was perfect and accurate. However there where not 600 in the bag I contacted them and they fixed te issue right away. Now I just wish they carries bigger bag of rhinestones. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I received my order within 2 days! !  I love the way they look! I&#x27;m getting a lot of compliments!  Will definitely order again!!</li>
            <li> came in multiple baggies, easy to count, there were in fact 600. these dont dull, which is the reason i bought them, for shiny sparkly nails, thanks!</li>
            <li> The rhinestones are a little closer to 2mm rather than 3mm. But I guess I should have looked more closely at the pictures!! lol I ordered these to do nail art and tried them out. They are kinda plastic looking, (and they are made of plastic lol) but still look very shiny and sparkly. Overall, good for the price. :)</li>
            <li> It might just be me but the stones I received don&#x27;t really look like what&#x27;s pictured. The ones I received look very smaller in size</li>
            <li> I kind off like it cuz it comes a lot of rhinestones but it comes the shine away when you put glue on top of it</li>
            <li> I ordered a few types of stones from this seller and none of them were the amount they were suppose to be...I contacted them and I am waiting on a response to see if they will rectify their mistake... Not really brilliant and I&#x27;m not a fan of the black backing of the stone...the only good thing is the size.😕</li>
            <li> The small crystals shines like a Swarovski crystal. I use these on nail designs and their shine lasts unlike some cheap crystals. Definitely worth buying for you nail designers.</li>
            <li> Not the exact count of 600 - other then that i was very pleased .</li>
            <li> Very impressed by these rhinestones :) they aren&#x27;t your plain every day silver stones, they have more color to them and are great quality, and the price was a great deal, thanks!</li>
            <li> Product was great &amp; fast delivery! Will order again! Thank you!</li>
            <li> They are just as pretty as they are in the picture, maybe even more so. There are six small baggies and i assume each contains 100. The package was delivered days before the first of the estimated delivery days. I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Package came very quickly... within a few days. But does not look like 600pc. I could be mistaking though. I will be counting them.. then maybe a better review if there are 600pc because that is what I paid for and expected to get.</li>
            <li> Loved them their very small but look just like pic!</li>
            <li> The worst! Not shine! Not Quality at all!</li>
            <li> I LOVE these ab rounds their super shiny &amp; great for my acrylic nail art. I compared them to the swarovski nd dnt differ to much from eachother for those who say they look cheap the defiantly dont. I will be keep buying this product, I finally found good crystals for a good price and added bonus that it ships super fast!!!</li>
            <li> i thought it is not 600 when i open the envelop but it was about 700! maybe a little bit more. i counted every single one. i stopped count it after 600. BUT! it was smaller than 3mm. its like 1.8mm. i guess thats why they send me more than 300. but i give 4 stars because it is still cute.</li>
            <li> I purchased as part of a Xmas gift. Based of what I can tell through the packaging, the product is as described. I&#x27;m Satisfied!</li>
            <li> Sad with how small they are,I thought they were going to be bigger.</li>
            <li> These are so gorgeous! I&#x27;m in love withuth how sparkly they are. Definitely will be ordering these again!</li>
            <li> Not too bad doesn&#x27;t shine insanely to me</li>
            <li> I actually thought they were a lil bigger. But overall I loved them and thank again for packaging it nicely.</li>
            <li> Very cute, they catch the light well.  Neat packaging,  6 separate packages of 100 each.</li>
            <li> I did not get any butterflies</li>
            <li> Did not like the product . Had it looked at by professional and they are not crystal. Have big black flat backs.. Would not order this particular product again</li>
            <li> I just got them today. It came earlier than expected. However, they&#x27;re smaller and not the same exact color either but I still love them ! I can wait to glue them to my nails ... bling bling lol .</li>
            <li> These were perfect for my crafts and so very beautiful, I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> these are perfect! with just the right shine I was looking for. I use these for my nail art and they don&#x27;t fog up on me when I add the top coat. I think it depends on the top coat you use? not sure however, I definitely recommend these to anyone.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping,got mine today,,,its really nice and shiny...will order again. Thank u for giving me a copy of my purchase.</li>
