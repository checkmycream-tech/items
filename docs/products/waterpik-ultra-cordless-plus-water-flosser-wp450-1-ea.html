            <li>For the price I think this item is great!</li>
            <li>Absolutely wonderful product.  </li>
            <li>Since it uses NiCad batteries, it&#x27;s best to drain the batteries before recharging.</li>
            <li>It was an excellent recommendation!  </li>
            <li>Even just using water makes your teeth feel great!</li>

            <li>A slimmer model would be ideal for traveling use.</li>
            <li>And all, at good price!  </li>
            <li>I bought in KOREA, delivered in good condition!</li>

            <li>As a test, I&#x27;ve used dental floss after the Waterpik to see how good it does, and I&#x27;ve been impressed.  </li>
            <li>This waterpik is good and perfect for travel.</li>

            <li>and she loves it, so great job.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;v had this for over a year, and it works great.</li>
            <li>They send out form letters and convince themselves that it is a great product because of all of the focus groups or the person sending out the letters just sends out letters and no one listens to them....</li>
            <li>This is a great product, portable,easy to hold and carry while travelling.</li>
            <li>and she has great hearing**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>I agree with the front page review that this is a great product, however I don&#x27;t agree with everything he said (the arrows indicate my comments):    </li>
            <li>and she has great hearing</li>
            <li>This item is great.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Even if the Waterpik does a great job on teeth, I am reluctant to use it.</li>
            <li>but the fact is the water pik works great.</li>
            <li>, the waterpik works great</li>
            <li>The cordless works great when you travel.</li>
            <li>This machine is great for cleaning your teeth between brushing.  </li>
            <li>Got this on the advice of the dentist and recommendations of the reviews for this product and it works GREAT.  </li>
            <li>but I use this twice a day, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>Its features are great.</li>
            <li>and I can recommend this product as something that will make you happy when you go in for cleanings.</li>
            <li>Great as a water pistol</li>
            <li>So any product that will step in for flossing part of the time is a great thing.</li>
            <li>Just returned from a trip and it worked great.</li>
            <li>I AM HAPPY WITH THE WATERPIC CORDLESS WATERFLOSSER.  </li>
            <li>itself works great, by the way.</li>
            <li>It worked great for about six months, then quit.  </li>
            <li>It works great for me.  </li>
            <li>Great unit for pressures and portability.  </li>
            <li>Great price for a great product.  </li>
            <li>During it&#x27;s life it worked great.  </li>
            <li>It was great for getting between teeth.  </li>
            <li>Great price.  </li>
            <li>The idea is great</li>
            <li>For a product pitched as being a great product for someone with orthodontics they didn&#x27;t think that through.</li>
            <li>, it is not the rechargeable one, but, I am happy with the solution.  </li>
            <li>I already own a HydroFloss Irrigator, a high-end machine with a lot of power which cleans under your gums and is excellent for preventing gum disease.  </li>
            <li>The pressure is Great.</li>
            <li>plus, the water pressure isn&#x27;t all that great.</li>

            <li>Great product my husband loved</li>
            <li>It works great, charge lasts a good while</li>
            <li>This Waterflosser is great and because of my using it I got a good report from my Dentist.  </li>
            <li>Waterpikin&#x27; as we call it, is the best thing to keep you mouth and gums healthy.</li>
            <li>OK but returned for a WP100 whick works great!</li>
            <li>The price was good and the service was great.  </li>
            <li>unit has appropriate power and a wonderful battery life.</li>
            <li>Thrilled with my purchase!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I&#x27;m still happy I made this purchase though, and hope to get good feedback from my dentist.</li>
            <li>Works good, very effective and conveniently portable.</li>
            <li>It is well-balanced and pleasant to hold and use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It turns out that this device is pleasant to use.  </li>
            <li>Excellent tool to clean gum line!</li>
            <li>He has been very happy with it and credits it with improving his gums.&lt;br /&gt;However, the ability to charge the battery is deteriorating -- must now charge every 2 days, and even that is becoming unreliable.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, works great!  </li>
            <li>Its easy for him to use and is still working flawlessly.</li>
            <li>Waterpik is my new best friend &lt;3</li>
            <li>Very good result, much much better than flossing.</li>
            <li>It was a very good decision and my gums feel healthy and well</li>
            <li>so its very easy to carry on the road with you and maintain your dental health !</li>
            <li>Great, amazing to see what toothbrush misses</li>
            <li>good,.</li>
            <li>Good stuff</li>
            <li>Gave it a  4 because it&#x27;s a good product.  </li>
            <li>The WP-450 is good quality except for the battery and the WP-360/365 is junk.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really good product.</li>
            <li>It is good looking</li>
            <li>Because of my good experience with the 350W, and because the WP-450 is rechargeable, I was inclined to prefer it over the Panasonic Oral Irrigator EW-DJ10-A.    </li>
            <li>outstanding product at an incredible price.</li>
            <li>While unit has a good waterproofing gasket where it disassembled in two parts the charging outlet is not waterproof at all, just has nothing to prevent water coming in.</li>
            <li>My model shoots a good stream of water and cleans around my braces.  </li>
            <li>Size wise</li>
            <li>It makes your mouth feel really good.</li>
            <li>and I loved it.  </li>
            <li>The Dentist said my teeth and gum are looking good.    </li>
            <li>Its fairly portable for traveling, packing.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll need to fill it four times to do a good job.</li>
            <li>Although it is definitely surprisingly bulky, it has to be (I couldn&#x27;t tolerate it if I had to refill 8 times).    </li>
            <li>Your unit must have an insanely good battery.</li>
            <li>When it was working, it performed fairly well.</li>
            <li>I took really good care of my Waterpik, and it still died in two months.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Also it does a good job of cleaning my teeth.  </li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t one thing good about this product.  </li>
            <li>It has good pressure and once you charge it you can use it for quite sometime before recharging.  </li>
            <li>Good item.  </li>
            <li>No, but it goes well with flossing or is a good stand-in.</li>
            <li>It is a good product.</li>
            <li>The unit cleans all the particles away from your teeth and feels good on the gums.</li>
            <li>The portable unit requires two fill ups to do a good job</li>
            <li>and it holds a charge for a good week.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>In addition, it feels sooo good while you&#x27;re doing it.</li>
            <li>Good for travel.</li>
            <li>Some good and some not so good.  </li>
            <li>I was told by someone that had their Waterpik die and replaced by Waterpik that you MUST keep it plugged in ALL the time to keep the charge good.    </li>
            <li>I would NEVER go a day without one, it&#x27;s that good for braces.</li>
            <li>They are good and always extract food particles even after a good brushing.</li>
            <li>The water pressure is good.  </li>
            <li>For travel, the Panasonic is good.</li>
            <li>The rechargable battery holds a good charge and has lasted almost a month; they recommend a weekly recharge for max performance.</li>
            <li>product at a good value.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this product for a year and absolutely loved it.  </li>
            <li>I loved the idea about it being cordless</li>
            <li>but it is a good</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It exerts a good deal of pressure</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband and he loved how it works.  </li>
            <li>I find that I have to refill the tank 2 times for a good cleaning.</li>
            <li>I was told that my gums looked good, and required no treatment.</li>
            <li>it is a good thing though.</li>
            <li>It feels so good that my mouth and teeth are cleaned.</li>
            <li>but it did a good job.</li>
            <li>Feels good at the gum line.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a really good product</li>
            <li>Does not do as good a job and removing debris between teeth either (in our opinion).</li>
            <li>(So the Waterpik paid for itself with that good news!!!)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really good product.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Loved the product when I got, however it broke within two months of purchase.  </li>
            <li>Price was good.  </li>
            <li>Quality seems good so far.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works good though and price was good.</li>
            <li>This is the best Water Pik cordless and eay to use, light to handle.</li>
            <li>this product for good hygiene.</li>
            <li>I feel good about them backing their product  like this.</li>
            <li>I feel good about them backing their product  like this.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem a good cost to use ratio.  </li>
            <li>It did do a good job for the year it worked correctly.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Water reservoir is a good size.</li>
            <li>It is good for travel although a bit bulky, but it is not a replacement for your plug in sink-top Water Pik.</li>
            <li>Keep up the good work Waterpik.</li>
            <li>I had never thought that waterpiks were what good</li>
            <li>The water also feels good on my teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li>I guess they give a good warranty</li>
            <li>Good Product..</li>
            <li>It was good.</li>
            <li>Power and battery are good.</li>
            <li>Produce arrived on time and in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Adjustible water pressure settings are also good for people with sensative gums.  </li>
            <li>Battery life is good.  </li>
            <li>It also makes my gums feel so good.</li>
            <li>does not contain a lot of water, but is a good waterpik.</li>
            <li>at the price point i think this is really a good product.</li>
            <li>, i think this would be a good start to try out.</li>
            <li>Intially I loved it.  </li>
            <li>The water pressure was good and I loved the additional attachments.  </li>
            <li>I need to travel,my mouth fill and really good, good product,</li>
            <li>Construction quality seems good, with quality plastics.  </li>
            <li>Good convenient product.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s all I can say good about it.</li>
            <li>/&gt; &amp;#62; value good price</li>
            <li>I am hoping it is all good.  </li>
            <li>A nice arrangement for a profit-hungry corporation, but not so great for the consumer.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s also good in my book.    </li>
            <li>Fair warning:  </li>
            <li>I thought this product would be good for cleaning my teeth</li>
            <li>It does a good job cleaning between teeth at the gum line.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do as good as a job as flossing.</li>
            <li>My husband loved it.</li>
            <li>but it didnt was a good idea.</li>
            <li>(good battery storage</li>
            <li>… you can get a good shot between every tooth, inside and out and</li>
            <li>It does a good job helping me care for my gum-line pockets; however, it is dificult to fill the tank without spillage and the discharge runs off the tank and gets everywhere.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After about a month of use, it seems to be consistently good for about 2 dozen or so uses between charges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is good for on the go</li>
            <li>I purchased Waterpik for me and my wife as it seemed to be a good deal.</li>
            <li>Cordless water flosser good to travel</li>
            <li>Not so good for every day.</li>

            <li>lacked information 110 or 220v quality product, Another difficulty is always to supply the refill, good for day-to-day, I recommend</li>
            <li>Works really good.. Helps and replace flossing</li>
            <li>I wanted to see how good this waterpik was, so I started using it every day.</li>
            <li>With the cost of dental treatments fifty bucks is a good investment.</li>
            <li>I use it 2 times a day and the battery charge lasts me a good 10 days.</li>
            <li>THIS ITEM WORKS FAIRLY WELL.  </li>
            <li>I used a peroxide based mouth wash with water and had good result.  </li>
            <li>I have to refill it three times to get through a good cleaning.  </li>
            <li>Good news.</li>
            <li>I loved this when it worked.</li>
            <li>Good price and reliable Amazon delivery.</li>
            <li>I now get good reviews when I go for my six-month dental checkup...</li>
            <li>NOW AFTER A YEAR I FIND THAT A 24 HOUR CHARGE IS INSUFFICIENT FOR EVEN ONE GOOD USE.</li>
            <li>All the parts clicked and fit perfectly, and it comes with four &amp;#34;nozzles&amp;#34; or attachments, just like advertised in the photos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As the instructions say, just move along the gum line at a 90 degree kind of angle, and yes indeed, it does a GREAT job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>good value good product</li>
            <li>Water resevoir holds good amount, occasionlly fill it twice.</li>
            <li>And fair warning...</li>
            <li>This was a good investment.</li>
            <li>Works great and effective.</li>
            <li>So for people like me, this is a good</li>
            <li>Product performs well, sleek, sturdy, and holds a good charge.  </li>
            <li>Good value for the money.  </li>
            <li>it is a good product however.</li>
            <li>i purchased primarily for travel and is excellent for that purpose.  </li>
            <li>Works just as good as my full-size Waterpik (countertop).  </li>
            <li>Good product for a cordless device.  </li>
            <li>It seems to do a good job on my teeth.</li>
            <li>It does almost as good a job as the Hydrofloss.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my mother who loved it.</li>
            <li>The unit is attractive looking and fits nicely in the hand, but that&#x27;s the end of the good news.</li>
            <li>The jet is concentrated and penetratiing, giving a perfect clean and aeration, as well as gum health maintenance and preservation.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and great product for the price.  </li>
            <li>This is a great item since I never floss, it&#x27;s also very easy to use.</li>
            <li>The battery life is great (1-2 weeks per charge using a couple times a day), it&#x27;s fairly easy to use and does a great job at what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li>For me, the reservoir holds the perfect amount of water needed for a full mouth cleaning.  </li>
            <li>but with the investment I&#x27;m making, I want to make sure I have beautiful teeth when the braces come off.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with this product.</li>

            <li>I absolutely love this!  </li>
            <li>it gets the teeth clean, it does I good job!</li>
            <li>, Waterpik is a more pleasant experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is a great product and easy to use.</li>
            <li>So easy to use and works great.</li>
            <li>Just what I needed, easy to handle and works great</li>
            <li>The battery life lasts about a week which is great, but the water runs out very quickly.  </li>
            <li>I have one for each house , this s a great product  easy to use and does its job.</li>
            <li>This is a great water flosser and easy to travel with.</li>
            <li>Does a great job, easy to use</li>
            <li>Much more effective and pleasant to use than the Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Very handy, easy to use.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li>How amazing it makes her mouth feel.</li>
            <li>Plus they have an amazing customer service to boot.</li>
            <li>Really amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing what it can do for cleaning your teeth, even after you worked with an electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>It has made amazing difference in my gums withing 3 minths.  </li>
            <li>This is amazing.  </li>
            <li>It is amazing what flossing misses or can&#x27;t get too.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing the power that has this water jet.</li>
            <li>It has made an amazing difference in my health.</li>
            <li>Thought I would try the portable one, but it is not as effective as the non-portable version.</li>
            <li>so it fits on a sink and the portability feature is nice for trips.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>Need to have a pitcher handy to fill it.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m over 61 with my own teeth).</li>
            <li>I think this is a good machine when it is working correctly but better sealing against water and debris</li>
            <li>I believe this would be nice to have, but I just carry it in a zip-lock bag.</li>
            <li>tidy.  </li>
            <li>I bought this model of WaterPik because it appeared to be  a handy, self-contained,  compact unit.</li>
            <li>A friend of mine who is a dental hygienist, recommended this to me when I asked her what kind of a waterpik to get.</li>
            <li>That, of course, was my own fault.  </li>
            <li>I have own the Waterpik WP-360W.</li>
            <li>that just got braces and she liked using it.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.  </li>
            <li>To be honest, the first-time use  takes some trial and error.</li>
            <li>This charges nicely and holds a charge well too.</li>
            <li>- This unit is much quieter, but any water pump will make some noise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reservoir - The size of reservoir is perfect for me.</li>
            <li>If I need more for a really good job, it takes a couple seconds to refill.</li>
            <li>Thanks to the excellent customer service at Amazon</li>
            <li>Use warm water for comfort.  </li>
            <li>I can honestly say the nylon string dental floss never inspired me.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t engineers or sales people EVER use their own products?</li>
            <li>The Waterpic Ultra is well made and the size makes it handy for use while travelling.  </li>
            <li>It took just a bit of getting used to, but I liked the way it got under my bridgework and around my one implant.</li>
            <li>but I wanted something portable, a \\&quot;no-muss, no-fuss\\&quot; kind of instrument for when I didn&#x27;t have time for the HydroFloss.  </li>
            <li>I liked the pressure etc</li>
            <li>Four tips to handle all needs included is a nice bonus.  </li>
            <li>kind of a pain to use.  </li>
            <li>It is effective and works well with diluted listerine.  </li>
            <li>My dentist recommended I buy a water pik since I have difficulty with dental floss catching and shredding under bridgework.</li>
            <li>It is a handy device, but lacking pressure.</li>
            <li>I have never used a Water Pik of any kind before buying this product.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s 4 nozzles that you can use, each seems to have their own</li>
            <li>Great product at great price, Fast shipping .</li>
            <li>My dentist is thrilled with my checkups.</li>
            <li>The price was more than fair.</li>
            <li>Well, Waterpick cordless is quite handy and you do not depend on cord</li>
            <li>and i liked the slim design of theone</li>
            <li>I needed something for travel and this unit does a nice job.  </li>
            <li>I own this model and I like how it cleans.</li>
            <li>but I do not feel that this is any kind of an inconvenience.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s handy when I want to use a water pic and not shower.</li>
            <li>I was initially really happy with the product, as I am sure most people would be.  </li>
            <li>My electric razor, by contrast, has a rechargeable battery that lasted many years already, so this seems to not have quite as good a battery.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This would be a good product if it lasted more than 6 months.</li>
            <li>A nice gizmo while it lasted,</li>
            <li>Also, the handle is kind off bulky.</li>
            <li>also liked the idea of it being cordless and portable.  </li>
            <li>I was very happy with the results I got from it while it was working, yet, this device came with a whole bunch of problems.    </li>
            <li>and she never told me how she liked it</li>
            <li>The Plus I purchased this time has a kind of figure</li>
            <li>cordless is nice</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so handy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice not to be tethered to a tank.</li>
            <li>I loved the flosser, but have not been able to get it to charge.</li>
            <li>Otherwise I liked it.</li>
            <li>At most, I get one good use out of it before I have to plug it in again.</li>
            <li>I liked this cordless water pik.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m thrilled with how well it works for the price and convenience of not having a bulky device sitting on my countertop.</li>
            <li>Ditto ifI weren&#x27;t so handy and consider these things challenges.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>Really though, a very good tool!</li>
            <li>i love this pik, it has a good size water resevoir and holds a charge for weeks of use.</li>
            <li>It also comes with additional tip/ head attachments, which is nice.</li>
            <li>I have used and liked Waterpiks for years.  </li>
            <li>It would have been nice to have been advised that the product would not work here.</li>
            <li>Also the dental hygienist was thrilled by what she called my home care.</li>
            <li>Suggest using warm water.  </li>
            <li>I liked the cordless plus because it doesn&#x27;t have a cord to navigate while using.  </li>
            <li>I liked it.</li>
            <li>I smiled at my mirror which happened to be covered in water and</li>
            <li>I do not even play a dentist on TV so please do your own research:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>I liked it while it worked, but stopped working after 2 years.</li>
            <li>find 2-3 fillings required for a nice thorough cleaning.  </li>
            <li>I put some mouth wash in and mix with warm water</li>
            <li>I fill it with warm tap water.</li>
            <li>I own the Ultra model which is the corded model.  </li>
            <li>My dentist suggesting me use this Waterpik Waterflosser with warm water and peroxide.  </li>
            <li>Does a nice job.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t like, compared to the non-mobile kind I used</li>
            <li>Has a nice stream of water that flows out....</li>
            <li>I was kind of looking forward to trying that out.</li>
            <li>I do own the Waterpik Flosser with the cord and needed this to use at school after lunch.</li>
            <li>That is still plenty of pressure for a handy cordless</li>
            <li>When it worked it made for a nice travel option.</li>
            <li>I just ordered the full size ultra but am happy to have this one for traveling for sure!</li>
            <li>Easy to use, effective and reliable!  </li>
            <li>Would like to return but can&#x27;t find original packing slip!!</li>
            <li>Go here for details on the most excellent flosser, because how can you live a quality life without a good flosser?:&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works great and leaves teeth clean.</li>
            <li>So....fresh breath, clean teeth and happy gums.</li>
            <li>Work great, holds charge over a week, teeth feel as clean as after visiting the dentist, and a lot cheaper</li>
            <li>So again, I highly recommend this product, but it is not as perfect</li>
            <li>This is a good concept as it is coordless and easy to use</li>
            <li>Over all I think my gums have become more healthy which is good.  </li>
            <li>Soooo easy to use and feels so good.  </li>
            <li>tips easy to change good value for the money</li>
            <li>great jet pressure... compact...would recommend to anyone who wants to get a good cleaning between teeth (along with flossing of course.)</li>
            <li>Finally,be sure to charge it for a full 24 hours before using, then keep it plugged in except for when you&#x27;re using it, this way it keeps a charge beautifully.</li>
            <li>Free shipping and prompt delivery was a pleasant experience.</li>
            <li>Easy to follow instructions and everything as described and at a good price, what&#x27;s not to like.</li>
            <li>Works well and easy to travel with; good value</li>
            <li>I find it very easy to use plus stays charged for over a week.  </li>
            <li>This is very easy to use and does the job.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to charge the battery.</li>
            <li>This is very easy to use, and even my kids like it.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is so very easy to use and has a dedicated space at my sink.</li>
            <li>The very first one I had worked great for a couple of years before&lt;</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE THIS!  </li>
            <li>It works ok, but is more of a hassle than using string/tape floss!  </li>
            <li>great product, like being able to get teeth really clean using it</li>
            <li>I found the product easy to use, that it works well with warm water, and that my dentist says my gums have never looked better!</li>
            <li>It is best to have Ni-Cads discharge completely and then recharge them.</li>
            <li>It is best to have Ni-Cads discharge completely and then recharge them.</li>
            <li>We have used waterpik products for more than 20 years &amp; it&#x27;s so nice to have this compact model.</li>
            <li>Gums will be great and there is rarely any scraping needed.</li>

            <li>, SO I FILL IT WITH LUKE WARM WATER, MUCH BETTER.</li>
            <li>But so far, very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>Read the reviews and see how many people mention some kind of battery problem.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exceptional - easy to use and does the job.   </li>
            <li>Much more effective than flossing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this handy appliance.</li>
            <li>It is kind of bulky, but works ok.</li>
            <li>We can swish warm water in our mouths with much more force than this Waterpik can muster.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to add warm water.</li>
            <li>Great product, works well, worth the money.</li>
            <li>Since I have not used a waterpik before, I had a bit of a learning curve to make it most effective, and keep water off the bathroom ceiling.</li>
            <li>It might take you longer, but I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s more effective than this hunk of junk.</li>
            <li>I used to have the old waterpik which did an excellent job but took space and was noisy.  </li>
            <li>I travel a good deal and this is indispensable for both its portability and for its cleaning power.  </li>
            <li>It works great as advertized and it shipped quick even with free shipping!</li>
            <li>It can wash my teeth very clean, I am very satisfied, but it does not power tips, more</li>
            <li>So easy to use!</li>
            <li>Plus, it fits neatly into my briefcase so I can easily use it after lunch, before a meeting, or while in queue at the bank!</li>
            <li>It is well made, versatile, and easy to use!  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and transport!</li>
            <li>I have bridges and dental implants and this works nicely to keep those hard-to-reach areas very clean.</li>
            <li>works great as suggested, not as strong as the large desk unit but good fror trips</li>
            <li>very good product, price a bit high</li>
            <li>its so enjoyable to be alive and get to use all this great stuff!</li>
            <li>I am very happy they did replace it because when it coincidentally started dripping two years to the DAY (on a Sunday) that it was covered for on a 2 year warranty that I had no idea was in force, the kind lady at Waterpik realized how close I was to the deadline that she simply replaced it.</li>
            <li>Good luck trying to actually clean anything this way</li>
            <li>Flossing is great, but it cannot really do as good of a job as an old fashion water stream can..</li>
            <li>I have used another model which I liked better, but this one is OK.  </li>
            <li>So handy being cordless, but powrful enough to do a great job!!</li>
            <li>The two pressure options are good, and it indeed clean the teeth.</li>
            <li>It does the job for sure but will require time to get accustomed to so that it is most effective.</li>
            <li>the Waterpik Waterflosser Cordless Plus is the best and only choice for portable, travel-friendly, effective water flossing.</li>
            <li>And if you do need more water, it is VERY easy to fill.&lt;br /&gt;Yes</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would not recommend the Cordless Plus unless you are sure you do not need a very strong jet of water - if, for example, you already have the Ultra and find that you use it with the power dial set to the halfway mark or below.</li>
            <li>Talk about wonderful customer service---and that also makes me feel really good about spending $50.00 for a dental \\&quot;gadget\\&quot; which, although it works really great, if it hadn&#x27;t been so easy to fix this problem, I might have had mixed feelings about purchasing it in the first place.</li>
            <li>Great cleaning power, long charge time, Fits nicely on my bathroom countertop, Holds just the right amount of water/wash for perfect cleaning performance.</li>
            <li>the water pressure is suitable, its an ok product.</li>
            <li>First I must say that the Waterpik Waterflosser Cordless Plus does a great job.  </li>
            <li>First off, a great idea, hence my reasons for buying it.</li>
            <li>Great item, exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>For the first 2-3 years it was great.</li>
            <li>If you want a great Waterpik product that does a great job, try the Ultra Water Flosser model WP-100W (which costs only about $5 more than the PLUS).[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>it works great and does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>the first one I ordered worked great for about 2 weeks</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s 110% better than flossing and the fact that it&#x27;s more effective is just a bonus :)</li>
            <li>I thought it was too good to be true,  </li>
            <li>This one has good features size, variability strength of jet, Filling is easy, charging is easy.  </li>
            <li>Quick and easy to use and does a great job.  </li>
            <li>Well that and one very detailed review (by The Geekster)</li>
            <li>It is very comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let the 5-star reviewer fool you on this very important factor.</li>
            <li>She says it doesn&#x27;t have as much power as the full size but is perfect for what she needs.</li>
            <li>My water pic arrived quickly and in good order.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and design fits nicely in hand for ease of operation.   </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for a quick go-around but not for thorough cleaning.  </li>
            <li>this product is easy to use and effective.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice size and easy to pack.</li>
            <li>But I would recommend this cordless unit to anyone that desires an easy Waterpik to take and use on the road, or just demands a handy cordless unit.</li>
            <li>I can feel the clean on my teeth after I use the product and am very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>Its a bit large to take with you on a trip, but its great form home use.</li>
            <li>It would be better if the tank held more water.</li>
            <li>one more thing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, but I wish I had kept my money in my pocket on this one.</li>
            <li>I love this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>although looking at the design, I don&#x27;t know where it could be more conveniently</li>
            <li>I love the compact size.  </li>
            <li>both lasted many years.</li>
            <li>and  has cord  and t also has a reservoir  for water for more than one minute</li>
            <li>(I keep it for traveling) and love the ultra.  </li>
            <li>It is also easier to refill from the side instead of the top as the wp360.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I have braces and I am so glad that I bought this product.</li>
            <li>You can always refill it if you think you need more time.  </li>
            <li>It has so much more power to it, which can be adjusted, and it cleans even better.</li>
            <li>She is really impressed that I am not only maintaing, but my teeth and gums are  better than she&#x27;s ever seen them.</li>
            <li>I just love it</li>
            <li>better than flossing.  </li>
            <li>love this device; i use mine in the shower.  </li>
            <li>I do not have a Waterpik that sits on my counter top and plugs into the wall socket.</li>
            <li>No I found that I like the cordless ones better.</li>
            <li>It was OK</li>
            <li>, the tip always falling on the floor as the way it was to be stored should have held the tip better.</li>
            <li>Are you sure you have it charged up?</li>
            <li>I think most people probably keep the unit charger plug in while not in use.</li>
            <li>but I have used their products for years and have not had that many problems which is why I guess they are still number one in Oral Irragtor sales.</li>

            <li>but I have used their products for years and have not had that many problems which is why I guess they are still number one in Oral Irragtor sales.</li>
            <li>On the more positivie side, I can tell a difference in my gums and teeth.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>You can recharge 24 hours or more, and then you with luck if you can use 3 times.  </li>
            <li>Also, because you need to keep it upright, there are parts of your mouth you can&#x27;t get to, notably the inside of your front teeth where plaque accumulates.</li>
            <li>Then twist the spout 180 degrees when it is not in my mouth to prep it to cover the top inside areas.  </li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t do much more of that by itself.</li>
            <li>This is a shower gizmo - if you don&#x27;t intend to use this in the shower, you might prefer to get a sink model instead - they lack the weight, hold more water, and are easier to deal with.   </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m no expert, but I do really love this thing.</li>
            <li>The water chamber takes up most of the side on it.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;re not going to be able to fill it up with your shower stream.</li>
            <li>Are you sure you have it charged up?</li>
            <li>and I love the fact that it is portable.  </li>
            <li>i love mine.</li>
            <li>Although I just read the charger cable is most probably the culprit.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I asked the orthodontist is a water flosser was okay</li>
            <li>I tried the product to make sure it is working, it was working</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t imagine that mold is particularly healthy.  </li>
            <li>I used to be able to go a week between chargings (using it once a day), and now I need to charge it about every 3-4 days.  </li>
            <li>I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>maybe that brand is a better choice.  </li>
            <li>I am really pleased with this because you don&#x27;t have to move the unit around dramatically</li>
            <li>It fits nicely in the hand, it&#x27;s light</li>
            <li>, I felt my gums get a great but gentle massage.</li>
            <li>I love the Waterpik.  </li>
            <li>My favorite brand is the InterPlak by Conair.  </li>
            <li>Since Waterpik has been making oral flushing devices for so many years I decided to purchase theirs.  </li>
            <li>I have the regular countertop waterpik and have been very happy with it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I think this is better than flossing with string.  </li>
            <li>do not buy it, maybe they wills top putting it on sale.</li>
            <li>I will get another water flossing system of some sort, but I recommend that you skip this one unless you&#x27;re ok with re-buying it once a year.</li>
            <li>I love it...</li>
            <li>This is a great product that really improve mine and my family&#x27;s oral health.  </li>
            <li>Like many of the reviewers</li>
            <li>It has more power than the cheaper units.</li>
            <li>Having said that, this unit exceeded every expectation, and this style of flosser (cordless) is much better for me.</li>
            <li>Having said that, this unit exceeded every expectation, and this style of flosser (cordless) is much better for me.</li>
            <li>All in all, it works, but having already used one that works much better</li>
            <li>I decided on the cordless and love it.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied.</li>
            <li>TSA inspections is a topic best left alone.</li>
            <li>I would have paid more if the unit used lithium ion rather than metal hydride batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was able to get a replacement</li>
            <li>and I hope I have better luck with this one.</li>
            <li>The Pansonic battery unit is much better</li>
            <li>Got feedback from my hygienist at a recent cleaning appointment - \\&quot;you are doing a wonderful job\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I have been using it on a daily basis and I am very happy with the results I am getting.  </li>
            <li>so mine didn&#x27;t come from Amazon, but I still love having it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Most users assume that the battery became defective.     </li>
            <li>I love these.  </li>
            <li>I charged it up with more than the time the directions said, just to be sure it was fully charged.</li>
            <li>This Water Pik irrigator has a battery that can be recharged and it works much better.  </li>
            <li>No complaints from recipient and they seem to be enjoying it.</li>
            <li>and I have tried many.    </li>
            <li>This works fabulous!  </li>
            <li>But the low speed is perfect!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need any more problems with my gums.</li>
            <li>You can do better.</li>
            <li>As a person who flosses every day, I find that the water pik does an even better job.  </li>
            <li>the water end up on the floor :-)    </li>
            <li>I needed a waterpik because I have the perfect gap between my back two teeth and food gets stuck in their in one chew.  </li>
            <li>I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>I have posted two more photos.  </li>
            <li>Usability is ok.    </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t come close to the quality of the counter top Waterpik(which</li>
            <li>I love).</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>It surely does the job when travelling.</li>
            <li>Each time I think this is about 12 months, but I cant be sure.  </li>
            <li>My dental hygenist recommended this product for both my husband and me because we&#x27;re not the most faithful users of dental floss.</li>
            <li>I purchased this with some terpidation, since it had so many reviews from people with concerns.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this Waterpik.  </li>
            <li>I like it but the table top has more</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m ok with it.</li>
            <li>If I need more..</li>
            <li>It sure beats having the bulky one on my counter.</li>
            <li>We love this product.  </li>
            <li>The biggest reason is that the tank hold more water.  </li>
            <li>If you want an irrigator for your bathroom, get a corded model, or better, one of the OralBreeze products.</li>
            <li>This item was recommended by my Dental Hygentist; said that it works much better than floss.</li>
            <li>Better yet, it&#x27;s time for them to transition to inductive charging the way the Philips flossers have.</li>
            <li>Before discarding the defective unit, I examined it more closely.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the purchase and recommend the unit.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than nothing and portable.  </li>
            <li>During those 5 days I found this product to be outstanding.  </li>
            <li>this is not the best thing and not a regular flosser substitute although did more bleeding on fastest setting.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned Waterpiks for many years.</li>
            <li>What I discovered was that the objections many of the one-star reviewers had given the Cordless Plus were in fact legitimate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My gut feeling tells me that most will do the same.n the counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It would be nice if it came with either a sample of all the heads available or if you could choose which heads would be included in the package.</li>
            <li>It sure does its job well.</li>
            <li>I ordered this waterpik and was not so sure about it since it is cordless.  </li>
            <li>I made sure that the reservoir was pushed in all the way.  </li>
            <li>but I like this better- easier to store.</li>
            <li>job.&lt;br /&gt;I found out it is much more comfortable once I use warm water.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>In most places where my gums a healthy it does not hurt on HI power.  </li>
            <li>I just enjoyed having this tool in the airport and wherever I had to be at.</li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>I will do this to extend the life of my battery, but if it still dies after 2 years, I will gladly buy another unit.  </li>
            <li>so I have more than ample water in the tank.</li>
            <li>OK, I didn&#x27;t read all the reviews, but here&#x27;s my take on this unit.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Why is the battery charge indicator SO IMPORTANT!  </li>
            <li>Every time you do this you degrade the battery that much more.  </li>
            <li>1) put a charge indicator on the side of the unit, or better yet, 2) put</li>
            <li>I love this thing.</li>
            <li>The waterpik cleans my teeth much better than a brush and floss</li>
            <li>I should have paid more attention to the reviews - some people warned against this.  </li>
            <li>And how all your mouth higene changes for better</li>
            <li>I also have the Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser which I love.</li>
            <li>Many complaints about the battery not accepting a charge after 3-4 months.</li>
            <li>It took 2 reservoirs of water to get the job done - used 1 reservoir for the top and 1 for the bottom.</li>
            <li>This product DOES NOT replace a floss, make sure you realize that before buying.</li>
            <li>He is pleased that I bought it for him.</li>
            <li>Would love to see a portable one that you could have at work.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li>My teeth and gums feel better already.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if the Panasonic is better</li>
            <li>Pleased with product for the price.</li>
            <li>well i&#x27;ve been using my waterpik for over a month and love it.</li>
            <li>so the pik   tip can be brought closer to the top of the gum line.</li>
            <li>I like this one better for my purposes.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>After you are done wrestling with the swiveling head, the water runs out -- it&#x27;s like an I Love Lucy comedy.    </li>
            <li>The water flossers are getting better with each one coming out....</li>
            <li>So you&#x27;d never be able to get away with using it while someone else in the house was trying to sleep.  </li>
            <li>I hope it works well for you for many years.  </li>
            <li>love love love this thing.</li>
            <li>I prefer the 110V counter unit over this because it holds more water and has more settings</li>
            <li>Glad I found it.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with my ointeractions with AMAZON on EVERY LEVEL (been with them for 3 years now)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try another brand of rechargeable water flosser and see if that&#x27;s any better.</li>
            <li>I love the compact design.  </li>
            <li>I have now owned three of them, but never for more than a year.  </li>
            <li>The battery charging system on the Sonicar products uses induction charging and has always lasted for many years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll let you know more when I buy the Sonicare - Airfloss.</li>
            <li>I love the waterpik waterflosser and I would recommend it to anyone that cares about oral hygiene.  </li>
            <li>Moreover the waterpik customer service is simply outstanding.  </li>
            <li>I was once again able to charge the Waterpik after cleaning&lt;br /&gt;out</li>
            <li>Ok, I have had this Waterpik just about a year</li>
            <li>I am so glad I bought this.</li>
            <li>WaterPik can and should do better.</li>
            <li>Also, you will squirt your wall multiple times, but all in all this thing is AWESOME!</li>
            <li>We love the Waterpik Waterflosser Cordless</li>
            <li>well i love it since we have two kids with braces.</li>
            <li>it helps a lot more as well</li>
            <li>/&gt;It seems better than dental</li>
            <li>did use waterpik WP-360.&lt;br /&gt;I think WP-450 better than WP-360.&lt;br /&gt;WP-450</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I don&#x27;t have another cord to contend with.</li>
            <li>the most appropriate pick, and teeth and gums are cleared of &amp;#34;gunk&amp;#34; and plaque.</li>
            <li>But I ended up getting lots and lots of cavities, more than I have ever had in my life, during the period I used this waterpick.  </li>
            <li>It does a better job &amp; is easier on my gums.  </li>
            <li>It is ok but will not ever replace my counter top waterpik.</li>
            <li>But when traveling it is better than not having one at all.</li>
            <li>I love my Waterflosser.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>So I thought the cordless model would be better for me.</li>
            <li>I wish it held more water</li>
            <li>Would be even better if the on/off switch is a momentary switch (power on when pressed, power off when released).</li>
            <li>The water only pumps if the waterpik is held perfectly vertical and stationary.   </li>
            <li>then the battery wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge for more than one use.  </li>
            <li>this one also now won&#x27;t hold a charge for more than one use.  </li>
            <li>Until you can get proficient you may want to refill the the unit twice, once for the top set of teeth and once for the bottom.</li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s self-contained, it&#x27;s more flexible than the waterpiks that use a tank with a hose running to the device.</li>
            <li>I have waited a while to review this product and feel confident that this unit is more DURABLE than the others I have purchased.  </li>
            <li>Maybe the two-year warrantee forces Waterpik to use better batteries.    </li>
            <li>and she said many people like this machine</li>
            <li>A better design is needed to keep water away from the charging area.</li>
            <li>I love the cordless feature.</li>
            <li>I use this twice a day every day and that is way more than I can say for flossing.  </li>
            <li>This may be your answer to healthy gums, it is in my home.</li>
            <li>But if you close the door of your bathroom you might be able to get away with it.    </li>
            <li>All in all, even though the countertop version takes up more space, it is the way to go.</li>
            <li>hope it works better.</li>
            <li>Power Switch reliability  8)</li>
            <li>The battery charge interval is outstanding.</li>
            <li>8)</li>
            <li>The pump is fairly powerful for a battery powered unit, so some noise is a good engineering compromise.</li>
            <li>I wish the water jet could be adjusted to be more forceful</li>
            <li>Flossing with water does give a more thorough, cleaner feel.</li>
            <li>I wish there were more pressure settings or a more stable water pressure throughout the battery life.</li>
            <li>Would sooner find ways to make room for AC-only version than even bother with even touching this model.</li>
            <li>After using another brand for quite some time my wife got this one and likes it a lot more than others she has had.</li>
            <li>More portable - would recommend this unit</li>
            <li>Second, device works best in position that allows the water to feed into the uptake tube in the holding tank.  </li>
            <li>but once I got used to it , it seems okay.  </li>
            <li>So I bought this and love how convenient it is.</li>
            <li>I really liked it until it blew something inside the pump and the water pressure was so light it was not useable.</li>
            <li>Perfect for cleaning between teeth, especially for cleaning around bridgework.</li>
            <li>Tabletop version holds more water and would run longer.</li>
            <li>To my mind this is better.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my daughter who is now wearing braces, and it is the BEST way to get them to floss daily.  </li>
            <li>I love the way it works, but there is a fatal design flaw- water always gets into the battery contacts and rusts them out.</li>
            <li>I will give more information once the gift has been given and the recipient responds.</li>
            <li>Have not been able to use it because it will not charge up.</li>
            <li>adn my coun ter top</li>
            <li>but you could not do better.</li>
            <li>She is very happy with how it works, but after 1-2 years enough water leaks inside to corrode the battery/motor.  </li>
            <li>Still would prefer they sealed the unit better.  </li>
            <li>Love the fact that its so portable.</li>
            <li>and they claimed there were no problems with the unit&#x27;s design and could not or would not tell me if the replacement part reflected a change in design aimed at correcting the issue that so many reviewers have discussed.  </li>
            <li>Not not cellophane tape, more like that on a band aide.  </li>
            <li>It works better than flossing.</li>
            <li>Great product ,very convienent .Compact</li>
            <li>If you are looking for or need more time then this unit may not be for you.</li>
            <li>I have to say I love it.</li>
            <li>I Love that I found this</li>
            <li>I love this site because I can come on here and read reviews and inform myself before making a purchase.</li>
            <li>I like this one better.</li>
            <li>it was ok.</li>
            <li>This one for Hubble was much better than mine.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with my item.   </li>
            <li>The item is not ergonomic for your hands so keep that in mind when choosing between portability or the counter top type.</li>
            <li>After about 14 months the battery will not hold a charge for more than a couple uses, then has to be recharged for a day.</li>
            <li>This product works great - when it works - which isn&#x27;t very often.  </li>
            <li>It is okay, but toilete tree is much better.</li>
            <li>It is on 110-220 Volts, which is much better for me.</li>
            <li>The level of cleaning this kind of thing does is simply amazing; use it twice a day, never had such a great cleaning experience.</li>
            <li>It holds a lot of water, is great even on the low setting and my dentist told me that using this will do my gums a world of good.  </li>
            <li>What more can you ask?</li>
            <li>Am glad she did.  </li>
            <li>and I love them</li>
            <li>I ended up giving this away and purchasing another model because it did have more &amp;#34;oomph&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>surely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I bought the newer version and just love it.</li>
            <li>The newer and larger version which holds more water is the perfect size.</li>
            <li>Just love it.</li>
            <li>If anything, my checkups were better and SHORTER.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Okay.</li>
            <li>Is there a better portable water flosser is market??</li>
            <li>But does this help you for for most part</li>
            <li>how many times i have to fill the tank for one time floss - 1-3 times depending on what i eat</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s working ok so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have many crowns in my mouth.</li>
            <li>I needed an autovolt - which most products these days are - or a 220V item.</li>
            <li>Glad I bought this water flosser for our three week trip.  </li>
            <li>My parents have the non-travel version of this product and love it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want the full-size version to take up space on the bathroom counter top, so I went with this version after reading a lot of reviews.</li>
            <li>Portability, does a better job than string flossing.</li>
            <li>I love it. ...</li>
            <li>I waited over two weeks before I ever got it, the longest I have waited for anything on here, and to top it off</li>
            <li>Since having caps put on, I have depended on this machine for better dental care.</li>
            <li>This is the better alternative for sure.</li>
            <li>It worked okay for 4 months and then stopped charging.</li>
            <li>Now I don&#x27;t know how I cleaned my braces before :)</li>
            <li>How many times did I have water squirt all over the place?  </li>
            <li>I have been using this for a week and my gums feel better already.  </li>
            <li>This time I&#x27;m going to find something more reliable.</li>
            <li>there are more reliable products out there.  </li>
            <li>Or add a door and appropriate connectors to the battery compartment so I can use disposable batteries and eliminate the charger.    </li>
            <li>I also thought the water stream would be more forceful than it is.  </li>
            <li>Recommendation: If you want something that is dependable shop electronics at a more reliable source.</li>
            <li>It give you 45 seconds of water flossing at a time - but the most important thing is : HE USES IT !</li>
            <li>Love this product and works just like a charm.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this gadget.  </li>
            <li>It still runs great, and the different attachments are all in good working order.</li>
            <li>The battery doesn&#x27;t hold a charge for more than one use, so it is always plugged in and in the way.  </li>
            <li>So, I just bought a counter top unit and love it.  </li>
            <li>I have used a waterpic for many years</li>
            <li>but I am sure that the hose corrects that issue.  </li>
            <li>The cordless waterpic flosser is okay.</li>
            <li>I guess my husband  says it works ok.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great alternative, much gentler on your gums, and seems to work just as well.</li>
            <li>Like my sonic air flosser better because it&#x27;s easier to use</li>
            <li>I travel a lot and still wanted to be able to have the use of my Waterpik.</li>
            <li>My gums are getting better day by day...</li>
            <li>I really love this item.  </li>
            <li>My son just got braces and the waterpik makes brushing much better by removing particles that he could no longer get to with the braces..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much more convenient than the waterpik with the cord.</li>
            <li>, I do recommend this and thanks for all the great reviews I was able to read before buying.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paid about 15% more at Target than I could have paid here on Amazon because I was worried about a convenient return if I didn&#x27;t like it, but I won&#x27;t be returning it.</li>
            <li>I put mouth wash in mine love cordless</li>
            <li>i dont need to floss my teeth any more, I use it every day.</li>
            <li>It turns out I love the thing and use it more than the corded one.</li>
            <li>I recommend you to keep your mouth closed and floss each section separately, turning off the unit and spitting in between, I&#x27;m sure each person will have their own preference for what works best for them in this regard.</li>
            <li>Okay, but my hydrofloss is better.</li>
            <li>It is not as powerful as my hydrofloss and doesn&#x27;t do as good of a job, but for travel purposes, it works.</li>
            <li>Ours did ok.  </li>
            <li>I think the shower model would be a better purchase,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li>Pros: Seems to work better than the Airflosser.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t say for sure because I haven&#x27;t been able to use it.</li>
            <li>I was able to get through my mouth with one fill of water.</li>
            <li>I got a better dental check up after using this for 6 months..</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>This is 100% better then</li>
            <li>Love the waterpik.</li>
            <li>Good for travel but not as powerful as my home water flosser which plugs in for use.</li>
            <li>I have been completely satisfied with its performance</li>
            <li>and I am sure my dentist will be too.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>and I have to say I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the way my teeth feel afterwards.  </li>
            <li>I wonder if there is a way to get a better closing lid/system.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the unit.</li>
            <li>enjoyed using this, it was recommended by my dental hygienist.</li>
            <li>To be safe, I&#x27;m waiting till the water in the socket dries before I plug it in to recharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The fact that a product is cordless implies that it is portable and more convenient than a wired model.&lt;br /&gt;Two</li>
            <li>Love this -</li>
            <li>We found it holds a charge for five days, but we have yet to take it on a longer trip, so it could be more.</li>
            <li>It just makes me feel better and even helps make</li>
            <li>so why can&#x27;t you favorite dental hygene tool?&lt;br</li>
            <li>It holds a charge for more than a week</li>
            <li>and then so I like the idea of being able to carry this around.</li>
            <li>Much better than when I floss</li>
            <li>I just need to get the hang of it :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I took a chance on it.</li>
            <li>The pump on this has a bout a 1/3 more power</li>
            <li>Love this waterpik.</li>
            <li>I love the waterpik and swear by it.  </li>
            <li>I love this WaterPik.  </li>
            <li>More then once a day.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s stylish.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad she did.  </li>
            <li>Love, love.  </li>
            <li>Company replaced with the wired unit and we are happy with it and really like the way both cleaned our teeth/gums.</li>
            <li>COULD BE MUCH BETTER DESIGNED</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>I never realized how much more our teeth need even after flossing.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love this flosser.</li>
            <li>This one is better and comes with a year longer</li>
            <li>It is ok.</li>
            <li>Flossing is better when compared to this.</li>
            <li>but we love that you can use it while it is not plugged in since we do not have plugs all over the place like newer homes</li>
            <li>I like this model better.  </li>
            <li>This is even better than I thought it would be..</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s better to use a strings.</li>
            <li>Water jet was ok.</li>
            <li>i love this product.  </li>
            <li>I have tried several and this one is the best.  </li>
            <li>It says it works better than floss.</li>
            <li>In most electronics, this is a novel concept.</li>
            <li>would have bought two more if it had the docking</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s good to keep your smile and breath in check&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is the one to buy since it can hold way more water and has the pressure you will need to get your teeth cleaned.</li>
            <li>By the way, no matter what waterpik products you buy you will be leaning over the sink to make sure the water does not get all over you.</li>
            <li>This product just would not hold a charge for more than one use.</li>
            <li>However, something sold as a travel item should surely come with a travel case.</li>
            <li>Works well,really pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I am enjoying this purchase.  </li>
            <li>I  love  the  portability</li>
            <li>The battery does not hold a charge for more than two days.  </li>
            <li>Better than Flossing</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re done, working top and bottom, and I did both the &amp;#34;outer&amp;#34; side and &amp;#34;inner&amp;#34; side of my teeth, if that makes sense....</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re done, working top and bottom, and I did both the &amp;#34;outer&amp;#34; side and &amp;#34;inner&amp;#34; side of my teeth, if that makes sense....</li>
            <li>My teeth and I love this waterflosser.  </li>
            <li>Sure wish the price of these would stop going up.</li>
            <li>and we are okay with it.</li>
            <li>This waterflosser is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I love this thing!&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: As others have noticed, this unit starts having problems with staying charged.</li>
            <li>The plug in unit was better than this cordless one.</li>
            <li>Completely satisfied with this product and the service provided.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure after using this</li>
            <li>I love this product my dentist suggested that I get it and have been using it ever since.</li>
            <li>I love my waterpik.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gets food from between my teeth much better than a toothbrush or floss</li>
            <li>and it removes the fuzzies on the tooth surface better than a toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Much better choice.</li>
            <li>Excellent addition to daily dental care.</li>
            <li>and why dentists don&#x27;t recommend it more often.  </li>
            <li>glad they did.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I keep tape over the charge recepticle just to be safe.  </li>
            <li>Miraculously, after using it four days, most of my soreness disappeared.</li>
            <li>just love using</li>
            <li>Glad I did.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li>My dentist insisted that I floss more than once a day.</li>
            <li>A corded model is probably a better choice but will take up more counter space..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too bulky to take up precious luggage space travelling when it&#x27;s not even working</li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s cordless.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m just 100% satisfied with the results.  </li>
            <li>It sayd it is better than string floss and that you can see a difference in 2 weeks</li>
            <li>i have beef with this version of the waterpik, but the corded one is actually 5 star and is perfect.</li>
            <li>It is also a bummer not to be able to return it.  </li>
            <li>I love your inventive minds and helpful</li>
            <li>Love the cordless part, I can take it in the shower</li>
            <li>Therefore, for the road option, I chose the same company and is very happy</li>
            <li>I plugged it in once more and thought I&#x27;d try it</li>
            <li>Love this cordless Waterpik.</li>
            <li>I am going to buy more for my children.  </li>
            <li>I love the cordless idea and the portable water tank.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased with all phases  of my purchase.</li>
            <li>Wish they had an even more compact version.</li>
            <li>It really does a great job of getting food out between the teeth and braces.</li>
            <li>Sometimes more than twice a day, if I felt something got stuck between my teeth i.e. after eating strawberries, etc.</li>
            <li>This is phenomenal.</li>
            <li>--I wouldn&#x27;t want anything stronger that&#x27;s for sure.  </li>
            <li>I really love my water pik glossed, feel like my teeth are cleaner.</li>
            <li>This is a replacement for a battery operated water flosser I had for many years.</li>
            <li>I was expecting that the battery will be better.</li>
            <li>It is better than nothing, but I prefer the corded version.</li>
            <li>I bought this for travel, it works ok, but I would like it to have more pressure.  </li>
            <li>I always kept &amp;#34;meaning&amp;#34; to floss more.</li>
            <li>I am getting better with it</li>
            <li>This one is so much better.  </li>
            <li>this is an improved version and does work better.</li>
            <li>Makes teeth and mouth feel a lot more cleaner when you have braces.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong, so I&#x27;m pretty happy with the battery life as well.</li>
            <li>but, this does a very nice job and doesn&#x27;t take up much space.</li>
            <li>I put mouthwash in the vessel with some warm water for a really refreshing clean.</li>
            <li>I was not so much aware of the change, but he certainly was and I was given the best compliment</li>
            <li>We were very excited when it arrived.  </li>
            <li>This time the company customer service wasn&#x27;t that nice and didn&#x27;t replace the unit as it has been over two years from the original purchase date.</li>
            <li>I have used A Waterpick  device for years, but this model is very easy to use and easy to keep clean!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m willing to do that until Waterpik fixes the problem or another excellent, reasonably priced water flosser comes along....</li>
            <li>The also are great for flushing pockets in the gums which develop as we grow older.  </li>
            <li>It is very easy and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and very easy to hold.  </li>
            <li>The end result is very clean gumlines and teeth.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels refreshed and very clean.  </li>
            <li>and my mouth feels very clean.</li>
            <li>Very light and easy to hold and use.</li>
            <li>It is very light weight and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I really loved using this Waterpik when I first got it.  </li>
            <li>It is pretty good for what it is.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very happy with it for as long as I have it,</li>
            <li>I loved this Waterflosser at first.  </li>
            <li>It is my first ever waterflosser and have loved it since i got it.</li>
            <li>This unit is pretty bulky, and the water pressure isn&#x27;t as good as the countertop plug in Waterpik, but it does suffice for travel.</li>
            <li>In my mind this is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>As that isn&#x27;t the case, this does a good job at exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li>When I first took this cordless Waterpik out of the box, I thought, \\&quot;What good</li>
            <li>I loved my Waterpik, it was the first one I had ever had.  </li>
            <li>First, the good stuff: It works.</li>
            <li>Has a pretty good forceful stream</li>
            <li>I think as I get better at moving it around my mouth it will be fine, but I keep on wishing I had about 10 more seconds of spray.   </li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t completely happy with the new design, so</li>
            <li>has very good water pressure your gums feel so clean like you just had a professional cleaning!</li>
            <li>It was okay, just not as strong as the electric one.</li>
            <li>Now, I easily do the job w. one refill for the bottom teeth and one refill for the top.  </li>
            <li>it is quite easy if you need a more thorough one.</li>
            <li>I wish I had selected a more evenly balanced and easily maneuverable wired option.</li>
            <li>I love that its portable &amp; easy to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased that the unit is easily transportable.    </li>
            <li>The countertop model is much more easily manipulated, of course.</li>
            <li>I love the &amp;#34;action&amp;#34; and the tip settings are easy to use.</li>
            <li>Love the waterpik , easy to use and like the hand held model.</li>
            <li>Using good batteries is the key to this working good.  </li>
            <li>It was taking more and more pushes of the switch to activate the electric motor(even after being fully charged), and the motor itself started sounding like a car running on cheap gas.  </li>
            <li>This is a portable water pik which sounds like a great idea, the problem is that it does not hold enough water to even begin to be effective.</li>
            <li>A great traveling partner, simple to use and highly effective.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m using the jelly and the tape just to make sure, so far everything is working great.</li>
            <li>Excellent water pick that can be used all week on a single charge.</li>
            <li>Daughter&#x27;s teeth are finally clean!  </li>
            <li>I thought I was getting my mouth clean with my electric toothbrush...guess not!  </li>
            <li>It really does get in between your teeth to keep you clean!!!</li>
            <li>I had owned the large tank Waterpik, I loved what it did to my teeth</li>
            <li>Good for car travel - too large for air.   </li>
            <li>It feels great after using it too because you can really notice the difference of how clean your teeth are compared to just brushing.</li>
            <li>i love this product as it helps to clean ur teeth , and keeps ur gums healthy.</li>
            <li>I recently got Invisalign and this is perfect to clean between my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I am really pleased with the product, easy to use, easy to store.  </li>
            <li>Though this appliance is very good when it works, I am sending this one back because like it&#x27;s predecessor, it quit within a year of buying it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anybody that wants the best !</li>
            <li>I was a happy user of WaterPik&#x27;s old travel oral irrigation system, the 350W.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, the waterpik cleans the braces well.  </li>
            <li>Many of the reviews complain of too freely rotating tip problems.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what more to ask for, but it is handheld, light and mobile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My dental hygienist recommended this product and thus far it has been great.</li>
            <li>Size - sure I don&#x27;t want to throw this into my purse, but it would fit in a suitcase if I was going on a longer trip.  </li>
            <li>Much more comfortable to use than floss.</li>
            <li>so it would be great for frequent travellers.</li>
            <li>I made the mistake in thinking that this Cordless Plus unit would fit the bill after reading one particularly convincing 5-star review.</li>
            <li>more efficient, comfortable and quicker.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have as many settings as the full sized one, but is way better than not having it.  </li>
            <li>In the meantime, I&#x27;ve ordered the battery operated Panasonic - so if it gets fixed - great, I&#x27;ll have a backup for when it happens again.  </li>
            <li>They said the most important thing was to please the customer.  </li>
            <li>it was cheap and my dentist said water piks are better than flossing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the old \\&quot;travel size\\&quot; water pik for years and thought this would be a great improvement.</li>
            <li>Yes, its bulky and it would be nice if there was more water in the tank, but if there was, you wouldn&#x27;t be able to manipulate it very well.  </li>
            <li>The charger connections are OK and the receptacle on the flosser is corrosion free.  </li>
            <li>Even my young daughter likes it, so it must be a great product.</li>
            <li>The water spray is so much more comfortable and efficient.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with it, no problems so far.</li>
            <li>You can fill it on its side to fit even more in.</li>
            <li>this product met all expectations.&lt;br /&gt;we are very happy with the product and find it useful for dental hygiene and general health.</li>
            <li>Good water pressure, reasonable sized reservoir.  </li>
            <li>I DESPISE flossing and this has a fun novelty effect and is really effective.</li>
            <li>I went out and bought an electric one which is far superior in performance, sounds better, has better pressure and does not make that noise which seems to grate on my wife&#x27;s nerves.</li>
            <li>It is not quite as powerful, but gets the job done nicely.</li>
            <li>I have been delighted with this product and it was a real life saver while undergoing a stem cell transplant which forbade electric toothbrushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good thing is its much lighter than the non portable version.</li>
            <li>Works good, and price was much lower than what my dentist office offered.  </li>
            <li>Does a good job, much easier for me than flossing, but I have to fill the resevoir twice to get the job done.</li>
            <li>A good strong jet and a large capacity reservoir.  </li>
            <li>Very good, easy to use and very, but very practical!</li>
            <li>This device is easy to use and most importantly, does the job.</li>
            <li>That being said though, even with 2 or 3 run-throughs, the process is still quicker and far more pleasant than using dental floss.</li>
            <li>I use this along with a sonicare toothbrush and it is AMAZING to see the pieces of food that the waterpik removes right after I brush.  </li>
            <li>They were popular right before battery charge indicators were invented!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li>I ordered the Panasonic Oral Irrigator EW-DJ10-A and found it superior to the WaterPik: a more elegant design, better construction, smaller and easier to handle.</li>
            <li>Most importantly for us, it&#x27;s not as soft-to-powerful on the settings, especially if you like the gum stimulating workouts that keep my dentist happy with the condition of our healthy gums.</li>
            <li>now on I will stick to Ebay, more user friendly</li>
            <li>Also when you use the more powerful setting, the tip flies off!</li>
            <li>I forgot the charging cord, which turned out not be a problem: the charge lasted the full week!</li>
            <li>I thought the horrendous reviews could not be true, but they were not exaggerations!</li>
            <li>I have the original electric Waterpik and love it, but wanted a cordless for mobility.  </li>
            <li>They even now have a cover which is cool!</li>
            <li>This holds more water than the original and the charge lasted me over a week with 2 uses a day.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The new plug is more effective and the water well empties more easily.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is smaller, more portable and easier to use than my oral B. Also gives a much better clean and mouth feels great.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s so easy to refill that it wasn&#x27;t a problem.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and a selection of heads to use.  </li>
            <li>Refilling is easy</li>
            <li>It was easy to purchase from Amazon.com since I already have an account with them.  </li>
            <li>Tips:  Warm water (as when the shower is just about ready to be entered) may work better.   </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to assemble/disassemble and in my opinion the reservoir held an ample amount of water.</li>
            <li>The tip rotates too easily.</li>
            <li>Unit does not lend itself to easy cleaning.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Bottom line is, I LOVE how clean my mouth and teeth feel after I use this Waterpik, and I would recommend it to others without hesitation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Ok, so this isn&#x27;t going to take the paint off cars, but it does clean teeth.</li>
            <li>There are no serviceable parts, although it would have been easy to engineer the unit so that the owner could easily replace the rechargeable batters.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and store when not in use.</li>
            <li>It is easy to fill, easy to use</li>
            <li>Easy to refill and plug in.       </li>
            <li>The cordless feature makes it easy to work with.</li>
            <li>But even then the jet easily flips and slips around in your mouth</li>
            <li>My dental hygiene person said it kept my gums clean and healthy.  </li>
            <li>this portable one is really easy to use and refill.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using waterpik products for over ten years, great company, most of their products are five stars.</li>
            <li>The unit is easy to use and store, and made well.</li>
            <li>Easy product to use plently of water force.</li>
            <li>It works great..holds a charge..is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>My gums are in better shape and my daughter&#x27;s braces are clean.  </li>
            <li>I can travel with his easily.</li>
            <li>It is easy to travel with.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and store.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, I like that</li>
            <li>/&gt;Waterpik could solve this issue easily in one of two ways.  </li>
            <li>Even after brushing and flossing the waterpik manages to clean more stuff out of my teeth.</li>
            <li>I have the larger waterpik that holds more water and works great at home.</li>
            <li>so I went through several of them and was initially happy to see Waterpik introducing a new-improved, and more costly WP-450 \\&quot;Ultra\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>easy to take with you on vacation and trips.</li>
            <li>The unit works well, nozzle turning can easily be controlled.  </li>
            <li>Easy to fill, holds plenty of water.  </li>
            <li>However, being waterpik users for many years when ours gave up the ghost finally, thought this would be a great replacement.</li>
            <li>Found it easy to use, and not too clunky.</li>
            <li>So once the tip is in your mouth, it changes the direction easily.  </li>
            <li>This one is really easy to use, easy to rinse out.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s easy to use, and it does the job.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, gets teetch flossed, easy to disassemble and to charge.</li>
            <li>So easy and thorough.  </li>
            <li>I thought a waterpik would be a hassle, but this product is so easy to use</li>
            <li>This is my first Waterpik, and I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.  </li>
            <li>Easy to hold.  </li>
            <li>I also wanted something that was easy to use and was lightweight.  </li>
            <li>it uses it all the time Easy</li>
            <li>Its relatively easy to handle</li>
            <li>The unit has a tapered area that makes it easy to hold.  </li>
            <li>; portable can easily travel with it&lt;br</li>
            <li>works well need to get used to using it however the product works as described and would recommend this to anyone looking for a better way to help clean between teeth</li>
            <li>but its is easily stored without cleaning and drying</li>
            <li>Easy to take along travelling.  </li>
            <li>Arrived very quickly</li>
            <li>It is so easy to fill who cares?</li>
            <li>Easy to charge and</li>
            <li>Easy to grip, though it is larg-ish.  </li>
            <li>I use it almost every day because it&#x27;s easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It does the job and is relatively easy to use.</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, the corrosion problem is easily solved without buying any Radio Shack parts.</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>Easy to handle.</li>
            <li>The cordless feature makes it easy to use.</li>
            <li>The best advice is to keep the power jack wires clean even though there&#x27;s no way to keep them dry, and I am blowing out the water in the jack after every use and will use the vinnegar technique if deposits form.</li>
            <li>reservoir is on an angle and it is easy to under-fill it, though once you realize this it is easy to fill it all the way.</li>
            <li>Is easy to use.</li>
            <li>and it seems to clean much better.</li>
            <li>The unit is easily unplugged by mistake.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy for me to bring to work and even though its on the noisy side, it expedites the cleaning process</li>
            <li>advise Panasonic DJ40 is much better, more powerful</li>
            <li>Waterpik&#x27;s customer service department was easy to contact and they agreed without argument to replace it.</li>
            <li>wish I&#x27;d bought it in a store so it would be easy to return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>like how easy they are to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>With this cordless model it is so easy to use and store.</li>
            <li>easy to use,..</li>
            <li>Easy to use, 2 power settings, fits in the hand well.  </li>
            <li>:))  Pros: Gets the teeth sparkling clean.</li>
            <li>She finds it easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to handle and maneuver while using.</li>
            <li>Easy to travel with and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s so easy to refill that I don&#x27;t find that to be an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found it to be easy to use.</li>
            <li>did watch some vids on YT to get a sense of how to use it, and it&#x27;s easy once you get the hang of it.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy and takes up a quarter of the room</li>
            <li>and that makes it really easy to share since we have separate</li>
            <li>Keeps my teeth incredibly clean and my gums healthy.</li>
            <li>I fill it about 4 times during each session but it is so easy to fill</li>
            <li>Easy to fill and use.</li>
            <li>I like being able to see in the water resservoir, easier to keep clean.</li>
            <li>The cordless needs 2 to 4 refills to really clean but rinses okay with one.</li>
            <li>Set up is easy.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the way the tank works and the door is flimsy and comes off easily.</li>
            <li>easy cordless use, would recommend it to everybody who has bridges, implants or both.</li>
            <li>I like the deflosser as it is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The lower one is strong enough.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And the stream is not quite as strong.  </li>
            <li>its been going strong for days without showing any strain.  </li>
            <li>I found this handy portable water pic just great for my needs,  I took it on vacation with me instead of my counter top model-takes up less space</li>
            <li>This item is not as good as the older model that I replaced.</li>
            <li>I found the non-PLUS model was a bit too strong with the one speed setting.  </li>
            <li>Still going strong after a year.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m one of those folks who dislikes the strong flavor of mouthwashes and &#x27;mint-this-or-that&#x27; in particular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It is a good size for travel, but the way the water reservoir is designed it makes it a challenge to keep the flow steady as you move the tip around your teeth.  </li>
            <li>However, the water pressure is not as strong as the countertop model.  </li>
            <li>The water pic is really good product is the best thing I have use thin flossing</li>
            <li>Nothing better than the feeling of a super clean mouth and teeth!</li>
            <li>The only thing I liked about it was that I could get a more effective between the teeth rinse after brushing and flossing.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you read the directions and charge for the full 24 hours before using the product.</li>
            <li>It charges beautifully and I only need to re-charge about once every 4-6 weeks.  </li>
            <li>This seemed like a handy way of water-flossing, and it was for the first 18 months.  </li>
            <li>First time it happened I got a warranty replacement, which was nice.  </li>
            <li>I used to use the full size model - this one sounded more convenient.</li>
            <li>I would not buy this if I had a good countertop - we have a countertop model that has more pressure, a larger tank, and is more convenient to pik with.</li>
            <li>After using my waterpik the first couple of times I still flossed just to see how effective it was</li>
            <li>While bulking it is still better than trying to lug around a full Waterpik.</li>
            <li>or it won&#x27;t spray, so you better have good dexterity, and it runs out of water quickly on the high setting.</li>
            <li>It never leaked and most importantly my teeth and gums felt really clean</li>
            <li>Water flow is not as strong as the corded model but probably adequate for most people who travel.  </li>
            <li>Recharging is very quick and the jet power is more than adequate for my needs.</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, this is a good flosser: good for the teeth, good for the gums, quick to use, not too heavy and not awkward to hold.</li>
            <li>Plus the on button moves so easily I keep accidentally touching it when removing the tip from my mouth or getting ready to use it and spraying mouthwash in my face, on my shirt or across the room! :-)</li>
            <li>It is a very good product and performs well with a long life after charging, Important for traveling so you can leave the charger home.</li>
            <li>It also comes with a very good selection of heads and a charger than has a long cord  that attaches securely to the unit.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Years ago I used the original Waterpick and it was mighty powerful and effective.  </li>
            <li>It stays charged for a long time, easy to handle, the two setting are perfect as I prefer the lighter setting and it is just right.</li>
            <li>insert tip, 3) fill reservoir, 4) use low pressure setting first time out, 5) how to turn on/off unit and 6) techniques for best results.  </li>
            <li>Works fine, but a bit noisy.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use and light weight.  </li>
            <li>and now it works fine again.</li>
            <li>This waterpik model was initially fine.  </li>
            <li>This was fine for travel</li>
            <li>Fortunately its easy to fill..</li>
            <li>The battery life and reservoir capacity seems fine.  </li>
            <li>Delivery was prompt and efficient, packaging fine etc..</li>
            <li>so I decided to look into it and found that the battery in each case was fine.</li>
            <li>It was working fine until stopped working battery.</li>
            <li>and it worked fine for 2.5 months after which the battery just gave up.</li>
            <li>According to him it is easy to use and does a fantastic job of cleaning and rinsing his teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>The pressure was just fine for me.</li>
            <li>The unit works fine for what it was designed to do--no complaints there.  </li>
            <li>I guess it may eventually clog but after 8 months, it still works fine.</li>
            <li>it seemed to work just fine.</li>
            <li>The Waterpic does fine and lasts about 10 days using it twice a day.  </li>
            <li>if so, for less than a dollar a week, i&#x27;m happy with it!</li>
            <li>This cordless model works fine.  </li>
            <li>I now mix the mouthwash I use in it with water (seems a 50/50 blend works fine) and it delivers as advertised.</li>
            <li>The cordless unit worked fine when it worked.</li>
            <li>The waterpic works fine.  </li>
            <li>It will be fine for travel which is why we purchased it.</li>
            <li>However, it is working fine after 6 months, and doesn&#x27;t appear to be suffering any degradation.  </li>
            <li>However, when traveling this works fine.  </li>
            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>But this handheld one works fine too.</li>
            <li>&amp; it&#x27;s been fine.</li>
            <li>It works fine.  </li>
            <li>Worked just fine for about 1 week.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re never going to move and can leave it plugged in for eternity, I guess it was a fine product to you.</li>
            <li>works fine</li>
            <li>The head does not move around freely but it is easily moved, and this can take some getting used to but is not a problem after a couple of uses.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The amount of water is fine.</li>
            <li>and it was fine</li>
            <li>The unit works fine.</li>
            <li>It works fine and saves time.</li>
            <li>It meets my needs just fine.</li>
            <li>During the first month it worked perfect, but after that I must have charging constantly.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and does a fantastic job.  </li>
            <li>Once you do it is fine.</li>
            <li>Yes, this flosser does work fine but don&#x27;t expect it to charge 7-10 months from now.</li>
            <li>It works fine.  </li>
            <li>Cheap, easy, light easy to pack</li>
            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>I did find the stream more than adequate when it was fully charged.</li>
            <li>otherwise, the sound is bearable and the water pressure is strong.</li>
            <li>held more water as it runs out quick</li>
            <li>I find it much more pleasant to use than dental floss, but since I just got it, will have to wait until next visit to the dentist to see how it&#x27;s working.  </li>
            <li>The great thing about that is, it&#x27;s really easy to fill the reservoir back up and keep going.</li>
            <li>My dentist is super impressed since I&#x27;ve been a lifelong &amp;#34;no flosser.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too heavy to use and the ergonomics of it are good -- it feels good in the hand, is balanced, is of a size and weight that are comfortable, and can be angled easily.</li>
            <li>This little machine does an excellent job.  </li>
            <li>So it was very nice to get a new, fresh one.  </li>
            <li>It strong, powerful and the battery lasts!  </li>
            <li>Removing four accessible screws allowed access to the release mechanism, which then was easy to free.</li>
            <li>Being curios I disassembled both and found a huge -10 to Waterpick engineers.</li>
            <li>That would be a huge inconvenience.    </li>
            <li>Its amazing on what it is able to clear</li>
            <li>My teeth, gums and smile are WAY more important.</li>
            <li>taking the aesthetics out (this thing is kinda huge), the water pik came recommended from my dentist.  </li>
            <li>and it has made a huge difference.</li>
            <li>device has made a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>I hope to get a great report from my hygienist at my next cleaning.</li>
            <li>Makes it so easy to clean my teeth.</li>
            <li>I find that I have the best results by starting at the back and working to the front teeth, then turning  it off with the handy on/off switch.</li>
            <li>working great for the last 7 years!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Still no indicator light.  </li>
            <li>It is shaped well to fit in your hand</li>
            <li>Errr...fine, so where is the charging light??</li>
            <li>I will buy a corded one next, becase it is a great product when it was working.</li>
            <li>I SAW THE LIGHT.  </li>
            <li>the product description does not specify this important information</li>
            <li>and I enjoy.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t fit in pocketbook but perhaps in a desk drawer.</li>
            <li>Reservoir needs to be filled twice for thorough cleaning</li>
            <li>I enjoy using it and the health benefits to my teeth.</li>
            <li>Cheap plastic body.</li>
            <li>I wish there were a charge light</li>
            <li>Unless some misguided portability in a water-flosser is strangely important to you, pass on this.  </li>
            <li>Ergonomically it easily fit into my hand</li>
            <li>/&gt;The unit \\&quot;is\\&quot; reasonably comfortable to hold albeit</li>
            <li>They are available on amazon and that&#x27;s where I got it.</li>
            <li>It is sometimes the only way I can dislodge food stuck between my teeth, and my dental hygienist always comments that my teeth and gums are in great shape.  </li>
            <li>But im happy overall.</li>
            <li>The product worked great and suddenly stopped after 6-months; the battery no longer holds a charge.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>There is no charging light.</li>
            <li>larger water container and the pressure is great...</li>
            <li>I then filled it and gave it a</li>
            <li>Simple to use and does a great job on my teeth</li>
            <li>would have been more powerful  </li>
            <li>much more powerful.</li>
            <li>After reading the lead review (and&lt;br /&gt; another review saying the parts were no longer available at Radio Shack)&lt;br /&gt; I searched for and found an electronic cleaner: DeoxIT  which I have now&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m happy with this product.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>The pressure on this isn&#x27;t great, so it isn&#x27;t my daily at-home flosser.</li>
            <li>It is a cheap piece of cr*p that has controls that don&#x27;t make sense and squirt water everywhere.  </li>
            <li>, I just wish it was more powerful.</li>
            <li>definitely recommend it to others who want great flossing experience.</li>
            <li>After charging the unit for 24 hours, I filled up the water vessel and started flossing.  </li>
            <li>This product needs a battery charge indicator light.</li>
            <li>This fit the bill on all accounts.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The portability is important as I travel alot.</li>
            <li>This is my second waterpik which has greatly helped toughen my gums which were always tender and would bleed from time to time.  </li>
            <li>After using the larger Waterpik Ultra (Model WP-100) for a couple of years, and getting great results from using it, I decided to buy one for my husband.  </li>
            <li>The cordless version is just too bulky to be comfortable in use.  </li>
            <li>Each use of the unit drains the fully filled reservoir.  </li>
            <li>However, I enjoy using it, which it motivating.</li>
            <li>so I fill it with a warmer temp that is comfortable to me.  </li>
            <li>and it is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Sound level:  </li>
            <li>If you are comfortable carrying a travel hair dryer this will work for you</li>
            <li>I am happy to report that Waterpik has changed the design to two separate prongs and the female charging unit has likewise been changed.  </li>
            <li>Cheap and available.</li>
            <li>I used it regularly and it is actually a great device.</li>
            <li>mighty.</li>
            <li>The price for this incredibly cheaply made trash is unconscionable.</li>
            <li>Cheap at twice the price, but don&#x27;t use it to remove ear wax</li>
            <li>This is a bit smaller, and runs with great speed and water pressure.</li>
            <li>Just clean off the charging tips so the juice can flow across, easy fix.</li>
            <li>Bought primarily for travelling purposes.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a comfortable pressure but won&#x27;t give you that stinging sensation of the counter top.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Buy it here on Amazon with confidence, read the reviews, and enjoy.</li>
            <li>I own a Sonicare toothebrush and cannot believe how much food is removed by the waterflosser even after brushing.</li>
            <li>and i enjoy it from over 18 months now.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product about 4 months ago and overall have been happy with the performance of this water flosser.</li>
            <li>I am comfortable using the product.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully this oversight doesn&#x27;t indicate a desire to skip quality for cheap manufacturing.</li>
            <li>Fully charged, filled tank with water again...</li>
            <li>fantastic  </li>
            <li>When I received it, the shipping label said \\&quot;Primary lithium battery - not for transport on passenger aircraft.\\&quot; Amazon refunded everything.</li>
            <li>Why would you make a great product to take with you on your travels but only supply a 110 volt charger?&lt;br /&gt;Laptops, phones and the like</li>
            <li>I have  braces and it works great around them with the standard tip.</li>
            <li>It works great, just enough time on.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>Its water capacity is sufficient and can be easily filled.</li>
            <li>Works great, the only downside is that you have to keep refilling the water reservoir.</li>
            <li>The unit initially worked quite well; a great adjunct to the oral hygiene routine.</li>
            <li>But overall it is great for flossing your teeth.  </li>
            <li>Fabulous Waterpik.  </li>
            <li>This product is fantastic and so userfrendly.&lt;br /&gt;It flosses teeth and gums</li>
            <li>Portable and cordless, it was quite convenient and I felt it did a great job, based on the junk that it flushed from my mouth after I had already brushed with my Phillips Sonicare.</li>
            <li>I can say, I will search Walmart.com as well as Amazon since I can return items for free if they do not meet my expectations.</li>
            <li>Once out of the package i charged it and filled with filtered water.  </li>
            <li>The battery lasts for a week, which is a sound performance.</li>
            <li>I was happy to find this gadget so that I wouldn&#x27;t have to have massive clutter in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The water reservoir</li>
            <li>you want it for travel it would do for light flossing.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>the color has improved greatly, and it appears that my gums are starting to regrow</li>
            <li>My case has been a very, very happy one, although I&#x27;m just a few days into it...</li>
            <li>and it was a fantastic tool to have.</li>
            <li>and it was confirmed by my orthodontist and hygienist.</li>
            <li>And the reservoir can&#x27;t be removed and filled because the hole on the bottom allows the water to come out.  </li>
            <li>A fantastic product.</li>
            <li>This waterpik is indispensable for when you are out on the road.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how much guck comes out of your mouth that you would never see with just brushing.</li>
            <li>This is probably one of the most fun items.</li>
            <li>like how it doesn&#x27;t have a huge water reservoir, allowing it to easily fit on my crowded counter.  </li>
            <li>I had it for a couple of months and it is really working nice.</li>
            <li>However when I unplugged the charger monday morning there was no pumping sound, no water spurted out.  </li>
            <li>I look at quite a few and decided this was the best one for my needs.</li>
            <li>It does a great job, especially as I have a lot of dental work; no shredded floss to pick out.</li>
            <li>mouthwash bottle filled with water and a splash of mouthwash in it.</li>
            <li>so cordless was important to me....</li>
            <li>Works grat to keep your teeth free of tarter</li>
            <li>There is a learning curve for proper use but great product once you know how to use it correctly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another issue is no battery charge/power available indicator.  </li>
            <li>Do wish it had a battery charged light on it</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>I find it to be far superior to flossing with string...</li>
            <li>Works perfectly and does the job Had many negative reviews</li>
            <li>but so far so good.  </li>
            <li>I felt it did a good job, I refilled it once to complete the flossing which took about 5 seconds</li>
            <li>I loved the Waterpik Waterflosser and bought the Cordless PLUS to take on my frequent travel.</li>
            <li>6 months after purchase it won&#x27;t hold a full charge or operate at full power any more.</li>
            <li>There have been many published dental studies (I read about 40 of them on-line in the Journal of Periodontology) that confirm the efficacy of disruption of bacteria whether physically or chemically (by, say, chlorhexidine,) and the PLUS (and Pocket-Pik tip) are good tools in that ongoing war.</li>
            <li>This is much more portable, smaller, but still does a good job.  </li>
            <li>Anything cordless is nice but it is kind of big.</li>
            <li>overall it is good ,after all it&#x27;s cheap !</li>
            <li>Instead I got the Panasonic EW1211, which is a far superior device.</li>
            <li>The second time I used it, I managed to make it HALFWAY THROUGH my top teeth before I laughed at something and water</li>
            <li>I do not have space on my bathroom counter for a bigger machine and need to be able to take it with me for my trips too, so this seems to be a good compromise.</li>
            <li>So far so good...</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, you can put the water very easily, and it have the exact water power for a quick cleaning.</li>
            <li>Rerservoir size, on full power setting, is more than adequate to fully irrigate for me.  </li>
            <li>The company sent me a new one which I was very pleased with.  </li>
            <li>I just took it on a trip to New Orleans and was very pleased with it&#x27;s performance.</li>
            <li>What more can you ask for right?</li>
            <li>and I found the right product, I recommend waterpik :-)</li>
            <li>There is a switch right on the wand where you need it most.</li>
            <li>like this water pink is very good to clean your teeth I recommended.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s great to finally have an easy-to-use portable bidet to help keep myself clean and comfortable.</li>
            <li>keeps the teeth and mouth fresh and clean but be ware not to use it at the sink as you will get wet best to use it in the shower.</li>
            <li>really wish this appliance were designed better, because it does an outstanding job keeping teeth clean.  </li>
            <li>It is true that I have to refill the water reservoir once or twice during each use, but it&#x27;s so easy to fill that I don&#x27;t consider that a problem -- takes just a couple seconds.  </li>
            <li>This makes flossing so much easier!!!</li>
            <li>Really gets between the teeth and into the gum line!!!  </li>
            <li>The water stream is very powerful.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very effective at getting all the gunk out from between my teeth, especially where I have a couple dental crowns.</li>
            <li>My husband,my daughter, my father all find this product very useful in getting into places the floss couldn&#x27;t get.</li>
            <li>It was very powerful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving this 3 stars (being very liberal here), because it is better to travel with than the regular sized Waterpik that I use every day (which I give a perfect &amp;#34;10&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li>Very powerful and substatial.  </li>
            <li>Very powerful cleaning, reach where tooth brush doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>Very powerful for a portable.</li>
            <li>Waterpik Ultra is not the perft whenever you start using it, you will find yourself in need for a higher speed than the highest one on it, it works fine but string flossing is more efficient in the sense of removing food leftovers between your teeth in addition to it</li>
            <li>It was fine for the first couple of weeks, then I found myself charging it more often.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many, mostly the older type, and None have made it for a year yet.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t read any other reviews with this issue, yet find it incredible</li>
            <li>Does what it says it will do.....leaves the mouth and teeth clean and debris free.</li>
            <li>When I first used it I&#x27;d never really used a water pik &amp; it took a while to figure out the best way to go about it...</li>
            <li>Reservoir holds plenty of water for one pass and is easily and quickly refillable.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use and doesn&#x27;t take up much space.  </li>
            <li>The Water Pik works very well and it is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The gadget does not take up too much space on the bathroom counter and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>I just bought this product and love it very much.</li>
            <li>I have been enjoying it very much.  </li>
            <li>Now I just go very fast with it after I brush and refill it 1 or 2 times at most.  </li>
            <li>This one is much, much better; it&#x27;s so easy and fast to use it encourages use every time I brush my teeth.</li>
            <li>Well not only has it helped my gums but it feels good and is easy to do.</li>
            <li>More than once I had to change to dry clothes as I sprayed myself good.  </li>
            <li>Its very powerful and does exactly what he needed, which is to keep his gums clean and healthy.</li>
            <li>This unit is not user friendly.  </li>
            <li>If it does stop working first thing is to make sure the jet isn&#x27;t blocked, any blockage can be removed with a needle or pin.</li>
            <li>So far, my husband and I have been very pleased with it, although it does take some time to get use to using it proficiently.</li>
            <li>And won&#x27;t be able to use the higher speed until we get use to it.</li>
            <li>The cordless water flosser at first glance is an interesting concept.  </li>
            <li>like the idea of the device, but in the end I&#x27;m not sure it was the best use of $100 (we bought two).  </li>
            <li>my dentist says that I will be buried with my original teeth.</li>
            <li>Time will also tell if I experience better dental checkups since using this consistently.</li>
            <li>Since I bought the first one and tried it, I have since bought two more.</li>
            <li>A product well worth the price!</li>
            <li>There is no indicator light or anything to show when the full charge has been reached.</li>
            <li>The product was received in original packaging, but was determined immediately faulty.  </li>
            <li>After thoroughly cleaning and removing the mold when I posted the original review.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I dropped and destroyed the first one.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not disappointed with the cordless waterpik.</li>
            <li>One reviewer commented that this pik is too powerful, even on &amp;#34;low&amp;#34;; I can&#x27;t imagine!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this for over a year and it has made a significant difference in my oral care.  </li>
            <li>my gum condition shows significant improvement in couple</li>
            <li>I was really excited about getting this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure this is the best device for kids but works well for adults if you take the time to use it as designed.  </li>
            <li>They are GREAT... as long as it works.</li>
            <li>I have to say the pump pressure on this newer Plus was better than I remembered when I first used the Plus 2 years ago.</li>
            <li>Not as forceful as the original waterpik model.  </li>
            <li>Skip this one and go for the original waterpik.</li>
            <li>Replacement parts were not being sold for the original unit nor was anything noted on the site about the original model.  </li>
            <li>I originally ordered this for my son who had braces.</li>
            <li>It is worth the price to just dislodge the piece of nut that gets stuck in between the tooth and gum from time to time!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 3/16 to original review (which is below):  I received the replacement from Waterpik.</li>
            <li>Waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;The first can&#x27;t hold energy for more than two days.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>She is really excited about using.the ester pik.</li>
            <li>Originally, I purchased the flosser as an alternative to string floss.</li>
            <li>The makers obviously don&#x27;t use their own product!</li>
            <li>I was excited to purchase this water pick.  </li>
            <li>The product works great, and the battery lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>This water flosser works pretty well, better than the string stuff.</li>
            <li>At the begining when I first started using this product I fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>It works great so long as the charge lasts.  </li>
            <li>I have used waterpik for a long time they are great for keeping the &amp;#34; pockets &amp;#34; below the gums clean i uses mine with some peroxide.  </li>
            <li>This does a great job and is just as powerful as the big one.  </li>
            <li>After using the Waterpik, my mouth and teeth feel exceptionally clean.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t ever keep it clean.</li>
            <li>A portable sink top unit with a longer cord that plugged in would have been a far better solution.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll save the $140.00 and still have clean teeth.</li>
            <li>Not having any way to fully drain and clean the unit seems like a design flaw to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It takes me two to three refills to clean teeth sufficiently.  </li>
            <li>After using the Waterpik, followed by brushing my teeth, they feel as clean as when I go to the dentist.</li>
            <li>I kind of wish I hadn&#x27;t bought it, but I&#x27;ll continue using it for now, and see if my next dental check-up is any better.</li>
            <li>The battery life is sufficient for a weeks worth of flossing and the unit is easy to handle.  </li>
            <li>Use it in conjunction with floss and electric tootbrush and everything seems to come completely clean.  </li>
            <li>Yes, you have to refill it two to three time to thoroughly clean your mouth</li>
            <li>Still, it does seem to clean the debris from between my teeth; we&#x27;ll see what the hygienist&#x27;s verdict is in a couple of months.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for daily use - corded models are more effective.  .</li>
            <li>although the company will replace for free you just go through them too quickly</li>
            <li>makes your teeth feel so clean.</li>
            <li>easy to use, its worth the money.</li>
            <li>but the machine was an eyesore, and a pain to clean out.  </li>
            <li>ilove that i can put peroxide in the mix and use to clean below the gumline.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m repurchasing because of how clean it got my teeth</li>
            <li>and my mouth feels really clean after use,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a chemistry professor and I put it in my office and get some HCl solution to clean up the stain.</li>
            <li>so I have to clean it every week.</li>
            <li>to clean n store would recommend to everyone</li>
            <li>I can now clean all the spaces between all my bridework.</li>
            <li>If you want a clean dental checkup</li>
            <li>and it uses water quickly even when filled to fill capacity.</li>
            <li>I took it to my office and now I don&#x27;t have to worry about a &#x27;clean&#x27; mouth when I go to meetings...</li>
            <li>If you are fortunate enough to have a unit that works, good for you.  </li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t always get between the teeth to clean.  </li>
            <li>Teeth and gums are clean with no pain.  </li>
            <li>I mix mouth wash and water to do the clean.</li>
            <li>Does it clean my teeth - yes</li>
            <li>My teeth and gums are clean all them time.</li>
            <li>and my mouth has never felt this clean before.</li>
            <li>It gets the job done and your mouth feels clean after every use.</li>
            <li>Think your teeth are clean after brushing??  </li>
            <li>Makes your mouth feel so clean.  </li>
            <li>Charges easily and is powerful if you feel you need it.</li>
            <li>All you need is a source of clean water.  </li>
            <li>I fill it at sink lean over clean my teeth to my hearts</li>
            <li>My dentist told me that I had 2mm pockets, but that overall my gums were nice and healthy.</li>
            <li>Mouth feels really clean.</li>
            <li>I bought this along with the plug in unit for a gift - I have had such great success with mine...</li>
            <li>but it will keep your gums and the pockets around them clean.</li>
            <li>feel that my teeth and gums are clean</li>
            <li>I had to fill it 4 times to completely clean my teeth . . .</li>
            <li>It takes more room but it is far better.</li>
            <li>This flosser gets the area between my teeth amazingly clean.  </li>
            <li>Got this to help with keeping braces clean.</li>
            <li>It is nice that it&#x27;s more portable than the regular waterpic.</li>
            <li>It leaves my mouth feeling really clean.</li>
            <li>Using this before you brush gets your mouth so clean....</li>
            <li>, teeth feel so clean.</li>
            <li>Like floss, I just don&#x27;t have a clean mouth with all that stuff between my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think it would be good for traveling, and it does what it said it does, however, it is very bulking in the hand and doesn&#x27;t hold much water.</li>
            <li>The cordless option is very handy, and it does hold a charge for a long while.  </li>
            <li>The older, original model Waterpik with the motor and water tank that sits on the counter top works fine and is the one you should buy.</li>
            <li>Love it, great only for travelling only when used with Hydrogen Peroxide not so good when used with water because I do not get a real clean feeling using water as I do with the larger capcity corded musti-speed Waterflosser.</li>
            <li>The very good reviews now available lead me to believe this is a newer model and with at least the same great performance of my 1270 unit.</li>
            <li>The engineering was abysmal and WaterPik evidently decided it was better to try and unload it in the marketplace and embarrass itself, than to suck it up, work out the bugs, and roll out an adequate model.</li>
            <li>Super portable and great for travel, however, after some time it starts to get yucky and the battery charge doesn&#x27;t hold as long.  </li>
            <li>The big Waterpik machine on our sink at home keeps away the plaque - more important than brushing and flossing, although all three are important for healthy teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to order and was shipped right away.</li>
            <li>found that, because the on/off switch is right in my hand, it&#x27;s easy to do a section at a time, turning it off in between</li>
            <li>I really liked this Waterpik because I don&#x27;t have a counter to put the other kind on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too large, won&#x27;t hold a charge more than 3 days, it won&#x27;t work if it is tilted</li>
            <li>Has a variety of tips for special needs.</li>
            <li>This unit comes with a special tip for implants and crowns, so I use that one.</li>
            <li>Also it looks smart :)</li>
            <li>I liked my original Waterpik much better - the one with the long cord.</li>
            <li>This item does a very good job, is very easy to use, and the charge last a long time.  </li>
            <li>I prefer my older Waterpik WP-70. Much more pressure available.</li>
            <li>I love the clean feeling after using a waterpik and my gums are so much healthier.  </li>
            <li>My father has the older model that must be filled from the top using a cup.  </li>
            <li>finally got around to calling Waterpik&#x27;s 800 Customer service number and have to say I was DELIGHTED that I only had to press one automated prompt, to select the product line...and suddenly, a REAL person was talking to me...a very friendly, helpful and delightful young  lady.</li>
            <li>This handheld, cordless version is light, easy to use and charges pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>I use it at home and hardly ever have to charge it and the size of the water bin is almost perfect.  </li>
            <li>Check out the Shower Flosser online if you want a more powerful water flosser for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I thought this would be a great product and was so happy to find a battery operated water-pik due to the limited counterspace I have inmy bathroom.  </li>
            <li>Waterpik was very courteous and shipped me a whole new package, tips and all, right away.  </li>
            <li>It is underpowered and while is much more convenient that the old Water Pik, it needs to be more powerful</li>
            <li>Until 2 days ago, I still liked the portable WaterPic as much as I did from the first.  </li>
            <li>Nothing to indicate charging is taking place, nothing to indicate a full charge, nothing to indicate a need to charge.  </li>
            <li>It has better pressure and seems to hold just as much water.  </li>
            <li>Unit works very well and i am pleased.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t want the full on reservoir model.  </li>
            <li>The Panasonic however is a true Travel/Portable unit as advertised.</li>
            <li>one year I&#x27;m now experencing a battery that won&#x27;t keep a full charge.  </li>
            <li>Good selection of tips for an individual.</li>
            <li>I am pleased that the product does in fact work very well.  </li>
            <li>It holds enough water to get a good rinse</li>
            <li>(the true results from using it will come in February when I see my dentist for a follow up).</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
            <li>AND Waterpik sometimes, and that is super clean.</li>
            <li>the way, it IS loud, and the tip does rotate on its own.</li>
            <li>I loved the earlier model.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really a good product to rinse in between your teeth, if it would just last.</li>
            <li>Simple comments:  1)  Product does look good  2)  </li>
            <li>dentist told me that the effort to use it will absolutely pay off by producing exceptionally healthy, bacteria-free gums.</li>
            <li>It is a good product, this is my second water pick (cordless)</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;m just spoiled by the full sized Waterpik, but I bought this one to travel with because I have been abusing my full sized by towing it in my travels...</li>
            <li>Using it twice a day with one full water reservoir each time it lasted 5 days.</li>
            <li>With two bridges in my mouth, they are essential to good oral hygiene.</li>
            <li>Still, it looks cool and is cordless...</li>
            <li>Had a full size waterpik</li>
            <li>Much easier to use, which means I use it more often.</li>
            <li>I love this so much that I am buying one for my daughter with braces.  </li>
            <li>But there is a vastly superior system that was designed by a French dentist, Dr. Woog.</li>
            <li>Nothing in between but seems good enough.</li>
            <li>But this one is good to take with you for short trips since it is cordless.</li>
            <li>the true test will be when i go to my dentist for my quarterly cleaning as I&#x27;ve had lots of gum problems,</li>
            <li>(I have to say that Ultra has very very short cord) and it is good to use at home</li>
            <li>But if someone wants to get the backs of their bottom teeth, I&#x27;d love to see how that works.  </li>
            <li>I have had the same person for over 20 years, so she knows my teeth and would be a good judge.  </li>
            <li>You have to really make sure the o-ring catches well.</li>
            <li>she has a full size one by this company and swears by it</li>
            <li>that I  can not recommend the company more highly!.</li>
            <li>According to my dentist Waterpik does a good job of honoring their warranty if I had known enough to call them.</li>
            <li>This prevents overcharging the battery, however the battery is never charged to full capacity.</li>
            <li>The battery lasts several days which is good.  </li>
            <li>It claims it gives &amp;#34;a full 45 seconds&amp;#34; of sonic floss before the container drains.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s good enough to blast the debris from geriatric gums....  </li>
            <li>A full charge will operate the unit for 20 to 30 uses before needing to recharge.</li>
            <li>Initially was good but after using for 10 times it stopped working and need to return it now..</li>
            <li>Good product but battery could last langer.</li>
            <li>I have to recharge it after every 2 or 3 uses (one full reservatory).</li>
            <li>I received it fast and just love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good enough for vacations</li>
            <li>and this is essential to keep those in good condition.    </li>
            <li>I. I truely thought my gums would suffer.</li>
            <li>I CANNOT say enough good stuff about the plug in one.</li>
            <li>The accessories that came with it - 3 extra picks - were good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true --</li>
            <li>I checked and it was full of goop again.</li>
            <li>My 80 year old mother has used a water pik for 40 years and still has ALL of her own teeth.  </li>
            <li>I have had a full sized one at home for years to compare it to.</li>
            <li>Water gets EVERYWHERE - outside and inside, which probably isn&#x27;t good for the hardware.</li>
            <li>I might as well have swished a mouth full of water around in my mouth for 60 seconds.  </li>
            <li>After 6 seconds my mouth is full of water.</li>
            <li>I very recoment this product :)</li>
            <li>Fresher breath and super clean gums and teeth.</li>
            <li>i love this so much..... 5 star</li>
            <li>We bought 3 so far, so everybody in the household has its own.</li>
            <li>, I keep the battery over 50% full.</li>
            <li>, I would recommend the regular counter top unit with the larger reservoir, but this one is ideal for travel.</li>
            <li>I bought the WP450 cordless model in June 2012, after repeated 6-month dentist appointments with ever deepening \\&quot;pockets\\&quot; and me saying: OK, I&#x27;ll try harder, brush better, floss better/more often, reach those corners better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a function-over-almost-anything kind of person, so the benefits far outweigh that trait of the appliance.  </li>
            <li>This model is a superior product compared to the basic model.</li>
            <li>Good while they last</li>
            <li>Was working good for 4 months, then pump wont pump water anymore it just died all of sudden.</li>
            <li>I put in my cap full of mouth wash and its all done.</li>
            <li>but now I use it on full power and there is no gum bleeding so it is working.  </li>
            <li>Every flaw you&#x27;ve read about is true.  </li>
            <li>I found the Waterpik Waterflosser Cordless handy, but the batteries got defective after a few months, so you need to charge the unit more and more often.</li>
            <li>OK but doesn&#x27;t really have a lot of force.  </li>
            <li>He named replacement parts that will fit and extend the life of this useful appliance.</li>
            <li>I have about 11 seconds of cool, watery burst.</li>
            <li>The pressure coming out of it is not what it needs to be to clean your teeth and the amount of water it holds runs out quickly.</li>
            <li>PLUGGED IN FULL TIME.</li>
            <li>You can mix listerine and water in there for a more intense cleaning</li>
            <li>mouth was definitely super clean.  </li>
            <li>mouth was definitely super clean.  </li>
            <li>it is a good product overall.</li>
            <li>Good overall product.</li>
            <li>and I always doubt it is doing as good a job as regular dental floss,</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any problems out of the battery life but would love to know how much power is remaining</li>
            <li>I love this one so much....</li>
            <li>Love this thing, really cleans out every thing between my teeth, dentist said to keep up what ever I am doing, my check-ups and cleanings have improved.</li>
            <li>minutes/two full cleanings.</li>
            <li>The only good thing I see in this product is for traveling.</li>
            <li>I think :) because it&#x27;s gentle on the gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not too large, easy to pack, and reasonably light in weight.</li>
            <li>Works better than the original even when the original was new.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m switching to the Panasonic which appears to be more portable and it uses batteries so that you don&#x27;t have to throw away a mechanically sound device because you can&#x27;t put a new battery in it.  </li>
            <li>of the box, it looks and feels like the kind of thing a dentist would use -- solid, well-built, easy to operate, and came with everything needed.  </li>
            <li>The issue with having to refill several times while \\&quot;water flossing\\&quot;, gets better as you become more familiar with product.</li>
            <li>I am used to the standard models which use much more water force to get between the teeth and clean more the pockets.</li>
            <li>Great for bridges and other dental work.</li>
            <li>Ok maybe after 3 months I don&#x27;t know what I am in for, I only use one tank full most of the time.</li>
            <li>Other than that, great product.</li>
            <li>Other than that, the water pick is great and priced correctly from my perspective.</li>
            <li>None of the problems experienced by the other buyers have even been an issue.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;To be fair, I liked the shuttering steam of water instead of steady one as other product.</li>
            <li>I love my new Waterpik!</li>
            <li>Bottom line is this is a huge improvement over the counter top models of old.</li>
            <li>The waterpik waterflosser cordless helps me to keep a clean, fresh tooth and mouth after each of meal.</li>
            <li>This waterflosser works well and leaves mouth feeling fresh and clean.   </li>
            <li>It makes my mouth feel fresh and clean even after brushing.</li>
            <li>I purchased a waterpikand it gave up, luckily before the guarantee ran out</li>
            <li>Will you pay for shipping both ways and ensure a quick turnaround</li>
            <li>Try to stop viewing this thing as a quick, one-handed, gadget that works on</li>
            <li>Water can deplete quickly.  </li>
            <li>I wanted a product that would make it fun (especially for my spouse) to continue good oral hygiene.</li>
            <li>Not as much power as a regular pik but works good and packs easily.  </li>
            <li>It comes with more tips than the classic, and it does save a lot of space.    </li>
            <li>but will do a quick cleaning on the go.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, the 450 seems to work adequately.  </li>
            <li>Having had some form of waterpik from their beginning many years back, I have watched their models evolve and purchased many over the years.  </li>
            <li>My main source of delight with the company is that it dealt with my issue quickly, efficiently, and appropriately.</li>
            <li>I am feeling some improvement in how the gums feel and it becomes easier to use rather quickly.</li>
            <li>but I quickly got the hang of it.  </li>
            <li>I do feel I get an adequate cleaning with the water/time allotted.  </li>
            <li>Use it everyday and it has helped my gums so much that my dentist is impressed.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;It goes quickly, cleans thoroughly and easier than flossing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is s portable one and the reservoir drains of water too quickly.  </li>
            <li>She paused after about 15 seconds, looked at the chart, started scraping for about 10 more seconds, stopped and asked if I was using a different tooth brush or flossed more often.  </li>
            <li>I suppose I&#x27;m lucky, mine lasted longer than others.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that the charger operates on 120V only, regardless that device is perfect for traveling.</li>
            <li>I contacted them because the Waterpik did not seem to have adequate water pressure.</li>
            <li>BATTERY DRAINS QUICKLY</li>
            <li>I purchased this Waterpik several weeks ago and could not be more pleased.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really a shame because this is a great product but doesn&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li>Most people travel overseas now and this charge can be used only in countries with 110v and not in countries with 220v (ie most countries).</li>
            <li>This is my third Waterpik and they just keep getting better and better.</li>
            <li>While cleaning the pressure was super and</li>
            <li>Water runs out of the tank quite fast but the rest is so far so good.</li>
            <li>, how quickly it cycles through the water.</li>
            <li>Battery dies quickly.</li>
            <li>battery self-discharges quickly.</li>
            <li>The water capacity is adequate.</li>
            <li>I thought this would be more convenient than my older model that plugs in to the wall and has a rectangular reservoir for water.  </li>
            <li>After using one of the extra tips, my husband was so impressed that I ordered a second unit for him.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hold adequate quantity of water for one session.</li>
            <li>yes, the water does run out quick</li>
            <li>The water seems to be used up too quickly.</li>
            <li>Battery dies quickly</li>
            <li>had to refill it FOUR times just to QUICKLY cover all 4 quadrants of my mouth.  </li>
            <li>This item came quickly and I was amazed at how well it works.</li>
            <li>like the older model better</li>
            <li>This smaller model is perfect for travel, or for your younger family members ...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Within about a week of using the device, the power started to fall off quickly between charges.  </li>
            <li>For the people that say it runs out of water to quick and you have to refill...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll fill up your mouth quite quickly, so you need to remember to spit often.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll fill up your mouth quite quickly, so you need to remember to spit often.</li>
            <li>Obviously, the wired water pic is still the best, but the cordless is an adequate substitute for those times when we are traveling and have no access to the traditional product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It does work QUICKLY</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does work QUICKLY</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;to run out much to quickly.  </li>
            <li>I love it as its much more coveenent than the larger ones.</li>
            <li>Does a super job of cleaning.</li>
            <li>am so grateful to be able to have a decent waterpik while travelling.</li>
            <li>So....&lt;br /&gt;I brought it back where I bought it and just ordered the Aquarius from Amazon, hoping it will be better with a more powerfull waterflosser.</li>
            <li>adequate but spray could be stronger</li>
            <li>I think I could ever get from my him: &amp;#34;I wish more people had such healthy gums like you</li>
            <li>but then my mouth fills up with water quickly</li>
            <li>Received super quick and works very, very well!</li>
            <li>I am confident that the High level will be sufficient when I build up some tolerance.  </li>
            <li>We love the cordless waterpik waterflosser and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly suggest this product be used for a much better cleaning of the teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>Works better on high speed</li>
            <li>Aside from that, the system was exceptionally durable and lasted 9 years with only one change of tubing, which unfortunately is no longer available.</li>
            <li>, I used this water pick about 3 times a day, hold the charge for a long time and it a great product for anybody that that wants to keep your gums and teeth clean.</li>
            <li>I love this new rechargeable model because of the decrease in counter clutter, ease of filling/emptying, and it has lasted the full week without recharging.  </li>
            <li>It holds just the right amount of water for me to clean all my teeth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve informed them of the problem repeatedly, and even got them to replace that first one under warranty, but they&#x27;ve done nothing to fix this huge issue.  </li>
            <li>at first thought it was going to be cheap , because of price.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied overall, and I look forward to having healthier teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>I bought this waterpik about 7 or 8 months ago and was actually very pleased with it until recently.  </li>
            <li>Much more convenient than the old countertop model that took up so much space and made much more noise.</li>
            <li>(O:&lt;br /&gt;also its alot more powerful than the 360 and holds just enough more water to make it a one-run through for me.</li>
            <li>Better than floss; makes my teeth and gums feel squeaky clean, and the smaller one I have packs up easily for travelling.</li>
            <li>it is more compact but still the same great quality as the larger models.  </li>
            <li>Last month I purchased the Cordless Plus and am very pleased.</li>
            <li>Good power and holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li>Good power and holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li>I purchased a used or display model at discount and paid dearly for the good deal in the long run.  </li>
            <li>The force of the water is not as strong as the full size model, but it still works better than just brushing or just flossing, especially with my braces.</li>
            <li>I have a the regular waterpik ultra flosser (countertop version) at home, but this is good enough and most importantly portable.</li>
            <li>By whittling some plastic away I made a better connector from the Radio Shack parts and now the Waterpiks work like new.     </li>
            <li>I love my new Waterpik Waterflosser Cordless PLUS&lt;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m enjoying the new tips that come with it.</li>
            <li>I WILL LOOK INTO REPLACING THE BATTERY AND SEE IF THIS IS A BETTER SOLUTION THAN BUYING A NEW ONE, SINCE THEY HAVE UPDATED THE MODEL.</li>
            <li>I WILL LOOK INTO REPLACING THE BATTERY AND SEE IF THIS IS A BETTER SOLUTION THAN BUYING A NEW ONE, SINCE THEY HAVE UPDATED THE MODEL.</li>
            <li>I may try one more time with a new one</li>
            <li>So this WATERPIK is my new love.  </li>
            <li>The Waterpik is able to reach below the gum line and new studies in periodontal health show that adding a 1/4 teaspoon of household bleach to the water will reduce the bacterial colony.  </li>
            <li>I really love the new portable waterpik flosser.</li>
            <li>Initially it was pretty good.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use and very convenient.  </li>
            <li>Is easy to use and reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to manage and does not take up too much space.</li>
            <li>, it is really easy, painless and very efficient.</li>
            <li>If you have strong gums, however, then yes, I would believe this flosser works quite well without much pain.</li>
            <li>It is very convienent to take while traveling and will packs easily.</li>
            <li>I took the easy route and purchased what had been working very well.</li>
            <li>The first one also had a leaking water reservoir which meant emptying it after each use (which isn&#x27;t a big deal and is probably a good idea anyways).  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s pretty good overall</li>
            <li>The Hi/Low switch feels cheap and almost like a fisher price kind of switch, it does not clearly click into one position or the other&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>The high/low switch is particularly awkward since it doesn&#x27;t have a good &#x27;click&#x27; when it engages.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that this is an excellent product I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It is a good alternative to having the plug in the wall unit if you are limited with space.</li>
            <li>I had considered sending it back but decided it was better than nothing!    </li>
            <li>My dentist told me last week that my gums look so healthy!</li>
            <li>It looks and works exactly like the write up said!  </li>
            <li>The photo on the box looks exactly like the original unit</li>
            <li>Back to manual until someone has a better product!</li>
            <li>highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>Lol made a mess at frst.</li>
            <li>Very please with item!!</li>
            <li>The new unit works great and have had no further issues.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Exhanged it for new  corded model whose performance is far superior.</li>
            <li>This model is easy to use, has a better hand grip and a longer lasting battery.</li>
            <li>I try and dry it out the best I can after each use but still think it might have some future problems.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for cleaning between two teeth that are too tight to get floss between.</li>
            <li>The hygienist said that my gums were in excellent health and there was almost no plaque, so very little scraping!!</li>
            <li>The water reservoir holds just about the right amount of water for a quick cleaning and refilling</li>
            <li>The cordless unit doesn&#x27;t have as much power as my old plug-in model, but the convenience of storing it out of sight and being able to easily travel with it warrants 4 stars.  </li>
            <li>This is the first tool I have ever had to clean my teeth this way so perhaps all of them do as well.  </li>
            <li>When my original WaterPik died I decided I wanted something that wouldn&#x27;t take up so much space on my counter that the full sized unit did.  </li>
            <li>Applied good old fashioned electrical grade CRC to the charging points and rubbed with an old toothbrush and Voila!  </li>
            <li>but I certainly thought it was important to do so this time.</li>
            <li>It is a great little machine and has helped improve my oral hygiene already.</li>
            <li>Great little device.</li>
            <li>The minor element of having to refill is easily offset by the comfortable size that fits easily in the hand.</li>
            <li>Takes up so little counter top space, always handy and the convenience of not having a tube connected to the dispenser.  </li>
            <li>After a few days, I&#x27;m happy I decided to switch.</li>
            <li>I would have also appreciated a light on it somewhere to let me know the charging status.</li>
            <li>It really is amazing what is left even after you brush with a toothbrush or a sonicare tooth brush.</li>
            <li>It has worked great for the few months</li>
            <li>Amazing product, personal dentist at home</li>
            <li>This Product is really noisy and huge size.</li>
            <li>How much could it hurt to include a charge indicator light on this thing.</li>
            <li>This works very well and seems to get into crevices where floss never seemed to fit.</li>
            <li>Furthermore, there are inconveniences: for example, since the tank is detachable, one would expect to be able to fill the tank at the sink and then reattach it to the body, but the tank leaks water in this case because WaterPik didn&#x27;t see fit to put a simple valve on the tank&#x27;s water output.</li>
            <li>Not as powerful as a plug in model but gets the job done if you&#x27;re on the road.</li>
            <li>That makes it worth the price</li>
            <li>Brush your tooth only is not enough to keep the good, healthy tooth.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After each use I run it until its as empty as possible and shake out any remaining water as best</li>
            <li>went with the Waterpik brand because I expected such a long-respected brand would be the best.  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve enjoyed it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as powerful as the countertop version</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still learning how to use this properly buy so far I think it does a great job.</li>
            <li>they are not, this is just not as powerful.  </li>
            <li>This makes flossing fun, not a chore anymore.  </li>
            <li>I let it charge a full 24 hours before my first use.  </li>
            <li>Not as powerful as stationary Waterpik</li>
            <li>It does not feel as strong as the older model I had.</li>
            <li>Worth it ?</li>
            <li>and Wow, I love it.</li>
            <li>Anyone with a teen and braces who won&#x27;t floss should try and make their own opinion.</li>
            <li>It is fun to use.</li>
            <li>It is much, much better than the old design.</li>
            <li>This smaller unit will be nice for traveling.  </li>
            <li>For once, flossing is fun.  </li>
            <li>At a price of about $40, it&#x27;s well worth $20 per year.</li>
            <li>The powerful water jet cleans below the gumline, between teeth where dental floss can not reach.</li>
            <li>After the cleaning leaves fresh breath.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t laugh.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There seems to be a whole debate about whether this is good enough to replace flossing.</li>
            <li>I liked this product overall even though it was bulky</li>
            <li>It seems to do at least as good of a job as floss - and perhaps better as I just had a dental cleaning</li>
            <li>/&gt;Swivel head is useful</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as powerful as stationary models but that&#x27;s what you get with cordless.</li>
            <li>The water container is bigger that the another model of this kind.</li>
            <li>( but when I do use it it&#x27;s fun</li>
            <li>but so far it&#x27;s been OK (almost a month of use).  </li>
            <li>The battery life isn&#x27;t long but it does do a pretty good job.</li>
            <li>actual product is pretty good, pretty useful</li>
            <li>It comes with multiple tips, which is nice.  </li>
            <li>MY mouth feels so fresh after I use my Waterpik.  </li>
            <li>Its value is well worth the cost.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>I also have a larger stand alone model which has more power, it really jets the water out with more pressure than this hand held</li>
            <li>I let the battery completely discharge through use, then fully recharge on the charger overnight for more than 12 hours.    </li>
            <li>Not as powerful as the electric water pick.  </li>
            <li>I love the waterpik and it is a complete must have item if you have braces.</li>
            <li>I want to use fresh water every time.</li>
            <li>Powerful</li>
            <li>and it rarely needs charging..  </li>
            <li>I feel that it was worth buying .</li>
            <li>If you want to push it against the teeth, then you can easily use one finger to steady it</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t worry, I will come back and adjust my review after I have tried this product and give an honest review on how well this product performs.</li>
            <li>The water flow is strong, particularly from the narrowest tip</li>
            <li>So now I rarely use it.</li>
            <li>We like this much better than the old waterpik with the wand.</li>
            <li>For me ... I would give 3 stars because it was not as powerful as I wanted.</li>
            <li>It holds 40 seconds worth of water,  and that is all you need.</li>
            <li>It is worth the effort.&lt;br /&gt;-You</li>
            <li>It will never charge up again to be useful.</li>
            <li>Although I liked the features of the Waterpik and its effectiveness, I think I will go back to Panasonic.</li>
            <li>The motor runs faster and the pump puts out a far better stream of water.  </li>
            <li>Does not seem quite as powerful as my corded one used at home, but should serve the purpose as a portable water pik.</li>
            <li>I would buy this again if it quit because I feel I&#x27;ve already gotten my monies worth from it.</li>
            <li>I got my money worth</li>
            <li>As far as I know the recipient has had no problems with this device and is pleased with it&#x27;s performance.</li>
            <li>We will see how effective it is on my next visit to the dentist.</li>
            <li>It would be nice to have a third setting for even stronger pressure.</li>
            <li>It is so much better; no messy container to fill with water-</li>
            <li>In a very short time I have come to wanting to use it every night before bed for the comfortable refreshing feeling that then accompanies me when falling to sleep.</li>
            <li>have the latest Waterpik complete</li>
            <li>*smile*</li>
            <li>I like the product and find I use it more often than the old corded style because I can take it into the shower.  </li>
            <li>compact, powerful and customizable.  </li>
            <li>It takes up no space in the bathroom, and it has a variety of useful tips.</li>
            <li>I opted for warm water and then poured some mouthwash in there -- worked terrific and my mouth felt like I&#x27;d just come from the hygienist.  </li>
            <li>I opted for warm water and then poured some mouthwash in there -- worked terrific and my mouth felt like I&#x27;d just come from the hygienist.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kinda nice, but way too big for traveling...</li>
            <li>First, I brush with toothpaste and my sonicare for the full 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li>It is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>such a nice product but</li>
            <li>I am enjoying my new handheld Waterpik very much.  </li>
            <li>It does not hold as much water and the water pressure is not quite as high as the AC units, but all is more than adequate.  </li>
            <li>I rather my have healthy strong guns and not lose teeth than to have a minor convenience.</li>
            <li>If only it was a bit more reliable and user friendly.  </li>
            <li>Great clean for hard spots</li>
            <li>There are only two pressure settings on this waterflosser, so I would advise getting the original one that has 10 settings (or however many settings it has).</li>
            <li>LOVE THE CORDLESS WATERPIK WATERFLOSSER, IT ACTUALLY MAKES FLOSSING FUN!</li>
            <li>This handy cordless water floss prove to be a very hygienic tool I use it daily to Clean my tooth</li>
            <li>The first one we had corroded fairly quickly and became unusable because it stopped charging.</li>
            <li>It took several days for me to develop a technique that allowed me to both clean my teeth comfortably and not squirt the bathroom walls!  </li>
            <li>It is okay, but I still find myself using  a dental tool such as a pick to clean between my teeth.  </li>
            <li>Personally for my teeth, I still like floss and don&#x27;t find it to be a replacement but an additional way to be sure my teeth are sqeaky clean.</li>
            <li>I used to use regular floss all the time, but this product can clean even better.</li>
            <li>Left my mouth feeling clean and healthy.  </li>
            <li>but with braces I use it more than if I didn&#x27;t have so much extra to clean around. :</li>
            <li>I refill the water chamber twice, sometimes three times, but this is no big deal; I just love the clean feeling, plus I eat a lot of fibrous veggies and fruits.  </li>
            <li>Make sure and clean it regularly like the instructions say, by running a capful of vinegar with water through the machine to keep it from clogging.</li>
            <li>It holds enough water to clean a row of teeth real quick.</li>
            <li>My dental hygienist recommended using the Water Pik for an even better daily clean &amp;  flossing.</li>
            <li>and it really leaves your mouth feeling totally clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>The Waterpik feels really good, and my gums are healthier, particularly my one problem deep pocket.  </li>
            <li>While it is larger than I had hoped, the Waterpik Ultra puts out a powerful stream of water comperable to the full size counter top waterpiks.</li>
            <li>Very reliable, holds a charge a long time, overall great product!  </li>
            <li>What they don&#x27;t tell you, however, is that you absolutely need a small hand towel handy to catch all the dribbles as you&#x27;re learning to use this handy tool.</li>
            <li>Since my other waterflosser is a shower device, this seemed a good option.</li>
            <li>I run white vinegar through and then three more times with clear water and the unit is good as new.</li>
            <li>I like the idea of using it in the shower, as the water is already warm and no worries about the mess (the easy to read instructions suggest keeping the unit upright</li>
            <li>My tips stays right where it should.</li>
            <li>My tips stays right where it should.</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>Use your right hand to hold the unit and turn it off (your right thumb sits over the OFF switch.</li>
            <li>If you get the unit (which I still recommend) spray the brass posts with WD-40 right away</li>
            <li>The water resovoir is just about right and won&#x27;t spill if held at angles.</li>
            <li>The built-in reservoir seems to be just the right size.</li>
            <li>After all, if your going to take the time to use a waterpik, may as well do it right.  </li>
            <li>I just tested the strenght of the water pressure and noticed the leaking right away.  </li>
            <li>The tank for the water is right there on the flosser.</li>
            <li>I wish Waterpik would do this right.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I was holding it at the right angle</li>
            <li>One thing I will comment on right now though, is the water pressure.</li>
            <li>Some reviews I read questioned water pressure adequacy, but I think it&#x27;s just right.  </li>
            <li>But if you do it right, 30 seconds is enough.&lt;br</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>If I run out of water, I&#x27;m right there at the faucet</li>
            <li>I would have returned this right away.</li>
            <li>Maybe I haven&#x27;t figured out the right way to perform this...</li>
            <li>right way.\\</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s just the right amount of water in the container.  </li>
            <li>And the price is right.</li>
            <li>The unit would not charge right from the start.</li>
            <li>price was right and for dental implants this was recommended by the dentist</li>
            <li>just right&#x27;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have braces and this product cleaned out the food particles right out between my teeth.  </li>
            <li>The price was right for a handheld.</li>
            <li>it takes some practice before getting it right in the mouth.</li>
            <li>The water resivoir is just right</li>
            <li>you and right pice.a a</li>
            <li>Great pick with a large reservoir that lasts long enough to clean all my teeth and still fits under the sink!</li>
            <li>product is really useful for doing a great flossing job - there&#x27;s not much more to say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really like the clean feeling</li>
            <li>I have to fill the tank twice to clean my whole mouth.  </li>
            <li>refill is required to clean your whole mouth.</li>
            <li>Water splashing everywhere, and you have to refill the water about 4-6 times to get your whole mouth clean.  </li>
            <li>These clean your teeth and gums very well.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have any kind of battery indicator, so you have to guess at that, but it is pretty obvious when it needs to be charged.  </li>
            <li>the real problem with this model is that you cannot clean the reservoir.  </li>
            <li>It really helps keep my teeth clean since I am wearing braces now</li>
            <li>but I was hoping for a &#x27;whole mouth clean&#x27; which will require an additional 25% over the selling price of the item for something I thought I had already paid for.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even when I first started I had virtually no pain in those most sensitive areas of my gums.  </li>
            <li>You really have to make an effort to get in there with a brush and some bleach to clean it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really helps to clean out particles of food.</li>
            <li>It works well, and is very helpful to keep my teeth clean.</li>
            <li>The only drawback I found is the reservoir needs to be refilled before I am done, but this is true of most mostt portables.  </li>
            <li>This was a great little water pik!  </li>
            <li>I was able to complete the flossing with a single filling and found the cleaning to be really effective.</li>
            <li>Because I like a lower pressure pulse and my husband likes a higher, this unit is ideal, since it has a switch that offers high or low pressure.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to fill and take in the shower to use - you can then refill if you like and use a second time.</li>
            <li>Even with an Oral-B motorized brush, this waterflosser does an excellent job in cleaning between teeth down deep in crevices.</li>
            <li>As long as this is charged up, it has a good force to clean near implants or spacing between tooth.</li>
            <li>and i absolutely cann&#x27;t live without it :)...</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used and loved a conventional corded Waterpik for years.  </li>
            <li>I guess if it were a little more powerful it would be better.</li>
            <li>The Waterpick is easy and comfortable to use and it is very obvious every time I use it that it is doing its job.</li>
            <li>Not made like the home model, portable could be better designed, better than previous models.  </li>
            <li>I &amp;#34;trained&amp;#34; the battery carefully, but a greater problem is the location of the socket for the charger, which is placed where water can easily get into it.  </li>
            <li>I love being able to use right in the shower and not having to worry about a mess.  </li>
            <li>Reservoir is adequate, pressure is barely adequate (on high setting).</li>
            <li>It looks great, so I can leave it on my bathroom counter if I choose, but I usually store it under the sink.    </li>
            <li>Its pretty powerful.  </li>
            <li>second problem I have is switched over to only using waterpick instead of flossing, because on the package it claims to be more effective than flossing.  </li>
            <li>Amazing I can&#x27;t believe I went so long without using one, thank goodness</li>
            <li>I was expecting a more powerful stream, this doesn&#x27;t seem powerful enough to do anything.</li>
            <li>The container runs out of water too quickly and I have to refill once or twice.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this unless you&#x27;re using it on a T-Rex or someone with an exceptionally large mouth.</li>
            <li>Now there is a nice tight fit with the charging unit.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Not a good road to go down, unless you admire the toothless hillbilly look.</li>
            <li>The water pressure is just not there, and even when the reservoir is full, it doesn&#x27;t clean my teeth the way my old one did.  </li>
            <li>Love 99% of it,,,,wish it held just a little more water.  </li>
            <li>I usually add some Listerine in my warm water and after that my mouth feels so clean!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is also good for tight spaces and when I get some food stuck that I can&#x27;t get to, because I just pot it in, push it to on, and it gets it right</li>
            <li>However, my new condo has a fancy faucet that doesn&#x27;t fit that device.  </li>
            <li>A NEW UNIT FREE OF CHARGE, CALL THEM AT 1-800-525-2774,</li>
            <li>it right in the shower and fill it up every morning.&lt;br /&gt;Use hot water</li>
            <li>Replaced totally the good old dental floss by this device.  </li>
            <li>working great for the last 7 years!!!!!!!!!!e WP-360 and about the same pressure as the Panasonic model.</li>
            <li>I used the flosser just about everyday, once a day for about six months before my regular cleaning, the cleaning was the best cleaning I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>The 450 is great as the reservoir is larger and charge last longer.  </li>
            <li>Hydrofloss makes a more powerful, larger resevoir unit but has issues during trips (parts break).  </li>
            <li>(TIPS ALSO MORE POWERFUL) in which case I would have gotten a different model.</li>
            <li>You should be able to snap out the bottom of the reservoir in order to thoroughly dry it after each use, or else Waterpik should provide a flexible brush that can be pushed into the reservoir to clean it</li>
            <li>My dentist recommended the waterpik for my daily dental care, so I bought one for myself and I liked it so much I bought one for my husband</li>
            <li>So far good, will see how well it is working when I go back for a check up.  </li>
            <li>It works beautifully in the beginning and then the charge doesn&#x27;t last as long as it should, and then it dies.  </li>
            <li>I previously had a portable Panasonic, which I loved, but after a year the plastic started creating an odor.  </li>
            <li>I discarded the unit and replaced it with a standard Interplak (non-rechargable) - so far, so good.</li>
            <li>probably not a serious issue if you&#x27;re keeping them clean, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t contact Waterpik because frankly my time is worth more than sitting on the phone or packing the thing up and sending it back.  </li>
            <li>does a great job and has multiple tips for different uses.</li>
            <li>It has 2 settings (use the lighter one if you are new to water piks!!!)</li>
            <li>I use it on high, and if that won&#x27;t clean your teeth</li>
            <li>/&gt;The higher settings can almost be painful, so be sure to start it on the lower settings until you find what suits you best.</li>
            <li>It is easily refilled if it runs out of water, so feel free to take as long as you like.</li>
            <li>I use the full power setting, and it seems to have enough power with a fairly strong jet.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I think this is a good product for the lazy and those mildly concerned about their dental health.</li>
            <li>Very Very clunky item.  </li>
            <li>He said flossing alone would not help very much and to start using the Water Pik.  </li>
            <li>He likes it very much.</li>
            <li>very very convenient.</li>
            <li>The fact that it&#x27;s portable is very, very convenient.  </li>
            <li>With single full charge, you will be able to use it for about 40 tull-tank usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But, I promptly ordered a new one as I really am convinced that using this daily has improved the health of my gums (and my dentist told me my gums looked really good).  </li>
            <li>So far, it works just fine.</li>
            <li>and so far it works fine.  </li>
            <li>A telephone call to Waterpik was answered promptly, and a friendly agent sent me a new unit.</li>
            <li>They both worked great, but died after a few years of steady use.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to fill and, if you leave the stopper open, it dries out quickly.  </li>
            <li>Even with a full charge and on high pressure it won&#x27;t penetrate gums or between teeth.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone because flossing really is important and this makes it not so much of a chore.</li>
            <li>so it is sometimes hard to keep in position to spray properly, the pressure is okay for somebody who has sensitive gums, which waterpiks are great for, but I doubt the high setting on this are more than a 5 or 6 on the ultra model (which goes up to 10.)</li>
            <li>The company was kind enough to replace it for free, the second time I needed a new cord because the original didnt charge the thing.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I am pretty happy with this product and feel that it is worth getting a little wet to have good gum health.</li>
            <li>I purchased this because I felt like I needed it to really clean around the crowns on new dental implants</li>
            <li>Too much pressure!</li>
            <li>The waterpik waterflosser is exactly what i wanted.  </li>
            <li>I have the big Waterpic and it just had a lot stronger water jet, which did a better job of cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>It works ok but my recollection of the waterpik from 20 years ago was much different.</li>
            <li>I will most likely put the waterpik in the Goodwill bin.</li>
            <li>would make them more reliable and last a lot longer.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it, there was a lot of blood because of the plaque being dislodged...</li>
            <li>My first one lasted for 3 months, then it wouldn&#x27;t take a charge anymore.</li>
            <li>My first one lasted one year before it stopped charging - I suspect the battery got corroded from water getting into it.  </li>
            <li>Price is ~70% higher than the</li>
            <li>It has two settings and is way better then the WP-360 and about the same pressure as the Panasonic model.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different ways of holding it</li>
            <li>I found this to be really convenient and fun to use.  </li>
            <li>I first brush and then use the pik</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to return this and try the larger counter top size.</li>
            <li>This is my first Waterpik</li>
            <li>This thing feels like a sand blaster the first time.</li>
            <li>If you need to refill it, flip the cap open and put in more hot water.</li>
            <li>I should have read the reviews first.</li>
            <li>I bought this model and the Ultra regular; that was OK</li>
            <li>Price is ~70% higher than the WP-360   </li>
            <li>It has two settings and is way better then the WP-360 and about the same pressure as the Panasonic model.</li>
            <li>You couldn&#x27;t possibly need more pressure.      </li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t use this as a floss replacement -- I use this before I floss, and I find that it makes flossing much easier and rarely does anything come out on the floss).</li>
            <li>The regular model does a much better job.</li>
            <li>You can buy a replacement reservoir for about $11  - not very cost effective.</li>
            <li>The only imporovement would be if it held more water.</li>
            <li>Getting the front surfaces of your teeth are fairly easy and not real messy but the inside surfaces are another story all together.  </li>
            <li>Thanks WaterPik!    JTB</li>
            <li>The plug gets really hot, but the flosser won&#x27;t charge even after 2 days of being plugged in.  </li>
            <li>and I was the first to use it.</li>
            <li>I was in Europe for 2 weeks and flossed twice a day most days and the battery still had some power when I got back.</li>
            <li>is the only redeeming feature)</li>
            <li>This has a bigger tank to hold more water &amp; it is cordless.  </li>
            <li>Most of my travels take me overseas where 110v is not the standard but 220v.  </li>
            <li>I was concerned about leaks developing, as the plug design seemed pretty flimsy.    </li>
            <li>Stopped working after the first week</li>
            <li>Does exactly what I had hoped for.  </li>
            <li>Much funner than flossing!</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with this Waterpik.  </li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li>This seems to do exactly what it is supposed to do.  </li>
            <li>When first started using it-</li>
            <li>The instructions seems to say you only need to do outside/in - but it seems to be more thorough doing both.  </li>
            <li>Hope WaterPik does a better job next time.....</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Might be pretty loud for some (electric toothbrush sound level)&lt;br</li>
            <li>More than enough to do the job.  </li>
            <li>First using it in a more standard situation and now with braces.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used numerous waterpiks that were corded, and were much better.  </li>
            <li>I purchased my WP-455W, in Orlando, FL @ Wallmart on a vacation trip as I left my counter top unit at home and needed one as a vacation back-up.  </li>
            <li>To compare with the regular waterflosser with cord, it is just OK level.</li>
            <li>and see what they are willing to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even putting hot glue or tape to seal the bottom shut didnt work.</li>
            <li>The attached tank holds enough water for me to do the top of my mouth.   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a user of the counter-top Waterpik, which I love, but this travel doesn&#x27;t do the same job.</li>
            <li>First of all, the Waterpik is a MUST if you have dental braces, as I do.</li>
            <li>But even when my braces are removed I will continue to use this product, as it really gives your teeth  a powerful and thorough cleaning before brushing.  </li>
            <li>This is what I needed the first time</li>
            <li>Once for top outer, another tank for top inner, then the same on the bottom.  </li>
            <li>Both are pretty noisy and your going to get water all over the place.  </li>
            <li>the appliance does exactly what it should do.</li>
            <li>FAST SHIPPING!  </li>
            <li>I bought my first waterflosser in August this year.</li>
            <li>OK, lotsa fluid on yer hand &amp; the machine.</li>
            <li>I really like it a lot!</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon and Waterpik!</li>
            <li>My gut feeling tells me that most will do the same.</li>
            <li>The Hydrofloss is much larger than the Pik, so it takes up more room on the vanity, and it has a cord.</li>
            <li>What, exactly, is the purpose of this product?</li>
            <li>the water flosser actually made them feel a bit better :</li>
            <li>When I first tried this item, it did not seem that it was working that</li>
            <li>The first couple of times you may want to use this in the shower until you get used to it.  </li>
            <li>Immediately after using the Water Pik Waterflosser Cordless Plus for the first time, I used string floss to see if anything had been missed, and surprise --</li>
            <li>and I actually make sure my sink is spotless so I can see the results.    </li>
            <li>, I wonder why Waterpik didn&#x27;t do this in the first place?  </li>
            <li>sure enough, one of the prong had water corrosion.</li>
            <li>I love the waterpik and use it daily.  </li>
            <li>I first used WaterPik as a teenager when I had braces.</li>
            <li>Price is ~70% higher than the</li>
            <li>This was my first water pik</li>
            <li>I went ahead,ordered one and gave it a whirl and used it twice today for the first time.  </li>
            <li>The first one I bought didn&#x27;t work and needed to be returned.  </li>
            <li>So, thinking it might work OK anyhow, I settled for one of these Water Pik Watterflosser cordless plus hand-held rechargeable units.  </li>
            <li>;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can swish water around my mouth with more force than the low setting generates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After the two weeks of using it, I went to my 6-month checkup and didn&#x27;t say anything at first.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powerful and really gets everything out from between your teeth.</li>
            <li>I really like it!  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even have to tell her that I tried first Amazon on Sunday who advised me to call Waterpik first in order to get this resolved.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even have to tell her that I tried first Amazon on Sunday who advised me to call Waterpik first in order to get this resolved.</li>
            <li>Evidently I have had this 2013.</li>
            <li>I did prefer the water pic as I felt I had more flexibility of working specific areas.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>At first this unit would stay charged for about a week.</li>
            <li>It seems to hold more water than his last one.</li>
            <li>None have lasted a year, even though I have followed the charging directions exactly.  </li>
            <li>I love my regular waterflosser</li>
            <li>My first order did not arrive after 3 weeks of waiting.</li>
            <li>First cleaning of the lower jaw in 2 years.</li>
            <li>The first one lasted about 5 months</li>
            <li>the product did not funtion when used it the first time it was used for 2 to 3 mintutes  </li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t beat it ;-)</li>
            <li>Protips for a first timer: fill it before every use, or you will run out.</li>
            <li>This product replaces the need for flossing (a function that never held much charm for me!).  </li>
            <li>the company would be willing to refund or issue a warranty that might improve my review, but I could not figure out how to contact the seller.</li>
            <li>This flosser no longer holds a charge, when first purchased I would charge it maybe every two weeks</li>
            <li>The first one lasted over three years, and then the battery just stopped fully recharging.</li>
            <li>First time the water went all over the bathroom, including in my ear.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t think it will last more than one year, time will tell.</li>
            <li>me obsess now with oral cleaning ...and takes no time at all for 100% better results than the regular floss.</li>
            <li>The most recent flosser gave out after a month.</li>
            <li>I have been a satisfied user of the regular Waterpik for years, so decided to get the cordless for \\&quot;travel\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>The first was 10 days trip.</li>
            <li>My first waterpik cordless lost its power strength after about 6 months.</li>
            <li>this waterflosser works pretty well.</li>
            <li>Thanks!  </li>
            <li>so reviews from the dentist on the state of my gums and pockets, and had to have deep scaling done twice in 3 years, ON TOP OF getting cleanings</li>
            <li>The corded version is way, way, way better and the newest one is about the same price as the handheld.</li>
            <li>My first hand held lasted one year.</li>
            <li>First, there was an issue with charging.  </li>
            <li>It took some getting used to when I first started with this device.  </li>
            <li>Okay, I sent it back and had another one sent.</li>
            <li>very convenient and works well!</li>
            <li>Much better than traditional floss.  </li>
            <li>there&#x27;s no issues at all but the first time....  </li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says it does</li>
            <li>I have made my self bleed a bit once, but it was most likely a bit of plaque build up &amp;</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a bit pricey, but if you can seem to reach a spot in your mouth, this will most likely do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so you simply do use it more.</li>
            <li>this is exactly what I wanted in a product.  </li>
            <li>and they tried to say it was something I did, like leave it on the sink counter while taking hot showers</li>
            <li>I replaced it with the larger non-portable waterpik which I&#x27;ve had for a couple years and is so much more convenient.</li>
            <li>For people who have debris that gets caught in the very back and also this does a better job of removing plaque below the gum line than flossing.  </li>
            <li>This second generation model is much better than the first.</li>
            <li>It sits on the shelf in the shower ready to use every morning!</li>
            <li>It stopped working after the first couple uses.</li>
            <li>Reservoir could be larger, but satisfied.</li>
            <li>I use it more often - although not often enough -</li>
            <li>would be better if it came with a travel bag for the different heads.</li>
            <li>The only drawback is that I wish the resevoir had about 30% more capacity.</li>
            <li>Better for the gums than standard flissing.  </li>
            <li>You get used to the clunkyness..which it is, at first.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am pleased with the purchase although I have yet to see if the container is removable for cleaning.</li>
            <li>is my first experience with the hand held battery powered unit.  </li>
            <li>I  also love the low price on the attachments.</li>
            <li>Much, much better than regular floss.</li>
            <li>The first one we bought had the motor seize up</li>
            <li>The Waterpik Waterflosser Cordless PLUS has been exactly what we needed.</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how much better it cleaned my teeth than just regular flossing.  </li>
            <li>Be warned - at first you will squirt water everywhere.  </li>
            <li>battery on the first one lasted 10 months.  </li>
            <li>This pic can be used away from the electric socket as most pics have short cords.  </li>
            <li>It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.  </li>
            <li>Kinda funny..</li>
            <li>I purchased it from Costco along with the wired version of the unit and took this one for my overseas trip without checking it first.  </li>
            <li>I hope it is not designed in US or it will put US engineering in really shame!  </li>
            <li>and I sure like the smaller footprint on my counter.  </li>
            <li>First time I used it, the water was plashing all over my T-shirt.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>First it says &amp;#34;..</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t look like it&#x27;s worth so much.</li>
            <li>&quot; filling was easier as the fill opening was at the top and larger.  </li>
            <li>Amazon, indicate in your product description if the item can only use 110 volts, most of this world uses 240.</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
            <li>I have a suggestion though for the manufacturer:  an indication light that there is a full charge, or low battery.  </li>
            <li>However, just over a year later, the battery refuses to accept charge at all any more.  </li>
            <li>maximize the capacity and life of the rechargeable batteries, the unit should be charged for 24 hours before the first use.  </li>
            <li>will add that the customer service at Waterpik is STELLAR.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m going to use it only until I buy a better model.  </li>
            <li>If the reservoir had been any bigger, the unit would have weight and balance issues, so I feel satisfied with the design.</li>
            <li>For those who are buying your first Waterpik, it is a must-have for a clean-feeling mouth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a recent convert, using it since my husband got one for use with his braces, and I love it.</li>
            <li>Yes, I do not like it despite the fact that -- when it was working -- it did exactly what it was supposed to do.</li>
            <li>Next one I had for more than 2 years</li>
            <li>The first lasted 2 years.</li>
            <li>After reading that review, I checked the terminals on my unit and sure enough they were corroded.</li>
            <li>I always kept the first unit connected to the charger when not in use.</li>
            <li>Having borne the expense of deep cleaning, I am glad I have it in my dental toolkit.</li>
            <li>I used my waterpik for the first time today.</li>
            <li>I was pretty dissapointed and</li>
            <li>it really does pay off!</li>
            <li>but they don&#x27;t  last more then a yr.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t see how they could possibly work better.  </li>
            <li>I am sure this one will do the same because it looks like that wasn&#x27;t taken care of in this product either.  </li>
            <li>But this product does  work the same and maybe even better.</li>
            <li>This was not the first time I&#x27;ve purchased this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used one before, so this is my first experience.  </li>
            <li>A very inexpensive method to prevent THAT madness!  </li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t - so do find appropriate ways to carry especially the tips.</li>
            <li>I got this larger model WP-450 because the warrantee is better, suggesting that this larger one is better.  </li>
            <li>Bought this on recommendation of ortho when son first got his braces.  </li>
            <li>I will know more on my next dental checkup and cleaning.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately not on long-lasting product.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s better to buy bigger item.</li>
            <li>Like many others, I thought this would replace my countertop unit, which finally gave out after 20 years.  </li>
            <li>no, sorry, it just doesn&#x27;t cut it.  </li>
            <li>Finally, like many before me, I find that the tips just rotate all by themselves.  </li>
            <li>So, I use the first level.</li>
            <li>On the more recent one, the two speeds became one speed within weeks.  </li>
            <li>Charge last long and does a great cleaning job on my teeth.</li>
            <li>This view was changed as soon as I tried it for the first time.</li>
            <li>Many different tips to choose from.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s pretty horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My gums are in better shape after only ten days of use than they have been in many years.  </li>
            <li>quality product... better than the big bulky one they sell with a cord</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the 3rd one I&#x27;ve bought because the battery doesn&#x27;t hold up much more than a year or so,  </li>
            <li>I love waterpiks and use it daily.  </li>
            <li>I hope that he likes it as much as I do!</li>
            <li>I rinsed out the inside with hot water and used a brush to get the mold out of all the nooks and crannies.</li>
            <li>I first brought it.</li>
            <li>My favorite is still the standard tip</li>
            <li>but I love it for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>It works exactly as promised.</li>
            <li>This is the third Waterpik Cordless Waterflosser I have owned and love the product.  </li>
            <li>They flow water deep into the gum line to promote healthy gums.</li>
            <li>I had a shower one prior to this, but this one is much better.  </li>
            <li>I suppose they&#x27;re compensating dentists for recommending it, but n one is compensating me for the cost of sending it back. :)</li>
            <li>I do wish there was a light showing when it is completely recharged.</li>
            <li>Because the picture shows exactly what I get and because of that I recomend this product and this saler for everyone.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because of the ease of use of this relative to flossing, I am &amp;#34;flossing&amp;#34; more than I would with the string.</li>
            <li>It is a good portable solution to an otherwise messy job.</li>
            <li>The battery lasts a good week before needing a recharge, which I do overnight, and its ready for action the next day.</li>
            <li>However, a few were really good</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to stay full through a week&#x27;s worth of teeth cleaning, but emptying before one brushing was complete was not acceptable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Had this for a few years and loved it.</li>
            <li>Each full charge is good for at least a week of once-a-day use...</li>
            <li>It is nice that it can be used away from an electrical outlet; once I even used it to clean a spot in my toilet, holding it several feet away, of course (it did exactly what I wanted it to do!).  </li>
            <li>will have about 30 seconds before the unit runs dry, but it refills very easily.</li>
            <li>Strong enough to do a good rinsing job and soft enough to not hurt the gums.  </li>
            <li>This brand is not as powerful in its flow and has a small resevoir but will do ok and is easy to pack for travel.</li>
            <li>Waterpik was courteous enough to send me a new unit.</li>
            <li>Worked as advertised, easy to use and clean, but does not hold a charge for very long.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not like my electric toothbrush where you have time to kind of focus on each tooth, since this one has a limited reservoir, and it runs out pretty fast, plus your mouth fills up with water</li>

            <li>My gum health has greatly improved per my hygenist and my teeth are much less temperature sensitive.</li>
            <li>Since my sister had experienced far less gum inflammation using a water pik, I purchased one.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick, painless, effective and adds just a few minutes to the oral health routine, for (according to all the research I could find on it)</li>

            <li>The corded replacement works just fine, &amp; if the hose was just a little longer, I&#x27;d be able to use it in my bathroom.  </li>
            <li>But it vibrates so much that it won&#x27;t do the job right.  </li>
            <li>but that really isn&#x27;t a problem since I&#x27;m right at the faucet.  </li>
            <li>By design it seems that a user could easily move his/her thumb slightly to rotate the spout to either left or right and thereby more accurately cover all areas of the inside gums and teeth.  </li>
            <li>I had to return the Waterpik Waterflosser because the high-pitched sound was too much for my sensitive ears!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve been using it for a week and only just read the complete info and its even better now!  </li>
            <li>I add some Listerine with warm water leaving an extra actual and clean feeling.</li>
            <li>does the job as expected, I would recommend this to anyone who wants to get a deeper clean and healthy teeth</li>
            <li>This product makes quick work of what would normally be a 10 minute process.</li>
            <li>She said this portable unit is good for just taking it in the shower and blast away at your teeth while you shower and that way it doesn&#x27;t make a mess all over the sink!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use it on low pressure as the high pressure should have been more useful.</li>
            <li>This product is exactly as described in the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>but I often fill it a second time to spend more time in certain problem areas I have.  </li>
            <li>the huge benefit of far superior oral hygiene, for us lazy flossers out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the huge benefit of far superior oral hygiene, for us lazy flossers out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>user friendly as far as ergonomic design.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is excellent for individual who have a hard time flossing or getting in between teeth.</li>
            <li>It did take a couple tries to get the right momentum with the water flossing process, but now it is a very important step in my oral hygiene.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve replaced the ni-mh battery in mine with a cheap new ni-mh battery from China, removed the diode from the circuit, and replaced the charger with a cheap universal ni-mh charger from China.</li>
            <li>I suppose this is comfortable for some people, but all I experienced was an uncomfortable stream of water into my mouth, without any noticeable pressure into or between teeth.</li>
            <li>The resevoir is easy to fill and remove, but there&#x27;s no way to empty and clean it.</li>
            <li>I am able to hit my upper and lower teeth front and back before the reservoir runs out and if I do run out the reservoir really easy to refill.</li>
            <li>Having used my girlfriend&#x27;s platinum model, and now owning the classic myself, I was not crazy about the cordless model.</li>
            <li>It might be useful for the mfgr to find a clever, compact way of containing the optional 2 or 3 nozzles.  </li>
            <li>Maybe, but it was so easy to stick it in the old unit&#x27;s closed storage area when you inverted the top.</li>
            <li>Using it is easy enough, but that&#x27;s the only redeeming aspect.</li>
            <li>It cleans very nicely, easy to use and has good power, however, after only a few months, it quit charging.</li>
            <li>He has figured out how to work it, so if the product is only half as effective as string then I am about 10X better off in</li>
            <li>I simply plug it in at night every couple of days and I am good to go the next day.</li>
            <li>It really blasts away food debris much better than just brushing or using regular dental floss.  </li>
            <li>such that you need several refills to do a good cleaning.   </li>
            <li>My secondary reason for giving it a great rating is that the temporary issue notwithstanding, the product works very well.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I need to fill the water reservoir a second time I am having such a good time.  </li>
            <li>Does a good job and holds a charge so daily recharging is not necessary.  </li>
            <li>If it doesn&#x27;t get fixed, I won&#x27;t be giving Waterpik my money again, since this is obviously a design flaw, and they should own up to the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does a good enough job on flossing, with the annoyance of using actual floss.</li>
            <li>This tells me that my gums really are getting stimulated and healthy from regular use of the waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Your child wants to come into the bathroom and you&#x27;re enjoying 45 seconds of peace and quiet?</li>
            <li>so I was looking for a better, quicker way to accomplish some good oral hygiene -- basically a cheat for being a lousy flosser....</li>
            <li>The low pressure setting is gentler than others I have used which is nice for people with sensitive gums.  </li>
            <li>those who complain about battery - the instructions clearly say that the device needs to be charged for a full day before first use.</li>
            <li>The product was great at first, but if you have weak gums, this should not be your first answer to healing your gums.</li>
            <li>Finally I have found a way to keep my teeth clean when on the road!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The only reason I got the cordless is to be able to easily store it, I have a little cabinet where I store all my dental stuff and the corded one wouldn&#x27;t fit there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wish it could hold more water, but it good for a quick rinse or a tough spot that only a pick can get to.  </li>
            <li>...loved the old one, so why change right!  </li>
            <li>Although this is probably a good waterpik, it feels to me like there is very little pressure.</li>
            <li>me, a full water tank is about 35 seconds more or less.</li>
            <li>The other reviews are right, the water reservoir is too small, but for travel this is great, I don&#x27;t mind refilling a couple of times!  </li>
            <li>The positive reviews that answer all the negatives are pretty much dead-on, folks, and you can buy this in confidence.</li>
            <li>This one is powerful and a pleasure to use, especially since I noticed a great improvement in gum &amp;#34;pockets&amp;#34; within a few days.  </li>
            <li>-- I kind of doubted that it would be able to get the trapped food particles out from between my crooked teeth as well as string floss does.  </li>
            <li>And its really lost a lot of power since when I first got it.</li>
            <li>There is a different one with a larger reservoir and it has more speed options available.  </li>
            <li>When I first got it I thought it was a bit bulky and didn&#x27;t hold much water.</li>
            <li>Thanks much, Comfort &amp; Warmth!</li>
            <li>Works really well when you floss first.</li>
            <li>The first one worked very well until it quit (6 months).</li>
            <li>No, but it goes well with flossing or is a good stand-in.e units in the past.</li>
            <li>Waterpik usually puts out a good product but this one missed the mark.</li>
            <li>go anywhere, small, good power.&lt;br</li>
            <li>tradeoff is that the water reservoir is small and to do a really good job, you&#x27;ll have to refill it once or twice depending upon how thorough you are.  </li>
            <li>Has good battery life and a small foot print on the vanity.</li>
            <li>Its good for a once over and usually needs to be refilled to finish the job.</li>
            <li>Firstly, there is no indicator anywhere that tells you how much charge is left; basically you have to depend on your ability to sense a decrease in power as it steadily un-charges over many days, which is akin to watching grass grow.</li>
            <li>Leaves a fresh clean feeling, even after electric toothbrush and traditional flossing.</li>
            <li>The jet is powerful enough to clean between teeth and massage the gums.</li>
            <li>Those who take their teeth more seriously than I do should probably invest in a table-top flosser with more power.</li>
            <li>It seemed the older more simple units lasted longer.  </li>
            <li>I have had extensive peridontal work done and this item works even better than my older waterpic  </li>
            <li>The high power setting is sufficient for cleaning with any of the standard piks; I do not need any more power.</li>
            <li>Just sounds like its working pretty hard to delivery its good pressure.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and the low pressure has been strong enough for me so far.  </li>
            <li>It took a little getting used to, but now I love it!</li>
            <li>After a 24 hour charge it was like a new unit, providing a weeks worth of use</li>
            <li>Excellent for general flossing, especially if you have tight spaces between teeth, irregular spacing, or implants.  </li>
            <li>It would have been better if Water-Pik had provided some sort of plug/barrier to keep water out of the plug-in cavity, or, better yet if they had used an induction-charge system with no contact points or pins as do many electric toothbrushes and other devices (either would make the product slightly more expensive, the later more so, but it would be well worth the extra dollar or</li>
            <li>This is not a big deal -- it&#x27;s so easy to refill, takes about 10 seconds.  </li>
            <li>Will hold a charge for over two weeks and that makes it easy to store for daily use.</li>
            <li>Overall, we are very pleased with this flosser and would buy another if our current unit ever needed to be replaced.</li>
            <li>I especially like the flexible gumline tip, and the easy fill.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is easy to use and it comes with 4 different heads.  </li>
            <li>The only drawback I found is that the setting of the pick turns too easily and away from the direction one intends.</li>
            <li>The included instructions are simple and easy to understand.</li>
            <li>Because this unit is so easy to use, I now use it daily as my dentist recommends.</li>
            <li>I easily go a week between charges and do it only as a precaution.  </li>
            <li>I have a feeling it will do fine for the gum line, but not sure water pressure alone is good enough for inbetween teeth.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t seem to be reparable and I sure can&#x27;t figure out a way to keep them dry.</li>
            <li>Cleaning the unit itself is simple and charging is as easy as plugging it in overnight.     </li>
            <li>I find that the unit lasts about one year before it starts to lose power and becomes less effective.</li>
            <li>How much water does it use bcoz of horizontal filling - 90-95% (pretty much all water can be used)&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the disadvantage of a smaller, portable unit that is easy to travel with.</li>
            <li>Easy grip simple to use.  </li>
            <li>The blue plastic tank comes off easily</li>
            <li>and this is a lot smaller and easy to travel with.</li>
            <li>My grandson has one and it looked so easy to use, and found out that my dentist recommended one, so I ordered it and some extra tips.  </li>
            <li>I had to send the first unit back because it wouldn&#x27;t fit any of the included tips.  </li>
            <li>I checked for clogs, battery charge, etc to find and easy fix, but it seems the pump simply lost</li>
            <li>Still takes up some countertop space but is easy enough to tuck in a drawer.</li>
            <li>I make sure I dry it thoroughly after use and blow out any residual water in the recessed plug-in spot on the device.  </li>
            <li>I had the same problem but noticed that the plug to the flossed would slide on too easily.  </li>
            <li>Once I get more used to it I will switch back to the normal tip.</li>
            <li>This streamline waterpik does the job with good pressure, long lasting charge and it doesn&#x27;t clutter up the counter.</li>
            <li>Strongly recommend this to people who care about their oral and overall health.</li>
            <li>It provides a strong jet of water even on low pressure setting which I use.</li>
            <li>On low pressure, it was strong and even stung my gums a couple times.</li>
            <li>The second one was just as strong when it went out.</li>
            <li>although the stream is not as strong as the larger model, the cordless suits my purposes.  </li>
            <li>All in all, it&#x27;s a small price to pay for a nice smile.</li>
            <li>This is a great product but it breaks down after 7 months and you only have one month to return it.  </li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend it for anyone that has permanent bridges or capped teeth.</li>
            <li>However, I found it to be quite large and cumbersome</li>
            <li>This product certainly does the trick.</li>
            <li>It is certainly a convenient waterpick design.  </li>
            <li>If you do, buy the countertop unit with the large water container.    </li>
            <li>I had a large Waterpik flosser before but did not like the coiled water tube.  </li>
            <li>The AC powered unit had a large removable water tank and a spring loaded coiled semi-flexible hose connecting to the hand wand.  </li>
            <li>It is somewhat large</li>
            <li>and a large container for water.</li>
            <li>You have to hold it at a certain angle when the water level drops.  </li>
            <li>As a guy with LARGE hands...</li>
            <li>Now that I can&#x27;t live without it, the battery died!!</li>
            <li>Amazing what even the sonicare toothbrush can mess.</li>
            <li>If the water tank was larger, it would make it even less handy, so the water tank is fine.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this thing for a few months and love it!</li>
            <li>True the regular style has a larger tank and more pressure settings, but this cordless model serves the purpose for me, for now.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Believe this product to be good but had to return it as voltage is not suitable for Australia (240 Volts).</li>
            <li>When the product works, it&#x27;s great, though I&#x27;ve only had this unit for less than four weeks and the motor makes a lot of noise, though isn&#x27;t pushing out water.&lt;br</li>
            <li>would recommend this instrument to anyone who wants to ensure effective plaque removal, healthier gums therefore the need for less dental work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If I make sure to dry out the connection site with compressed air and really push the charger in</li>
            <li>They still haven&#x27;t fixed the design flaw that diminishes battery life much too quickly.</li>
            <li>and I was quite impressed with the gentle pulsing action (for such a small unit)</li>
            <li>very loud and you have to fill it several times, should have done more research regarding this</li>
            <li>I originally reviewed this item as a 5-star item, but that was back in September 2011 when I first bought it.  </li>
            <li>It worked fine and then suddenly stopped working at all!</li>
            <li>Finally had my fill; I threw it out and bought a corded-type waterpik which works fine.    </li>
            <li>After one month of daily use it works fine.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li>Unlike the ones that attach to your faucet you can mix in a little mouthwash, which is nice</li>
            <li>However, the technique for containing that nice forceful water jet over your sink will require a little practice.</li>
            <li>until you are a master Waterpik user, keep that glass cleaner in full supply as the over-spray will attack your mirror like no other.</li>
            <li>First, let me say that this unit does what a Waterpik should do: clean between the teeth and under the gums, especially with gingivitis.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice little product, and it works very well.  </li>
            <li>It could be a little more powerful.</li>
            <li>The product is a little bulky in your hand (and a bit more messy than I expected).However, it does a good job flossing the teeth.</li>
            <li>Well, I sure don&#x27;t get the bad reviews of this great dental hygiene booster.  </li>
            <li>Since they are very close together, this is real progress for me and much appreciated.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get the food properly out of your teeth and anyone who says it does probably has huge gaping spaces between their teeth.</li>
            <li>It works great and shoots out water with enough power to get out trapped food after brushing.  </li>
            <li>I wish Waterpik would get it together and make a charging system more like the Sonicare products, which are a closed charging system and they hold a charge much longer.  </li>
            <li>I feel they make a huge difference for flossing around my caps, especially the front of the caps where you can&#x27;t really floss</li>
            <li>this unit has a redesigned plug-in for the charger cord end to fit into the unit and a larger water tank...excellent unit.</li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>Really?  </li>
            <li>This device is very helpful during travel time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very convient and works very well.  </li>
            <li>I much prefer using the cordless waterpik to flossing with floss.  </li>
            <li>Much tidier on the bathroom counter.  </li>
            <li>I really like the cordless</li>
            <li>Really like the charging stand with nothing to remove.</li>
            <li>I expected more power.</li>
            <li>Very bulky.</li>
            <li>I have a bulky Interplak that really removes debris.  </li>
            <li>Very prompt shipping.  </li>
            <li>this water pik get things that brushing misses, and i brush really well.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot for it being here before Christmas</li>
            <li>You think that your electric toothbrush really cleans your teeth until you use the Waterpik.</li>
            <li>Since I got my wp450, I use it every day, and my visits are much happier.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I really like the Waterpik...</li>
            <li>\\&quot;They are really hammering derp product.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let</li>
            <li>think that the problem is that these days people do not take the time to complain to the Company because they feel that, even if they do, no one really cares.  </li>
            <li>The product works very well, as advertised by the manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;Try</li>
            <li>You need to refill the water tank twice to do your whole mouth.</li>
            <li>A lot of people might find they need to stick to the gentle setting.</li>
            <li>The item works very well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve taken extra care with this one to ensure that the connection for the recharger remained free from corrosion or build up of gunk.  </li>
            <li>The Waterpik Waterflosser does what it&#x27;s supposed to do really well.</li>
            <li>Much faster than dental tape.</li>
            <li>if even that, goes trough way too fast.</li>
            <li>but it really does the job of cleaning between the teeth before you brush.  </li>
            <li>More than I expected.</li>
            <li>Very helpful.</li>
            <li>But after couple of uses, you will get used to how to handle it, and it does the job quite well, cleaning up the gumlines and flosses out food debris from your teeth very efficiently.</li>
            <li>In all, it does the job very well.</li>
            <li>The Waterpik makes me feel that much cleaner and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>Almost no loss of power until the batteries are ready to quit.  </li>
            <li>I really need this thing</li>
            <li>I found that the \\&quot;AdaptaPlug\\&quot; connector system available at Radio Shack has the same pin diameter and pin spacing.</li>
            <li>Your patience is greatly appreciated and we apologize for the inconvenience.    </li>
            <li>The power cord is also detachable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For around $40-$50, I guess you really can&#x27;t complain with this unit.</li>
            <li>Why companies can&#x27;t put together an item like this with components that have semblance of a reasonable life-cycle is beyond me.</li>
            <li>and I really missed it.</li>
            <li>The outside, the pik itself, and the tank are easy enough to keep clean, but the inside of the pumper is not.  </li>
            <li>I really have to get the water out after everyuse.</li>
            <li>but I really would recommend the Waterpik to everyone.</li>
            <li>dollars then it would have been a reasonable product for the price, but $45 is too much.</li>
            <li>If someone wants to try - ignore all the complainers and try this.  </li>
            <li>I use this portable unit and &amp;#34;flush a whole meal&amp;#34; out from under my gums and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than I expected for a cordless.  </li>
            <li>Of course it doesn&#x27;t hold much water -</li>
            <li>Now, my wife wants one also; I&#x27;ll be buying the combo pack that includes both a tabletop and this one.</li>
            <li>Once, you catch-on, it works very well.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Secondly, the unit lacks power even on the intense setting.</li>
            <li>It is much easier to control the stream of water and keep it from spraying all over the bathroom.</li>
            <li>I made sure that the front of the unit was properly closed.  </li>
            <li>Too much pressure for me, even in the lowest setting.  </li>
            <li>Runs out of water too fast.  </li>
            <li>well since I expected the power of the water stream to be more pronounced.  </li>
            <li>This is very thorough, and painless.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product on the advice of a dentist and could really prove that it works.</li>
            <li>And since you can&#x27;t replace the batteries in the unit, the whole thing is going into the trash.  </li>
            <li>water jet is very week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s what WaterPik would evolve into if they really cared about quality.</li>
            <li>you realise how much you needed</li>
            <li>I really like the Waterpik Waterflosser.  </li>
            <li>Takes too much time with all the refilling.</li>
            <li>I cleaned up my bathroom, and not knowing what the charger was in my cleaning frenzy (because I really didn&#x27;t use it often)</li>
            <li>and I might not use as much water though.</li>
            <li>It is more noisy than I expected.  </li>
            <li>Versatile with 4 tips supplied, travel ready, and charge lasts a week for me.  </li>
            <li>This thing really works very well.  </li>
            <li>I use daily and enjoy the gum massage while cleaning my teeth,</li>
            <li>It is easier for me than using dental floss - and much faster to use.</li>
            <li>I really like to travel, but...  </li>
            <li>In my opinion portable items must be capable to work everywhere, like you cellphone, laptop, e-razor else advantages of portability are vanishing.  </li>
            <li>The electrical inlet and the water chamber are very close and water from flossing runs very close to the inlet.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am not used to floss my teeth, and this product make flossing much easier and efficient.</li>
            <li>The whole idea is to get the water to the gumline.</li>
            <li>I have to fill water four times to cover the whole mouth.  </li>
            <li>The whole idea of water jet is even doubtable.</li>
            <li>They really ought to try using this thing before even going into production.  </li>
            <li>When I say it really works, I have proof.  </li>
            <li>My teeth are generally very close together</li>
            <li>and my gums looked much healthier.  </li>
            <li>and it really doesn&#x27;t need it even then.  </li>
            <li>This is SO much easier.</li>
            <li>I found this item very inadequate.  </li>
            <li>It works very well, and my dental checks have improved since using them.</li>
            <li>My check-ups have been much improved.  </li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping...</li>
            <li>there is a known issue with the charging contacts that really makes charging fail.&lt;br /&gt;Why</li>
            <li>great for when I am too tired to manually floss my</li>
            <li>No pressure after 1 month of use&lt;br /&gt;not fall, used carefully, very disappointed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very inefficient battary life.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a unit that doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of real estate on your counter</li>
            <li>but it cannot take the place of flossing (as the advertising wants you to believe) ... not at all per my dental hygenist.  </li>
            <li>I bought this model because we don&#x27;t have much counter space in our bathroom.</li>
            <li>It does the job of cleaning very well.  </li>
            <li>It works so much better than I expected.</li>
            <li>and I was amazed at how much I missed with the toothbrush and floss.</li>
            <li>When we traveled out of town for a week, I really missed it.</li>
            <li>It drains incredibly fast even charging whenever not in use.</li>
            <li>I really like this item.  </li>
            <li>Reasonably priced and works well.</li>
            <li>I think this takes up a reasonable amount of room on the counter, too.  </li>
            <li>however, I expected better performance from this product.  </li>
            <li>Very time consuming and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used a dental irrigator before so this was an unusual experience, but here goes....</li>
            <li>It comes with a variety of &amp;#34;jet extensions&amp;#34; to fit various needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this product saves a lot of time and works very well.</li>
            <li>and you can fill the resevoir with germ killing mouthwash or a prescribed peridontal rinse to really push it into any problem spot.    </li>
            <li>Also, the tank design weighs the unit such that it is comfortable to the hand.      </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m scared to see what high feels like!    </li>
            <li>My teeth are very close together</li>
            <li>(My husband wants me to add it</li>
            <li>I also have taken to blowing the water out of the connector after using it, though I doubt that really makes much of a difference</li>
            <li>never realized how much food residual could be stuck.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>Depending on your needs &amp; wants I&#x27;d would probably recommend it.</li>
            <li>You need to use it fast before the water runs out.  </li>
            <li>It really seems to make a difference when I go to the dentist.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone who is very mobile.</li>
            <li>This newer version holds the battery charge much longer.</li>
            <li>I bought this one because of the cordless aspect... makes it very convenient to use.</li>
            <li>Be gentle when you floss manually.</li>
            <li>You have no control over how gentle the pressure is on this flosser.</li>
            <li>, I realized there really is no need for more time/bigger tank.</li>
            <li>It works really well.  </li>
            <li>is efficient and gentle on my gums.</li>
            <li>The whole thing is very convenient to use.</li>
            <li>but it goes fast because of the flow settings even with the narrowest attachment being used.</li>
            <li>I really like my waterpik.  </li>
            <li>My mouth and teeth feel much cleaner</li>
            <li>I really prefer the battery unit.  </li>
            <li>I really like the way it works.</li>
            <li>Is so much that goes away when you use it, and I&#x27;ve already improved my dental care, so much that my dentist is also amazed.</li>
            <li>Highly advisable to use this!</li>
            <li>My gums get inflammed and sore and this absolutely solved the problem.  </li>
            <li>Really.  </li>
            <li>Seems to really do the trick.</li>
            <li>I wear braces, so this has really been a life-saver for me.</li>
            <li>He has been using the water jet every day and feels it is really helping his gum issue.</li>
            <li>50 years later, with gingival issues, I didn&#x27;t realize then how important</li>
            <li>Amazon kept ture to the 14 day refund and issued it in a very timely fashion.</li>
            <li>I really like it being handheld.  </li>
            <li>I need to charge it every 2-3 days during whole night.</li>
            <li>I really  have no complaints</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve been using this product I&#x27;ve noticed that my mouth feels much healthier than it did before I began using it.</li>
            <li>My husband really likes this waterpik waterflosser.  </li>
            <li>would recommend this to everyone who wants to protect their teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>I bought mine in 2013 and have really tried to like the thing, but I can&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>but I really like the variety of heads this offer as well as the fact that the water container comes off.  </li>
            <li>This cordless model works better than expected.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It works very well.</li>
            <li>Your mouth feels so much cleaner</li>
            <li>The water reservoir used fast.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels much cleaner with it.  </li>
            <li>I really do like the waterflosser, it makes my flossing time faster.</li>
            <li>15 months with nearly daily use primarily by my wife.  </li>
            <li>Fits our tiny space, does the job, is quiet, easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>- It has really helped with my breath and gums.  </li>
            <li>so i would not recommend this product most of the 5 star reviews are most likely written by the company itself or inpatient people that just received the product in hand and played with it a few minutes</li>
            <li>While the product had battery life, I found it very efficient.</li>
            <li>It works very well.  </li>
            <li>it help me so much</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t have any complaints, it has plenty of water pressure and does the job.</li>
            <li>You have to keep the darned thing straight up in order to use it, meaning that you are drooling all over it and your hand.&lt;br</li>
            <li>We also invested in the carrying case, which is very handy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My wife really wanted this.  </li>
            <li>Now I really miss it if I don&#x27;t use it.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product for anyone who needs healthier gums and wants to improve dental hygiene, etc&lt;br</li>
            <li>whole mouth feels fresher and cleaner</li>
            <li>I did wipe the unit each time, but I did not spend much time drying the terminals, if at all.</li>
            <li>really like this device, except for the cost.</li>
            <li>she seldom has to spend much time cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li>This thing really gets the food particles out from between your teeth and under your gums.  </li>
            <li>All I know is I was looking at some that cost twice as much</li>
            <li>Customer service graciously replaced one unit but now wants receipts, etc.  </li>
            <li>Very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;Cunfunit</li>
            <li>My  gums are much healthier (per dentist)</li>
            <li>I find it much easier then flossing with the string</li>
            <li>It just gets really weak.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Flossing with water really works.</li>
            <li>do absolutely recommend using a waterpik every day.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for the chance to write this review.  </li>
            <li>It does not adjust as much as we would like</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve charged it once for the whole night</li>
            <li>and she absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>I like it because it doesn&#x27;t take up too much space.  </li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s just too much of a pain.</li>
            <li>No one wants to eat pie after they cleaned their teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would have given it four stars except I find the fact that there is no docking station and I have to plug it in for charging and then unplug it to use it a real pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>which really put me off about ordering from any merchant on Amazon that will charge you to return it.</li>
            <li>I am very displeased.</li>
            <li>but really think it should work longer than 5 days.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>Much like my sonic toothbrush thingie</li>
            <li>might fast too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>might fast too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very bulky.</li>
            <li>Both machines have been returned to Amazon and I have, very reluctantly, ordered an Oral B Oxyjet.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no neat, non-messy way to use this product, as it almost has to be standing straight up to use; any tilt to allow you head and mouth to pour over into the sink, and the thing gets clogged and the water starts leaking and dribbling onto your hands.  </li>
            <li>MUCH EASIER TO USE THEN</li>
            <li>It is much messier than using the waterpik corded flosser.</li>
            <li>It suits me very well.</li>
            <li>Much easier for me to handle than the corded one.</li>
            <li>Works very well and has 2 speeds.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Before you buy, ask yourself if you really must have the cordless model.</li>
            <li>It really gives a feeling of dental cleaning.  </li>
            <li>Mine does, but after verifying that it rotated I haven&#x27;t tried to rotate the tip again as  it is easier to rotate the whole body.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>My teeth felt so much cleaner...</li>
            <li>this one is way too bulky, cant be charged while in use, and doesnt hold much water.</li>
            <li>Really helps to get into nooks and crannies while massaging the gums.</li>
            <li>I have an irrigator waterpik wp 70, and I really like it.</li>
            <li>She loves it because it&#x27;s so much easier than having to thread floss between braces and teeth.  </li>
            <li>I have to refill it 2-4 times while using it depending on how fast I go.  </li>
            <li>I really like it and it does the job</li>
            <li>: I find it convenient because it is cordless and does not take up much counter space.</li>
            <li>Unlike the cord one, you can hold it at any angle and you can put as much water as you want.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>is fast</li>
            <li>This really is an alternative to flossing that is getting in there and doing the job like floss.</li>
            <li>I really like the ease of handling the  cordless unit.  </li>
            <li>But the convenience of taking the cordless unit on the road is a real advantage.  </li>
            <li>, I wished it held more water, but after using it daily, I manage to waterpik every tooth and completely cover all gum&lt;&gt;tooth areas with one filling.     </li>
            <li>Despite my efforts, however, it is starting to require more frequent charging.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more trouble than its worth.</li>
            <li>The WP450 is far better than the earlier WP360.  </li>
            <li>It keeps a charge for several days and is so convenient to use as it is nice enough to leave sitting out on the vanity.  </li>
            <li>I actually like the Waterpik concept, and own a larger unit.</li>
            <li>I learned a few thing on my own that were not mentioned in the instructions.  </li>
            <li>After using the flossed for a few weeks I find it does a nice job.</li>
            <li>Not enough pressure to actually do anything, the regular ones by waterpik are far more effective.</li>
            <li>I liked to use it everyday and even sent a couple of these waterflossers to my relatives abroad.</li>
            <li>I use it on a daily basis and love this product but don&#x27;t completely trust it yet</li>
            <li>However, the water force is not as strong and the water reservoir, naturally is smaller so you might have to fill it twice to get a decent cleaning.</li>
            <li>No wet, corroding terminals and the unit seems as powerful as the first time I used</li>
            <li>the way my dentist told me to add a few drops of bleach to the water to really be effective in healing your gums.</li>
            <li>Flossing the opposite side of your mouth will cause all the water to flow over your hand, which is tolerable but kind of gross</li>
            <li>Even when we fly for a warm vacation, we like to travel light, and the bulk of the regular unit was annoying, so once again, we&#x27;d suffer through yucky</li>
            <li>It travels easily, holds a charge for up to a week, and is a pretty powerful little tool.</li>
            <li>My husband uses the &#x27;regular&#x27; floss tip and is able to clean his teeth with a single fill of the reservoir.</li>
            <li>I had my first root canal and cap down and the dentist suggested that I get a water flosser to make sure I kept the area clean...especially since my teeth are really close together</li>
            <li>bought this portable job after researching the counter top edition and seeing that this one performs the same task, with the same assurances of better oral health, but doesn&#x27;t take up counter space (of which I have none) and is just a lot less to fuss with in terms of cleaning, worrying about hose length, and generally just being a lot more bulk to deal with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It comes with a bunch of fancy-smancy other tips (which I think are funny imo) but all that matters to me is the standard nozzle is good and the pressure on high meets my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So far it has emptied over ten tanks of water and is still going strong on the first charge.    </li>
            <li>particular portable model has an easy fill reservoir with the fill hole located on the side so when it&#x27;s tilted under the faucet of a small sink it fills easily.  </li>
            <li>wow!!!</li>
            <li>the box)&lt;br /&gt;This unit is powerful, portable, sits right next to the basin</li>
            <li>I recently purchased a new portable waterpik that works great, but now the battery has gone down and the recharge coard does not work.</li>
            <li>This is a very fun product and I can only trust the science that it does what it claims to.</li>
            <li>first thing I noticed was that it really was very loud.  </li>
            <li>First let me say I can&#x27;t live without a waterflosser.</li>
            <li>Of course, the time you remember that it needs to be recharged is right after you use it, and getting all of the water out of that hole is near impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just the right amount of pressure and water to complete the job.</li>
            <li>but then, you&#x27;re holding the motor right near you ears.</li>
            <li>with plain warm water using my cordless</li>
            <li>Had the previous model which worked well, the new model has more power and the accessories provided are useful also.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never needed high as it does just fine on the low setting.  </li>
            <li>The battery lasts a long time between charges, and the water compartment is easy to fill, even by children.  </li>
            <li>I can more than adequately clean my entire mouth in the time it takes for the tank to empty.</li>
            <li>You have to be careful though, because after one dentist told me it&#x27;s great to use to prevent gum disease, another dentist told me it could cause problems by allowing food stuck between teeth to get moved to other pockets between gums.</li>
            <li>actually one and a half does the trick), but it&#x27;s easy to fill, and it sure beats feeling yucky for two weeks.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and stayed charged for a long time ( 3 weeks).</li>
            <li>The flosser can be replaced easily and the charge lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>like that it does not take up too much space on the counter because i have so many other products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Hopefully, they read this stuff and will either add some sort of (attached to the unit) plug or go to an induction-type re-charge method on the next version of the PLUS, if they haven&#x27;t already concluded that one or the other is a good idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>It also has a high and low setting which gives more options for sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>At home, I definitely prefer the regular one, which I love very much.</li>
            <li>With this one, the strength of the water isn&#x27;t quite strong enough, but I could live with that.</li>
            <li>But don&#x27;t get me wrong, despite wearing braces, my hygienist complimented about how clean I maintained my teeth and good part of the credit should go to this device.  </li>
            <li>Not enough to clean whole mouth.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, works great in those hard to reach areas, especially in the back &amp; around bridge work.</li>
            <li>I have an other water pick product that is counter top</li>
            <li>Very low pressure and doesn&#x27;t compare with  the original  Waterpik.  </li>
            <li>Having learned from past purchases of products with questionable reviews, I had purchased it from another source that has a great return policy, so I just returned it to the purchaser rather than wait months for the manufacturere to make good.</li>
            <li>As with many of the other reviews there is a flaw in the way that the nozzles were designed, once put it there</li>
            <li>The other interesting thing the Customer service person mentioned, which sounds counter intuitive to me, is that I need to keep the Waterpik plugged in all the time expect when it is in use.  </li>
            <li>It is a significant improvement to have the entire unit built into the handle.</li>
            <li>other than that, im satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I love the product.</li>
            <li>like it better  than the other one I had.</li>
            <li>When we first discovered that, I tried pushing all sorts of skinny things through the little hole to get to the mold to wipe it off, but nothing was able to reach all the areas of the tank&#x27;s interior.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t imagine any of the other brands are any easier to use except for the counter top models where one just has to manage the tube and not a bulky device with a built in tank</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll be able to buy a replacement from some other outfit this time.</li>
            <li>Used one of the original plug-in-the-wall Pik units back in the &#x27;60s as a kid.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this I ran out of water, but the second time the extra fill gave me about 10 more seconds.</li>
            <li>but that could change with more experience using the other 2&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>I can honestly say this is a convenient product but not very effective.</li>
            <li>high isn&#x27;t very high.</li>
            <li>It keeps a charge for a remarkable length of time -- I only need to charge it every few weeks &amp; do so overnight</li>
            <li>The entire reason for the water pick is to power clean your teeth and without power that goal is not met.    </li>
            <li>Next, the pressure is insufficient to really clean your teeth.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t recall my teeth feeling so clean, especially under bridgework!&lt;br</li>
            <li>The water container does not hold enough water to completely clean all my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it a few weeks now and am pretty satisfied.</li>
            <li>I also just got back from vacation for a week and did not bring it with me, and I could tell that my teeth were not as clean.  </li>
            <li>Two to three extra minutes for REALLY clean teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li>You have to fill the reservoir twice in order to clean both upper teeth and lower teeth</li>
            <li>It holds enough water to clean your mouth.  </li>
            <li>I think this newer version does not have as much pressure as my older model.</li>
            <li>BUT I used it (only twice) and the water was every where, had to clean my mirror</li>
            <li>This product leaves us short of satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;The water reservoir leaks when the Waterpik Cordless is tipped to clean the teeth.  </li>
            <li>The first Waterpik funtioned very well when received but after about (1) year after purchase the product lost water pressure and had to be charged frequently just to operate.</li>
            <li>unit works very well and has just enough water to floss your whole mouth quickly.  </li>
            <li>though the tank is bigger, it still takes 2 fills to clean my mouth satisfactorily.  </li>
            <li>my teeth never felt so clean even after regular flossing.  </li>
            <li>it has some serious flaws: the reservoir tank is good for 1/3 of the mouth and the tip keeps jumping out of the holder and rotates.  </li>
            <li>Now, I&#x27;ll just be able to use the Water Pik with its special orthodontic tip (which comes with this model, along with several other tips).  </li>
            <li>Battery good for about 2 weeks of use (once with regular tip, once with pocket-pic, daily,) and a large enough water reservoir.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This would be a nice travel Waterpik, as it is one piece plus charging cord, but it is somewhat larger than my very old battery-operated Panasonic Travel Oral Irrigator, which is not rechargeable but is similar in effectiveness to this cordless</li>
            <li>Both had FAR more power (needing to be set well below their highest settings for my use), ran for about five to ten times as long on a filling, and allowed me to easily and successfully direct the stream at every point where gums meet tooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It seems kind of odd that nobody around here carries any of the standard countertop units right now.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s still better than conventional floss so rated \\&quot;Ok\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Although it ideally could be a little smaller for that use, I will definitely find room to take it along when I travel --</li>
            <li>If someone really wants to use it for a long time though, they should stick with the original model.  </li>
            <li>Waterpik does carry a model which is suitable for my travel needs, but that model was not available at Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li>Now I must find out if I can get a charger suitable for the country or do I just have to throw away the device, which to me is a waste of money.</li>
            <li>Disappointed in this travel pik as I have the full size  Waterpik that is over 20 years old and perfect in what it does.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d need gigantic hands to do that with this one, especially when the reservoir is full.    </li>
            <li>Stick with a full size water pick, not necessarily Waterpik brand.</li>
            <li>It started to act funky about two weeks ago when it began to make a loud chirping noise (which it did not do when I first bought it).  </li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s true that this is NOT a total replacement for flossing (braces or not) it does help a lot in getting rid of  all kinds of things that get stuck to teeth and in between teeth.  </li>
            <li>so I had to take it apart and service it like a car - which is not something an average user would be able to do.    </li>
            <li>I use the unit twice a day on average, and I can go more than three weeks between charges.  </li>
            <li>One full charge lasts over a week with daily use.</li>
            <li>Good idea in theory but not good in practice.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews on it and found that the complaints of water every where was true but only if you don&#x27;t keep your head over the sink.</li>
            <li>I find the amount of fluid is more than enough to get along all the gums very thoroughly.</li>
            <li>One full battery charge allows for several applications.</li>
            <li>I purchased a cheaper one first and there is no comparison as far as cleaning my teeth and gum spaces.  </li>
            <li>Replaced same unit when battery would not hold a full charge.</li>
            <li>Once I figured this out, my unit went back to full power.</li>
            <li>Personally find cordless units very easy to use Wish the 4 tips were all the same rather than 4 different styles as only use standard type and spare tips are good to have (replacements at $10 each justify just buying a new unit)</li>
            <li>he only drawback is the limited capacity of the reservoir, but refilling it is quick and easy.</li>
            <li>It works very well and does what it is supposed to, the only problem I have with it is it runs out of water rather quickly when you run it on the high setting.</li>
            <li>the only thing i can say negative is that it is not as powerful as the one you hook up to your faucet, but the attachments for this clean the gumline better.</li>
            <li>I broke one getting it down off of the top of my medicine cabinet.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to turn the thing upside down as fully upright and moving my head, I am able to angle it to hit everywhere.  </li>
            <li>I cleaned it out as well as I could, and it worked better for a while and then slowed down again -</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s too early to tell if it fixes the main problem of the cordless Waterpik 360, which is that before the first year is out, the rechargable battery will no longer hold a charge</li>
            <li>The second one never did work properly -- the nozzle always was in free float: you had to hang on to it to keep it pointed in the right direction.</li>
            <li>The opening for the stream of water seems to be too large; I end up with a mouth full of water long before I finish using the waterflosser, and have to keep refilling it.</li>
            <li>A little bit of mouthwash, with the water, and you got a super clean moth.  </li>
            <li>my new dentist recommended it!</li>
            <li>On a brand new item!  </li>
            <li>She called Waterpik, asked for a replacement -and Waterpik sent her a new one!</li>
            <li>I had used the older, \\&quot;big\\&quot; version of the Waterpik with a large reservoir and the wand with a cord many years ago - noisy, messy, took up a lot of counter space.</li>
            <li>Cons have to charge every day, taking the tank off be gentle, cleaning is kind of hard because of shape of tank</li>
            <li>by far not so strong and effective as the normal standard Watepik which, by the way, has a very short life as the hose breakes no matter how careful you handle the Waterpik.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how it compares to other handheld waterpiks, but it&#x27;s definitely so much nicer to use than the plug-in waterpiks which sound like jackhammers and take up so much space.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this unit last year on May 6th, and i am using it almost everyday, and now I can review it correctly, for me, it is a perfect unit, I have no problems with battery, noise and size all other reviewers talking about.</li>
            <li>reviewers have said that the new model dies after awhile, not so much because the battery wears out (although it seems to), but because the contacts get corroded and the battery will not fully charge.</li>
            <li>A real PITA to have to keep mixing new rinse solution if you are not Piking with</li>
            <li>but this one worked better and longer than the one I had previously.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a trade-off of cordless and less pressure vs. corded and more pressure.</li>
            <li>It is ergonomically designed for better functionality compared to the previous editions of the Cordless Waterpik.</li>
            <li>This one seems to work much better and has faster pulses than the previous one.  </li>
            <li>The dental hygienist could not believe how much more plaque I had since the previous 6th month appointment-</li>
            <li>I agree with a previous reviewer that Waterpik should fix this problem rather than me buying something at Radio Shack to make it better.</li>
            <li>There was only a quick start guide which says to 1) charge for 24 hours, 2)</li>
            <li>It holds enough water for a quick once-over</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t appear to be particularly well-made.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hold enough water for thorough  cleaning nor is the pressure adequate.</li>
            <li>The jet wand can be rotated (the wand rotates and clicks in place, holding steady...</li>
            <li>I decided to get the cheaper classic model.</li>
            <li>Thank goodness all the older heads work</li>
            <li>Delivery was quick and unit has been utilized daily without any problems.  </li>
            <li>I always had a challenging time flossing the back teeth with them and as a result I never flossed regularly.  </li>
            <li>and it is more than enough for my (currently) tender gums.  </li>
            <li>like this unit because it is portable and has a decent battery charge.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, they are that good that I am looking to buy another after last stopped charging few days ago.  </li>
            <li>It seems to hold a charge pretty well, you have to charge it for several hours before the first use, so</li>
            <li>but I moved to an older house that didn&#x27;t have outlets in the bathrooms.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it daily for about a month now and fairly satisfied overall.</li>
            <li>Recently my older Waterpik Ultra had its hose break necessitating a replacement.</li>
            <li>obviously, if it were smaller, the water reservoir would have to be refilled more often, so there is that trade-off.  </li>
            <li>It replaced an older model.  </li>
            <li>Item too big to hold and takes up more space than necessary.  </li>
            <li>Nice, compact device that&#x27;s fairly simple to use and takes up minimal space on your bathroom sink or shelf.</li>
            <li>I either do that to control as a \\&quot;pause\\&quot; button or just turn it off with a quick flip of the on/off switch and then flip it back on when I want the water flow to resume.    </li>
            <li>We had an older version.</li>
            <li>I chose this particular unit because it said it came with a nozzle designed for braces</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sticking with my older version.</li>
            <li>This is the second one of this model we have owned, and we bought it only because we need an oral irrigator to take on trips (we bought the Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser for use at home, and we are pleased with it).</li>
            <li>This is a decent product.  </li>
            <li>It is not silent but the sound isn&#x27;t particularly loud.</li>
            <li>Yes, it does run out of water quickly (as stated in one review), but simply fill it up while you are showering and press on.</li>
            <li>works but thin cheap plastic case;  water capacity adequate but must rinse teeth quickly or will run out &amp; have to refill</li>
            <li>The chamber holds enough water to rinse the gums once over, but needs refilling if more rinsing than that is needed, but this is not a big deal.</li>
            <li>I have never used one of these before so after reading multiple reviews I decided to go for the cordless one so that I didn&#x27;t have a big machine on my counter top.</li>
            <li>On the plus side, it basically does the job, just not as conveniently as my older one.</li>
            <li>It did have decent &#x27;power&#x27; on the pik.  </li>
            <li>the older model was better (now at half the price).</li>
            <li>i will either get the older model or it may be time to try the panasonic with rechargable batteries and see how well that works.</li>
            <li>Definitely get better result than using the regular floss.</li>
            <li>Much better than using regular wooden or plastic picks.</li>
            <li>All I can say positive--which is of course the main thing--is that it goes where no floss and toothbrush have gone before, flushing away debris</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I hit my significant other in the face.</li>
            <li>I bought this model as it was cordless would actually be used (as opposed to the static wall plug types which invariably end up back in</li>
            <li>Plus, they only come with one of each type of flossing head, so if two or more people are using it, they have to share the same tip!!!</li>
            <li>Most people stop flossing after starting the waterpik and that is a big problem</li>
            <li>I had to replace my older cordless water pik.....</li>
            <li>tank is quickly refilled, so I&#x27;m not too concerned about the (admittedly surprisingly) short operation length per water</li>
            <li>/&gt;Couple areas for improvement (hence only 3 stars at this time):&lt;br /&gt;- the biggest flaw in my opinion is that the tips should have a much smaller hole - I was hoping for much more of a water jet stream than a flowing one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok for travel however for a home model I would choose the regular standard ones again.</li>
            <li>This waterpik only has two settings which is high and low and high is just a little too much for my gums but the low level works perfect for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good to travel with, if you really feel you can&#x27;t miss a few days, but if you have limited luggage real estate, leave it home.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little akward holding the whole unit at first, but the pivoting head allows you to hold it however it is comfortable for you.  </li>
            <li>The tank does empty very fast, but the workaround - just keep the faucet running and from time to time just fill in the water without stopping, just bend low :)</li>
            <li>Not sure why they changed what previously was a very good product.</li>
            <li>It has no battery level indicator, and no LED to indicate when it is successfully being charged (or fully charged), and the battery only lasts for a short, unknown number of uses.  </li>
            <li>but when it runs out of water the pitch of the fairly noisy thing gets even higher and more annoying.   </li>
            <li>The water tank will empty pretty quick</li>
            <li>The other reviewer suggested getting a different charging cord that had a tighter fit, but the solution I found was just use a bobby pin to clean off the funk that builds on the charging tips on the device.</li>
            <li>While I didn&#x27;t have high expectations of quality with a cordless waterflosser, it never occurred to me there wouldn&#x27;t be a charge indicator.  </li>
            <li>No warnings about how high pressure water can cut through tissue, no shock warnings.  </li>
            <li>The design and functionality of the unit satisfactory, on high</li>
            <li>Highly recomend this prodact.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone with braces.</li>
            <li>And yes I am using the High pressure setting.</li>
            <li>And yes I am using the High pressure setting.</li>
            <li>On the high pressure setting, the water runs out after probably 15 seconds.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>On the recommendation of my dental hygenist to use a water pik, I got this one and also the Waterpik Dental Water Jet Replacement High Pressure Jet Tips</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I use the flosser on the high setting.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this.  </li>
            <li>I prefer the high, but again, I have braces.  </li>
            <li>so at this point would highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product to anyone with it without braces.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for anyone with braces.</li>
            <li>The tip keeps popping out if I set the power to high.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I was using it 1-2 times/day on the high setting.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
            <li>With high hopes I got this.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I finally got a full size corded waterpik because they came out with a newer version that has a smaller footprint that just barely did fit on my sink.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to any of my friends or family.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I still highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>any case, I still HIGHLY recommend the PLUS.</li>
            <li>Recommend highly.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>The high setting is a bit weaker than my home unit dial</li>
            <li>The high spray adjustment does the job without hurting gums.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I get one or two uses on high</li>
            <li>If you use it on high speed - it seems to run out of water faster than what I would like</li>
            <li>On high, the water runs out in 20 seconds.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>On the high setting it uses all the water in about 10 seconds max.  </li>
            <li>On the high setting, I&#x27;d say it runs out of water after about 35 seconds.</li>
            <li>close your mouth somewhat to keep in the spray (very important ahaha, as I found out when I forgot to do that), then hit the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; button, and it does the job, shooting a firm stream of water.  </li>
            <li>, then eventually going to the high</li>
            <li>highly recommend!!!sy to do a section at a time, turning it off in between</li>
            <li>, then eventually going to the high</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t switched  it to high yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product for people who have braces.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I asked a couple of my dentist friends and they highly recommended it too.</li>
            <li>dentist says I should use it on high setting.&lt;br /&gt;this portable model cannot do that.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Our mouths feel fresh and clean and I look forward to using this little appliance each night.</li>
            <li>Pretty cheap, pretty loud, doesn&#x27;t hold much water, leaks, charge lasts for very little time so has to be plugged in all the time anyway.  </li>
            <li>Low doesn&#x27;t seem quite strong enough and high is too much pressure.</li>
            <li>It seems a bit more powerful than the previous model, and  I started using it on the low setting.</li>
            <li>Remember to use with warm water for better cleaning and minus the shock of 40 psi of cold water blasting your teeth and gums- unless you are into that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reaserching several dental websites, it is apparant that this does not replace flossing; this is good for cleaning gumlines and overall food removal.</li>
            <li>The pressure could be a little more now that my gums are used to it</li>
            <li>I wish it was designed a little lighter in weight, and had a better battery/charger system.</li>
            <li>There are some pretty major design flaws on the cordless model.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m suprised to see so many cry babies nit-picking over every little thing.</li>
            <li>have to say, I love it for getting out all the little bits of food and stuff that get stuck in-between</li>
            <li>As someone else mentioned, you can probably swish water around your mouth and it will have more power than this little machine.  </li>
            <li>A little clunky, could be designed better somehow.</li>
            <li>I just feel that the water tank should be redesigned in order to have just a little bit more of capacity.</li>
            <li>It is a little more cumbersome when you are doing the backside of the teeth</li>
            <li>Maybe as I get more used to it, it may go a little faster</li>
            <li>The flosser appears to work although it&#x27;s a little soon to tell for sure.</li>
            <li>anyway so it just takes a coupld of seconds to add a little more.</li>
            <li>On to the next part... I used it for the first time today!</li>
            <li>WOW!!</li>
            <li>I will re-rate my purchase at 2 stars because this item lasted little more than 1 year.</li>
            <li>The tip DOES rotate easily, like other reviewers mentioned.</li>
            <li>have my wisdom teeth, didn&#x27;t need them taken out, &amp; this really is the only way I can really get back there to clean the area.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>It has more water capacity, but the force is less than my old one, and the battery runs out too quickly to keep from carrying the charger for even a very short trip.  </li>
            <li>Shooting a stream of pressurized water into your mouth pretty much guarantees a somewhat messy outcome...but the cordless PLUS is an efficient unit and way more contained than the older traditional Waterpik set up.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried the high setting yet since the low setting seems to shoot out water at a pretty fast pace.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never before written a review on a product, but this product is so bad that my best recommendation is not to purchase it.</li>
            <li>I proceeded to clean and dry the terminals and plugged it up; no change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Will let you know if my opinion works, but so far I can really see that this will make a difference.  </li>
            <li>But it lacks the real power that my old piks had, which made me feel the old pik was really doing the job.  </li>
            <li>I was replacing an old one,new one much improved,shaped grip easier to hold...</li>
            <li>is always yelling at me (okay not really yelling, but at least scolding me) that I need to floss more.  </li>
            <li>I see that the &amp;#34;free shipping&amp;#34; that you get through Prime pays for itself as the products that are Prime-eligible are are about $10 higher in general.</li>
            <li>This one is so much an improvement over the old Waterpik which was cumbersome with those coily cords and the motor from heck.</li>
            <li>additionally, the button placement and button feel and action are not up to modern day standards.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So far really like this product</li>
            <li>Also the water tank was redesigned and I think the old design was much easier to fill.  </li>
            <li>There was nothing wrong with the seller and their service was great.  </li>
            <li>This Waterpik works very well so far.</li>
            <li>Most probably, the battery is dead.</li>
            <li>After using it for a few weeks,  i love it, use it every night before bed</li>
            <li>but the battery pretty much had to be charged every week if used daily.</li>
            <li>Since the TSA regularly searches my luggage and disturbs the contents, I am not unhappy with the life of the unit.</li>
            <li>I use this combined with normal floss and an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Not enough pressure to be useful to me.  </li>
            <li>I had no problem and enjoyed using it everyday to the amazement of my wife.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love that moisture gets trapped in there.   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had to recharge once so far with almost daily use, so that&#x27;s ok too.</li>
            <li>I initially charged this unit for a full 24 hours prior to first use (Waterpik suggests 16 hours).</li>
            <li>It was worth the considerably larger expenditure.</li>
            <li>I love my waterpik flosser…I have bought one for my 3 daughters and a few friends.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I do for few weeks, more often I don&#x27;t.   </li>
            <li>is powerful enough to do the job.  </li>
            <li>but I can close my mouth around it for a few seconds and then just spit out the water with no problem and love it vs flossing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve babied it along for a couple of months now, but at this point the water pressure is too low to do anything, even fresh off the charger.</li>
            <li>I have two complaints, but it is such a useful piece of equipment that I still give it five stars.</li>
            <li>My dentist recommended I purchase a Waterflosser to avoid erosion and I&#x27;m glad I did - after just a few weeks use, I couldn&#x27;t do without it.</li>
            <li>and they just aren&#x27;t powerful enough.  </li>
            <li>When I plugged it in, you could feel it plugged in smoother and more firmly.</li>
            <li>After a few more uses to see if it gets easier to use, I will review it again.</li>
            <li>You can just add more water if it didn&#x27;t run long enough.</li>
            <li>and if i brushed before flossing (really can you complain abt it ;-)&lt;br /&gt;6) can i take in my wallet or purse -</li>
            <li>I got this thing from Costco as part of a kit that has the normal plug in to the wall one, and this cordless one.</li>
            <li>I usually fill it twice more before I feel really finished.</li>
            <li>I think it is strange that for 1 full flossing sessions, I need to fill the reservoir 3 times.  </li>
            <li>well it&#x60;s worth the money i will tell my friends about this product in the future</li>
            <li>I would recommend spending a bit more for a countertop model that plugs in, and don&#x27;t waste your money, time and aggravation on the hand</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s powerful enough to stand on the porch and squirt the cats stalking the birds at the feeder.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly good power and pressure for such a small device.</li>
            <li>The instructions say to just let the water run out of your mouth, but that is a bit more messy, and I wasn&#x27;t a fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The instructions say to just let the water run out of your mouth, but that is a bit more messy, and I wasn&#x27;t a fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I skip on some of the above steps and as long as I don&#x27;t skip often my mouth stays healthy.</li>
            <li>They pretty much speak fpr themselves and withstand countless droppings but eventually the break.</li>
            <li>Supposedly this is normal and will not happen</li>
            <li>Not as powerful as the regular water pic.</li>
            <li>Good idea poor follow thru.    </li>
            <li>Start off slowly and learn your own limit and tolerance level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>if you live in Gulf Coast or areas of high MOLD activity.  </li>
            <li>This is hands down better then the old but still selling WP-360.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated 20 June 2016:&lt;br /&gt;Been</li>
            <li>This is hands down better then the old but still selling WP-360.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated 20 June 2016:&lt;br /&gt;Been</li>
            <li>My old waterpik with the separate tank was thrown away years ago because of the space it took, the need to stretch the hose and electric cord down the cabinet to use it, and the moldy slime that tended to form in the tank top.  </li>
            <li>Love my waterpik waterflosser and I use it at least once a day,  very powerful on low setting  </li>
            <li>The WaterFlosser is HUGE, and certainly not an option for travelling.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it seems to work fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d never used a waterpik before this one and after having used it several times I agree with other reviewers that it is best used in the shower as its hard not to get water everywhere unless you just keep it in your mouth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Batteries are living things, and unless new, corrosion free and kept on a charger they become an unknown quantity.  </li>
            <li>It does get the teeth very clean, in every little pocket.</li>
            <li>The waterpik works far better and takes less time.</li>
            <li>The only thing I would change about this is to have a better way to allow the tank to dry.  </li>
            <li>This rapid action emptys the reservoir to quickly even on low speed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not been a faithful flosser but find that using this Waterpik daily is easy and I hope it will be notice by the dentist on my next visit.</li>
            <li>for something that i can only use for like 6 minutes before it requires charging, it would be nice if said charging took less</li>
            <li>easy to use and handle while flossing; the price is right;I especially like the number of different flosser heads with the unit; battery holds it&#x27;s charge too!</li>
            <li>It arrived in a timely manner, less than a week after I ordered it, full marks for that, but when I took it out of the box and went to plug it in I first checked what was written on the charger....</li>
            <li>The modelling is far better and it makes less noise.</li>
            <li>Indeed, the male prongs on my unit showed some corrosion and the female plug did not seem to be a tight fit any more....</li>
            <li>Sometimes I do refill it for a single use, but only when I am enjoying the gum massage and not just cleaning my teeth.  </li>
            <li>On low, I get plenty of pressure because I place the tip of the spout right up between teeth and between teeth and gums.       </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to order right now a different product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not going to happen right away, but the batteries will never be the same</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll likely have to refill 1-2x to get the job done right, but if you need a waterpik, I think this is the way to go.</li>
            <li>It died right after the initial battery charge ran out, and refuses to charge up again...</li>
            <li>I have placed a clean pic next to the one with mold, note the darkened clear plastic vs the clear unused pic.</li>
            <li>My older one filled differently and all the extra water in the container could be drained out.  </li>
            <li>after many years of the other model and use i recently upgraded to this one and really like it so far!</li>
            <li>you have immediately shortened their lifespan and limited there capacity to hold a full charge.  </li>
            <li>too read all the reviews and thought it was interesting that there was such polar disparity in the reviews.  </li>
            <li>It really is not very user friendly.</li>
            <li>The product itself works great, but the downside of it is that the water reservoir is to damn small, and has to be refilled several times before it actually gets the job done.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much nicer than the full sized one, comes with four different heads so multiple people can use it.</li>
            <li>This is crazy good!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m only a few days into using it, so, as a say, I&#x27;ll update if things go sideways, but, my first experience is that I really love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>my first use I was surprised by how much this actually hurts.  </li>
            <li>I warm the water prior to putting it in the unit and add a little antiseptic mouth rinse</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m going to see if I can find a new corded version that&#x27;s maybe a little more sturdy than my old unit.</li>
            <li>My only comment is, it certainly cleanses my teeth thoroughly but it runs out of fluid quickly..</li>
            <li>Somewhat bulky;  however, I can live with this.</li>
            <li>This is a teeth saver for my child with new braces.  </li>
            <li>So even after reading the reviews on the new Waterpik Cordless Dental Jet</li>
            <li>I fill my units up to max and the new Water Jet holds twice the amount of water then</li>
            <li>If it were not for this product I would be hopeless in cleaning my teeth since I had my new braces put on.  </li>
            <li>The tips on my new 450 Waterpik [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I cleaned the posts with WD-40 and the unit is re-charging like new.</li>
            <li>where I live the voltage is 240v, so I could not use the product.</li>
            <li>Lifespan:  When it was new, I had to charge the battery once a  week.</li>
            <li>My dentist recommended the WaterPik to me whenI had new crowns put in.  </li>
            <li>We could just order new batteries and replace them and not have to buy a new unit, which is what my wife and I have to do about every year or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is sitting in my recycle bin awaiting a new fate.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m guessing that means I&#x27;ll be getting a new one soon.</li>
            <li>So I don&#x27;t bother to buy a new tip.  </li>
            <li>I do not like the shape of the new one</li>
            <li>I bought this to help with my new braces and it does the job.</li>
            <li>BUT MAY NEED TO REPLACE FOR NEW ONES; TOO SOON?</li>
            <li>I was sent a new waterpik waterflosser within two weeks.  </li>
            <li>The con about it is that if the battery dies, you have to get a new product.</li>
            <li>This means I would have to buy a new waterpick every 1.5 years at this rate.</li>
            <li>Contacting customer service to try and get a new one.</li>
            <li>I ordered a new one and the problems began.</li>
            <li>I need a new 3-volt output AC/AC Adaptor.</li>
            <li>So when the battery goes, you just toss it and get a new one?  </li>
            <li>I contacted Customer Service and was told they would ship me a new set of tips, that was in December 2010, and as of today, Feb 13, 2011, I have not received the replacement tips.</li>
            <li>and id just have to toss it and buy a new one.  </li>
            <li>this is the \\&quot; new improved \\&quot;portable water pik.</li>
            <li>looks like and performs like new.</li>
            <li>When the battery dies, I get a new one because I like it.</li>
            <li>I live overseas, so I&#x27;m charging it on a converter.</li>
            <li>I bought a new W450WP and after about 18 months the battery is deader than a door nail.  </li>
            <li>When I received my new Waterpik Waterflosser Cordless Plus from Amazon, I charged it for 24 hours.  </li>
            <li>If I ran into these problems with a new unit at list prices I would not be so generous.  </li>
            <li>My wife loves this for her new braces and says it gets everything out without the hassle of the toothbrush bristles getting stuck in her braces.  </li>
            <li>Also gives her a new freshness to her breath.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without this.</li>
            <li>the problem is that these should be used in the shower and the new waterpik does not have a rubber cover for the recharging input.</li>
            <li>&quot; I live in Australia where the voltage is 240V.</li>
            <li>I hope the new one lasts a bit longer than two months.</li>
            <li>and I cannot live without it.</li>
            <li>I figured it&#x27;s time for a new one anyway.</li>
            <li>I had started shopping for a new device, determined to never purchase another WaterPik flosser.</li>
            <li>WaterPik replaced my leaking unit with a new one.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even bother calling on the warranty to get a new one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m discarding the new unit and will not bother to replace it.</li>
            <li>Read the reviews about buying new adapter @</li>
            <li>The oral surgeon found nothing new.</li>
            <li>The new one is still working fine over the past year, but I have used other waterpik products more to my liking.</li>
            <li>read the reviews out there about it and 2) if you purchase it, be sure to keep your receipt/box as more than likely you will be returning it after a few months due to charging problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I literally had to plug it in over night and bet on the 50/50 chance of it actually charging or not depending on pure luck!    </li>
            <li>I expected it to clean in between teeth</li>
            <li>But it can be easily rotated by slightly turning it.</li>
            <li>This feature will make it easier to clean and to empty for travel.</li>
            <li>Ok...so if you&#x27;re in need of a great way to achieve the effect of flossing without dragging out the dreaded strings of wax that turn the tips of your fingers numb, this is the real deal.</li>
            <li>Main problem is the tip won&#x27;t stay fixed, it keeps rotating, so it sprays water everywhere</li>
            <li>Main problem is the tip won&#x27;t stay fixed, it keeps rotating, so it sprays water everywhere</li>
            <li>I bought this only a couple of months ago, it worked great, but is now completely broken and will not recharge.</li>
            <li>I expected this to last more than 4 months and would never buy another waterpik.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also not sure that it&#x27;s cleaning any better than normal floss.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend it only if you could get it at a price that would make it worth your wild to buy.</li>
            <li>had to chase up a non standard charger with an unusual input voltage and an unusual output voltage</li>
            <li>Using a waterpik is a great relief to wash away the gunk that is still left behind from floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have a pocket in my gum and the dentist suggested mixing water and peroxide in equal parts to reduce inflammation, so this device makes it easy with the fluid levels marked on the side.</li>
            <li>Main problem is the tip won&#x27;t stay fixed, it keeps rotating, so it sprays water everywhere but your teeth.</li>
            <li>In short - it&#x27;s awkward at best.</li>
            <li>so you either have to fill it back up after you do one side of your mouth or be REALLY fast at getting your whole mouth done.</li>
            <li>So far this one seems to hold a charge for longer than my older ones.  </li>
            <li>(ample amount in fact since I often have contents left over) Is light and maneuverable has 2 power ratings although I only need the hi setting.</li>
            <li>Sure, it&#x27;s a bit bulkier than I would prefer, but I&#x27;ll take a useful product over a broken one any day.</li>
            <li>By the way, I&#x27;d checked prices prior to puschase and found Amazon not only got the lowest price but also provided free shipping.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s handy enough, but often lackluster in power, especially as it aged.</li>
            <li>not so much, because I had used a previous model (same company) that had more pressure for cleaning.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the device is a bit bulky and takes a good amount of space in the bathroom.</li>
            <li>I took it apart and found that the entire internal cavity housing the mechnism was filled with a slimy gray substance with the consistency of stringy Jello, which was strangling the moving parts.</li>
            <li>In the interim I got the Panasonic oral irrigator and love it:  they fixed the one weakness of the Waterflosser:  - dead or dying batteries -by making them replaceable; which also eliminates the problem of lost chargers and corroded connectors.  </li>
            <li>Main problem is the tip won&#x27;t stay fixed, it keeps rotating, so it sprays water everywhere</li>
            <li>I had the dentist put some crowns on, this Water Pick is fantastic is big, hold a lot of water, I found out that when I eat some food is left on my teeth</li>
            <li>Got one for the kid at college that she can keep charged in her room and carry to the bathroom down the hall to keep the mouth in fine order.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very loud and noisy.</li>
            <li>only complaint is that it requires recharging far too often and, if you want full speed operation, even more often.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>when the tube on my (very) old one sprung a leak, I decided to try this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The water pressure isn&#x27;t as high as the old unit...</li>
            <li>very loud, and water leaks out</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty intense, and there&#x27;s definitely a learning curve, but overall, my teeth are much freer of plaque than they used to be.</li>
            <li>, don&#x27;t worry about making a mess, life is so easy now, wish someone would&#x27;ve told me this 10 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I looked for a replacement and was interested to see the new and actually 2nd gen cordless ones but worried about the lackluster reviews.</li>
            <li>The water can get a bit messy but you learn to wrangle the beast pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>Worse than my travel pik which is not as strong as a full size</li>
            <li>And yes, I had the sprayer in my mouth the whole time, but the back-splash made a huge mess!</li>
            <li>Mild diluted dish soap can be used, and a soft damp toothbrush can be used to clean hard to reach areas and crevices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She thought this would be a good idea, but it isn&#x27;t IMO.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s bulky, hard to control and aim, just as noisy as the old ones were and does not hold enough water.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s powerful enough on the low setting to pik through the spaces between teeth, though quite a bit less than the counter top model.</li>
            <li>It works well and is invaluable, as far as I&#x27;m concerned, because healthy gums mean a healthier body, and this certainly makes your gums healthier than flossing alone</li>
            <li>Since I was short on time when the first stopped working, I went to Walgreens expecting to find another WP-450, but all they stocked was a WP-360/365</li>
            <li>you use the higher pressure, you are likely to run out of water before flossing completely.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>it first in the LOW position to check your sensitivity to it.</li>
            <li>It is actually 61.4 % higher in cost.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not excessive.  </li>
            <li>The battery weakens after two washes, so do the lower inside first; then the lower outside; then the uppers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Coffee grinder loud!   </li>
            <li>It is actually 61.4 % higher in cost.</li>
            <li>My first impression is this water flosser was quite big with water reservoir and it requires some pratice to hold the flosser to make it work.</li>
            <li>First one last about 6 months and then stopped charging.</li>
            <li>The first version I bought had a larger reservoir and had to replace the unit after 7 months since it no longer accepted a charge.</li>
            <li>When I first plugged it in, I could only assume and hope that it was charging.&lt;br /&gt;Time</li>
            <li>Wow, what a difference!  </li>
            <li>My countertop version has a ring on the top of the small handheld assembly</li>
            <li>Because my bathroom is small and there&#x27;s no storage room on the sink, I love the cordless model.  </li>
            <li>In my research I was not able to find another product that seemed any better than this one which is why I ended up purchasing it.  </li>
            <li>one is the exact same thing as I had.</li>
            <li>I charged it for 24 hours prior to the first use, just as instructed.</li>
            <li>No invoice was requested, so obviously they are aware of this design flaw.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powerful and holds a charge for a long time.  </li>
            <li>When I first got it, I brushed my teeth and flossed, then used the Waterflosser</li>
            <li>Why in the world Waterpik would be willing to damage its reputation by keeping this albatross on the market is the big mystery.</li>
            <li>At first I thought it needed to be recharged but after charging it overnight I had the same problem.</li>
            <li>My hand is pretty big</li>
            <li>Without the niggles, this could be a five star product, but I give four stars for a pretty solid showing.</li>
            <li>At first the battery would last for a 2-3 day trip - then it would not hold any charge</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll check amazon next time first</li>
            <li>However, some 2 weeks ago, when the warranty year expired, it works for not more than 10 seconds after a recharge of more than 5 hours.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first time in 6 months (when I got my last root canal) that I have not been in pain from the inflammation.  </li>
            <li>My first one died in 2 months and the second one in 6 months.</li>
            <li>The first one died after a year and probably a total of 25 days&#x27; use.</li>
            <li>Downside is that you have to recharge it, but after daily use for a month, it is still on its first charge.</li>
            <li>This model is the second pik i&#x27;ve gotten that has been pretty sh&amp;tty.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But if you&#x27;re going to buy one of these you need to be aware that the current charging instructions are to either keep it on charge when not in use, or to recharge it for 24-hours after seven uses.</li>
            <li>The tab that closes the reservoir opening broke in the first or second week of use.  </li>
            <li>That has been pretty much standard for any device if this type except the waterpik.</li>
            <li>I am anxious to continue using it and seeing how much better my teeth will look (eventually)</li>
            <li>I used the first one for several years before needing a replacement.</li>
            <li>I bought the first unit in March 2012 and it worked well initially but stopped charging after three months.</li>
            <li>I purchased another Waterpik for my husband for Christmas and thought it was the same exact model.  </li>
            <li>If I can get a Waterpik to last for over a year I&#x27;ll give it a higher rating because they do get a lot of food out of my teeth.</li>
            <li>this one conks, I will replace it with the exact same one.</li>
            <li>- at first I had to refill and continue, but now I only use one fill.  </li>
            <li>Upon receipt:&lt;br /&gt;My second water pic..after 5 years the battery on my first one woudn&#x27;t hold a charge.  </li>
            <li>The high power mode on this hand held puts out less pressure than my counter top waterpik on low pressure.</li>
            <li>but I do know it&#x27;s easy to use, takes up LITTLE counter space and is rechargeable.  </li>
            <li>The water presser is a little to strong.</li>
            <li>The one really big issue I have with this appliance is that there is no way to clean and totally drain the reservoir after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>To clean deep gum pocket daily, this is the one nothing else can replace.</li>
            <li>Deep pockets will give you gingivitis, unless you clean them 2X daily.</li>
            <li>Long story short, my July cleaning went just fine, the hygienist was pleased with the results, the dentist noted that my wisdom teeth, which I&#x27;d always had a hard time keeping clean, were much cleaner than previous visits.</li>
            <li>New unit works fine but is a little noisy.</li>
            <li>MAJOR improvement two settings low and high both not as strong as the one on my other which was way too much.</li>
            <li>I find that many other water piks are bulky and messy, but this one is easy to maneuver and actually fits in my medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a dentist and don&#x27;t know how many pounds per square inch are recommended to chase scum away from teeth and gum, but where I once started out clicking up the water pressure output to high</li>
            <li>If Waterpic told the world that this thing is tricky to use, they would sell very few of them - but in truth all sophisticated gadgets have their idiosyncrasies.  </li>
            <li>It has very ample jet action and will clean a mouthful of teeth before running out of water with a little practice.</li>
            <li>I was pretty annoyed about that until I read on this site the positive customer review that included a detailed and well-conceived explanation about the care and charging of the battery.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-This unit takes up very little counter space, or goes in a drawer nicely, as compared to the larger units.</li>
            <li>so I swapped the old one onto the new one.</li>
            <li>I replaced my old portable water pik with this new version.  </li>
            <li>The new waterpik arrived 17 hours after talking to them (Amazon) and I now have the product that far outdoes the &amp;#34;new improved&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>will probably return this new one and get the old model waterpik.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE am hopefol that the new charger cord will solve the problem but am abs horrified that i may have discarded the old ones for no reason.</li>
            <li>Also, as he said, there is no indicator or light or anything to tell you whether it is fully charged which is odd.    </li>
            <li>Got my replacement unit for free in less than a week.  </li>
            <li>I slightly bent one of the tangs on the flossed so the plug fit tighter</li>
            <li>With water the electrode can be easily oxidated to become green and no protection had been considered.</li>
            <li>I think this might be bulky to carry around everyday, but if you leave this in the office it enables you to floss easily even when away from home.</li>
            <li>I really liked the unit (4 stars at least) and in considering alternatives I looked on Waterpik&#x27;s site and noted that a replacement part was sold for the female charger unit that did not look like the two prongs of the older unit that I had.  </li>
            <li>Works easily, does the job and is not as messy as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>The small size is nice and the fact that it is cordless is a big plus.</li>
            <li>Same problem - it doesn&#x27;t charge enough for a full use.</li>
            <li>I finally wound up soaking it with white vinegar, full strength, overnight.  </li>
            <li>I find that the reservoir is big enough for a full cleaning,</li>
            <li>The flow of water is quite strong, the portability of it allows me to use it in a small bathroom where I have no room for our older Waterpik flosser.</li>
            <li>Third, I put mouthwash in my mouth (crest whitening) and brush again with the sonicare and mouthwash for a second full 2 minutes of brushing.  </li>
            <li>Trying to control the tip position, hold your head over and down in the sink, tilt the body so the fluid is around the intake tube and slide the on/off button to the position desired is fairly challenging.</li>
            <li>It makes a huge mess in my opinion but thats just probably operator error.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Additionally, it&#x27;s not nearly as powerful as the original waterpick</li>
            <li>I purchased this as an alternative to a full sized model, mostly due to space requirements on my sink/vanity.</li>
            <li>Also, not knowing how long the machine sat on the shelf with the internals corroding before I bought it, it seems only fair to allow for a dead battery and score it as it runs after repair.  </li>
            <li>The new version is much better but a little larger.</li>
            <li>I previously had an electric model that was a little more powerful</li>
            <li>In short, the Waterpik Ultra WP-450 is less (performance) for more (money).</li>
            <li>I always had problems sticking with flossing as my gums tend to bleed easily and therefore never really pursued it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>The tank did seem to empty quickly, but now I can complete my mouth on one filling.</li>
            <li>Only conplant is water tank could be larger, you have to be quick.</li>
            <li>The only issue I&#x27;ve seen is that it runs out of water quickly, so have to refill several times.</li>
            <li>The negative reviews were very credible.</li>
            <li>Very loud and does not hold enough water to do your whole mouth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, but I found it didn&#x27;t have nearly the pressure as the corded model, and did not hold enough water to go long enough for me.</li>
            <li>The nozzle sometime pops out of the main unit especially at the high pressure setting.    </li>
            <li>Since this is cordless and the water resevoir is in your hand and not on the counter or back of your sink, you can be more mobile in reaching all teeth and angles without spilling water or making a mess in your bathroom.  </li>
            <li>No excuse why everyone shouldn&#x27;t own one and use it at least once a day.  </li>
            <li>The result is a big mess, and consequently the applicance sits unused in my medicine cabinet most of the time.</li>
            <li>The first one didn&#x27;t have what I was looking for, so I tried the other one, and it didn&#x27;t have what I really wanted either.  </li>
            <li>one.&lt;br /&gt;This model will last one week or more on a single charge with the same amount of use.</li>
            <li>You must hold the entire large unit when you use it.</li>
            <li>If the resevoir was larger, it would be too large to be a cordless unit.</li>
            <li>The water reservoir seems large enough as well.</li>
            <li>I would say don&#x27;t bother to order the extra &amp;#34;brushes&amp;#34; unless you need them for a large family.</li>
            <li>think if you have the room, you should get the regular one with the large reservoir.</li>
            <li>You need to rock the unit back and forth a couple of times to drain all the left-over water from the large reservoir.  </li>
            <li>The pressure is well-calibrated and the water reservoir is large enough for a thorough cleaning.</li>
            <li>Compaired to the large models it quit even though its next to your ear.</li>
            <li>There are two settings, LOW AND HIGH, I just start using HIGH setting</li>
            <li>... it&#x27;s a little too bulky to fit into a toiletries bag.  </li>
            <li>Water reservoir lasts just long enough to clean teeth thoroughly.  </li>
            <li>I then used rolled up paper towel and stuff it down into the reservoir, took a chopstick and tried to swish the crumpled paper towel around to clean the interior.  </li>
            <li>Just what I wanted....sits unobtrusively on my counter..ready to use several times a day without having to haul out from under my sink, my old reservoir model..which is too large for the counter.  </li>
            <li>A little bit of Mouthwash mixed in with the water brings forth a refreshing result.   </li>
            <li>The reservoir is too small, you can not complete a full clean unless you refill the reservoir five to six times</li>
            <li>It takes up less space on the bathroom counter than the original size one.</li>
            <li>so I may invest in the more expensive sink-top model later on, but for now this one is doing a fine job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Personally, I would like a little more pressure.  </li>
            <li>So, Amazon gets its usual high mark from me, but Waterpik should be chastized mightily for allowing this product to go out the door as ineffective as it is.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what I expected and would recommend highly.</li>
            <li>but it is a huge waste of money and resources if it has to be replaced every year.</li>
            <li>A huge waste of money.</li>
            <li>Wish Amazon made this clear on the product description.  </li>
            <li>I really miss my old corded model for the following reasons;  </li>
            <li>But clearly it make take some practice to not have 1/2</li>
            <li>unit was supposed  to clear food particles</li>
            <li>On another note, my dentist suggested running hydrogen-peroxide through the waterpik and after finishing, let the unit run a cycle of clear water through it.</li>
            <li>or it wasn&#x27;t too clear</li>
            <li>and they told me to run a couple tablespoons of vinegar along with the water through it and then clear water and that I should charge it for 48 hours.  </li>
            <li>Clearly, the batteries were dying and would not take a charge.      </li>
            <li>I still have to floss, but this does clear away the debris.</li>
            <li>Water pick developed a flaw and forces the clear plastic tube out of the base.&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I purchased this brand on the recommendation of our hygienist for my 89-yr old father.</li>
            <li>We have a 10 year old who just got braces, and his dental hygienist recommended buying this for him.  </li>
            <li>The reservoir is much easier to fill than the last one I had.  </li>
            <li>It is so loud it will wake anyone sleeping.</li>
            <li>Yes I guess it is loud as it is near you</li>
            <li>But not that loud to me(i.e.</li>
            <li>My woman says it is not that loud</li>
            <li>the old WP-360 **&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8.</li>
            <li>Allot of people keep going on about the old WP-360</li>
            <li>Allot of people keep going on about the old WP-360</li>
            <li>I ended up giving it my granddaughter (11 years old)</li>
            <li>although not quite coffee grinder loud.  </li>
            <li>and I went to their online service site yesterday to request info on how to get it fixed as the battery can&#x27;t be user replaced.  </li>
            <li>Loud as any waterpik has been for decades.  </li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.  </li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON WATERPIK.</li>
            <li>It is so loud it will wake anyone sleeping.</li>
            <li>Yes I guess it is loud as it is near you</li>
            <li>But not that loud to me(i.e.</li>
            <li>My woman says it is not that loud</li>
            <li>I always run out of water just before I complete the circle...</li>
            <li>so I could direct the stream.  </li>
            <li>My 12-year old has braces and he was struggling with the flossers and getting them in between the metal in his mouth.</li>
            <li>It fits well in my 12-year old&#x27;s hand and he can get into all the areas of his mouth with no problem.</li>
            <li>Completely unusable for the reasons already mentioned.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product about two months ago and, so far, it is working just as advertised.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far, so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I get up early and it wakes up my family.  </li>
            <li>In my opinion, it&#x27;s not too loud.</li>
            <li>The power seems to be much lower, and even lower once it encounters resistance such as your tooth or gum.</li>
            <li>BOTHERS MY NOW SENSITIVE TEETH</li>
            <li>After owning this device for 7 months, the battery has completely given up the ghost, without warning.    </li>
            <li>I sent it back immediately and spent money on a larger better one.</li>
            <li>I like it a lot and am glad I didn&#x27;t listen to the negative reviews.  </li>
            <li>I do agree with one of the comments about it being loud.  </li>
            <li>and it is not an accident, but a complete rip off.  </li>
            <li>and therefore they are DISHONEST to be sure.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying the old reliable.  </li>
            <li>Frequently my wife&#x27;s hair dryer, after usage, trips the GFI circuit and as a result no power is supplied to all the circuits unless it is reset.  </li>
            <li>I never thought that there are still parts of the developed world that still use 110 V electricity&lt;</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, with my frequent traveling I needed something simular and portable.</li>
            <li>My suggestion is use an old toothbrush and spray some Hydrogen Peroxide while scrubbing with the tooth  brush...</li>
            <li>I am NOT going to pay this much money for something built to last two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No complaints so far.</li>
            <li>Our 16 year old is still in braces.</li>
            <li>But then she can be a bit hyper sensitive at times.</li>
            <li>so I  would know when it is charging and how much of a I have left like I have on my electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>runs out of water if you tip it too far to the side</li>
            <li>This really cleans the tiny gaps of your tooth</li>
            <li>I find that the reservoir will be enough for my whole mouth.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised at what washed from between my teeth that the floss and brushing did not remove.  </li>
            <li>The low speed is gentle on teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>My next check up will be the real deciding factor.</li>
            <li>This one is working well so far and will stay charged for a week at a time.  </li>
            <li>For a 70 year old to be told her teeth look like a 30 year old&#x27;s is quite a compliment.</li>
            <li>If that gets fixed then it&#x27;s five stars.</li>
            <li>I have 9 implants and nearly all my teeth are bridged  </li>
            <li>It has two settings: low and intense.</li>
            <li>After using the Waterflosser several times I really am happen with</li>
            <li>After a few times you can use it comfortably at the sink.  </li>
            <li>Takes care of the problem completely.</li>
            <li>then it developed the battery issue.</li>
            <li>- so far it is working just as well.&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li>It is also bulky and loud.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace my old travel waterpik.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see it as an improvement over the old one.</li>
            <li>The spray itself is underpowered and the battery degraded early on not holding a charge.</li>
            <li>I had the old WP-360</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it so far.</li>
            <li>and now it does not hold a charge for one complete use.</li>
            <li>It is so loud it will wake anyone sleeping.</li>
            <li>Went ahead and purchased and have been pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>and it last the whole week.</li>
            <li>The design is ergonomic and it is not as loud as people write here...  </li>
            <li>I used to have the old type waterpik that had the tank of water you had to fill.</li>
            <li>It is really too soon to tell if it will continue to chatrge, but the charger is configured differently so I hold out hope.</li>
            <li>So as far as Waterpik knew, I was one day out of warranty</li>
            <li>So as far as Waterpik knew, I was one day out of warranty</li>
            <li>The biggest problem is that the pressure it creates is much too low.</li>
            <li>still love this thing and use it at least once a day.  </li>
            <li>Tried cleaning the pins on the charger connector, hasn&#x27;t helped so far.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait till my next dental appointment to see how much improvement I&#x27;ve made</li>
            <li>I thought I was looking for the old timey water pik and saw this and thought I would give it a try.</li>
            <li>Many people may have complained about the corrosion of charging spots: both body and charger.</li>
            <li>I like it so far and for the price?</li>
            <li>I use it only for travel, and for this it&#x27;s very convenient.</li>
            <li>For this amount of money this should last much longer.  </li>
            <li>That old unit with its separate water tank had always been semi-inconvenient and noisy to use... and my irregular use of it was the result.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised at how well this works.  </li>
            <li>Some of us have sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not that they completely die..</li>
            <li>It traveled directly into the trash.  </li>
            <li>My adult son got braces, so I bought this Waterpik for him, as his orthodontist recommended it.</li>
            <li>This way my whole family can use it in different places.</li>
            <li>I developed a technique that allows for this and the pattern lets me keep going without having to stop and start.  </li>
            <li>Just doesn&#x27;t have enough power to really flush out between the teeth.  </li>
            <li>and they pretty much told me they dont last long</li>
            <li>I personally needed a cordless even though I knew it wouldn&#x27;t hold as much water in one use</li>
            <li>I wish there was a battery indicator on it to let you know how much charge is left though.</li>
            <li>This was a replacement for our old one.  </li>
            <li>I  like it  so far.</li>
            <li>I have had one of the old style, sit on the counter units.</li>
            <li>The one said it was loud, coffee grinder loud.</li>
            <li>Bought this for our young son with braces.  </li>
            <li>The water level lasts the whole cycle and he likes the different spray patterns.  </li>
            <li>Battery charge holds up for nearly a week.</li>
            <li>The unit wouldn&#x27;t re-charge, and I discovered that the brass contacts where the cord plugs in, had developed a layer of corrosion.</li>
            <li>I took it apart and found that one of the pump reed valves was deformed but easily fixed.  </li>
            <li>This model did not allow the tank to be emptied completely as the opening was on the side.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that it lasted a week on one charge.</li>
            <li>Product arrived properly packaged and in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li>the first charge lasted a long time and I&#x27;m just today re-charging it.</li>
            <li>the old model does have this.</li>
            <li>furthermore, i believe it uses up the water supply faster than the old model.</li>
            <li>with the old model this \\&quot;active\\</li>
            <li>completely discharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit should be fully charged before extended periods of no use.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised at the bits of debris that came out of my mouth even after brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li>&quot; WOW.</li>
            <li>it loud?  </li>
            <li>after a couple more clumsy attempts (during which I changed tips three times) and two refills I turned it off.</li>
            <li>My dental exams are markedly improved after using this.</li>
            <li>The pressure on this flosser seems to be lacking in comparison to the old Waterpik cordless flosser I had.  </li>
            <li>Broke the old one and tried this because of the price.  </li>
            <li>DOES WHAT THE BIG ONE DOES ...DOES NOT TAKE UP MUCH COUNTER SPACE ..</li>
            <li>The Cordless Plus is convenient to use, holds its charge well, and so far (5 months)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since switched over to the travel model with global voltage as it&#x27;s much easier for</li>
            <li>Do NOT waste your money on this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another issue is that the unit is designed for use only with 110 - 120v electricity, which means if you have to take it to a country with 220-240v electricity, as I had to do, you must get a transformer which is additional cost and sometimes dont work very well.</li>
            <li>This waterpik completely surpasses my old technique of clearing food particles from between my teeth.</li>
            <li>The improvements are so obvious and make so much sense you have to wonder what Waterpik&#x27;s product development team are doing.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how much this water flosser is essential to my life.</li>
            <li>It is so loud it will wake anyone sleeping.</li>
            <li>My old plug-in-the-wall model bit</li>
            <li>It takes some used to getting used to as far as timing.</li>
            <li>I rated this 5 comparing it to the larger ones that I had that the tubing always breaks and is much loader.</li>
            <li>I use my flosser one or two times a day, and I have no trouble with it</li>
            <li>Reasonable power, short battery life.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found it holds enough water for one cleaning session which is really all you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My mouth feels refreshed when I finish--just like the old dental flossing.</li>
            <li>My 3 year old loves to use it too.  </li>
            <li>Only complaint I have about it is that it is kind of bulky</li>
            <li>As attractive as the whole cordless concept may be, the fact is that a standard base unit with a generous reservoir and a small, easy-to-aim handpiece connected by a small hose turns out to be the best design in my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It looked like my third attempt with this 2nd generation WP 450 would be a success.</li>
            <li>I suppose it would do in a pinch if you travel a lot, but for everyday use, much better to purchase the standard countertop unit.</li>
            <li>I hate flossing but love the feel of a super clean mouth.</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s a secret no one will tell you: It may very well work better than floss, but...</li>
            <li>Also, the &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; setting is not really that powerful compared to another model (Gurin Hydroflosser)</li>
            <li>Unless you are prepared to solder on your own transformer as I had to, don&#x27;t buy this for travel overseas, besides,it is really poor anyway.  </li>
            <li>The seal had failed and the battery was fairly corroded.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not all that expensive and does a really good job.  </li>
            <li>This cordless model is a bit more difficult to control due to the size (as opposed to the small easy to handle corded models), the tip tends to swivel much too easily (easier than the corded models)</li>
            <li>when my cordless was new, &#x27;high&#x27; on it was about equal to &#x27;7&#x27;.</li>
            <li>Provides a good excuse to wipe down the bathroom mirrors since they were already wet.</li>
            <li>Tip choices (easy to switch); takes up very little space; easy to clean and fill with water (or mouth wash); relatively quite compared to the big model; delivers a powerful stream at the high setting; minimal mess if you keep your lips closed around the probe.  </li>
            <li>The old unit uses Ni-Cad batteries as the new one uses more expensive L-Ion or NiMH batteries hence the higher cost and the L-Ion battery can hold a charge longer.</li>
            <li>The old unit uses Ni-Cad batteries as the new one uses more expensive L-Ion or NiMH batteries hence the higher cost and the L-Ion battery can hold a charge longer.</li>
            <li>made a mess on my mirror, and didn&#x27;t clean between my teeth anywhere near as well as I was doing before buying it.</li>
            <li>It makes a splashy mess, but does seem to clean between my teeth</li>
            <li>This was the biggest issue, as it made it difficult to make sure the tip was facing the right direction.    </li>
            <li>My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t have a light indicating if it is charging and auttomatically shuts off when fully charged as most other units that are rechargible do.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, as is typical for many rechargeables, it seems to me that it is less powerful than my former plug-in Waterpik.  </li>
            <li>I decided to try and repair it because other reviews said the battery stops charging, anyway I dismantled it which was pretty easy and found that the problem was water and dirt had got onto the contacts on the power button so cleaned them with a swab and put a little petroleum jelly on the contacts</li>
            <li>It never held a charge for very long in the first place.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to avoid having removed and it&#x27;s really been hard to keep the gum area clean.  </li>
            <li>Not sure if it&#x27;s a safety issue, but it is rotating way too easy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;What is not normal (or maybe it could be normal, I really don&#x27;t know)</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think they could make it smaller and still have enough water to clean one entire mouth.</li>
            <li>It is less toxic to you than Clorox and less likely to ignite from a  spark from an electric motor than EverClear alcohol which is also good to kill mold.  </li>
            <li>However, it was not out of water, it was half full.</li>
            <li>Appreciate the different brushes and the new design for filling the tank as well as the new charging method.  </li>
            <li>I am long experienced in rechargeable battery maintenance and usually amaze people with how long my cordless items last.  </li>
            <li>so I got the little one to keep my teeth clean</li>
            <li>me - dental floss goes like this - I pull out a long piece and wrap it around my fingers and start flossing - then the string breaks (is cut by my sharp teeth) - then I have to &amp;#34;re-wrap&amp;#34; - now my hands are slippy and the string loosens on my fingers and slips - more string - more breaks - soon the fingers must be dried to keep the string from slipping - then it breaks again</li>
            <li>He would have liked the reservior to be bigger so that he doesn&#x27;t have to refil as often, but being that it is cordless and smaller it fits well in our small bathroom vanity.</li>
            <li>I can take in the shower and not mess up my bathroom mirror.</li>
            <li>YEAR LATER: battery life extremely short, only 4 or 5 sessions per charge and none of them at full speed.</li>
            <li>so there is no mess.</li>
            <li>No mess</li>
            <li>I normally refill it and use it twice as it only lasts 45 seconds, but it&#x27;s so much nicer than keeping the larger one on the counter!</li>
            <li>I CHARGED IT FOR A FULL 24 HRS PRIOR TO 1ST USE AS INSTRUCTED, BUT FOUND IT TO BE GROSSLY UNDERPOWERED IN COMPARISON TO THE TRADITIONAL PLUG IN VERSION</li>
            <li>I definitely prefer it over normal flossing (despite the water mess, but then again normal flossing is also kind of messy,</li>
            <li>/&gt;After a few weeks, the high speed is still too powerful for me.  </li>
            <li>make my gums feel clean, improves circulation (due to water masaging the gums) and it gets more food particles out that floss or dental picks tend to leave behind..</li>
            <li>It takes up considerably less counter space then traditional waterpiks and even though it doesn&#x27;t hold as much water, I don&#x27;t mind having to fill it twice to keep my smile</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had two in the past that worked fine &amp;</li>
            <li>This portable unit has pressure to clean, but it is so messy to use.  </li>
            <li>The tank is SMALL, I admit and I have to fill&#x27;er up twice, but it works fine</li>
            <li>love my Waterpik, but it&#x27;s ridiculous to replace it every year.</li>
            <li>I purchased this model to replace an older water pik that finally quit.  </li>
            <li>, it holds a charge for many hours, it is small enough to take along if traveling.   </li>
            <li>love the potential of this specific unit, especially for travel, but with its likely battery problems and total lack of customer support, I would not recommend buying it.</li>
            <li>Both of these were the standard counter-top type with a reservoir on top and the nozzle/handle connected by a small hose.  </li>
            <li>The Cordless PLUS has adequate power and enough capacity to do the job, but the inexcusable problem with it is that the connector for the charging cord is totally unprotected from the water that necessarily runs all over the machine while it is in use.</li>
            <li>No more touching the gross floss</li>
            <li>The water pik water flosser is pretty effective and convenient but disappointing in the end.</li>
            <li>Eight weeks in the device wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge -- and the entire assembly where the reservoir meets the main unit was moldy.  </li>
            <li>the first one lasted for 6 months and the second one only three months.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Small enough to leave on the counter top.</li>
            <li>However, the first of these stopped working after 6 months and bought the second lasted only three months and stopped working.</li>
            <li>AS stated above the charger stopped working after the first charge, works only on 110 V and not dual voltage</li>
            <li>You can easily bye the cheaper item with little bit smaller waterbox.</li>
            <li>However, the pressure of the waterpik (on high setting) feels just enough when the battery if fully charged, and quickly decreases into less than satisfactory.</li>
            <li>major gripes about this flosser so far</li>
            <li>There are two setting for pressure, low and high.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no need for high pressures, just enough to remove the food particles.  </li>
            <li>its high pressure setting is really a low pressure setting.</li>
            <li>It has a high &amp; low switch.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a high and a low</li>
            <li>As of now we can not tell difference between high and low water pressure.</li>
            <li>You can adjust the water stream between high and low pressure.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s high or low speed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Settings are set to either high or low.</li>
            <li>Initially, the high setting on this made my gums bleed quite a bit.</li>
            <li>I just bumped it back to high setting.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend w/ flossing for your daily routine ...</li>
            <li>highly recommend water-flossing to remove junk you&#x27;d never know was back there, thus improving your breath for hours.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend using it because, as for me, it is very essential!</li>
            <li>I noticed that it was always on high setting and it could not be changed to low.  </li>
            <li>The setting cannot be changed from high to low.  </li>
            <li>I understand the reservoir issue but that is only if on the high setting, had no problem with charging, the issue I have and continue to have is there is no pressure now</li>
            <li>There are 2 settings; high and low.</li>
            <li>One tank lasts about 28 seconds and it doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s on low or high pressure.  </li>
            <li>I use it for ear lavage on low and as a dental waterpik on high.</li>
            <li>My dentist highly recommended a waterpik for my daily use.</li>
            <li>I use the high setting always with the regular jet tip.</li>
            <li>and then the high setting became like the low.  </li>
            <li>but personally I didn&#x27;t find that part significantly useful compared to the regular attachment that comes with it other than the fact the water pressure was lower in the orthodontic attachment which made it easier to get used to the whole concept of blasting water on to sensitive gums.      </li>
            <li>Fits nicely in my hand and the tank holds enough water to do half my teeth then a quick refill and the other half.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is a little learning curve to holding the unit, but by the second use I was able to do the outside and inside of mygums.</li>
            <li>(I swear on my Catholic upbringing, I do not mean this the way you think</li>
            <li>(I swear on my Catholic upbringing, I do not mean this the way you think</li>
            <li>and after I use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend spending a little more and getting one with a larger tank, however it is not a big deal to refill it a couple</li>
            <li>stays charged over a good few days.&lt;br /&gt;I can fill up the little water reservoir and it will last for all of my teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And it was $10 less on Amazon (with free shipping) than at the big box stores.  </li>
            <li>But refilling is easy and takes only a few seconds.  </li>
            <li>Takes a little practice to do it right without hosing down your bathroom, but your mouth feels really clean after.  </li>
            <li>It was huge, loud, a hassle to fill, had a short tube that could accidentally get yanked, and took one of my few outlets in the bathroom.</li>
            <li>The big problem is that after about 3 weeks of normal use, the unit does not fully charge.  </li>
            <li>It works quite well, but does have only two positions, the \\&quot;low\\&quot; being too weak and the \\&quot;high\\&quot; being kind of \\&quot;low\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Secondly, for a device that is meant to be used in an environment full of water for an activity that involves a lot of water flowing and splashing around, it is not exactly water proof.  </li>
            <li>I love the travel version of my big Waterpik, actually I use it everyday and not just for travel.  </li>
            <li>Resulted in going back using normal</li>
            <li>I have a full size waterpik which I use everyday and wanted this item for travel.  </li>
            <li>Easy to fill and empty, I leave mine open to dry completely.</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t plug it back in right after using it so that the socket can dry, someone commented that the nodes can get corroded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little unwieldly to hold, but you get used to it quickly.  </li>
            <li>then it&#x27;s little brother and get the job done quick.</li>
            <li>The resevoir is large enough to do a twice daily cleaning.</li>
            <li>Not the case easy to use and gets to those hard to reach places.  </li>
            <li>They should make a portable device with a seperate tank with a hose - something similar to the regular full size model, but with a smaller tank, shorter hose, and smaller handle.  </li>
            <li>I was buying the handheld because my bathroom sink is a pedestal-type with only a tiny ledge, not big enough to handle the full size, boxy, corded waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I decided it is not worth taking a chance on this model again as more than likely the same problem will occur so will be purchasing a different brand.</li>
            <li>I would be required to purchase an entire new tank for $8 plus shipping.  </li>
            <li>Finally got it to charge but decided to order the new model wp450 ultra.  </li>
            <li>I was foolish enough to give a new one a chance.  </li>
            <li>I bought my Phillips Sonicare toothbrush at the same time, and it&#x27;s still working like new, so</li>
            <li>The dealer executed a warranty claim and I just got a new one (not the same model)</li>
            <li>I sent the Cordless back today and ordered a new Waterpik Ultra.</li>
            <li>I sent the Cordless back today and ordered a new Waterpik Ultra.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this new cordless Waterpik for several weeks</li>
            <li>Since it has a very short warranty, a year I believe, I had to buy a new one.</li>
            <li>Replaced it with a corded waterpik and a new shelf next to the sink.  </li>
            <li>Because how itwas listed when you put Waterpik into the search boox, a different irrigator is snuggled in below the waterpiks and says its the NEW AND IMPROVED version MISLEADING one to believe it is also by waterpik.</li>
            <li>I chatted with Amazon and they said they would send me a new waterpk on SAME DAY SERVICE at their expense for the confusion.</li>
            <li>The new unit is having the same problem.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m debating whether to go through the dance to get it warrantied or just junk it and get a new one (possibly not Waterpik brand).  </li>
            <li>Waterpik sent me a new one and now 6 months in I am having the same problem.</li>
            <li>We are on vacation with our new Waterpik and want our money back.  </li>
            <li>It leaked water in big puddles after emptying, but I could live with that.</li>
            <li>It was noisy and screamed when the water got low, but I could live with that.</li>
            <li>I notice the new units in the stores have only a 1-year warranty.</li>
            <li>Meaning that: while new, I would only need to recharge it after say, six uses.</li>
            <li>On this new model I noticed a redesign of the charging connection and the charger itself is different.  </li>
            <li>nope, just not enough umph even brand new &amp; fully charged.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I truly do love this little bugger!!!  </li>
            <li>It tries to miniaturize its traditional water flosser into a smaller version, but still cumbersome version, and keeps the cordless and potentially easily portable version constrained with the above</li>
            <li>L-Ion / NiMH batteries do not suffer from this problem that I know of, but it is always better to only charge any battery after it loses its charge.</li>
            <li>L-Ion / NiMH batteries do not suffer from this problem that I know of, but it is always better to only charge any battery after it loses its charge.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised that this one isn&#x27;t too loud yet still has the same pressure.    </li>
            <li>I use my regular waterpik daily but it takes up so much space when traveling.</li>
            <li>Yes, it is loud but every water pick I have ever tried has been loud and given that you only use it for 30 seconds in my opinion</li>
            <li>I use it only sometimes because the lowest selection (it only has two) is too intense for my gums.</li>
            <li>Even on low, the amount of fluid squirting through the jet is to much.</li>
            <li>With all the problems above, I actually don&#x27;t care too much on this.    </li>
            <li>I had the prior model and this is a big improvement in handling it as it has a curved body now instead of straight.</li>
            <li>However the tank is not big enough to do the whole mouth.</li>
            <li>It is not as powerful and holds much less water.  </li>
            <li>I should be able to use it at least 2-3 times before having to charge it again instead of the one time that I&#x27;m currently getting.</li>
            <li>my only least favorite thing is that I travel for work</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t blame this on the product itself since I should have realized that a cordless Waterpik with this capacity was going to be big, but it does not fit comfortably in my hand.  </li>
            <li>I have found that the smaller, &amp;#34;waterpik&amp;#34; flosser does the job every bit as well, and is much easier to pack for travel if necessary.</li>
            <li>so I try to really hit my rough spots early on.  </li>
            <li>for its effectiveness, my teeth definitely feel cleaner but the real test will come when I see my dentist next.</li>
            <li>times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am currently using the tip that has a lot of brushes on the end as it does not seem to be as intense as the regular tip.  </li>
            <li>Yes, presently, I have to refill frequently, but in my opinion, it&#x27;s a minor inconvenience compared to a large unit sitting on the counter</li>
            <li>Whatever, the old electric pik was easier to control, just a tiny attachment on a long tube, easy to aim and didn&#x27;t tend to send water down my arm and onto my pajama&#x27;s arm like this cordless one does.  </li>
            <li>my only complaints I have about it is it&#x27;s very loud and it leaks.  </li>
            <li>Liked cordless feature for ease of use and smaller profile for counter space, however jet stream was simply too weak compared to old corded model I was replacing.</li>
            <li>The thing comes with clear instructions to charge it like 24 hours before first use, and to NOT run it all the way down.</li>
            <li>It will make a huge mess in your toilet if you plan to use it with a mirror.</li>
            <li>I actually got a customer service rep in less than 5 minutes, to whom I explained my problem to, and then I provided her with the serial number and the model number of the machine, and she assured  me that it would be no problem, and they would send another one out as a replacement right away!</li>
            <li>I just need to decide if the mess is worth it.</li>
            <li>The only other cordless oral hygiene product I can compare it to in terms of its lifespan and design is the Phillips sonic toothbrush,  My original toothbrush lasted 5+ years before dying and had indicator to inform you the level of charge left and/or amount of the battery charged during recharging.  </li>
            <li>This is my first Waterpik and I bought due to braces.  </li>
            <li>Took back to the store and exchanged for another one, and had the exact same problem with the second one.  </li>
            <li>There were suggestions given in other reviews how to make the first one work again</li>
            <li>One major disadvantage is I won&#x27;t have the option of using mouthwash (e.g. Listerine) instead of water alone in the spray with it.    </li>
            <li>I was in target the other day and found this exact one for cheaper than I paid here.</li>
            <li>But the funny thing is that the same problem happened to my relative&#x27;s Waterpiks after the same period of time!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve followed the care instructions, but the fact that it&#x27;s cordless is the major problem.</li>
            <li>I love the way my teeth feel after using it, but it is messy, and the water doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>product did take a little getting used to the first time i used it and took longer than 60 seconds!</li>
            <li>However, it is cordless and lasts a very long time without recharging (I barely have to charge it) which is really convenient.</li>
            <li>I find this model has plenty of power and lasts long enough to get a single clean out of the water reservoir.</li>
            <li>It is adequate but the water stream is not nearly as powerful as the tradiional model nor does it hold enough water.</li>
            <li>I had a difficult time using regular floss and this works great, especially with 2 different pressures of the water.</li>
            <li>It is powerful enough for me, but I never used the larger unit above the third setting anyway.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say how many times I left it to charge for 24 hours and came back to use it, only to find out it was still dead.</li>
            <li>BUT, my daughter never used a previous model so this feels right to her.</li>
            <li>Overall the waterpik performs as advertised and thus far I have found no down side.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t any way to clean this reservoir either unless you can get a brush into the small hole and even so, you would need to bleach it to kill all the bacteria.  </li>
            <li>Small water capacity sometimes not finish to clean and have to refill&lt;br /&gt;Oxidation on the battery charger conector</li>
            <li>Lighter, more portable, much less trouble than those clunky reservoir units of old.</li>
            <li>On about ONLY the 6th use, half way through a session, the pressure suddenly dropped and the sound of the pump increased...</li>
            <li>tank last just long enough for me and the battery life is better than I expected, lasting a couple weeks on one charge.</li>
            <li>My dentist&#x27;s lab tech said I needed something more than brushing, and she knew I had trouble flossing due to my permanent bridges.</li>
            <li>one even had 3 streams which I did not see as being useful), but I only find use for the regular single stream nozzle; all the others can be discarded.  </li>
            <li>I admit that I purchased the unit locally rather than on Amazon because I was not sure that the unit on Amazon would be the re-designed unit or the old original.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that with practice you get the job done in less time and with less refills.</li>
            <li>The reservoir is SMALL enough to easily be held, emptied back out, and to fit under the faucet in a small sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s plenty to clean your mouth, front and back, all the way around, a few times on a fill.</li>
            <li>Not only does it clean debris between teeth and gums, it has removed a lot of a patch of tarter in just a few days with twice a day use.</li>
            <li>(My brother recommended this particular model and tip type, and he says his gum pockets were noticeable smaller are using it regularly).</li>
            <li>- It came with extra tips with different names and shapes, but I just use the classic one.</li>
            <li>I was lucky to have purchased from a big box store with a 90 day return policy (yes, this happened to me in less than 90 days).</li>
            <li>Because of their inherent convenience and ease of use, I am a big fan of battery-powered oral irrigators and have had several of Waterpik&#x27;s older WP-360W model.</li>
            <li>The fact that it did actually work, and kinda decently, for a couple months, is the only reason it didn&#x27;t get a 1-star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had major problems with gingivitis that developed suddenly.</li>
            <li>You only have two choices, low and high.  </li>
            <li>The low setting is pretty much worthless and the intense as I&#x27;ve already stated is more a setting of \\&quot;4\\&quot; on my older Waterpik Ultra.</li>
            <li>In general terms I like the device</li>
            <li>This one has two speeds setting, which is not strong enough to clean teeth.</li>
            <li>especially when so many people on this review board said that it was not a good machine.  </li>
            <li>As to it not running long enough, this one really leaves me wondering.</li>
            <li>Amazon should have known this and made it clear that this model will only run on 110 volts.</li>
            <li>The real test of these things is how long do they Last.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First let me start by saying that this was my first waterflosser, and since I&#x27;ve never liked flossing I was really looking forward to this being good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve only used it once.  </li>
            <li>water is all over the place, the reservoir is EMPTY, and user is ready to throw it against the wall.    </li>
            <li>Apparently, the reservoir was leaking and air-borne or water-borne</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s only one year old</li>
            <li>Time will tell, and I will update my review if any problems come up in near future.</li>
            <li>I have another Waterpik at home (works completely on electricity) has a very low setting</li>
            <li>As a result, it sat in my bathroom closet for nearly three years before I finally tossed it in the trash.  </li>
            <li>The third one (the Professional model)</li>
            <li>The problem I had with mine, is that it stopped working entirely when it was four months old.</li>
            <li>I travel frequently and take a current converter with me anyway,</li>
            <li>Split decision because there&#x27;s no storage for extra heads in or near the unit.</li>
            <li>next thing I noticed was that, try as I might, there was no way to get all of the desired angles without causing the unit to suck air because the reservoir, naturally, must move with the handle.  </li>
            <li>battery barely makes 2 weeks, not that</li>
            <li>pics come only with complete box.</li>
            <li>and apparently it takes practice.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, more difficult to clean since the reservoir has only a small round egress that does not allow all the water to be emptied.</li>
            <li>I bought this one after my old one pooped out after only a year of use.</li>
            <li>My gums are much healthier and exhibit a pink color.  </li>
            <li>It is far inferior to the regular plug in version.</li>
            <li>it will not recharge - takes me a minimum of 3 tries to get it to really charge.  </li>
            <li>(especially if you don&#x27;t flush or have sensitive gums).</li>
            <li>can i take it in my back pack to school/office - absolutely yes (not too big for a pocket in back</li>
            <li>I just replaced my old one with this model, after constant use for three years.</li>
            <li>This portable one is a bit larger than I imagined but not heavy.</li>
            <li>Wow - it&#x27;s a different machine:  </li>
            <li>They all worked for years but this one worked for barely 5 weeks, then died..</li>
            <li>finished water flossing, we recommend completely emptying the internal pump housing of water.</li>
            <li>After careful brushing and flossing, there are still bits of food that are flushed out from the gums, and your mouth feels much cleaner after using your Waterpik,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quieter and completely tolerable when it&#x27;s pumping fluid.  </li>
            <li>Thus, I spent as much time drying out the electrical connections as using it on my mouth.  </li>
            <li>The Waterpik is a vital part of my daily dental hygiene.</li>
            <li>Not so apparently, I asked a friend who is an electrical engineer to check it out - his verdict is that there must be a fault with the device.</li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t tried using all the different tips.</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to temperature, especially in the winter, so I run the hottest tap water, and it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.  </li>
            <li>As I noted in an earlier review of my experience with several of my last few counter top models......  BEWARE of MOLD buildup internally.....</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m covering up the hole with tape during normal usage and only charging it when it&#x27;s going low.</li>
            <li>I have several crowns, bridges and implants, made necessary because all my life I&#x27;ve had an auto-immune disease that prevents me from producing a normal level of saliva.  </li>
            <li>However the hygiene is worth the trouble.</li>
            <li>I liked the look of the one with the brush attached, thinking it would be quite efficient - wrong -</li>
            <li>I have a small bathroom and no counter space for the full size waterpik.</li>
            <li>ANYWAY, IF YOU HAVE THE UNIT LOOK AT IT BEHIND THE WATER RESERVOIR AND MAKE SURE</li>
            <li>Sometimes I take more time squirting, so I have to refill the reservoir, but that takes approximately 5 seconds to do.</li>
            <li>After a few days of working beautifully the battery on both failed to charge.</li>
            <li>being this small, it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>That pause button is very useful and shouldn&#x27;t be that hard to implement on the Waterpik Ultra.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take up much room on the counter, and I have now gotten the wrist action down</li>
            <li>reading the reviews on this water flosser as I am looking for a replacement, there has been a very high volume of complaints about the unit not charging at less than 1 year old.  </li>
            <li>As far as water capacity goes, I usually am done flossing right about the time I&#x27;m about out of water.  </li>
            <li>(I am at least on week 3 of the initial charge; it is still going strong).  </li>
            <li>so I won&#x27;t have to live too long without it?    </li>
            <li>did have a problem after a long time of using mine, but since it has a warranty, I e-mailed the company, and they sent me a brand new one.&lt;br /&gt;Great customer service.</li>
            <li>Since I had long since thrown out the box and paperwork I had forgotten that there was a two-year warranty on it and went ahead a bought a new one.</li>
            <li>(the number is on their website) and as long as you are in the warranty period, they&#x27;ll send a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My first unit lasted about a year and a half</li>
            <li>The stream is much too weak to be useful to me.</li>
            <li>When I first started using the Ultra, I had to start on the low setting due to gum sensitivity.    </li>
            <li>Not sure what other people are using it for that they need more than that.</li>
            <li>The first one, due to corrosion on the charge wiring and male connectors of the unit.</li>
            <li>but if I&#x27;m quick I can usually get my teeth done unless there&#x27;s some food</li>
            <li>The only hitch, which I blame the manufacturer, is there are only 2 settings for the water flow, high or low.</li>
            <li>The play between high and low pressure is slight and often high comes on with a slight move of the hand and ouch too much power on the gums!</li>
            <li>Now it operates fine for ONLY 3 seconds then quickly loses all its power.</li>
            <li>and I have hardly a cleaning where I don&#x27;t need to clean myself and</li>
            <li>On the other hand, I really did like this one</li>
            <li>My husband suggested I get this for my bridge - it&#x27;s hard to get between the bridge to clean.  </li>
            <li>They say it is because of hard water and to clean it with vinegar and change the tip.</li>
            <li>I was unsure about getting this or the countertop model but decided on this one as the other one seemed much too bulky to display on the countertop.</li>
            <li>I still floss at night but very seldom is any other residue dislodged.  </li>
            <li>and it is hard to clean it out.  </li>
            <li>Water in the storage part last long enough for me to do my whole mouth, what else do you need?</li>
            <li>True enough, I got it in a few days with no extra charge.</li>
            <li>I am comparing this new Cordless PLUS unit to the old one, not against other cordless units.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noise</li>
            <li>I use on low pressure because the high pressure depletes the water too fast and makes an even bigger mess.  </li>
            <li>It is easier for me to simply leave the little spout in one place and hold the waterpik with two hands and very carefully trace the gum/tooth line for the top and bottom front and bottom back.  </li>
            <li>The product itself looks a little clunky in a very modern bathroom so my wife makes me store it under the sink rather than leaving it</li>
            <li>Furthermore, my jaw appreciates that I don&#x27;t have to open it very wide to have clean gums and minimal pockets.  </li>
            <li>Well, if one avoid pour the unit it would work fine, but this is not a good idea for anything used in a bathroom.</li>
            <li>Still, at least the contacts have stayed clean, but it does seem that Waterpik could design a waterproof way to close the portal when it&#x27;s not in use, or even a sealed arrangement with inductive charging.  </li>
            <li>You will need to stop and refill at least 5 times to clean your mouth once.   </li>
            <li>But I freely admit that I can&#x27;t think of how such a system could be worked out without some complex system of automatically-operated valves or the like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really wish I had counters in either bathroom to just get a standard countertop tank Waterpik, but we&#x27;re stuck with standalone sinks.</li>
            <li>I am always surprised by what is washed out of my gums, especially if I had brushed first.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Only takes a couple of tries to become very proficient at using.  </li>
            <li>Also, to the person who says it lasts 10 seconds, can you imagine how big this thing would be to hold a few minutes worth of water?</li>
            <li>The small charging station and handle reservoir make this so handy for small spaces and travel.</li>
            <li>Only draw back is that you have to get use to the product because the water comes out rather quickly &amp; can be messy.</li>
            <li>I love the little brush attachment it came with as opposed to the plain tube.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I gave myself a facial and washed the mirror down.</li>
            <li>it had a little higher pressure.  </li>
            <li>I use this in the morning only and it has been a major benefit.&lt;br /&gt;At 64</li>
            <li>If I could change something, I wish the higher strength setting was a little bit stronger, but I guess that is the sacrifice you make with a portable unit.  </li>
            <li>However, our first one lasted a little over a year then quit.</li>
            <li>I have owned two (three, if you count the first one which never worked due to an initial battery problem) lesser WaterPik flossers.  </li>
            <li>The other reviews have accurated stated that it takes a little effort to get comfortable with using this item.  </li>
            <li>The reservoir&#x27;s filling hole is too small to do anything more than rinse it out, and even in a dry climate it doesn&#x27;t dry out between uses.  </li>
            <li>can select water pressure (strong, weak).</li>
            <li>If you live long enough ever one will need one.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Highly recommend to anyone who wants to give up conventional string flossing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first problem with this model is the capacity, which is about half the size of the regular model.  </li>
            <li>The small reservoir needs to be refilled several times to do an adequate job.</li>
            <li>the water reservoir is larger but, on high, does not last as long (42 seconds).</li>
            <li>for general rinsing only, and doesn&#x27;t replace the dentist.</li>
            <li>This works really well and works with my other cleaning tips on my larger waterpik.</li>
            <li>I just used it for the first time and it was a total mess.</li>
            <li>Really like the item until I had to recharge about every other day then daily.</li>
            <li>The earlier model was a barely working toy.  </li>
            <li>There is no excuse to market this junk.  </li>
            <li>I barely get one use out of it after charging for several hours.</li>
            <li>Now, a twelve-hour charge barely gives me three or four days, same amount of time nightly.</li>
            <li>This has never work well at all, I had to finally go out &amp; buy another one, I feel I should be able to return this and at least get a partial credit.</li>
            <li>First few uses</li>
            <li>Then more recently for several months now, its been leaking water and it keeps getting worse.</li>
            <li>My first one (the Plus model) basically fried the battery with green foam pouring out of the charging slot.  </li>
            <li>teeth were so sore the first few weeks and</li>
            <li>It was small and powerful.</li>
            <li>It is a bit messy to use at first, but got the hang of using it soon.</li>
            <li>First one lasted a few weeks before doing this.</li>
            <li>I notice that my gums bleed for the first few days of use.  </li>
            <li>you have to really hang over the sink so you don&#x27;t get water all down your front.</li>
            <li>This Waterpik may feel a little bit bulky at first compared to a regular toothbrush</li>
            <li>corded model takes a little more counter space but not much more.</li>
            <li>Though the time is given, this waterpik is a short-lived glory; the water runs out quickly, and the pressure isn&#x27;t as hard as I was used to with a plug-in type.</li>
            <li>The tank quickly drained and I had a hard time controlling the water as I flossed.</li>
            <li>The reservoir is one piece molded plastic, and except for the small filler opening, there is no way to clean and dry it -</li>
            <li>it is not that much of the difference from previous one.  </li>
            <li>However, it works very well and recovers hidden food particles all of the time.</li>
            <li>At least the company is willing to replace the units that die young.</li>
            <li>I would barely feel the water stream hitting my teeth, but then I noticed that several food particles would come out, even after doing a regular floss.  </li>
            <li>like you normally would- just to get the minimal amount of respect and for them to believe that their product is actually malfunctioning.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize just how thin and strong the water stream is.  </li>
            <li>We love to take road trips in a tiny little sports car, where space is at a minimum, and in the past it meant leaving the Waterpik at home.</li>
            <li>One reviewer said they don&#x27;t last because the parts don&#x27;t fit tight enough and water entering the interior ruins them prematurely.</li>
            <li>Pump motor is not able to spray the water - but runs fine when empty!</li>
            <li>I have a Waterpik for home use in my bathroom, but it is a little too large to travel with.</li>
            <li>- It is a little large to travel.  </li>
            <li>it is pretty loud - I live in a condo, and at night I&#x27;m almost concerned it might wake up my neighbors (that said, this might not be as dramatic when you&#x27;re not the one who holds it in hand)&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live with the fact that it loses it&#x27;s whole charge after about 2 1/2 days though.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve made a few improvements to this new model, but I never had any problem with the old one.</li>
            <li>Also, this has two power settings, Low or High, where the other one is continuously adjustable over a wider range of pressures.  </li>
            <li>It did clean my mouth rather well, its small and compact, it fit nicely on my small sink, and although I had to refill it a few times for the entire mouth, this did not bother me.  </li>
            <li>&#x27;S BACK, WHEN I SAW IT, THE WHOLE INSIDE WAS COVERED IN BLACK MOLD.</li>
            <li>, that actually makes it a fast job -- as they say in the instructions, about a minute and a half</li>
            <li>, that actually makes it a fast job -- as they say in the instructions, about a minute and a half</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that it runs out of water quickly.</li>
            <li>but there is no good way to clean the tank.</li>
            <li>It seems to not have as much water pressure as the other models that have a separate water reservoir and a long cord attached.</li>
            <li>The larger tip is useless; it pours out too much water and empties the water reservoir too quickly.</li>
            <li>The water power itself is decent; it&#x27;s definitely not as powerful as a plug-in flosser</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t mind spending money for a piece of poor engineering and replace it every 8-12 months it works fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After the quick failure of the replacement sent by Waterpik, outlined below, I e-mailed them about it.</li>
            <li>It also gives less control over angling the thing in the right way, and combined with the moving tip, it&#x27;s just that much harder.    </li>
            <li>I CANNOT believe this little machine could do THAT much in ONE use.</li>
            <li>Using the waterpik, I see many small particles being removed!!!</li>
            <li>Our (new) dentist recommended that we both start using a WaterPik and Sonicare electric toothbrushes due to &amp;#34;issues&amp;#34; with our gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have a tight jaw, so I can&#x27;t really get to my back teeth with regular floss.  </li>
            <li>need that size for travel (3-4 days of the week) and are now considering buying an additional more cumbersome base unit that is far better at flossing and cleaning the teeth, even though it is not suitable for travel.</li>
            <li>It comes with a very small water container which you can run out of water quickly, you have to refill three or four times to get work done.</li>
            <li>I use very warm water and turn on the pik so that the initial cold water (which remains from my previous use)goes into the sink, not my mouth.  </li>
            <li>Despite being rechargeable, It works just as well as my old hard wired apparatus that took up too much space.</li>
            <li>Only 2 water pressure speeds and high is not powerful enough after using for 1-2 weeks.  </li>
            <li>The only drawback is that the water pressure isn&#x27;t as high as I would like, but that is a personal preference, and one that should not be an issue for the average user.</li>
            <li>The only think I found annoying in the beginning is that the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; button in not also the &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; button - two separate buttons for each state and that took some time for me to learn :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are plenty of things that I use every single day but none have made such a significant difference to my health.</li>
            <li>bad quality for a good name.</li>
            <li>Good idea, bad implementation.</li>
            <li>It really gets the crude out from between the teeth and works better than just flossing alone.</li>
            <li>Since the unit can only suck up water when it&#x27;s being held more or less vertically, that seriously restricts the possible aim angles of the nozzle.  </li>
            <li>Now I place a piece of clear tape over the terminals until the unit needs to be charged; I only charge the unit when the battery is spent.</li>

            <li> I do everything in a rush in the mornings and the water pik is an excellent compliment to my procrastination.  </li>
            <li> For the price I think this item is great!</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful product.  </li>
            <li> Since it uses NiCad batteries, it&#x27;s best to drain the batteries before recharging.</li>
            <li> It was an excellent recommendation!  </li>
            <li> Even just using water makes your teeth feel great!</li>

            <li> , it is a very good product.  </li>
            <li> very good buy.</li>
            <li> And is very good for gums,you should buy this one</li>

            <li> The countertop model worked great, my hygienist is very happy with the results....</li>
            <li> However, it is ideal for travelling, to which end</li>
            <li> A slimmer model would be ideal for traveling use.</li>
            <li> And all, at good price!  </li>
            <li> I bought in KOREA, delivered in good condition!</li>
            <li> works great and a very good price</li>
            <li> The ortho tip does a good job of cleaning my braces, and the tongue cleaner is great too!</li>
            <li> and it works beautifully.</li>
            <li> Excellent for travel although it is of a good size.</li>
            <li> As a test, I&#x27;ve used dental floss after the Waterpik to see how good it does, and I&#x27;ve been impressed.  </li>
            <li> This waterpik is good and perfect for travel.</li>
            <li> But, impressive to look at, so that seemed a good sign.  </li>
            <li> He said it is very refreshing!</li>
            <li> It works great.</li>
            <li> Works great, takes leftover food debris out well, keeps dental plaque away, my dentist and hygienist noticed the improvement.  </li>

            <li> the price was great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>

            <li> LOL</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> and she loves it, so great job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;v had this for over a year, and it works great.</li>
            <li> They send out form letters and convince themselves that it is a great product because of all of the focus groups or the person sending out the letters just sends out letters and no one listens to them....</li>
            <li> This is a great product, portable,easy to hold and carry while travelling.</li>
            <li> and she has great hearing**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> I agree with the front page review that this is a great product, however I don&#x27;t agree with everything he said (the arrows indicate my comments):    </li>
            <li> and she has great hearing</li>
            <li> This item is great.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> Even if the Waterpik does a great job on teeth, I am reluctant to use it.</li>
            <li> but the fact is the water pik works great.</li>
            <li> , the waterpik works great</li>
            <li> The cordless works great when you travel.</li>
            <li> This machine is great for cleaning your teeth between brushing.  </li>
            <li> Got this on the advice of the dentist and recommendations of the reviews for this product and it works GREAT.  </li>
            <li> but I use this twice a day, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Its features are great.</li>
            <li> and I can recommend this product as something that will make you happy when you go in for cleanings.</li>
            <li> Great as a water pistol</li>
            <li> So any product that will step in for flossing part of the time is a great thing.</li>
            <li> Just returned from a trip and it worked great.</li>
            <li> I AM HAPPY WITH THE WATERPIC CORDLESS WATERFLOSSER.  </li>
            <li> itself works great, by the way.</li>
            <li> It worked great for about six months, then quit.  </li>
            <li> It works great for me.  </li>
            <li> Great unit for pressures and portability.  </li>
            <li> Great price for a great product.  </li>
            <li> During it&#x27;s life it worked great.  </li>
            <li> It was great for getting between teeth.  </li>
            <li> Great price.  </li>
            <li> The idea is great</li>
            <li> For a product pitched as being a great product for someone with orthodontics they didn&#x27;t think that through.</li>
            <li> , it is not the rechargeable one, but, I am happy with the solution.  </li>

            <li> And it is very effective.</li>
            <li> So great that I ordered a number of them to carry in my own store!</li>
            <li> Healthy Teeth are Priceless.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy and glad I ordered this waterpik.</li>
            <li> I think it is most excellent!</li>

            <li> my dentist will be impressed :)</li>
            <li> Waterpik is a good product i am happy with it.</li>
            <li> Great product my husband loved</li>
            <li> It works great, charge lasts a good while</li>
            <li> This Waterflosser is great and because of my using it I got a good report from my Dentist.  </li>
            <li> Waterpikin&#x27; as we call it, is the best thing to keep you mouth and gums healthy.</li>
            <li> OK but returned for a WP100 whick works great!</li>
            <li> The price was good and the service was great.  </li>
            <li> unit has appropriate power and a wonderful battery life.</li>
            <li> Thrilled with my purchase!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m still happy I made this purchase though, and hope to get good feedback from my dentist.</li>
            <li> Works good, very effective and conveniently portable.</li>
            <li> It is well-balanced and pleasant to hold and use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It turns out that this device is pleasant to use.  </li>
            <li> Excellent tool to clean gum line!</li>
            <li> He has been very happy with it and credits it with improving his gums.&lt;br /&gt;However, the ability to charge the battery is deteriorating -- must now charge every 2 days, and even that is becoming unreliable.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, works great!  </li>
            <li> Its easy for him to use and is still working flawlessly.</li>
            <li> Waterpik is my new best friend &lt;3</li>
            <li> Very good result, much much better than flossing.</li>
            <li> It was a very good decision and my gums feel healthy and well</li>
            <li> so its very easy to carry on the road with you and maintain your dental health !</li>
            <li> Great, amazing to see what toothbrush misses</li>
            <li> good,.</li>
            <li> Good stuff</li>
            <li> Gave it a  4 because it&#x27;s a good product.  </li>
            <li> The WP-450 is good quality except for the battery and the WP-360/365 is junk.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really good product.</li>
            <li> It is good looking</li>
            <li> Because of my good experience with the 350W, and because the WP-450 is rechargeable, I was inclined to prefer it over the Panasonic Oral Irrigator EW-DJ10-A.    </li>
            <li> outstanding product at an incredible price.</li>
            <li> While unit has a good waterproofing gasket where it disassembled in two parts the charging outlet is not waterproof at all, just has nothing to prevent water coming in.</li>
            <li> My model shoots a good stream of water and cleans around my braces.  </li>
            <li> Size wise</li>
            <li> It makes your mouth feel really good.</li>
            <li> and I loved it.  </li>
            <li> The Dentist said my teeth and gum are looking good.    </li>
            <li> Its fairly portable for traveling, packing.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll need to fill it four times to do a good job.</li>
            <li> Although it is definitely surprisingly bulky, it has to be (I couldn&#x27;t tolerate it if I had to refill 8 times).    </li>
            <li> Your unit must have an insanely good battery.</li>
            <li> When it was working, it performed fairly well.</li>
            <li> I took really good care of my Waterpik, and it still died in two months.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Also it does a good job of cleaning my teeth.  </li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t one thing good about this product.  </li>
            <li> It has good pressure and once you charge it you can use it for quite sometime before recharging.  </li>
            <li> Good item.  </li>
            <li> No, but it goes well with flossing or is a good stand-in.</li>
            <li> It is a good product.</li>
            <li> The unit cleans all the particles away from your teeth and feels good on the gums.</li>
            <li> The portable unit requires two fill ups to do a good job</li>
            <li> and it holds a charge for a good week.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.</li>
            <li> In addition, it feels sooo good while you&#x27;re doing it.</li>
            <li> Good for travel.</li>
            <li> Some good and some not so good.  </li>
            <li> I was told by someone that had their Waterpik die and replaced by Waterpik that you MUST keep it plugged in ALL the time to keep the charge good.    </li>
            <li> I would NEVER go a day without one, it&#x27;s that good for braces.</li>
            <li> They are good and always extract food particles even after a good brushing.</li>
            <li> The water pressure is good.  </li>
            <li> For travel, the Panasonic is good.</li>
            <li> The rechargable battery holds a good charge and has lasted almost a month; they recommend a weekly recharge for max performance.</li>
            <li> product at a good value.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for a year and absolutely loved it.  </li>
            <li> I loved the idea about it being cordless</li>
            <li> but it is a good</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It exerts a good deal of pressure</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he loved how it works.  </li>
            <li> I find that I have to refill the tank 2 times for a good cleaning.</li>
            <li> I was told that my gums looked good, and required no treatment.</li>
            <li> it is a good thing though.</li>
            <li> It feels so good that my mouth and teeth are cleaned.</li>
            <li> but it did a good job.</li>
            <li> Feels good at the gum line.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a really good product</li>
            <li> Does not do as good a job and removing debris between teeth either (in our opinion).</li>
            <li> (So the Waterpik paid for itself with that good news!!!)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really good product.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Loved the product when I got, however it broke within two months of purchase.  </li>
            <li> Price was good.  </li>
            <li> Quality seems good so far.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works good though and price was good.</li>
            <li> This is the best Water Pik cordless and eay to use, light to handle.</li>
            <li> this product for good hygiene.</li>
            <li> I feel good about them backing their product  like this.</li>
            <li> I feel good about them backing their product  like this.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem a good cost to use ratio.  </li>
            <li> It did do a good job for the year it worked correctly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Water reservoir is a good size.</li>
            <li> It is good for travel although a bit bulky, but it is not a replacement for your plug in sink-top Water Pik.</li>
            <li> Keep up the good work Waterpik.</li>
            <li> I had never thought that waterpiks were what good</li>
            <li> The water also feels good on my teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li> I guess they give a good warranty</li>
            <li> Good Product..</li>
            <li> It was good.</li>
            <li> Power and battery are good.</li>
            <li> Produce arrived on time and in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Adjustible water pressure settings are also good for people with sensative gums.  </li>
            <li> Battery life is good.  </li>
            <li> It also makes my gums feel so good.</li>
            <li> does not contain a lot of water, but is a good waterpik.</li>
            <li> at the price point i think this is really a good product.</li>
            <li> , i think this would be a good start to try out.</li>
            <li> Intially I loved it.  </li>
            <li> The water pressure was good and I loved the additional attachments.  </li>
            <li> I need to travel,my mouth fill and really good, good product,</li>
            <li> Construction quality seems good, with quality plastics.  </li>
            <li> Good convenient product.</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s all I can say good about it.</li>
            <li> /&gt; &amp;#62; value good price</li>
            <li> I am hoping it is all good.  </li>
            <li> A nice arrangement for a profit-hungry corporation, but not so great for the consumer.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s also good in my book.    </li>
            <li> Fair warning:  </li>
            <li> I thought this product would be good for cleaning my teeth</li>
            <li> It does a good job cleaning between teeth at the gum line.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do as good as a job as flossing.</li>
            <li> My husband loved it.</li>
            <li> but it didnt was a good idea.</li>
            <li> (good battery storage</li>
            <li> … you can get a good shot between every tooth, inside and out and</li>
            <li> It does a good job helping me care for my gum-line pockets; however, it is dificult to fill the tank without spillage and the discharge runs off the tank and gets everywhere.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After about a month of use, it seems to be consistently good for about 2 dozen or so uses between charges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I bought this model because I didn&#x27;t want to have to plug one in to use it and thought it would be good for travel.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good for is a rinse or to flush under a bridge.</li>

            <li> Kudos to them for good customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> lacked information 110 or 220v quality product, Another difficulty is always to supply the refill, good for day-to-day, I recommend</li>
            <li> Works really good.. Helps and replace flossing</li>
            <li> I wanted to see how good this waterpik was, so I started using it every day.</li>
            <li> With the cost of dental treatments fifty bucks is a good investment.</li>
            <li> I use it 2 times a day and the battery charge lasts me a good 10 days.</li>
            <li> THIS ITEM WORKS FAIRLY WELL.  </li>
            <li> I used a peroxide based mouth wash with water and had good result.  </li>
            <li> I have to refill it three times to get through a good cleaning.  </li>
            <li> Good news.</li>
            <li> I loved this when it worked.</li>
            <li> Good price and reliable Amazon delivery.</li>
            <li> I now get good reviews when I go for my six-month dental checkup...</li>
            <li> NOW AFTER A YEAR I FIND THAT A 24 HOUR CHARGE IS INSUFFICIENT FOR EVEN ONE GOOD USE.</li>
            <li> All the parts clicked and fit perfectly, and it comes with four &amp;#34;nozzles&amp;#34; or attachments, just like advertised in the photos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As the instructions say, just move along the gum line at a 90 degree kind of angle, and yes indeed, it does a GREAT job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> good value good product</li>
            <li> Water resevoir holds good amount, occasionlly fill it twice.</li>
            <li> And fair warning...</li>
            <li> This was a good investment.</li>
            <li> Works great and effective.</li>
            <li> So for people like me, this is a good</li>
            <li> Product performs well, sleek, sturdy, and holds a good charge.  </li>
            <li> Good value for the money.  </li>
            <li> it is a good product however.</li>
            <li> i purchased primarily for travel and is excellent for that purpose.  </li>
            <li> Works just as good as my full-size Waterpik (countertop).  </li>
            <li> Good product for a cordless device.  </li>
            <li> It seems to do a good job on my teeth.</li>
            <li> It does almost as good a job as the Hydrofloss.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother who loved it.</li>
            <li> The unit is attractive looking and fits nicely in the hand, but that&#x27;s the end of the good news.</li>
            <li> The jet is concentrated and penetratiing, giving a perfect clean and aeration, as well as gum health maintenance and preservation.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and great product for the price.  </li>
            <li> This is a great item since I never floss, it&#x27;s also very easy to use.</li>
            <li> The battery life is great (1-2 weeks per charge using a couple times a day), it&#x27;s fairly easy to use and does a great job at what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> For me, the reservoir holds the perfect amount of water needed for a full mouth cleaning.  </li>
            <li> but with the investment I&#x27;m making, I want to make sure I have beautiful teeth when the braces come off.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with this product.</li>

            <li> it gets the teeth clean, it does I good job!</li>
            <li> , Waterpik is a more pleasant experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is a great product and easy to use.</li>
            <li> So easy to use and works great.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed, easy to handle and works great</li>
            <li> The battery life lasts about a week which is great, but the water runs out very quickly.  </li>
            <li> I have one for each house , this s a great product  easy to use and does its job.</li>
            <li> This is a great water flosser and easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> Does a great job, easy to use</li>
            <li> Much more effective and pleasant to use than the Sonicare toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Very handy, easy to use.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> How amazing it makes her mouth feel.</li>
            <li> Plus they have an amazing customer service to boot.</li>
            <li> Really amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing what it can do for cleaning your teeth, even after you worked with an electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> It has made amazing difference in my gums withing 3 minths.  </li>
            <li> This is amazing.  </li>
            <li> It is amazing what flossing misses or can&#x27;t get too.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing the power that has this water jet.</li>
            <li> It has made an amazing difference in my health.</li>
            <li> Thought I would try the portable one, but it is not as effective as the non-portable version.</li>
            <li> so it fits on a sink and the portability feature is nice for trips.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> Need to have a pitcher handy to fill it.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m over 61 with my own teeth).</li>
            <li> I think this is a good machine when it is working correctly but better sealing against water and debris</li>
            <li> I believe this would be nice to have, but I just carry it in a zip-lock bag.</li>
            <li> tidy.  </li>
            <li> I bought this model of WaterPik because it appeared to be  a handy, self-contained,  compact unit.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine who is a dental hygienist, recommended this to me when I asked her what kind of a waterpik to get.</li>
            <li> That, of course, was my own fault.  </li>
            <li> I have own the Waterpik WP-360W.</li>
            <li> that just got braces and she liked using it.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own.  </li>
            <li> To be honest, the first-time use  takes some trial and error.</li>
            <li> This charges nicely and holds a charge well too.</li>
            <li> - This unit is much quieter, but any water pump will make some noise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reservoir - The size of reservoir is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> If I need more for a really good job, it takes a couple seconds to refill.</li>
            <li> Thanks to the excellent customer service at Amazon</li>
            <li> Use warm water for comfort.  </li>
            <li> I can honestly say the nylon string dental floss never inspired me.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t engineers or sales people EVER use their own products?</li>
            <li> The Waterpic Ultra is well made and the size makes it handy for use while travelling.  </li>
            <li> It took just a bit of getting used to, but I liked the way it got under my bridgework and around my one implant.</li>
            <li> but I wanted something portable, a \\&quot;no-muss, no-fuss\\&quot; kind of instrument for when I didn&#x27;t have time for the HydroFloss.  </li>
            <li> I liked the pressure etc</li>
            <li> Four tips to handle all needs included is a nice bonus.  </li>
            <li> kind of a pain to use.  </li>
            <li> It is effective and works well with diluted listerine.  </li>
            <li> My dentist recommended I buy a water pik since I have difficulty with dental floss catching and shredding under bridgework.</li>
            <li> It is a handy device, but lacking pressure.</li>
            <li> I have never used a Water Pik of any kind before buying this product.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s 4 nozzles that you can use, each seems to have their own</li>
            <li> Great product at great price, Fast shipping .</li>
            <li> My dentist is thrilled with my checkups.</li>
            <li> The price was more than fair.</li>
            <li> Well, Waterpick cordless is quite handy and you do not depend on cord</li>
            <li> and i liked the slim design of theone</li>
            <li> I needed something for travel and this unit does a nice job.  </li>
            <li> I own this model and I like how it cleans.</li>
            <li> but I do not feel that this is any kind of an inconvenience.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s handy when I want to use a water pic and not shower.</li>
            <li> I was initially really happy with the product, as I am sure most people would be.  </li>
            <li> My electric razor, by contrast, has a rechargeable battery that lasted many years already, so this seems to not have quite as good a battery.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This would be a good product if it lasted more than 6 months.</li>
            <li> A nice gizmo while it lasted,</li>
            <li> Also, the handle is kind off bulky.</li>
            <li> also liked the idea of it being cordless and portable.  </li>
            <li> I was very happy with the results I got from it while it was working, yet, this device came with a whole bunch of problems.    </li>
            <li> and she never told me how she liked it</li>
            <li> The Plus I purchased this time has a kind of figure</li>
            <li> cordless is nice</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so handy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice not to be tethered to a tank.</li>
            <li> I loved the flosser, but have not been able to get it to charge.</li>
            <li> Otherwise I liked it.</li>
            <li> At most, I get one good use out of it before I have to plug it in again.</li>
            <li> I liked this cordless water pik.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m thrilled with how well it works for the price and convenience of not having a bulky device sitting on my countertop.</li>
            <li> Ditto ifI weren&#x27;t so handy and consider these things challenges.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> Really though, a very good tool!</li>
            <li> i love this pik, it has a good size water resevoir and holds a charge for weeks of use.</li>
            <li> It also comes with additional tip/ head attachments, which is nice.</li>
            <li> I have used and liked Waterpiks for years.  </li>
            <li> It would have been nice to have been advised that the product would not work here.</li>
            <li> Also the dental hygienist was thrilled by what she called my home care.</li>
            <li> Suggest using warm water.  </li>
            <li> I liked the cordless plus because it doesn&#x27;t have a cord to navigate while using.  </li>
            <li> I liked it.</li>
            <li> I smiled at my mirror which happened to be covered in water and</li>
            <li> I do not even play a dentist on TV so please do your own research:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> I liked it while it worked, but stopped working after 2 years.</li>
            <li> find 2-3 fillings required for a nice thorough cleaning.  </li>
            <li> I put some mouth wash in and mix with warm water</li>
            <li> I fill it with warm tap water.</li>
            <li> I own the Ultra model which is the corded model.  </li>
            <li> My dentist suggesting me use this Waterpik Waterflosser with warm water and peroxide.  </li>
            <li> Does a nice job.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t like, compared to the non-mobile kind I used</li>
            <li> Has a nice stream of water that flows out....</li>
            <li> I was kind of looking forward to trying that out.</li>
            <li> I do own the Waterpik Flosser with the cord and needed this to use at school after lunch.</li>
            <li> That is still plenty of pressure for a handy cordless</li>
            <li> When it worked it made for a nice travel option.</li>
            <li> I just ordered the full size ultra but am happy to have this one for traveling for sure!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, effective and reliable!  </li>
            <li> Would like to return but can&#x27;t find original packing slip!!</li>
            <li> Go here for details on the most excellent flosser, because how can you live a quality life without a good flosser?:&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works great and leaves teeth clean.</li>
            <li> So....fresh breath, clean teeth and happy gums.</li>
            <li> Work great, holds charge over a week, teeth feel as clean as after visiting the dentist, and a lot cheaper</li>
            <li> So again, I highly recommend this product, but it is not as perfect</li>
            <li> This is a good concept as it is coordless and easy to use</li>
            <li> Over all I think my gums have become more healthy which is good.  </li>
            <li> Soooo easy to use and feels so good.  </li>
            <li> tips easy to change good value for the money</li>
            <li> great jet pressure... compact...would recommend to anyone who wants to get a good cleaning between teeth (along with flossing of course.)</li>
            <li> Finally,be sure to charge it for a full 24 hours before using, then keep it plugged in except for when you&#x27;re using it, this way it keeps a charge beautifully.</li>
            <li> Free shipping and prompt delivery was a pleasant experience.</li>
            <li> Easy to follow instructions and everything as described and at a good price, what&#x27;s not to like.</li>
            <li> Works well and easy to travel with; good value</li>
            <li> I find it very easy to use plus stays charged for over a week.  </li>
            <li> This is very easy to use and does the job.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to charge the battery.</li>
            <li> This is very easy to use, and even my kids like it.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is so very easy to use and has a dedicated space at my sink.</li>
            <li> The very first one I had worked great for a couple of years before&lt;</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE THIS!  </li>
            <li> It works ok, but is more of a hassle than using string/tape floss!  </li>
            <li> great product, like being able to get teeth really clean using it</li>
            <li> I found the product easy to use, that it works well with warm water, and that my dentist says my gums have never looked better!</li>

            <li> We have used waterpik products for more than 20 years &amp; it&#x27;s so nice to have this compact model.</li>
            <li> Gums will be great and there is rarely any scraping needed.</li>
            <li> Is it more effective than flossing?</li>
            <li> Is it more effective than flossing?</li>
            <li> , SO I FILL IT WITH LUKE WARM WATER, MUCH BETTER.</li>
            <li> But so far, very happy with it.  </li>
            <li> Read the reviews and see how many people mention some kind of battery problem.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exceptional - easy to use and does the job.   </li>
            <li> Much more effective than flossing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this handy appliance.</li>
            <li> It is kind of bulky, but works ok.</li>
            <li> We can swish warm water in our mouths with much more force than this Waterpik can muster.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to add warm water.</li>
            <li> Great product, works well, worth the money.</li>
            <li> Since I have not used a waterpik before, I had a bit of a learning curve to make it most effective, and keep water off the bathroom ceiling.</li>
            <li> It might take you longer, but I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s more effective than this hunk of junk.</li>
            <li> I used to have the old waterpik which did an excellent job but took space and was noisy.  </li>
            <li> I travel a good deal and this is indispensable for both its portability and for its cleaning power.  </li>
            <li> It works great as advertized and it shipped quick even with free shipping!</li>
            <li> It can wash my teeth very clean, I am very satisfied, but it does not power tips, more</li>
            <li> So easy to use!</li>
            <li> Plus, it fits neatly into my briefcase so I can easily use it after lunch, before a meeting, or while in queue at the bank!</li>
            <li> It is well made, versatile, and easy to use!  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and transport!</li>
            <li> I have bridges and dental implants and this works nicely to keep those hard-to-reach areas very clean.</li>
            <li> works great as suggested, not as strong as the large desk unit but good fror trips</li>
            <li> very good product, price a bit high</li>
            <li> its so enjoyable to be alive and get to use all this great stuff!</li>
            <li> I am very happy they did replace it because when it coincidentally started dripping two years to the DAY (on a Sunday) that it was covered for on a 2 year warranty that I had no idea was in force, the kind lady at Waterpik realized how close I was to the deadline that she simply replaced it.</li>
            <li> Good luck trying to actually clean anything this way</li>
            <li> Flossing is great, but it cannot really do as good of a job as an old fashion water stream can..</li>
            <li> I have used another model which I liked better, but this one is OK.  </li>
            <li> So handy being cordless, but powrful enough to do a great job!!</li>
            <li> The two pressure options are good, and it indeed clean the teeth.</li>
            <li> It does the job for sure but will require time to get accustomed to so that it is most effective.</li>
            <li> the Waterpik Waterflosser Cordless Plus is the best and only choice for portable, travel-friendly, effective water flossing.</li>
            <li> And if you do need more water, it is VERY easy to fill.&lt;br /&gt;Yes</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would not recommend the Cordless Plus unless you are sure you do not need a very strong jet of water - if, for example, you already have the Ultra and find that you use it with the power dial set to the halfway mark or below.</li>
            <li> Talk about wonderful customer service---and that also makes me feel really good about spending $50.00 for a dental \\&quot;gadget\\&quot; which, although it works really great, if it hadn&#x27;t been so easy to fix this problem, I might have had mixed feelings about purchasing it in the first place.</li>
            <li> Great cleaning power, long charge time, Fits nicely on my bathroom countertop, Holds just the right amount of water/wash for perfect cleaning performance.</li>
            <li> the water pressure is suitable, its an ok product.</li>
            <li> First I must say that the Waterpik Waterflosser Cordless Plus does a great job.  </li>
            <li> First off, a great idea, hence my reasons for buying it.</li>
            <li> Great item, exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> For the first 2-3 years it was great.</li>
            <li> If you want a great Waterpik product that does a great job, try the Ultra Water Flosser model WP-100W (which costs only about $5 more than the PLUS).[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> it works great and does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> the first one I ordered worked great for about 2 weeks</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s 110% better than flossing and the fact that it&#x27;s more effective is just a bonus :)</li>
            <li> I thought it was too good to be true,  </li>
            <li> This one has good features size, variability strength of jet, Filling is easy, charging is easy.  </li>
            <li> Quick and easy to use and does a great job.  </li>
            <li> Well that and one very detailed review (by The Geekster)</li>
            <li> It is very comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the 5-star reviewer fool you on this very important factor.</li>
            <li> She says it doesn&#x27;t have as much power as the full size but is perfect for what she needs.</li>
            <li> My water pic arrived quickly and in good order.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and design fits nicely in hand for ease of operation.   </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for a quick go-around but not for thorough cleaning.  </li>
            <li> this product is easy to use and effective.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice size and easy to pack.</li>
            <li> But I would recommend this cordless unit to anyone that desires an easy Waterpik to take and use on the road, or just demands a handy cordless unit.</li>
            <li> I can feel the clean on my teeth after I use the product and am very satisfied.  </li>
            <li> Its a bit large to take with you on a trip, but its great form home use.</li>
            <li> It would be better if the tank held more water.</li>
            <li> one more thing.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, but I wish I had kept my money in my pocket on this one.</li>
            <li> I love this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> although looking at the design, I don&#x27;t know where it could be more conveniently</li>
            <li> I love the compact size.  </li>
            <li> both lasted many years.</li>
            <li> and  has cord  and t also has a reservoir  for water for more than one minute</li>
            <li> (I keep it for traveling) and love the ultra.  </li>
            <li> It is also easier to refill from the side instead of the top as the wp360.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I have braces and I am so glad that I bought this product.</li>
            <li> You can always refill it if you think you need more time.  </li>
            <li> It has so much more power to it, which can be adjusted, and it cleans even better.</li>
            <li> She is really impressed that I am not only maintaing, but my teeth and gums are  better than she&#x27;s ever seen them.</li>
            <li> I just love it</li>
            <li> better than flossing.  </li>
            <li> love this device; i use mine in the shower.  </li>
            <li> I do not have a Waterpik that sits on my counter top and plugs into the wall socket.</li>
            <li> No I found that I like the cordless ones better.</li>
            <li> It was OK</li>
            <li> , the tip always falling on the floor as the way it was to be stored should have held the tip better.</li>
            <li> Are you sure you have it charged up?</li>
            <li> I think most people probably keep the unit charger plug in while not in use.</li>
            <li> but I have used their products for years and have not had that many problems which is why I guess they are still number one in Oral Irragtor sales.</li>

            <li> On the more positivie side, I can tell a difference in my gums and teeth.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> You can recharge 24 hours or more, and then you with luck if you can use 3 times.  </li>
            <li> Also, because you need to keep it upright, there are parts of your mouth you can&#x27;t get to, notably the inside of your front teeth where plaque accumulates.</li>
            <li> Then twist the spout 180 degrees when it is not in my mouth to prep it to cover the top inside areas.  </li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t do much more of that by itself.</li>
            <li> This is a shower gizmo - if you don&#x27;t intend to use this in the shower, you might prefer to get a sink model instead - they lack the weight, hold more water, and are easier to deal with.   </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m no expert, but I do really love this thing.</li>
            <li> The water chamber takes up most of the side on it.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;re not going to be able to fill it up with your shower stream.</li>
            <li> Are you sure you have it charged up?</li>
            <li> and I love the fact that it is portable.  </li>
            <li> i love mine.</li>
            <li> Although I just read the charger cable is most probably the culprit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I asked the orthodontist is a water flosser was okay</li>
            <li> I tried the product to make sure it is working, it was working</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t imagine that mold is particularly healthy.  </li>
            <li> I used to be able to go a week between chargings (using it once a day), and now I need to charge it about every 3-4 days.  </li>
            <li> I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> maybe that brand is a better choice.  </li>
            <li> I am really pleased with this because you don&#x27;t have to move the unit around dramatically</li>
            <li> It fits nicely in the hand, it&#x27;s light</li>
            <li> , I felt my gums get a great but gentle massage.</li>
            <li> I love the Waterpik.  </li>
            <li> My favorite brand is the InterPlak by Conair.  </li>
            <li> Since Waterpik has been making oral flushing devices for so many years I decided to purchase theirs.  </li>
            <li> I have the regular countertop waterpik and have been very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I think this is better than flossing with string.  </li>
            <li> do not buy it, maybe they wills top putting it on sale.</li>
            <li> I will get another water flossing system of some sort, but I recommend that you skip this one unless you&#x27;re ok with re-buying it once a year.</li>
            <li> I love it...</li>
            <li> This is a great product that really improve mine and my family&#x27;s oral health.  </li>
            <li> Like many of the reviewers</li>
            <li> It has more power than the cheaper units.</li>
            <li> Having said that, this unit exceeded every expectation, and this style of flosser (cordless) is much better for me.</li>
            <li> Having said that, this unit exceeded every expectation, and this style of flosser (cordless) is much better for me.</li>
            <li> All in all, it works, but having already used one that works much better</li>
            <li> I decided on the cordless and love it.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied.</li>
            <li> TSA inspections is a topic best left alone.</li>
            <li> I would have paid more if the unit used lithium ion rather than metal hydride batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was able to get a replacement</li>
            <li> and I hope I have better luck with this one.</li>
            <li> The Pansonic battery unit is much better</li>
            <li> Got feedback from my hygienist at a recent cleaning appointment - \\&quot;you are doing a wonderful job\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I have been using it on a daily basis and I am very happy with the results I am getting.  </li>
            <li> so mine didn&#x27;t come from Amazon, but I still love having it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Most users assume that the battery became defective.     </li>
            <li> I love these.  </li>
            <li> I charged it up with more than the time the directions said, just to be sure it was fully charged.</li>
            <li> This Water Pik irrigator has a battery that can be recharged and it works much better.  </li>
            <li> No complaints from recipient and they seem to be enjoying it.</li>
            <li> and I have tried many.    </li>
            <li> This works fabulous!  </li>
            <li> But the low speed is perfect!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need any more problems with my gums.</li>
            <li> You can do better.</li>
            <li> As a person who flosses every day, I find that the water pik does an even better job.  </li>
            <li> the water end up on the floor :-)    </li>
            <li> I needed a waterpik because I have the perfect gap between my back two teeth and food gets stuck in their in one chew.  </li>
            <li> I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have posted two more photos.  </li>
            <li> Usability is ok.    </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t come close to the quality of the counter top Waterpik(which</li>
            <li> I love).</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> It surely does the job when travelling.</li>
            <li> Each time I think this is about 12 months, but I cant be sure.  </li>
            <li> My dental hygenist recommended this product for both my husband and me because we&#x27;re not the most faithful users of dental floss.</li>
            <li> I purchased this with some terpidation, since it had so many reviews from people with concerns.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this Waterpik.  </li>
            <li> I like it but the table top has more</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m ok with it.</li>
            <li> If I need more..</li>
            <li> It sure beats having the bulky one on my counter.</li>
            <li> We love this product.  </li>
            <li> The biggest reason is that the tank hold more water.  </li>
            <li> If you want an irrigator for your bathroom, get a corded model, or better, one of the OralBreeze products.</li>
            <li> This item was recommended by my Dental Hygentist; said that it works much better than floss.</li>
            <li> Better yet, it&#x27;s time for them to transition to inductive charging the way the Philips flossers have.</li>
            <li> Before discarding the defective unit, I examined it more closely.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the purchase and recommend the unit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than nothing and portable.  </li>
            <li> During those 5 days I found this product to be outstanding.  </li>
            <li> this is not the best thing and not a regular flosser substitute although did more bleeding on fastest setting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned Waterpiks for many years.</li>
            <li> What I discovered was that the objections many of the one-star reviewers had given the Cordless Plus were in fact legitimate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My gut feeling tells me that most will do the same.n the counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It would be nice if it came with either a sample of all the heads available or if you could choose which heads would be included in the package.</li>
            <li> It sure does its job well.</li>
            <li> I ordered this waterpik and was not so sure about it since it is cordless.  </li>
            <li> I made sure that the reservoir was pushed in all the way.  </li>
            <li> but I like this better- easier to store.</li>
            <li> job.&lt;br /&gt;I found out it is much more comfortable once I use warm water.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> In most places where my gums a healthy it does not hurt on HI power.  </li>
            <li> I just enjoyed having this tool in the airport and wherever I had to be at.</li>
            <li> Love this.  </li>
            <li> I will do this to extend the life of my battery, but if it still dies after 2 years, I will gladly buy another unit.  </li>
            <li> so I have more than ample water in the tank.</li>
            <li> OK, I didn&#x27;t read all the reviews, but here&#x27;s my take on this unit.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Why is the battery charge indicator SO IMPORTANT!  </li>
            <li> Every time you do this you degrade the battery that much more.  </li>
            <li> 1) put a charge indicator on the side of the unit, or better yet, 2) put</li>
            <li> I love this thing.</li>
            <li> The waterpik cleans my teeth much better than a brush and floss</li>
            <li> I should have paid more attention to the reviews - some people warned against this.  </li>
            <li> And how all your mouth higene changes for better</li>
            <li> I also have the Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser which I love.</li>
            <li> Many complaints about the battery not accepting a charge after 3-4 months.</li>
            <li> It took 2 reservoirs of water to get the job done - used 1 reservoir for the top and 1 for the bottom.</li>
            <li> This product DOES NOT replace a floss, make sure you realize that before buying.</li>
            <li> He is pleased that I bought it for him.</li>
            <li> Would love to see a portable one that you could have at work.</li>
            <li> Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> My teeth and gums feel better already.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the Panasonic is better</li>
            <li> Pleased with product for the price.</li>
            <li> well i&#x27;ve been using my waterpik for over a month and love it.</li>
            <li> so the pik   tip can be brought closer to the top of the gum line.</li>
            <li> I like this one better for my purposes.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> After you are done wrestling with the swiveling head, the water runs out -- it&#x27;s like an I Love Lucy comedy.    </li>
            <li> The water flossers are getting better with each one coming out....</li>
            <li> So you&#x27;d never be able to get away with using it while someone else in the house was trying to sleep.  </li>
            <li> I hope it works well for you for many years.  </li>
            <li> love love love this thing.</li>
            <li> I prefer the 110V counter unit over this because it holds more water and has more settings</li>
            <li> Glad I found it.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with my ointeractions with AMAZON on EVERY LEVEL (been with them for 3 years now)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try another brand of rechargeable water flosser and see if that&#x27;s any better.</li>
            <li> I love the compact design.  </li>
            <li> I have now owned three of them, but never for more than a year.  </li>
            <li> The battery charging system on the Sonicar products uses induction charging and has always lasted for many years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll let you know more when I buy the Sonicare - Airfloss.</li>
            <li> I love the waterpik waterflosser and I would recommend it to anyone that cares about oral hygiene.  </li>
            <li> Moreover the waterpik customer service is simply outstanding.  </li>
            <li> I was once again able to charge the Waterpik after cleaning&lt;br /&gt;out</li>
            <li> Ok, I have had this Waterpik just about a year</li>
            <li> I am so glad I bought this.</li>
            <li> WaterPik can and should do better.</li>
            <li> Also, you will squirt your wall multiple times, but all in all this thing is AWESOME!</li>
            <li> We love the Waterpik Waterflosser Cordless</li>
            <li> well i love it since we have two kids with braces.</li>
            <li> it helps a lot more as well</li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems better than dental</li>
            <li> did use waterpik WP-360.&lt;br /&gt;I think WP-450 better than WP-360.&lt;br /&gt;WP-450</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I don&#x27;t have another cord to contend with.</li>
            <li> the most appropriate pick, and teeth and gums are cleared of &amp;#34;gunk&amp;#34; and plaque.</li>
            <li> But I ended up getting lots and lots of cavities, more than I have ever had in my life, during the period I used this waterpick.  </li>
            <li> It does a better job &amp; is easier on my gums.  </li>
            <li> It is ok but will not ever replace my counter top waterpik.</li>
            <li> But when traveling it is better than not having one at all.</li>
            <li> I love my Waterflosser.</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> So I thought the cordless model would be better for me.</li>
            <li> I wish it held more water</li>
            <li> Would be even better if the on/off switch is a momentary switch (power on when pressed, power off when released).</li>
            <li> The water only pumps if the waterpik is held perfectly vertical and stationary.   </li>
            <li> then the battery wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge for more than one use.  </li>
            <li> this one also now won&#x27;t hold a charge for more than one use.  </li>
            <li> Until you can get proficient you may want to refill the the unit twice, once for the top set of teeth and once for the bottom.</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s self-contained, it&#x27;s more flexible than the waterpiks that use a tank with a hose running to the device.</li>
            <li> I have waited a while to review this product and feel confident that this unit is more DURABLE than the others I have purchased.  </li>
            <li> Maybe the two-year warrantee forces Waterpik to use better batteries.    </li>
            <li> and she said many people like this machine</li>
            <li> A better design is needed to keep water away from the charging area.</li>
            <li> I love the cordless feature.</li>
            <li> I use this twice a day every day and that is way more than I can say for flossing.  </li>
            <li> This may be your answer to healthy gums, it is in my home.</li>
            <li> But if you close the door of your bathroom you might be able to get away with it.    </li>
            <li> All in all, even though the countertop version takes up more space, it is the way to go.</li>
            <li> hope it works better.</li>
            <li> Power Switch reliability  8)</li>
            <li> The battery charge interval is outstanding.</li>
            <li> 8)</li>
            <li> The pump is fairly powerful for a battery powered unit, so some noise is a good engineering compromise.</li>
            <li> I wish the water jet could be adjusted to be more forceful</li>
            <li> Flossing with water does give a more thorough, cleaner feel.</li>
            <li> I wish there were more pressure settings or a more stable water pressure throughout the battery life.</li>
            <li> Would sooner find ways to make room for AC-only version than even bother with even touching this model.</li>
            <li> After using another brand for quite some time my wife got this one and likes it a lot more than others she has had.</li>
            <li> More portable - would recommend this unit</li>
            <li> Second, device works best in position that allows the water to feed into the uptake tube in the holding tank.  </li>
            <li> but once I got used to it , it seems okay.  </li>
            <li> So I bought this and love how convenient it is.</li>
            <li> I really liked it until it blew something inside the pump and the water pressure was so light it was not useable.</li>
            <li> Perfect for cleaning between teeth, especially for cleaning around bridgework.</li>
            <li> Tabletop version holds more water and would run longer.</li>
            <li> To my mind this is better.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my daughter who is now wearing braces, and it is the BEST way to get them to floss daily.  </li>
            <li> I love the way it works, but there is a fatal design flaw- water always gets into the battery contacts and rusts them out.</li>
            <li> I will give more information once the gift has been given and the recipient responds.</li>
            <li> Have not been able to use it because it will not charge up.</li>
            <li> adn my coun ter top</li>
            <li> but you could not do better.</li>
            <li> She is very happy with how it works, but after 1-2 years enough water leaks inside to corrode the battery/motor.  </li>
            <li> Still would prefer they sealed the unit better.  </li>
            <li> Love the fact that its so portable.</li>
            <li> and they claimed there were no problems with the unit&#x27;s design and could not or would not tell me if the replacement part reflected a change in design aimed at correcting the issue that so many reviewers have discussed.  </li>
            <li> Not not cellophane tape, more like that on a band aide.  </li>
            <li> It works better than flossing.</li>
            <li> Great product ,very convienent .Compact</li>
            <li> If you are looking for or need more time then this unit may not be for you.</li>
            <li> I have to say I love it.</li>
            <li> I Love that I found this</li>
            <li> I love this site because I can come on here and read reviews and inform myself before making a purchase.</li>
            <li> I like this one better.</li>
            <li> it was ok.</li>
            <li> This one for Hubble was much better than mine.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with my item.   </li>
            <li> The item is not ergonomic for your hands so keep that in mind when choosing between portability or the counter top type.</li>
            <li> After about 14 months the battery will not hold a charge for more than a couple uses, then has to be recharged for a day.</li>
            <li> This product works great - when it works - which isn&#x27;t very often.  </li>
            <li> It is okay, but toilete tree is much better.</li>
            <li> It is on 110-220 Volts, which is much better for me.</li>
            <li> The level of cleaning this kind of thing does is simply amazing; use it twice a day, never had such a great cleaning experience.</li>
            <li> It holds a lot of water, is great even on the low setting and my dentist told me that using this will do my gums a world of good.  </li>
            <li> What more can you ask?</li>
            <li> Am glad she did.  </li>
            <li> and I love them</li>
            <li> I ended up giving this away and purchasing another model because it did have more &amp;#34;oomph&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> surely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought the newer version and just love it.</li>
            <li> The newer and larger version which holds more water is the perfect size.</li>
            <li> Just love it.</li>
            <li> If anything, my checkups were better and SHORTER.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> Okay.</li>
            <li> Is there a better portable water flosser is market??</li>
            <li> But does this help you for for most part</li>
            <li> how many times i have to fill the tank for one time floss - 1-3 times depending on what i eat</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s working ok so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have many crowns in my mouth.</li>
            <li> I needed an autovolt - which most products these days are - or a 220V item.</li>
            <li> Glad I bought this water flosser for our three week trip.  </li>
            <li> My parents have the non-travel version of this product and love it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want the full-size version to take up space on the bathroom counter top, so I went with this version after reading a lot of reviews.</li>
            <li> Portability, does a better job than string flossing.</li>
            <li> I love it. ...</li>
            <li> I waited over two weeks before I ever got it, the longest I have waited for anything on here, and to top it off</li>
            <li> Since having caps put on, I have depended on this machine for better dental care.</li>
            <li> This is the better alternative for sure.</li>
            <li> It worked okay for 4 months and then stopped charging.</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t know how I cleaned my braces before :)</li>
            <li> How many times did I have water squirt all over the place?  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for a week and my gums feel better already.  </li>
            <li> This time I&#x27;m going to find something more reliable.</li>
            <li> there are more reliable products out there.  </li>
            <li> Or add a door and appropriate connectors to the battery compartment so I can use disposable batteries and eliminate the charger.    </li>
            <li> I also thought the water stream would be more forceful than it is.  </li>
            <li> Recommendation: If you want something that is dependable shop electronics at a more reliable source.</li>
            <li> It give you 45 seconds of water flossing at a time - but the most important thing is : HE USES IT !</li>
            <li> Love this product and works just like a charm.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this gadget.  </li>
            <li> It still runs great, and the different attachments are all in good working order.</li>
            <li> The battery doesn&#x27;t hold a charge for more than one use, so it is always plugged in and in the way.  </li>
            <li> So, I just bought a counter top unit and love it.  </li>
            <li> I have used a waterpic for many years</li>
            <li> but I am sure that the hose corrects that issue.  </li>
            <li> The cordless waterpic flosser is okay.</li>
            <li> I guess my husband  says it works ok.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great alternative, much gentler on your gums, and seems to work just as well.</li>
            <li> Like my sonic air flosser better because it&#x27;s easier to use</li>
            <li> I travel a lot and still wanted to be able to have the use of my Waterpik.</li>
            <li> My gums are getting better day by day...</li>
            <li> I really love this item.  </li>
            <li> My son just got braces and the waterpik makes brushing much better by removing particles that he could no longer get to with the braces..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much more convenient than the waterpik with the cord.</li>
            <li> , I do recommend this and thanks for all the great reviews I was able to read before buying.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paid about 15% more at Target than I could have paid here on Amazon because I was worried about a convenient return if I didn&#x27;t like it, but I won&#x27;t be returning it.</li>
            <li> I put mouth wash in mine love cordless</li>
            <li> i dont need to floss my teeth any more, I use it every day.</li>
            <li> It turns out I love the thing and use it more than the corded one.</li>
            <li> I recommend you to keep your mouth closed and floss each section separately, turning off the unit and spitting in between, I&#x27;m sure each person will have their own preference for what works best for them in this regard.</li>
            <li> Okay, but my hydrofloss is better.</li>
            <li> It is not as powerful as my hydrofloss and doesn&#x27;t do as good of a job, but for travel purposes, it works.</li>
            <li> Ours did ok.  </li>
            <li> I think the shower model would be a better purchase,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> Pros: Seems to work better than the Airflosser.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t say for sure because I haven&#x27;t been able to use it.</li>
            <li> I was able to get through my mouth with one fill of water.</li>
            <li> I got a better dental check up after using this for 6 months..</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> This is 100% better then</li>
            <li> Love the waterpik.</li>
            <li> Good for travel but not as powerful as my home water flosser which plugs in for use.</li>
            <li> I have been completely satisfied with its performance</li>
            <li> and I am sure my dentist will be too.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> and I have to say I love it.</li>
            <li> I love the way my teeth feel afterwards.  </li>
            <li> I wonder if there is a way to get a better closing lid/system.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the unit.</li>
            <li> enjoyed using this, it was recommended by my dental hygienist.</li>
            <li> To be safe, I&#x27;m waiting till the water in the socket dries before I plug it in to recharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The fact that a product is cordless implies that it is portable and more convenient than a wired model.&lt;br /&gt;Two</li>
            <li> Love this -</li>
            <li> We found it holds a charge for five days, but we have yet to take it on a longer trip, so it could be more.</li>
            <li> It just makes me feel better and even helps make</li>
            <li> so why can&#x27;t you favorite dental hygene tool?&lt;br</li>
            <li> It holds a charge for more than a week</li>
            <li> and then so I like the idea of being able to carry this around.</li>
            <li> Much better than when I floss</li>
            <li> I just need to get the hang of it :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I took a chance on it.</li>
            <li> The pump on this has a bout a 1/3 more power</li>
            <li> Love this waterpik.</li>
            <li> I love the waterpik and swear by it.  </li>
            <li> I love this WaterPik.  </li>
            <li> More then once a day.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s stylish.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad she did.  </li>
            <li> Love, love.  </li>
            <li> Company replaced with the wired unit and we are happy with it and really like the way both cleaned our teeth/gums.</li>
            <li> COULD BE MUCH BETTER DESIGNED</li>
            <li> Love the product.</li>
            <li> I never realized how much more our teeth need even after flossing.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this flosser.</li>
            <li> This one is better and comes with a year longer</li>
            <li> It is ok.</li>
            <li> Flossing is better when compared to this.</li>
            <li> but we love that you can use it while it is not plugged in since we do not have plugs all over the place like newer homes</li>
            <li> I like this model better.  </li>
            <li> This is even better than I thought it would be..</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s better to use a strings.</li>
            <li> Water jet was ok.</li>
            <li> i love this product.  </li>
            <li> I have tried several and this one is the best.  </li>
            <li> It says it works better than floss.</li>
            <li> In most electronics, this is a novel concept.</li>
            <li> would have bought two more if it had the docking</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s good to keep your smile and breath in check&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is the one to buy since it can hold way more water and has the pressure you will need to get your teeth cleaned.</li>
            <li> By the way, no matter what waterpik products you buy you will be leaning over the sink to make sure the water does not get all over you.</li>
            <li> This product just would not hold a charge for more than one use.</li>
            <li> However, something sold as a travel item should surely come with a travel case.</li>
            <li> Works well,really pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying this purchase.  </li>
            <li> I  love  the  portability</li>
            <li> The battery does not hold a charge for more than two days.  </li>
            <li> Better than Flossing</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re done, working top and bottom, and I did both the &amp;#34;outer&amp;#34; side and &amp;#34;inner&amp;#34; side of my teeth, if that makes sense....</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re done, working top and bottom, and I did both the &amp;#34;outer&amp;#34; side and &amp;#34;inner&amp;#34; side of my teeth, if that makes sense....</li>
            <li> My teeth and I love this waterflosser.  </li>
            <li> Sure wish the price of these would stop going up.</li>
            <li> and we are okay with it.</li>
            <li> This waterflosser is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I love this thing!&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: As others have noticed, this unit starts having problems with staying charged.</li>
            <li> The plug in unit was better than this cordless one.</li>
            <li> Completely satisfied with this product and the service provided.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure after using this</li>
            <li> I love this product my dentist suggested that I get it and have been using it ever since.</li>
            <li> I love my waterpik.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gets food from between my teeth much better than a toothbrush or floss</li>
            <li> and it removes the fuzzies on the tooth surface better than a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Much better choice.</li>
            <li> Excellent addition to daily dental care.</li>
            <li> and why dentists don&#x27;t recommend it more often.  </li>
            <li> glad they did.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I keep tape over the charge recepticle just to be safe.  </li>
            <li> Miraculously, after using it four days, most of my soreness disappeared.</li>
            <li> just love using</li>
            <li> Glad I did.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li> My dentist insisted that I floss more than once a day.</li>
            <li> A corded model is probably a better choice but will take up more counter space..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bulky to take up precious luggage space travelling when it&#x27;s not even working</li>
            <li> Love that it&#x27;s cordless.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m just 100% satisfied with the results.  </li>
            <li> It sayd it is better than string floss and that you can see a difference in 2 weeks</li>
            <li> i have beef with this version of the waterpik, but the corded one is actually 5 star and is perfect.</li>
            <li> It is also a bummer not to be able to return it.  </li>
            <li> I love your inventive minds and helpful</li>
            <li> Love the cordless part, I can take it in the shower</li>
            <li> Therefore, for the road option, I chose the same company and is very happy</li>
            <li> I plugged it in once more and thought I&#x27;d try it</li>
            <li> Love this cordless Waterpik.</li>
            <li> I am going to buy more for my children.  </li>
            <li> I love the cordless idea and the portable water tank.  </li>
            <li> I am pleased with all phases  of my purchase.</li>
            <li> Wish they had an even more compact version.</li>
            <li> It really does a great job of getting food out between the teeth and braces.</li>
            <li> Sometimes more than twice a day, if I felt something got stuck between my teeth i.e. after eating strawberries, etc.</li>
            <li> This is phenomenal.</li>
            <li> --I wouldn&#x27;t want anything stronger that&#x27;s for sure.  </li>
            <li> I really love my water pik glossed, feel like my teeth are cleaner.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for a battery operated water flosser I had for many years.</li>
            <li> I was expecting that the battery will be better.</li>
            <li> It is better than nothing, but I prefer the corded version.</li>
            <li> I bought this for travel, it works ok, but I would like it to have more pressure.  </li>
            <li> I always kept &amp;#34;meaning&amp;#34; to floss more.</li>
            <li> I am getting better with it</li>
            <li> This one is so much better.  </li>
            <li> this is an improved version and does work better.</li>
            <li> Makes teeth and mouth feel a lot more cleaner when you have braces.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still going strong, so I&#x27;m pretty happy with the battery life as well.</li>
            <li> but, this does a very nice job and doesn&#x27;t take up much space.</li>
            <li> I put mouthwash in the vessel with some warm water for a really refreshing clean.</li>
            <li> I was not so much aware of the change, but he certainly was and I was given the best compliment</li>
            <li> We were very excited when it arrived.  </li>
            <li> This time the company customer service wasn&#x27;t that nice and didn&#x27;t replace the unit as it has been over two years from the original purchase date.</li>
            <li> I have used A Waterpick  device for years, but this model is very easy to use and easy to keep clean!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m willing to do that until Waterpik fixes the problem or another excellent, reasonably priced water flosser comes along....</li>
            <li> The also are great for flushing pockets in the gums which develop as we grow older.  </li>
            <li> It is very easy and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and very easy to hold.  </li>
            <li> The end result is very clean gumlines and teeth.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels refreshed and very clean.  </li>
            <li> and my mouth feels very clean.</li>
            <li> Very light and easy to hold and use.</li>
            <li> It is very light weight and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I really loved using this Waterpik when I first got it.  </li>
            <li> It is pretty good for what it is.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very happy with it for as long as I have it,</li>
            <li> I loved this Waterflosser at first.  </li>
            <li> It is my first ever waterflosser and have loved it since i got it.</li>
            <li> This unit is pretty bulky, and the water pressure isn&#x27;t as good as the countertop plug in Waterpik, but it does suffice for travel.</li>
            <li> In my mind this is pretty good.  </li>
            <li> As that isn&#x27;t the case, this does a good job at exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> When I first took this cordless Waterpik out of the box, I thought, \\&quot;What good</li>
            <li> I loved my Waterpik, it was the first one I had ever had.  </li>
            <li> First, the good stuff: It works.</li>
            <li> Has a pretty good forceful stream</li>
            <li> I think as I get better at moving it around my mouth it will be fine, but I keep on wishing I had about 10 more seconds of spray.   </li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t completely happy with the new design, so</li>
            <li> has very good water pressure your gums feel so clean like you just had a professional cleaning!</li>
            <li> It was okay, just not as strong as the electric one.</li>
            <li> Now, I easily do the job w. one refill for the bottom teeth and one refill for the top.  </li>
            <li> it is quite easy if you need a more thorough one.</li>
            <li> I wish I had selected a more evenly balanced and easily maneuverable wired option.</li>
            <li> I love that its portable &amp; easy to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased that the unit is easily transportable.    </li>
            <li> The countertop model is much more easily manipulated, of course.</li>
            <li> I love the &amp;#34;action&amp;#34; and the tip settings are easy to use.</li>
            <li> Love the waterpik , easy to use and like the hand held model.</li>
            <li> Using good batteries is the key to this working good.  </li>
            <li> It was taking more and more pushes of the switch to activate the electric motor(even after being fully charged), and the motor itself started sounding like a car running on cheap gas.  </li>
            <li> This is a portable water pik which sounds like a great idea, the problem is that it does not hold enough water to even begin to be effective.</li>
            <li> A great traveling partner, simple to use and highly effective.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m using the jelly and the tape just to make sure, so far everything is working great.</li>
            <li> Excellent water pick that can be used all week on a single charge.</li>
            <li> Daughter&#x27;s teeth are finally clean!  </li>
            <li> I thought I was getting my mouth clean with my electric toothbrush...guess not!  </li>
            <li> It really does get in between your teeth to keep you clean!!!</li>
            <li> I had owned the large tank Waterpik, I loved what it did to my teeth</li>
            <li> Good for car travel - too large for air.   </li>
            <li> It feels great after using it too because you can really notice the difference of how clean your teeth are compared to just brushing.</li>
            <li> i love this product as it helps to clean ur teeth , and keeps ur gums healthy.</li>
            <li> I recently got Invisalign and this is perfect to clean between my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I am really pleased with the product, easy to use, easy to store.  </li>
            <li> Though this appliance is very good when it works, I am sending this one back because like it&#x27;s predecessor, it quit within a year of buying it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anybody that wants the best !</li>
            <li> I was a happy user of WaterPik&#x27;s old travel oral irrigation system, the 350W.</li>
            <li> Most importantly, the waterpik cleans the braces well.  </li>
            <li> Many of the reviews complain of too freely rotating tip problems.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what more to ask for, but it is handheld, light and mobile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist recommended this product and thus far it has been great.</li>
            <li> Size - sure I don&#x27;t want to throw this into my purse, but it would fit in a suitcase if I was going on a longer trip.  </li>
            <li> Much more comfortable to use than floss.</li>
            <li> so it would be great for frequent travellers.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake in thinking that this Cordless Plus unit would fit the bill after reading one particularly convincing 5-star review.</li>
            <li> more efficient, comfortable and quicker.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have as many settings as the full sized one, but is way better than not having it.  </li>
            <li> In the meantime, I&#x27;ve ordered the battery operated Panasonic - so if it gets fixed - great, I&#x27;ll have a backup for when it happens again.  </li>
            <li> They said the most important thing was to please the customer.  </li>
            <li> it was cheap and my dentist said water piks are better than flossing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the old \\&quot;travel size\\&quot; water pik for years and thought this would be a great improvement.</li>
            <li> Yes, its bulky and it would be nice if there was more water in the tank, but if there was, you wouldn&#x27;t be able to manipulate it very well.  </li>
            <li> The charger connections are OK and the receptacle on the flosser is corrosion free.  </li>
            <li> Even my young daughter likes it, so it must be a great product.</li>
            <li> The water spray is so much more comfortable and efficient.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with it, no problems so far.</li>
            <li> You can fill it on its side to fit even more in.</li>
            <li> this product met all expectations.&lt;br /&gt;we are very happy with the product and find it useful for dental hygiene and general health.</li>
            <li> Good water pressure, reasonable sized reservoir.  </li>
            <li> I DESPISE flossing and this has a fun novelty effect and is really effective.</li>
            <li> I went out and bought an electric one which is far superior in performance, sounds better, has better pressure and does not make that noise which seems to grate on my wife&#x27;s nerves.</li>
            <li> It is not quite as powerful, but gets the job done nicely.</li>
            <li> I have been delighted with this product and it was a real life saver while undergoing a stem cell transplant which forbade electric toothbrushes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good thing is its much lighter than the non portable version.</li>
            <li> Works good, and price was much lower than what my dentist office offered.  </li>
            <li> Does a good job, much easier for me than flossing, but I have to fill the resevoir twice to get the job done.</li>
            <li> A good strong jet and a large capacity reservoir.  </li>
            <li> Very good, easy to use and very, but very practical!</li>
            <li> This device is easy to use and most importantly, does the job.</li>
            <li> That being said though, even with 2 or 3 run-throughs, the process is still quicker and far more pleasant than using dental floss.</li>
            <li> I use this along with a sonicare toothbrush and it is AMAZING to see the pieces of food that the waterpik removes right after I brush.  </li>
            <li> They were popular right before battery charge indicators were invented!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li> I ordered the Panasonic Oral Irrigator EW-DJ10-A and found it superior to the WaterPik: a more elegant design, better construction, smaller and easier to handle.</li>
            <li> Most importantly for us, it&#x27;s not as soft-to-powerful on the settings, especially if you like the gum stimulating workouts that keep my dentist happy with the condition of our healthy gums.</li>
            <li> now on I will stick to Ebay, more user friendly</li>
            <li> Also when you use the more powerful setting, the tip flies off!</li>
            <li> I forgot the charging cord, which turned out not be a problem: the charge lasted the full week!</li>
            <li> I thought the horrendous reviews could not be true, but they were not exaggerations!</li>
            <li> I have the original electric Waterpik and love it, but wanted a cordless for mobility.  </li>
            <li> They even now have a cover which is cool!</li>
            <li> This holds more water than the original and the charge lasted me over a week with 2 uses a day.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The new plug is more effective and the water well empties more easily.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is smaller, more portable and easier to use than my oral B. Also gives a much better clean and mouth feels great.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s so easy to refill that it wasn&#x27;t a problem.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and a selection of heads to use.  </li>
            <li> Refilling is easy</li>
            <li> It was easy to purchase from Amazon.com since I already have an account with them.  </li>
            <li> Tips:  Warm water (as when the shower is just about ready to be entered) may work better.   </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to assemble/disassemble and in my opinion the reservoir held an ample amount of water.</li>
            <li> The tip rotates too easily.</li>
            <li> Unit does not lend itself to easy cleaning.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Bottom line is, I LOVE how clean my mouth and teeth feel after I use this Waterpik, and I would recommend it to others without hesitation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Ok, so this isn&#x27;t going to take the paint off cars, but it does clean teeth.</li>
            <li> There are no serviceable parts, although it would have been easy to engineer the unit so that the owner could easily replace the rechargeable batters.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and store when not in use.</li>
            <li> It is easy to fill, easy to use</li>
            <li> Easy to refill and plug in.       </li>
            <li> The cordless feature makes it easy to work with.</li>
            <li> But even then the jet easily flips and slips around in your mouth</li>
            <li> My dental hygiene person said it kept my gums clean and healthy.  </li>
            <li> this portable one is really easy to use and refill.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using waterpik products for over ten years, great company, most of their products are five stars.</li>
            <li> The unit is easy to use and store, and made well.</li>
            <li> Easy product to use plently of water force.</li>
            <li> It works great..holds a charge..is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> My gums are in better shape and my daughter&#x27;s braces are clean.  </li>
            <li> I can travel with his easily.</li>
            <li> It is easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and store.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, I like that</li>
            <li> /&gt;Waterpik could solve this issue easily in one of two ways.  </li>
            <li> Even after brushing and flossing the waterpik manages to clean more stuff out of my teeth.</li>
            <li> I have the larger waterpik that holds more water and works great at home.</li>
            <li> so I went through several of them and was initially happy to see Waterpik introducing a new-improved, and more costly WP-450 \\&quot;Ultra\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> easy to take with you on vacation and trips.</li>
            <li> The unit works well, nozzle turning can easily be controlled.  </li>
            <li> Easy to fill, holds plenty of water.  </li>
            <li> However, being waterpik users for many years when ours gave up the ghost finally, thought this would be a great replacement.</li>
            <li> Found it easy to use, and not too clunky.</li>
            <li> So once the tip is in your mouth, it changes the direction easily.  </li>
            <li> This one is really easy to use, easy to rinse out.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s easy to use, and it does the job.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, gets teetch flossed, easy to disassemble and to charge.</li>
            <li> So easy and thorough.  </li>
            <li> I thought a waterpik would be a hassle, but this product is so easy to use</li>
            <li> This is my first Waterpik, and I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.  </li>
            <li> Easy to hold.  </li>
            <li> I also wanted something that was easy to use and was lightweight.  </li>
            <li> it uses it all the time Easy</li>
            <li> Its relatively easy to handle</li>
            <li> The unit has a tapered area that makes it easy to hold.  </li>
            <li> ; portable can easily travel with it&lt;br</li>
            <li> works well need to get used to using it however the product works as described and would recommend this to anyone looking for a better way to help clean between teeth</li>
            <li> but its is easily stored without cleaning and drying</li>
            <li> Easy to take along travelling.  </li>
            <li> Arrived very quickly</li>
            <li> It is so easy to fill who cares?</li>
            <li> Easy to charge and</li>
            <li> Easy to grip, though it is larg-ish.  </li>
            <li> I use it almost every day because it&#x27;s easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It does the job and is relatively easy to use.</li>
            <li> Nonetheless, the corrosion problem is easily solved without buying any Radio Shack parts.</li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> Easy to handle.</li>
            <li> The cordless feature makes it easy to use.</li>
            <li> The best advice is to keep the power jack wires clean even though there&#x27;s no way to keep them dry, and I am blowing out the water in the jack after every use and will use the vinnegar technique if deposits form.</li>
            <li> reservoir is on an angle and it is easy to under-fill it, though once you realize this it is easy to fill it all the way.</li>
            <li> Is easy to use.</li>
            <li> and it seems to clean much better.</li>
            <li> The unit is easily unplugged by mistake.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy for me to bring to work and even though its on the noisy side, it expedites the cleaning process</li>
            <li> advise Panasonic DJ40 is much better, more powerful</li>
            <li> Waterpik&#x27;s customer service department was easy to contact and they agreed without argument to replace it.</li>
            <li> wish I&#x27;d bought it in a store so it would be easy to return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> like how easy they are to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> With this cordless model it is so easy to use and store.</li>
            <li> easy to use,..</li>
            <li> Easy to use, 2 power settings, fits in the hand well.  </li>
            <li> :))  Pros: Gets the teeth sparkling clean.</li>
            <li> She finds it easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to handle and maneuver while using.</li>
            <li> Easy to travel with and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s so easy to refill that I don&#x27;t find that to be an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found it to be easy to use.</li>
            <li> did watch some vids on YT to get a sense of how to use it, and it&#x27;s easy once you get the hang of it.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy and takes up a quarter of the room</li>
            <li> and that makes it really easy to share since we have separate</li>
            <li> Keeps my teeth incredibly clean and my gums healthy.</li>
            <li> I fill it about 4 times during each session but it is so easy to fill</li>
            <li> Easy to fill and use.</li>
            <li> I like being able to see in the water resservoir, easier to keep clean.</li>
            <li> The cordless needs 2 to 4 refills to really clean but rinses okay with one.</li>
            <li> Set up is easy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the way the tank works and the door is flimsy and comes off easily.</li>
            <li> easy cordless use, would recommend it to everybody who has bridges, implants or both.</li>
            <li> I like the deflosser as it is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> The lower one is strong enough.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And the stream is not quite as strong.  </li>
            <li> its been going strong for days without showing any strain.  </li>
            <li> I found this handy portable water pic just great for my needs,  I took it on vacation with me instead of my counter top model-takes up less space</li>
            <li> This item is not as good as the older model that I replaced.</li>
            <li> I found the non-PLUS model was a bit too strong with the one speed setting.  </li>
            <li> Still going strong after a year.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those folks who dislikes the strong flavor of mouthwashes and &#x27;mint-this-or-that&#x27; in particular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It is a good size for travel, but the way the water reservoir is designed it makes it a challenge to keep the flow steady as you move the tip around your teeth.  </li>
            <li> However, the water pressure is not as strong as the countertop model.  </li>
            <li> The water pic is really good product is the best thing I have use thin flossing</li>
            <li> Nothing better than the feeling of a super clean mouth and teeth!</li>
            <li> The only thing I liked about it was that I could get a more effective between the teeth rinse after brushing and flossing.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you read the directions and charge for the full 24 hours before using the product.</li>
            <li> It charges beautifully and I only need to re-charge about once every 4-6 weeks.  </li>
            <li> This seemed like a handy way of water-flossing, and it was for the first 18 months.  </li>
            <li> First time it happened I got a warranty replacement, which was nice.  </li>
            <li> I used to use the full size model - this one sounded more convenient.</li>
            <li> I would not buy this if I had a good countertop - we have a countertop model that has more pressure, a larger tank, and is more convenient to pik with.</li>
            <li> After using my waterpik the first couple of times I still flossed just to see how effective it was</li>
            <li> While bulking it is still better than trying to lug around a full Waterpik.</li>
            <li> or it won&#x27;t spray, so you better have good dexterity, and it runs out of water quickly on the high setting.</li>
            <li> It never leaked and most importantly my teeth and gums felt really clean</li>
            <li> Water flow is not as strong as the corded model but probably adequate for most people who travel.  </li>
            <li> Recharging is very quick and the jet power is more than adequate for my needs.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, this is a good flosser: good for the teeth, good for the gums, quick to use, not too heavy and not awkward to hold.</li>
            <li> Plus the on button moves so easily I keep accidentally touching it when removing the tip from my mouth or getting ready to use it and spraying mouthwash in my face, on my shirt or across the room! :-)</li>
            <li> It is a very good product and performs well with a long life after charging, Important for traveling so you can leave the charger home.</li>
            <li> It also comes with a very good selection of heads and a charger than has a long cord  that attaches securely to the unit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Years ago I used the original Waterpick and it was mighty powerful and effective.  </li>
            <li> It stays charged for a long time, easy to handle, the two setting are perfect as I prefer the lighter setting and it is just right.</li>
            <li> insert tip, 3) fill reservoir, 4) use low pressure setting first time out, 5) how to turn on/off unit and 6) techniques for best results.  </li>
            <li> Works fine, but a bit noisy.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use and light weight.  </li>
            <li> and now it works fine again.</li>
            <li> This waterpik model was initially fine.  </li>
            <li> This was fine for travel</li>
            <li> Fortunately its easy to fill..</li>
            <li> The battery life and reservoir capacity seems fine.  </li>
            <li> Delivery was prompt and efficient, packaging fine etc..</li>
            <li> so I decided to look into it and found that the battery in each case was fine.</li>
            <li> It was working fine until stopped working battery.</li>
            <li> and it worked fine for 2.5 months after which the battery just gave up.</li>
            <li> According to him it is easy to use and does a fantastic job of cleaning and rinsing his teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> The pressure was just fine for me.</li>
            <li> The unit works fine for what it was designed to do--no complaints there.  </li>
            <li> I guess it may eventually clog but after 8 months, it still works fine.</li>
            <li> it seemed to work just fine.</li>
            <li> The Waterpic does fine and lasts about 10 days using it twice a day.  </li>
            <li> if so, for less than a dollar a week, i&#x27;m happy with it!</li>
            <li> This cordless model works fine.  </li>
            <li> I now mix the mouthwash I use in it with water (seems a 50/50 blend works fine) and it delivers as advertised.</li>
            <li> The cordless unit worked fine when it worked.</li>
            <li> The waterpic works fine.  </li>
            <li> It will be fine for travel which is why we purchased it.</li>
            <li> However, it is working fine after 6 months, and doesn&#x27;t appear to be suffering any degradation.  </li>
            <li> However, when traveling this works fine.  </li>
            <li> Works fine.</li>
            <li> But this handheld one works fine too.</li>
            <li> &amp; it&#x27;s been fine.</li>
            <li> It works fine.  </li>
            <li> Worked just fine for about 1 week.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re never going to move and can leave it plugged in for eternity, I guess it was a fine product to you.</li>
            <li> works fine</li>
            <li> The head does not move around freely but it is easily moved, and this can take some getting used to but is not a problem after a couple of uses.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The amount of water is fine.</li>
            <li> and it was fine</li>
            <li> The unit works fine.</li>
            <li> It works fine and saves time.</li>
            <li> It meets my needs just fine.</li>
            <li> During the first month it worked perfect, but after that I must have charging constantly.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and does a fantastic job.  </li>
            <li> Once you do it is fine.</li>
            <li> Yes, this flosser does work fine but don&#x27;t expect it to charge 7-10 months from now.</li>
            <li> It works fine.  </li>
            <li> Cheap, easy, light easy to pack</li>
            <li> Works fine.</li>
            <li> I did find the stream more than adequate when it was fully charged.</li>
            <li> otherwise, the sound is bearable and the water pressure is strong.</li>
            <li> held more water as it runs out quick</li>
            <li> I find it much more pleasant to use than dental floss, but since I just got it, will have to wait until next visit to the dentist to see how it&#x27;s working.  </li>
            <li> The great thing about that is, it&#x27;s really easy to fill the reservoir back up and keep going.</li>
            <li> My dentist is super impressed since I&#x27;ve been a lifelong &amp;#34;no flosser.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too heavy to use and the ergonomics of it are good -- it feels good in the hand, is balanced, is of a size and weight that are comfortable, and can be angled easily.</li>
            <li> This little machine does an excellent job.  </li>
            <li> So it was very nice to get a new, fresh one.  </li>
            <li> It strong, powerful and the battery lasts!  </li>
            <li> Removing four accessible screws allowed access to the release mechanism, which then was easy to free.</li>
            <li> Being curios I disassembled both and found a huge -10 to Waterpick engineers.</li>
            <li> That would be a huge inconvenience.    </li>
            <li> Its amazing on what it is able to clear</li>
            <li> My teeth, gums and smile are WAY more important.</li>
            <li> taking the aesthetics out (this thing is kinda huge), the water pik came recommended from my dentist.  </li>
            <li> and it has made a huge difference.</li>
            <li> device has made a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> I hope to get a great report from my hygienist at my next cleaning.</li>
            <li> Makes it so easy to clean my teeth.</li>
            <li> I find that I have the best results by starting at the back and working to the front teeth, then turning  it off with the handy on/off switch.</li>
            <li> working great for the last 7 years!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Still no indicator light.  </li>
            <li> It is shaped well to fit in your hand</li>
            <li> Errr...fine, so where is the charging light??</li>
            <li> I will buy a corded one next, becase it is a great product when it was working.</li>
            <li> I SAW THE LIGHT.  </li>
            <li> the product description does not specify this important information</li>
            <li> and I enjoy.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t fit in pocketbook but perhaps in a desk drawer.</li>
            <li> Reservoir needs to be filled twice for thorough cleaning</li>
            <li> I enjoy using it and the health benefits to my teeth.</li>
            <li> Cheap plastic body.</li>
            <li> I wish there were a charge light</li>
            <li> Unless some misguided portability in a water-flosser is strangely important to you, pass on this.  </li>
            <li> Ergonomically it easily fit into my hand</li>
            <li> /&gt;The unit \\&quot;is\\&quot; reasonably comfortable to hold albeit</li>
            <li> They are available on amazon and that&#x27;s where I got it.</li>
            <li> It is sometimes the only way I can dislodge food stuck between my teeth, and my dental hygienist always comments that my teeth and gums are in great shape.  </li>
            <li> But im happy overall.</li>
            <li> The product worked great and suddenly stopped after 6-months; the battery no longer holds a charge.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> There is no charging light.</li>
            <li> larger water container and the pressure is great...</li>
            <li> I then filled it and gave it a</li>
            <li> Simple to use and does a great job on my teeth</li>
            <li> would have been more powerful  </li>
            <li> much more powerful.</li>
            <li> After reading the lead review (and&lt;br /&gt; another review saying the parts were no longer available at Radio Shack)&lt;br /&gt; I searched for and found an electronic cleaner: DeoxIT  which I have now&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m happy with this product.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li> The pressure on this isn&#x27;t great, so it isn&#x27;t my daily at-home flosser.</li>
            <li> It is a cheap piece of cr*p that has controls that don&#x27;t make sense and squirt water everywhere.  </li>
            <li> , I just wish it was more powerful.</li>
            <li> definitely recommend it to others who want great flossing experience.</li>
            <li> After charging the unit for 24 hours, I filled up the water vessel and started flossing.  </li>
            <li> This product needs a battery charge indicator light.</li>
            <li> This fit the bill on all accounts.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The portability is important as I travel alot.</li>
            <li> This is my second waterpik which has greatly helped toughen my gums which were always tender and would bleed from time to time.  </li>
            <li> After using the larger Waterpik Ultra (Model WP-100) for a couple of years, and getting great results from using it, I decided to buy one for my husband.  </li>
            <li> The cordless version is just too bulky to be comfortable in use.  </li>
            <li> Each use of the unit drains the fully filled reservoir.  </li>
            <li> However, I enjoy using it, which it motivating.</li>
            <li> so I fill it with a warmer temp that is comfortable to me.  </li>
            <li> and it is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Sound level:  </li>
            <li> If you are comfortable carrying a travel hair dryer this will work for you</li>
            <li> I am happy to report that Waterpik has changed the design to two separate prongs and the female charging unit has likewise been changed.  </li>
            <li> Cheap and available.</li>
            <li> I used it regularly and it is actually a great device.</li>
            <li> mighty.</li>
            <li> The price for this incredibly cheaply made trash is unconscionable.</li>
            <li> Cheap at twice the price, but don&#x27;t use it to remove ear wax</li>
            <li> This is a bit smaller, and runs with great speed and water pressure.</li>
            <li> Just clean off the charging tips so the juice can flow across, easy fix.</li>
            <li> Bought primarily for travelling purposes.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a comfortable pressure but won&#x27;t give you that stinging sensation of the counter top.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Buy it here on Amazon with confidence, read the reviews, and enjoy.</li>
            <li> I own a Sonicare toothebrush and cannot believe how much food is removed by the waterflosser even after brushing.</li>
            <li> and i enjoy it from over 18 months now.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product about 4 months ago and overall have been happy with the performance of this water flosser.</li>
            <li> I am comfortable using the product.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully this oversight doesn&#x27;t indicate a desire to skip quality for cheap manufacturing.</li>
            <li> Fully charged, filled tank with water again...</li>
            <li> fantastic  </li>
            <li> When I received it, the shipping label said \\&quot;Primary lithium battery - not for transport on passenger aircraft.\\&quot; Amazon refunded everything.</li>
            <li> Why would you make a great product to take with you on your travels but only supply a 110 volt charger?&lt;br /&gt;Laptops, phones and the like</li>
            <li> I have  braces and it works great around them with the standard tip.</li>
            <li> It works great, just enough time on.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic product.  </li>
            <li> Its water capacity is sufficient and can be easily filled.</li>
            <li> Works great, the only downside is that you have to keep refilling the water reservoir.</li>
            <li> The unit initially worked quite well; a great adjunct to the oral hygiene routine.</li>
            <li> But overall it is great for flossing your teeth.  </li>
            <li> Fabulous Waterpik.  </li>
            <li> This product is fantastic and so userfrendly.&lt;br /&gt;It flosses teeth and gums</li>
            <li> Portable and cordless, it was quite convenient and I felt it did a great job, based on the junk that it flushed from my mouth after I had already brushed with my Phillips Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I can say, I will search Walmart.com as well as Amazon since I can return items for free if they do not meet my expectations.</li>
            <li> Once out of the package i charged it and filled with filtered water.  </li>
            <li> The battery lasts for a week, which is a sound performance.</li>
            <li> I was happy to find this gadget so that I wouldn&#x27;t have to have massive clutter in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The water reservoir</li>
            <li> you want it for travel it would do for light flossing.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> the color has improved greatly, and it appears that my gums are starting to regrow</li>
            <li> My case has been a very, very happy one, although I&#x27;m just a few days into it...</li>
            <li> and it was a fantastic tool to have.</li>
            <li> and it was confirmed by my orthodontist and hygienist.</li>
            <li> And the reservoir can&#x27;t be removed and filled because the hole on the bottom allows the water to come out.  </li>
            <li> A fantastic product.</li>
            <li> This waterpik is indispensable for when you are out on the road.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how much guck comes out of your mouth that you would never see with just brushing.</li>
            <li> This is probably one of the most fun items.</li>
            <li> like how it doesn&#x27;t have a huge water reservoir, allowing it to easily fit on my crowded counter.  </li>
            <li> I had it for a couple of months and it is really working nice.</li>
            <li> However when I unplugged the charger monday morning there was no pumping sound, no water spurted out.  </li>
            <li> I look at quite a few and decided this was the best one for my needs.</li>
            <li> It does a great job, especially as I have a lot of dental work; no shredded floss to pick out.</li>
            <li> mouthwash bottle filled with water and a splash of mouthwash in it.</li>
            <li> so cordless was important to me....</li>
            <li> Works grat to keep your teeth free of tarter</li>
            <li> There is a learning curve for proper use but great product once you know how to use it correctly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another issue is no battery charge/power available indicator.  </li>
            <li> Do wish it had a battery charged light on it</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> I find it to be far superior to flossing with string...</li>
            <li> Works perfectly and does the job Had many negative reviews</li>
            <li> but so far so good.  </li>
            <li> I felt it did a good job, I refilled it once to complete the flossing which took about 5 seconds</li>
            <li> I loved the Waterpik Waterflosser and bought the Cordless PLUS to take on my frequent travel.</li>
            <li> 6 months after purchase it won&#x27;t hold a full charge or operate at full power any more.</li>
            <li> There have been many published dental studies (I read about 40 of them on-line in the Journal of Periodontology) that confirm the efficacy of disruption of bacteria whether physically or chemically (by, say, chlorhexidine,) and the PLUS (and Pocket-Pik tip) are good tools in that ongoing war.</li>
            <li> This is much more portable, smaller, but still does a good job.  </li>
            <li> Anything cordless is nice but it is kind of big.</li>
            <li> overall it is good ,after all it&#x27;s cheap !</li>
            <li> Instead I got the Panasonic EW1211, which is a far superior device.</li>
            <li> The second time I used it, I managed to make it HALFWAY THROUGH my top teeth before I laughed at something and water</li>
            <li> I do not have space on my bathroom counter for a bigger machine and need to be able to take it with me for my trips too, so this seems to be a good compromise.</li>
            <li> So far so good...</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, you can put the water very easily, and it have the exact water power for a quick cleaning.</li>
            <li> Rerservoir size, on full power setting, is more than adequate to fully irrigate for me.  </li>
            <li> The company sent me a new one which I was very pleased with.  </li>
            <li> I just took it on a trip to New Orleans and was very pleased with it&#x27;s performance.</li>
            <li> What more can you ask for right?</li>
            <li> and I found the right product, I recommend waterpik :-)</li>
            <li> There is a switch right on the wand where you need it most.</li>
            <li> like this water pink is very good to clean your teeth I recommended.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s great to finally have an easy-to-use portable bidet to help keep myself clean and comfortable.</li>
            <li> keeps the teeth and mouth fresh and clean but be ware not to use it at the sink as you will get wet best to use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> really wish this appliance were designed better, because it does an outstanding job keeping teeth clean.  </li>
            <li> It is true that I have to refill the water reservoir once or twice during each use, but it&#x27;s so easy to fill that I don&#x27;t consider that a problem -- takes just a couple seconds.  </li>
            <li> This makes flossing so much easier!!!</li>
            <li> Really gets between the teeth and into the gum line!!!  </li>
            <li> The water stream is very powerful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very effective at getting all the gunk out from between my teeth, especially where I have a couple dental crowns.</li>
            <li> My husband,my daughter, my father all find this product very useful in getting into places the floss couldn&#x27;t get.</li>
            <li> It was very powerful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this 3 stars (being very liberal here), because it is better to travel with than the regular sized Waterpik that I use every day (which I give a perfect &amp;#34;10&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li> Very powerful and substatial.  </li>
            <li> Very powerful cleaning, reach where tooth brush doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> Very powerful for a portable.</li>
            <li> Waterpik Ultra is not the perft whenever you start using it, you will find yourself in need for a higher speed than the highest one on it, it works fine but string flossing is more efficient in the sense of removing food leftovers between your teeth in addition to it</li>
            <li> It was fine for the first couple of weeks, then I found myself charging it more often.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many, mostly the older type, and None have made it for a year yet.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t read any other reviews with this issue, yet find it incredible</li>
            <li> Does what it says it will do.....leaves the mouth and teeth clean and debris free.</li>
            <li> When I first used it I&#x27;d never really used a water pik &amp; it took a while to figure out the best way to go about it...</li>
            <li> Reservoir holds plenty of water for one pass and is easily and quickly refillable.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use and doesn&#x27;t take up much space.  </li>
            <li> The Water Pik works very well and it is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> The gadget does not take up too much space on the bathroom counter and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I just bought this product and love it very much.</li>
            <li> I have been enjoying it very much.  </li>
            <li> Now I just go very fast with it after I brush and refill it 1 or 2 times at most.  </li>
            <li> This one is much, much better; it&#x27;s so easy and fast to use it encourages use every time I brush my teeth.</li>
            <li> Well not only has it helped my gums but it feels good and is easy to do.</li>
            <li> More than once I had to change to dry clothes as I sprayed myself good.  </li>
            <li> Its very powerful and does exactly what he needed, which is to keep his gums clean and healthy.</li>
            <li> This unit is not user friendly.  </li>
            <li> If it does stop working first thing is to make sure the jet isn&#x27;t blocked, any blockage can be removed with a needle or pin.</li>
            <li> So far, my husband and I have been very pleased with it, although it does take some time to get use to using it proficiently.</li>
            <li> And won&#x27;t be able to use the higher speed until we get use to it.</li>
            <li> The cordless water flosser at first glance is an interesting concept.  </li>
            <li> like the idea of the device, but in the end I&#x27;m not sure it was the best use of $100 (we bought two).  </li>
            <li> my dentist says that I will be buried with my original teeth.</li>
            <li> Time will also tell if I experience better dental checkups since using this consistently.</li>
            <li> Since I bought the first one and tried it, I have since bought two more.</li>
            <li> A product well worth the price!</li>
            <li> There is no indicator light or anything to show when the full charge has been reached.</li>
            <li> The product was received in original packaging, but was determined immediately faulty.  </li>
            <li> After thoroughly cleaning and removing the mold when I posted the original review.  </li>
            <li> I am glad I dropped and destroyed the first one.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not disappointed with the cordless waterpik.</li>
            <li> One reviewer commented that this pik is too powerful, even on &amp;#34;low&amp;#34;; I can&#x27;t imagine!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for over a year and it has made a significant difference in my oral care.  </li>
            <li> my gum condition shows significant improvement in couple</li>
            <li> I was really excited about getting this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure this is the best device for kids but works well for adults if you take the time to use it as designed.  </li>
            <li> They are GREAT... as long as it works.</li>
            <li> I have to say the pump pressure on this newer Plus was better than I remembered when I first used the Plus 2 years ago.</li>
            <li> Not as forceful as the original waterpik model.  </li>
            <li> Skip this one and go for the original waterpik.</li>
            <li> Replacement parts were not being sold for the original unit nor was anything noted on the site about the original model.  </li>
            <li> I originally ordered this for my son who had braces.</li>
            <li> It is worth the price to just dislodge the piece of nut that gets stuck in between the tooth and gum from time to time!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 3/16 to original review (which is below):  I received the replacement from Waterpik.</li>
            <li> Waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;The first can&#x27;t hold energy for more than two days.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> She is really excited about using.the ester pik.</li>
            <li> Originally, I purchased the flosser as an alternative to string floss.</li>
            <li> The makers obviously don&#x27;t use their own product!</li>
            <li> I was excited to purchase this water pick.  </li>
            <li> The product works great, and the battery lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> This water flosser works pretty well, better than the string stuff.</li>
            <li> At the begining when I first started using this product I fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> It works great so long as the charge lasts.  </li>
            <li> I have used waterpik for a long time they are great for keeping the &amp;#34; pockets &amp;#34; below the gums clean i uses mine with some peroxide.  </li>
            <li> This does a great job and is just as powerful as the big one.  </li>
            <li> After using the Waterpik, my mouth and teeth feel exceptionally clean.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t ever keep it clean.</li>
            <li> A portable sink top unit with a longer cord that plugged in would have been a far better solution.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll save the $140.00 and still have clean teeth.</li>
            <li> Not having any way to fully drain and clean the unit seems like a design flaw to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It takes me two to three refills to clean teeth sufficiently.  </li>
            <li> After using the Waterpik, followed by brushing my teeth, they feel as clean as when I go to the dentist.</li>
            <li> I kind of wish I hadn&#x27;t bought it, but I&#x27;ll continue using it for now, and see if my next dental check-up is any better.</li>
            <li> The battery life is sufficient for a weeks worth of flossing and the unit is easy to handle.  </li>
            <li> Use it in conjunction with floss and electric tootbrush and everything seems to come completely clean.  </li>
            <li> Yes, you have to refill it two to three time to thoroughly clean your mouth</li>
            <li> Still, it does seem to clean the debris from between my teeth; we&#x27;ll see what the hygienist&#x27;s verdict is in a couple of months.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for daily use - corded models are more effective.  .</li>
            <li> although the company will replace for free you just go through them too quickly</li>
            <li> makes your teeth feel so clean.</li>
            <li> easy to use, its worth the money.</li>
            <li> but the machine was an eyesore, and a pain to clean out.  </li>
            <li> ilove that i can put peroxide in the mix and use to clean below the gumline.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m repurchasing because of how clean it got my teeth</li>
            <li> and my mouth feels really clean after use,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a chemistry professor and I put it in my office and get some HCl solution to clean up the stain.</li>
            <li> so I have to clean it every week.</li>
            <li> to clean n store would recommend to everyone</li>
            <li> I can now clean all the spaces between all my bridework.</li>
            <li> If you want a clean dental checkup</li>
            <li> and it uses water quickly even when filled to fill capacity.</li>
            <li> I took it to my office and now I don&#x27;t have to worry about a &#x27;clean&#x27; mouth when I go to meetings...</li>
            <li> If you are fortunate enough to have a unit that works, good for you.  </li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t always get between the teeth to clean.  </li>
            <li> Teeth and gums are clean with no pain.  </li>
            <li> I mix mouth wash and water to do the clean.</li>
            <li> Does it clean my teeth - yes</li>
            <li> My teeth and gums are clean all them time.</li>
            <li> and my mouth has never felt this clean before.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done and your mouth feels clean after every use.</li>
            <li> Think your teeth are clean after brushing??  </li>
            <li> Makes your mouth feel so clean.  </li>
            <li> Charges easily and is powerful if you feel you need it.</li>
            <li> All you need is a source of clean water.  </li>
            <li> I fill it at sink lean over clean my teeth to my hearts</li>
            <li> My dentist told me that I had 2mm pockets, but that overall my gums were nice and healthy.</li>
            <li> Mouth feels really clean.</li>
            <li> I bought this along with the plug in unit for a gift - I have had such great success with mine...</li>
            <li> but it will keep your gums and the pockets around them clean.</li>
            <li> feel that my teeth and gums are clean</li>
            <li> I had to fill it 4 times to completely clean my teeth . . .</li>
            <li> It takes more room but it is far better.</li>
            <li> This flosser gets the area between my teeth amazingly clean.  </li>
            <li> Got this to help with keeping braces clean.</li>
            <li> It is nice that it&#x27;s more portable than the regular waterpic.</li>
            <li> It leaves my mouth feeling really clean.</li>
            <li> Using this before you brush gets your mouth so clean....</li>
            <li> , teeth feel so clean.</li>
            <li> Like floss, I just don&#x27;t have a clean mouth with all that stuff between my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think it would be good for traveling, and it does what it said it does, however, it is very bulking in the hand and doesn&#x27;t hold much water.</li>
            <li> The cordless option is very handy, and it does hold a charge for a long while.  </li>
            <li> The older, original model Waterpik with the motor and water tank that sits on the counter top works fine and is the one you should buy.</li>
            <li> Love it, great only for travelling only when used with Hydrogen Peroxide not so good when used with water because I do not get a real clean feeling using water as I do with the larger capcity corded musti-speed Waterflosser.</li>
            <li> The very good reviews now available lead me to believe this is a newer model and with at least the same great performance of my 1270 unit.</li>
            <li> The engineering was abysmal and WaterPik evidently decided it was better to try and unload it in the marketplace and embarrass itself, than to suck it up, work out the bugs, and roll out an adequate model.</li>
            <li> Super portable and great for travel, however, after some time it starts to get yucky and the battery charge doesn&#x27;t hold as long.  </li>
            <li> The big Waterpik machine on our sink at home keeps away the plaque - more important than brushing and flossing, although all three are important for healthy teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li> It was easy to order and was shipped right away.</li>
            <li> found that, because the on/off switch is right in my hand, it&#x27;s easy to do a section at a time, turning it off in between</li>
            <li> I really liked this Waterpik because I don&#x27;t have a counter to put the other kind on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too large, won&#x27;t hold a charge more than 3 days, it won&#x27;t work if it is tilted</li>
            <li> Has a variety of tips for special needs.</li>
            <li> This unit comes with a special tip for implants and crowns, so I use that one.</li>
            <li> Also it looks smart :)</li>
            <li> I liked my original Waterpik much better - the one with the long cord.</li>
            <li> This item does a very good job, is very easy to use, and the charge last a long time.  </li>
            <li> I prefer my older Waterpik WP-70. Much more pressure available.</li>
            <li> I love the clean feeling after using a waterpik and my gums are so much healthier.  </li>
            <li> My father has the older model that must be filled from the top using a cup.  </li>
            <li> finally got around to calling Waterpik&#x27;s 800 Customer service number and have to say I was DELIGHTED that I only had to press one automated prompt, to select the product line...and suddenly, a REAL person was talking to me...a very friendly, helpful and delightful young  lady.</li>
            <li> This handheld, cordless version is light, easy to use and charges pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> I use it at home and hardly ever have to charge it and the size of the water bin is almost perfect.  </li>
            <li> Check out the Shower Flosser online if you want a more powerful water flosser for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a great product and was so happy to find a battery operated water-pik due to the limited counterspace I have inmy bathroom.  </li>
            <li> Waterpik was very courteous and shipped me a whole new package, tips and all, right away.  </li>
            <li> It is underpowered and while is much more convenient that the old Water Pik, it needs to be more powerful</li>
            <li> Until 2 days ago, I still liked the portable WaterPic as much as I did from the first.  </li>
            <li> Nothing to indicate charging is taking place, nothing to indicate a full charge, nothing to indicate a need to charge.  </li>
            <li> It has better pressure and seems to hold just as much water.  </li>
            <li> Unit works very well and i am pleased.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t want the full on reservoir model.  </li>
            <li> The Panasonic however is a true Travel/Portable unit as advertised.</li>
            <li> one year I&#x27;m now experencing a battery that won&#x27;t keep a full charge.  </li>
            <li> Good selection of tips for an individual.</li>
            <li> I am pleased that the product does in fact work very well.  </li>
            <li> It holds enough water to get a good rinse</li>
            <li> (the true results from using it will come in February when I see my dentist for a follow up).</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
            <li> AND Waterpik sometimes, and that is super clean.</li>
            <li> the way, it IS loud, and the tip does rotate on its own.</li>
            <li> I loved the earlier model.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really a good product to rinse in between your teeth, if it would just last.</li>
            <li> Simple comments:  1)  Product does look good  2)  </li>
            <li> dentist told me that the effort to use it will absolutely pay off by producing exceptionally healthy, bacteria-free gums.</li>
            <li> It is a good product, this is my second water pick (cordless)</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m just spoiled by the full sized Waterpik, but I bought this one to travel with because I have been abusing my full sized by towing it in my travels...</li>
            <li> Using it twice a day with one full water reservoir each time it lasted 5 days.</li>
            <li> With two bridges in my mouth, they are essential to good oral hygiene.</li>
            <li> Still, it looks cool and is cordless...</li>
            <li> Had a full size waterpik</li>
            <li> Much easier to use, which means I use it more often.</li>
            <li> I love this so much that I am buying one for my daughter with braces.  </li>
            <li> But there is a vastly superior system that was designed by a French dentist, Dr. Woog.</li>
            <li> Nothing in between but seems good enough.</li>
            <li> But this one is good to take with you for short trips since it is cordless.</li>
            <li> the true test will be when i go to my dentist for my quarterly cleaning as I&#x27;ve had lots of gum problems,</li>
            <li> (I have to say that Ultra has very very short cord) and it is good to use at home</li>
            <li> But if someone wants to get the backs of their bottom teeth, I&#x27;d love to see how that works.  </li>
            <li> I have had the same person for over 20 years, so she knows my teeth and would be a good judge.  </li>
            <li> You have to really make sure the o-ring catches well.</li>
            <li> she has a full size one by this company and swears by it</li>
            <li> that I  can not recommend the company more highly!.</li>
            <li> According to my dentist Waterpik does a good job of honoring their warranty if I had known enough to call them.</li>
            <li> This prevents overcharging the battery, however the battery is never charged to full capacity.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts several days which is good.  </li>
            <li> It claims it gives &amp;#34;a full 45 seconds&amp;#34; of sonic floss before the container drains.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s good enough to blast the debris from geriatric gums....  </li>
            <li> A full charge will operate the unit for 20 to 30 uses before needing to recharge.</li>
            <li> Initially was good but after using for 10 times it stopped working and need to return it now..</li>
            <li> Good product but battery could last langer.</li>
            <li> I have to recharge it after every 2 or 3 uses (one full reservatory).</li>
            <li> I received it fast and just love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good enough for vacations</li>
            <li> and this is essential to keep those in good condition.    </li>
            <li> I. I truely thought my gums would suffer.</li>
            <li> I CANNOT say enough good stuff about the plug in one.</li>
            <li> The accessories that came with it - 3 extra picks - were good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true --</li>
            <li> I checked and it was full of goop again.</li>
            <li> My 80 year old mother has used a water pik for 40 years and still has ALL of her own teeth.  </li>
            <li> I have had a full sized one at home for years to compare it to.</li>
            <li> Water gets EVERYWHERE - outside and inside, which probably isn&#x27;t good for the hardware.</li>
            <li> I might as well have swished a mouth full of water around in my mouth for 60 seconds.  </li>
            <li> After 6 seconds my mouth is full of water.</li>
            <li> I very recoment this product :)</li>
            <li> Fresher breath and super clean gums and teeth.</li>
            <li> i love this so much..... 5 star</li>
            <li> We bought 3 so far, so everybody in the household has its own.</li>
            <li> , I keep the battery over 50% full.</li>
            <li> , I would recommend the regular counter top unit with the larger reservoir, but this one is ideal for travel.</li>
            <li> I bought the WP450 cordless model in June 2012, after repeated 6-month dentist appointments with ever deepening \\&quot;pockets\\&quot; and me saying: OK, I&#x27;ll try harder, brush better, floss better/more often, reach those corners better.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a function-over-almost-anything kind of person, so the benefits far outweigh that trait of the appliance.  </li>
            <li> This model is a superior product compared to the basic model.</li>
            <li> Good while they last</li>
            <li> Was working good for 4 months, then pump wont pump water anymore it just died all of sudden.</li>
            <li> I put in my cap full of mouth wash and its all done.</li>
            <li> but now I use it on full power and there is no gum bleeding so it is working.  </li>
            <li> Every flaw you&#x27;ve read about is true.  </li>
            <li> I found the Waterpik Waterflosser Cordless handy, but the batteries got defective after a few months, so you need to charge the unit more and more often.</li>
            <li> OK but doesn&#x27;t really have a lot of force.  </li>
            <li> He named replacement parts that will fit and extend the life of this useful appliance.</li>
            <li> I have about 11 seconds of cool, watery burst.</li>
            <li> The pressure coming out of it is not what it needs to be to clean your teeth and the amount of water it holds runs out quickly.</li>
            <li> PLUGGED IN FULL TIME.</li>
            <li> You can mix listerine and water in there for a more intense cleaning</li>
            <li> mouth was definitely super clean.  </li>
            <li> mouth was definitely super clean.  </li>
            <li> it is a good product overall.</li>
            <li> Good overall product.</li>
            <li> and I always doubt it is doing as good a job as regular dental floss,</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any problems out of the battery life but would love to know how much power is remaining</li>
            <li> I love this one so much....</li>
            <li> Love this thing, really cleans out every thing between my teeth, dentist said to keep up what ever I am doing, my check-ups and cleanings have improved.</li>
            <li> minutes/two full cleanings.</li>
            <li> The only good thing I see in this product is for traveling.</li>
            <li> I think :) because it&#x27;s gentle on the gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not too large, easy to pack, and reasonably light in weight.</li>
            <li> Works better than the original even when the original was new.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m switching to the Panasonic which appears to be more portable and it uses batteries so that you don&#x27;t have to throw away a mechanically sound device because you can&#x27;t put a new battery in it.  </li>
            <li> of the box, it looks and feels like the kind of thing a dentist would use -- solid, well-built, easy to operate, and came with everything needed.  </li>
            <li> The issue with having to refill several times while \\&quot;water flossing\\&quot;, gets better as you become more familiar with product.</li>
            <li> I am used to the standard models which use much more water force to get between the teeth and clean more the pockets.</li>
            <li> Great for bridges and other dental work.</li>
            <li> Ok maybe after 3 months I don&#x27;t know what I am in for, I only use one tank full most of the time.</li>
            <li> Other than that, great product.</li>
            <li> Other than that, the water pick is great and priced correctly from my perspective.</li>
            <li> None of the problems experienced by the other buyers have even been an issue.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;To be fair, I liked the shuttering steam of water instead of steady one as other product.</li>
            <li> I love my new Waterpik!</li>
            <li> Bottom line is this is a huge improvement over the counter top models of old.</li>
            <li> The waterpik waterflosser cordless helps me to keep a clean, fresh tooth and mouth after each of meal.</li>
            <li> This waterflosser works well and leaves mouth feeling fresh and clean.   </li>
            <li> It makes my mouth feel fresh and clean even after brushing.</li>
            <li> I purchased a waterpikand it gave up, luckily before the guarantee ran out</li>
            <li> Will you pay for shipping both ways and ensure a quick turnaround</li>
            <li> Try to stop viewing this thing as a quick, one-handed, gadget that works on</li>
            <li> Water can deplete quickly.  </li>
            <li> I wanted a product that would make it fun (especially for my spouse) to continue good oral hygiene.</li>
            <li> Not as much power as a regular pik but works good and packs easily.  </li>
            <li> It comes with more tips than the classic, and it does save a lot of space.    </li>
            <li> but will do a quick cleaning on the go.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, the 450 seems to work adequately.  </li>
            <li> Having had some form of waterpik from their beginning many years back, I have watched their models evolve and purchased many over the years.  </li>
            <li> My main source of delight with the company is that it dealt with my issue quickly, efficiently, and appropriately.</li>
            <li> I am feeling some improvement in how the gums feel and it becomes easier to use rather quickly.</li>
            <li> but I quickly got the hang of it.  </li>
            <li> I do feel I get an adequate cleaning with the water/time allotted.  </li>
            <li> Use it everyday and it has helped my gums so much that my dentist is impressed.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;It goes quickly, cleans thoroughly and easier than flossing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is s portable one and the reservoir drains of water too quickly.  </li>
            <li> She paused after about 15 seconds, looked at the chart, started scraping for about 10 more seconds, stopped and asked if I was using a different tooth brush or flossed more often.  </li>
            <li> I suppose I&#x27;m lucky, mine lasted longer than others.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that the charger operates on 120V only, regardless that device is perfect for traveling.</li>
            <li> I contacted them because the Waterpik did not seem to have adequate water pressure.</li>
            <li> BATTERY DRAINS QUICKLY</li>
            <li> I purchased this Waterpik several weeks ago and could not be more pleased.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really a shame because this is a great product but doesn&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li> Most people travel overseas now and this charge can be used only in countries with 110v and not in countries with 220v (ie most countries).</li>
            <li> This is my third Waterpik and they just keep getting better and better.</li>
            <li> While cleaning the pressure was super and</li>
            <li> Water runs out of the tank quite fast but the rest is so far so good.</li>
            <li> , how quickly it cycles through the water.</li>
            <li> Battery dies quickly.</li>
            <li> battery self-discharges quickly.</li>
            <li> The water capacity is adequate.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be more convenient than my older model that plugs in to the wall and has a rectangular reservoir for water.  </li>
            <li> After using one of the extra tips, my husband was so impressed that I ordered a second unit for him.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hold adequate quantity of water for one session.</li>
            <li> yes, the water does run out quick</li>
            <li> The water seems to be used up too quickly.</li>
            <li> Battery dies quickly</li>
            <li> had to refill it FOUR times just to QUICKLY cover all 4 quadrants of my mouth.  </li>
            <li> This item came quickly and I was amazed at how well it works.</li>
            <li> like the older model better</li>
            <li> This smaller model is perfect for travel, or for your younger family members ...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Within about a week of using the device, the power started to fall off quickly between charges.  </li>
            <li> For the people that say it runs out of water to quick and you have to refill...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll fill up your mouth quite quickly, so you need to remember to spit often.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll fill up your mouth quite quickly, so you need to remember to spit often.</li>
            <li> Obviously, the wired water pic is still the best, but the cordless is an adequate substitute for those times when we are traveling and have no access to the traditional product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It does work QUICKLY</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does work QUICKLY</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;to run out much to quickly.  </li>
            <li> I love it as its much more coveenent than the larger ones.</li>
            <li> Does a super job of cleaning.</li>
            <li> am so grateful to be able to have a decent waterpik while travelling.</li>
            <li> So....&lt;br /&gt;I brought it back where I bought it and just ordered the Aquarius from Amazon, hoping it will be better with a more powerfull waterflosser.</li>
            <li> adequate but spray could be stronger</li>
            <li> I think I could ever get from my him: &amp;#34;I wish more people had such healthy gums like you</li>
            <li> but then my mouth fills up with water quickly</li>
            <li> Received super quick and works very, very well!</li>
            <li> I am confident that the High level will be sufficient when I build up some tolerance.  </li>
            <li> We love the cordless waterpik waterflosser and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly suggest this product be used for a much better cleaning of the teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> Works better on high speed</li>
            <li> Aside from that, the system was exceptionally durable and lasted 9 years with only one change of tubing, which unfortunately is no longer available.</li>
            <li> , I used this water pick about 3 times a day, hold the charge for a long time and it a great product for anybody that that wants to keep your gums and teeth clean.</li>
            <li> I love this new rechargeable model because of the decrease in counter clutter, ease of filling/emptying, and it has lasted the full week without recharging.  </li>
            <li> It holds just the right amount of water for me to clean all my teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve informed them of the problem repeatedly, and even got them to replace that first one under warranty, but they&#x27;ve done nothing to fix this huge issue.  </li>
            <li> at first thought it was going to be cheap , because of price.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied overall, and I look forward to having healthier teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> I bought this waterpik about 7 or 8 months ago and was actually very pleased with it until recently.  </li>
            <li> Much more convenient than the old countertop model that took up so much space and made much more noise.</li>
            <li> (O:&lt;br /&gt;also its alot more powerful than the 360 and holds just enough more water to make it a one-run through for me.</li>
            <li> Better than floss; makes my teeth and gums feel squeaky clean, and the smaller one I have packs up easily for travelling.</li>
            <li> it is more compact but still the same great quality as the larger models.  </li>
            <li> Last month I purchased the Cordless Plus and am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Good power and holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> Good power and holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> I purchased a used or display model at discount and paid dearly for the good deal in the long run.  </li>
            <li> The force of the water is not as strong as the full size model, but it still works better than just brushing or just flossing, especially with my braces.</li>
            <li> I have a the regular waterpik ultra flosser (countertop version) at home, but this is good enough and most importantly portable.</li>
            <li> By whittling some plastic away I made a better connector from the Radio Shack parts and now the Waterpiks work like new.     </li>
            <li> I love my new Waterpik Waterflosser Cordless PLUS&lt;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m enjoying the new tips that come with it.</li>
            <li> I WILL LOOK INTO REPLACING THE BATTERY AND SEE IF THIS IS A BETTER SOLUTION THAN BUYING A NEW ONE, SINCE THEY HAVE UPDATED THE MODEL.</li>
            <li> I WILL LOOK INTO REPLACING THE BATTERY AND SEE IF THIS IS A BETTER SOLUTION THAN BUYING A NEW ONE, SINCE THEY HAVE UPDATED THE MODEL.</li>
            <li> I may try one more time with a new one</li>
            <li> So this WATERPIK is my new love.  </li>
            <li> The Waterpik is able to reach below the gum line and new studies in periodontal health show that adding a 1/4 teaspoon of household bleach to the water will reduce the bacterial colony.  </li>
            <li> I really love the new portable waterpik flosser.</li>
            <li> Initially it was pretty good.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use and very convenient.  </li>
            <li> Is easy to use and reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to manage and does not take up too much space.</li>
            <li> , it is really easy, painless and very efficient.</li>
            <li> If you have strong gums, however, then yes, I would believe this flosser works quite well without much pain.</li>
            <li> It is very convienent to take while traveling and will packs easily.</li>
            <li> I took the easy route and purchased what had been working very well.</li>
            <li> The first one also had a leaking water reservoir which meant emptying it after each use (which isn&#x27;t a big deal and is probably a good idea anyways).  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s pretty good overall</li>
            <li> The Hi/Low switch feels cheap and almost like a fisher price kind of switch, it does not clearly click into one position or the other&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> The high/low switch is particularly awkward since it doesn&#x27;t have a good &#x27;click&#x27; when it engages.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that this is an excellent product I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It is a good alternative to having the plug in the wall unit if you are limited with space.</li>
            <li> I had considered sending it back but decided it was better than nothing!    </li>
            <li> My dentist told me last week that my gums look so healthy!</li>
            <li> It looks and works exactly like the write up said!  </li>
            <li> The photo on the box looks exactly like the original unit</li>
            <li> Back to manual until someone has a better product!</li>
            <li> highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> Lol made a mess at frst.</li>
            <li> Very please with item!!</li>
            <li> The new unit works great and have had no further issues.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Exhanged it for new  corded model whose performance is far superior.</li>
            <li> This model is easy to use, has a better hand grip and a longer lasting battery.</li>
            <li> I try and dry it out the best I can after each use but still think it might have some future problems.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for cleaning between two teeth that are too tight to get floss between.</li>
            <li> The hygienist said that my gums were in excellent health and there was almost no plaque, so very little scraping!!</li>
            <li> The water reservoir holds just about the right amount of water for a quick cleaning and refilling</li>
            <li> The cordless unit doesn&#x27;t have as much power as my old plug-in model, but the convenience of storing it out of sight and being able to easily travel with it warrants 4 stars.  </li>
            <li> This is the first tool I have ever had to clean my teeth this way so perhaps all of them do as well.  </li>
            <li> When my original WaterPik died I decided I wanted something that wouldn&#x27;t take up so much space on my counter that the full sized unit did.  </li>
            <li> Applied good old fashioned electrical grade CRC to the charging points and rubbed with an old toothbrush and Voila!  </li>
            <li> but I certainly thought it was important to do so this time.</li>
            <li> It is a great little machine and has helped improve my oral hygiene already.</li>
            <li> Great little device.</li>
            <li> The minor element of having to refill is easily offset by the comfortable size that fits easily in the hand.</li>
            <li> Takes up so little counter top space, always handy and the convenience of not having a tube connected to the dispenser.  </li>
            <li> After a few days, I&#x27;m happy I decided to switch.</li>
            <li> I would have also appreciated a light on it somewhere to let me know the charging status.</li>
            <li> It really is amazing what is left even after you brush with a toothbrush or a sonicare tooth brush.</li>
            <li> It has worked great for the few months</li>
            <li> Amazing product, personal dentist at home</li>
            <li> This Product is really noisy and huge size.</li>
            <li> How much could it hurt to include a charge indicator light on this thing.</li>
            <li> This works very well and seems to get into crevices where floss never seemed to fit.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, there are inconveniences: for example, since the tank is detachable, one would expect to be able to fill the tank at the sink and then reattach it to the body, but the tank leaks water in this case because WaterPik didn&#x27;t see fit to put a simple valve on the tank&#x27;s water output.</li>
            <li> Not as powerful as a plug in model but gets the job done if you&#x27;re on the road.</li>
            <li> That makes it worth the price</li>
            <li> Brush your tooth only is not enough to keep the good, healthy tooth.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After each use I run it until its as empty as possible and shake out any remaining water as best</li>
            <li> went with the Waterpik brand because I expected such a long-respected brand would be the best.  </li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve enjoyed it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as powerful as the countertop version</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still learning how to use this properly buy so far I think it does a great job.</li>
            <li> they are not, this is just not as powerful.  </li>
            <li> This makes flossing fun, not a chore anymore.  </li>
            <li> I let it charge a full 24 hours before my first use.  </li>
            <li> Not as powerful as stationary Waterpik</li>
            <li> It does not feel as strong as the older model I had.</li>
            <li> Worth it ?</li>
            <li> and Wow, I love it.</li>
            <li> Anyone with a teen and braces who won&#x27;t floss should try and make their own opinion.</li>
            <li> It is fun to use.</li>
            <li> It is much, much better than the old design.</li>
            <li> This smaller unit will be nice for traveling.  </li>
            <li> For once, flossing is fun.  </li>
            <li> At a price of about $40, it&#x27;s well worth $20 per year.</li>
            <li> The powerful water jet cleans below the gumline, between teeth where dental floss can not reach.</li>
            <li> After the cleaning leaves fresh breath.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t laugh.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There seems to be a whole debate about whether this is good enough to replace flossing.</li>
            <li> I liked this product overall even though it was bulky</li>
            <li> It seems to do at least as good of a job as floss - and perhaps better as I just had a dental cleaning</li>
            <li> /&gt;Swivel head is useful</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as powerful as stationary models but that&#x27;s what you get with cordless.</li>
            <li> The water container is bigger that the another model of this kind.</li>
            <li> ( but when I do use it it&#x27;s fun</li>
            <li> but so far it&#x27;s been OK (almost a month of use).  </li>
            <li> The battery life isn&#x27;t long but it does do a pretty good job.</li>
            <li> actual product is pretty good, pretty useful</li>
            <li> It comes with multiple tips, which is nice.  </li>
            <li> MY mouth feels so fresh after I use my Waterpik.  </li>
            <li> Its value is well worth the cost.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> I also have a larger stand alone model which has more power, it really jets the water out with more pressure than this hand held</li>
            <li> I let the battery completely discharge through use, then fully recharge on the charger overnight for more than 12 hours.    </li>
            <li> Not as powerful as the electric water pick.  </li>
            <li> I love the waterpik and it is a complete must have item if you have braces.</li>
            <li> I want to use fresh water every time.</li>
            <li> Powerful</li>
            <li> and it rarely needs charging..  </li>
            <li> I feel that it was worth buying .</li>
            <li> If you want to push it against the teeth, then you can easily use one finger to steady it</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t worry, I will come back and adjust my review after I have tried this product and give an honest review on how well this product performs.</li>
            <li> The water flow is strong, particularly from the narrowest tip</li>
            <li> So now I rarely use it.</li>
            <li> We like this much better than the old waterpik with the wand.</li>
            <li> For me ... I would give 3 stars because it was not as powerful as I wanted.</li>
            <li> It holds 40 seconds worth of water,  and that is all you need.</li>
            <li> It is worth the effort.&lt;br /&gt;-You</li>
            <li> It will never charge up again to be useful.</li>
            <li> Although I liked the features of the Waterpik and its effectiveness, I think I will go back to Panasonic.</li>
            <li> The motor runs faster and the pump puts out a far better stream of water.  </li>
            <li> Does not seem quite as powerful as my corded one used at home, but should serve the purpose as a portable water pik.</li>
            <li> I would buy this again if it quit because I feel I&#x27;ve already gotten my monies worth from it.</li>
            <li> I got my money worth</li>
            <li> As far as I know the recipient has had no problems with this device and is pleased with it&#x27;s performance.</li>
            <li> We will see how effective it is on my next visit to the dentist.</li>
            <li> It would be nice to have a third setting for even stronger pressure.</li>
            <li> It is so much better; no messy container to fill with water-</li>
            <li> In a very short time I have come to wanting to use it every night before bed for the comfortable refreshing feeling that then accompanies me when falling to sleep.</li>
            <li> have the latest Waterpik complete</li>
            <li> *smile*</li>
            <li> I like the product and find I use it more often than the old corded style because I can take it into the shower.  </li>
            <li> compact, powerful and customizable.  </li>
            <li> It takes up no space in the bathroom, and it has a variety of useful tips.</li>
            <li> I opted for warm water and then poured some mouthwash in there -- worked terrific and my mouth felt like I&#x27;d just come from the hygienist.  </li>
            <li> I opted for warm water and then poured some mouthwash in there -- worked terrific and my mouth felt like I&#x27;d just come from the hygienist.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kinda nice, but way too big for traveling...</li>
            <li> First, I brush with toothpaste and my sonicare for the full 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li> It is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> such a nice product but</li>
            <li> I am enjoying my new handheld Waterpik very much.  </li>
            <li> It does not hold as much water and the water pressure is not quite as high as the AC units, but all is more than adequate.  </li>
            <li> I rather my have healthy strong guns and not lose teeth than to have a minor convenience.</li>
            <li> If only it was a bit more reliable and user friendly.  </li>
            <li> Great clean for hard spots</li>
            <li> There are only two pressure settings on this waterflosser, so I would advise getting the original one that has 10 settings (or however many settings it has).</li>
            <li> LOVE THE CORDLESS WATERPIK WATERFLOSSER, IT ACTUALLY MAKES FLOSSING FUN!</li>
            <li> This handy cordless water floss prove to be a very hygienic tool I use it daily to Clean my tooth</li>
            <li> The first one we had corroded fairly quickly and became unusable because it stopped charging.</li>
            <li> It took several days for me to develop a technique that allowed me to both clean my teeth comfortably and not squirt the bathroom walls!  </li>
            <li> It is okay, but I still find myself using  a dental tool such as a pick to clean between my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Personally for my teeth, I still like floss and don&#x27;t find it to be a replacement but an additional way to be sure my teeth are sqeaky clean.</li>
            <li> I used to use regular floss all the time, but this product can clean even better.</li>
            <li> Left my mouth feeling clean and healthy.  </li>
            <li> but with braces I use it more than if I didn&#x27;t have so much extra to clean around. :</li>
            <li> I refill the water chamber twice, sometimes three times, but this is no big deal; I just love the clean feeling, plus I eat a lot of fibrous veggies and fruits.  </li>
            <li> Make sure and clean it regularly like the instructions say, by running a capful of vinegar with water through the machine to keep it from clogging.</li>
            <li> It holds enough water to clean a row of teeth real quick.</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist recommended using the Water Pik for an even better daily clean &amp;  flossing.</li>
            <li> and it really leaves your mouth feeling totally clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li> The Waterpik feels really good, and my gums are healthier, particularly my one problem deep pocket.  </li>
            <li> While it is larger than I had hoped, the Waterpik Ultra puts out a powerful stream of water comperable to the full size counter top waterpiks.</li>
            <li> Very reliable, holds a charge a long time, overall great product!  </li>
            <li> What they don&#x27;t tell you, however, is that you absolutely need a small hand towel handy to catch all the dribbles as you&#x27;re learning to use this handy tool.</li>
            <li> Since my other waterflosser is a shower device, this seemed a good option.</li>
            <li> I run white vinegar through and then three more times with clear water and the unit is good as new.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of using it in the shower, as the water is already warm and no worries about the mess (the easy to read instructions suggest keeping the unit upright</li>
            <li> My tips stays right where it should.</li>
            <li> My tips stays right where it should.</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> Use your right hand to hold the unit and turn it off (your right thumb sits over the OFF switch.</li>
            <li> If you get the unit (which I still recommend) spray the brass posts with WD-40 right away</li>
            <li> The water resovoir is just about right and won&#x27;t spill if held at angles.</li>
            <li> The built-in reservoir seems to be just the right size.</li>
            <li> After all, if your going to take the time to use a waterpik, may as well do it right.  </li>
            <li> I just tested the strenght of the water pressure and noticed the leaking right away.  </li>
            <li> The tank for the water is right there on the flosser.</li>
            <li> I wish Waterpik would do this right.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I was holding it at the right angle</li>
            <li> One thing I will comment on right now though, is the water pressure.</li>
            <li> Some reviews I read questioned water pressure adequacy, but I think it&#x27;s just right.  </li>
            <li> But if you do it right, 30 seconds is enough.&lt;br</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> If I run out of water, I&#x27;m right there at the faucet</li>
            <li> I would have returned this right away.</li>
            <li> Maybe I haven&#x27;t figured out the right way to perform this...</li>
            <li> right way.\\</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s just the right amount of water in the container.  </li>
            <li> And the price is right.</li>
            <li> The unit would not charge right from the start.</li>
            <li> price was right and for dental implants this was recommended by the dentist</li>
            <li> just right&#x27;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have braces and this product cleaned out the food particles right out between my teeth.  </li>
            <li> The price was right for a handheld.</li>
            <li> it takes some practice before getting it right in the mouth.</li>
            <li> The water resivoir is just right</li>
            <li> you and right pice.a a</li>
            <li> Great pick with a large reservoir that lasts long enough to clean all my teeth and still fits under the sink!</li>
            <li> product is really useful for doing a great flossing job - there&#x27;s not much more to say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really like the clean feeling</li>
            <li> I have to fill the tank twice to clean my whole mouth.  </li>
            <li> refill is required to clean your whole mouth.</li>
            <li> Water splashing everywhere, and you have to refill the water about 4-6 times to get your whole mouth clean.  </li>
            <li> These clean your teeth and gums very well.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have any kind of battery indicator, so you have to guess at that, but it is pretty obvious when it needs to be charged.  </li>
            <li> the real problem with this model is that you cannot clean the reservoir.  </li>
            <li> It really helps keep my teeth clean since I am wearing braces now</li>
            <li> but I was hoping for a &#x27;whole mouth clean&#x27; which will require an additional 25% over the selling price of the item for something I thought I had already paid for.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even when I first started I had virtually no pain in those most sensitive areas of my gums.  </li>
            <li> You really have to make an effort to get in there with a brush and some bleach to clean it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really helps to clean out particles of food.</li>
            <li> It works well, and is very helpful to keep my teeth clean.</li>
            <li> The only drawback I found is the reservoir needs to be refilled before I am done, but this is true of most mostt portables.  </li>
            <li> This was a great little water pik!  </li>
            <li> I was able to complete the flossing with a single filling and found the cleaning to be really effective.</li>
            <li> Because I like a lower pressure pulse and my husband likes a higher, this unit is ideal, since it has a switch that offers high or low pressure.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to fill and take in the shower to use - you can then refill if you like and use a second time.</li>
            <li> Even with an Oral-B motorized brush, this waterflosser does an excellent job in cleaning between teeth down deep in crevices.</li>
            <li> As long as this is charged up, it has a good force to clean near implants or spacing between tooth.</li>
            <li> and i absolutely cann&#x27;t live without it :)...</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used and loved a conventional corded Waterpik for years.  </li>
            <li> I guess if it were a little more powerful it would be better.</li>
            <li> The Waterpick is easy and comfortable to use and it is very obvious every time I use it that it is doing its job.</li>
            <li> Not made like the home model, portable could be better designed, better than previous models.  </li>
            <li> I &amp;#34;trained&amp;#34; the battery carefully, but a greater problem is the location of the socket for the charger, which is placed where water can easily get into it.  </li>
            <li> I love being able to use right in the shower and not having to worry about a mess.  </li>
            <li> Reservoir is adequate, pressure is barely adequate (on high setting).</li>
            <li> It looks great, so I can leave it on my bathroom counter if I choose, but I usually store it under the sink.    </li>
            <li> Its pretty powerful.  </li>
            <li> second problem I have is switched over to only using waterpick instead of flossing, because on the package it claims to be more effective than flossing.  </li>
            <li> Amazing I can&#x27;t believe I went so long without using one, thank goodness</li>
            <li> I was expecting a more powerful stream, this doesn&#x27;t seem powerful enough to do anything.</li>
            <li> The container runs out of water too quickly and I have to refill once or twice.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this unless you&#x27;re using it on a T-Rex or someone with an exceptionally large mouth.</li>
            <li> Now there is a nice tight fit with the charging unit.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Not a good road to go down, unless you admire the toothless hillbilly look.</li>
            <li> The water pressure is just not there, and even when the reservoir is full, it doesn&#x27;t clean my teeth the way my old one did.  </li>
            <li> Love 99% of it,,,,wish it held just a little more water.  </li>
            <li> I usually add some Listerine in my warm water and after that my mouth feels so clean!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is also good for tight spaces and when I get some food stuck that I can&#x27;t get to, because I just pot it in, push it to on, and it gets it right</li>
            <li> However, my new condo has a fancy faucet that doesn&#x27;t fit that device.  </li>
            <li> A NEW UNIT FREE OF CHARGE, CALL THEM AT 1-800-525-2774,</li>
            <li> it right in the shower and fill it up every morning.&lt;br /&gt;Use hot water</li>
            <li> Replaced totally the good old dental floss by this device.  </li>
            <li> working great for the last 7 years!!!!!!!!!!e WP-360 and about the same pressure as the Panasonic model.</li>
            <li> I used the flosser just about everyday, once a day for about six months before my regular cleaning, the cleaning was the best cleaning I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> The 450 is great as the reservoir is larger and charge last longer.  </li>
            <li> Hydrofloss makes a more powerful, larger resevoir unit but has issues during trips (parts break).  </li>
            <li> (TIPS ALSO MORE POWERFUL) in which case I would have gotten a different model.</li>
            <li> You should be able to snap out the bottom of the reservoir in order to thoroughly dry it after each use, or else Waterpik should provide a flexible brush that can be pushed into the reservoir to clean it</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended the waterpik for my daily dental care, so I bought one for myself and I liked it so much I bought one for my husband</li>
            <li> So far good, will see how well it is working when I go back for a check up.  </li>
            <li> It works beautifully in the beginning and then the charge doesn&#x27;t last as long as it should, and then it dies.  </li>
            <li> I previously had a portable Panasonic, which I loved, but after a year the plastic started creating an odor.  </li>
            <li> I discarded the unit and replaced it with a standard Interplak (non-rechargable) - so far, so good.</li>
            <li> probably not a serious issue if you&#x27;re keeping them clean, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t contact Waterpik because frankly my time is worth more than sitting on the phone or packing the thing up and sending it back.  </li>
            <li> does a great job and has multiple tips for different uses.</li>
            <li> It has 2 settings (use the lighter one if you are new to water piks!!!)</li>
            <li> I use it on high, and if that won&#x27;t clean your teeth</li>
            <li> /&gt;The higher settings can almost be painful, so be sure to start it on the lower settings until you find what suits you best.</li>
            <li> It is easily refilled if it runs out of water, so feel free to take as long as you like.</li>
            <li> I use the full power setting, and it seems to have enough power with a fairly strong jet.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I think this is a good product for the lazy and those mildly concerned about their dental health.</li>
            <li> Very Very clunky item.  </li>
            <li> He said flossing alone would not help very much and to start using the Water Pik.  </li>
            <li> He likes it very much.</li>
            <li> very very convenient.</li>
            <li> The fact that it&#x27;s portable is very, very convenient.  </li>
            <li> With single full charge, you will be able to use it for about 40 tull-tank usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But, I promptly ordered a new one as I really am convinced that using this daily has improved the health of my gums (and my dentist told me my gums looked really good).  </li>
            <li> So far, it works just fine.</li>
            <li> and so far it works fine.  </li>
            <li> A telephone call to Waterpik was answered promptly, and a friendly agent sent me a new unit.</li>
            <li> They both worked great, but died after a few years of steady use.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to fill and, if you leave the stopper open, it dries out quickly.  </li>
            <li> Even with a full charge and on high pressure it won&#x27;t penetrate gums or between teeth.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone because flossing really is important and this makes it not so much of a chore.</li>
            <li> so it is sometimes hard to keep in position to spray properly, the pressure is okay for somebody who has sensitive gums, which waterpiks are great for, but I doubt the high setting on this are more than a 5 or 6 on the ultra model (which goes up to 10.)</li>
            <li> The company was kind enough to replace it for free, the second time I needed a new cord because the original didnt charge the thing.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I am pretty happy with this product and feel that it is worth getting a little wet to have good gum health.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I felt like I needed it to really clean around the crowns on new dental implants</li>
            <li> Too much pressure!</li>
            <li> The waterpik waterflosser is exactly what i wanted.  </li>
            <li> I have the big Waterpic and it just had a lot stronger water jet, which did a better job of cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> It works ok but my recollection of the waterpik from 20 years ago was much different.</li>
            <li> I will most likely put the waterpik in the Goodwill bin.</li>
            <li> would make them more reliable and last a lot longer.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it, there was a lot of blood because of the plaque being dislodged...</li>
            <li> My first one lasted for 3 months, then it wouldn&#x27;t take a charge anymore.</li>
            <li> My first one lasted one year before it stopped charging - I suspect the battery got corroded from water getting into it.  </li>
            <li> Price is ~70% higher than the</li>
            <li> It has two settings and is way better then the WP-360 and about the same pressure as the Panasonic model.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different ways of holding it</li>
            <li> I found this to be really convenient and fun to use.  </li>
            <li> I first brush and then use the pik</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to return this and try the larger counter top size.</li>
            <li> This is my first Waterpik</li>
            <li> This thing feels like a sand blaster the first time.</li>
            <li> If you need to refill it, flip the cap open and put in more hot water.</li>
            <li> I should have read the reviews first.</li>
            <li> I bought this model and the Ultra regular; that was OK</li>
            <li> Price is ~70% higher than the WP-360   </li>
            <li> It has two settings and is way better then the WP-360 and about the same pressure as the Panasonic model.</li>
            <li> You couldn&#x27;t possibly need more pressure.      </li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t use this as a floss replacement -- I use this before I floss, and I find that it makes flossing much easier and rarely does anything come out on the floss).</li>
            <li> The regular model does a much better job.</li>
            <li> You can buy a replacement reservoir for about $11  - not very cost effective.</li>
            <li> The only imporovement would be if it held more water.</li>
            <li> Getting the front surfaces of your teeth are fairly easy and not real messy but the inside surfaces are another story all together.  </li>
            <li> Thanks WaterPik!    JTB</li>
            <li> The plug gets really hot, but the flosser won&#x27;t charge even after 2 days of being plugged in.  </li>
            <li> and I was the first to use it.</li>
            <li> I was in Europe for 2 weeks and flossed twice a day most days and the battery still had some power when I got back.</li>
            <li> is the only redeeming feature)</li>
            <li> This has a bigger tank to hold more water &amp; it is cordless.  </li>
            <li> Most of my travels take me overseas where 110v is not the standard but 220v.  </li>
            <li> I was concerned about leaks developing, as the plug design seemed pretty flimsy.    </li>
            <li> Stopped working after the first week</li>
            <li> Does exactly what I had hoped for.  </li>
            <li> Much funner than flossing!</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with this Waterpik.  </li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li> This seems to do exactly what it is supposed to do.  </li>
            <li> When first started using it-</li>
            <li> The instructions seems to say you only need to do outside/in - but it seems to be more thorough doing both.  </li>
            <li> Hope WaterPik does a better job next time.....</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Might be pretty loud for some (electric toothbrush sound level)&lt;br</li>
            <li> More than enough to do the job.  </li>
            <li> First using it in a more standard situation and now with braces.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used numerous waterpiks that were corded, and were much better.  </li>
            <li> I purchased my WP-455W, in Orlando, FL @ Wallmart on a vacation trip as I left my counter top unit at home and needed one as a vacation back-up.  </li>
            <li> To compare with the regular waterflosser with cord, it is just OK level.</li>
            <li> and see what they are willing to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even putting hot glue or tape to seal the bottom shut didnt work.</li>
            <li> The attached tank holds enough water for me to do the top of my mouth.   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a user of the counter-top Waterpik, which I love, but this travel doesn&#x27;t do the same job.</li>
            <li> First of all, the Waterpik is a MUST if you have dental braces, as I do.</li>
            <li> But even when my braces are removed I will continue to use this product, as it really gives your teeth  a powerful and thorough cleaning before brushing.  </li>
            <li> This is what I needed the first time</li>
            <li> Once for top outer, another tank for top inner, then the same on the bottom.  </li>
            <li> Both are pretty noisy and your going to get water all over the place.  </li>
            <li> the appliance does exactly what it should do.</li>
            <li> FAST SHIPPING!  </li>
            <li> I bought my first waterflosser in August this year.</li>
            <li> OK, lotsa fluid on yer hand &amp; the machine.</li>
            <li> I really like it a lot!</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon and Waterpik!</li>
            <li> My gut feeling tells me that most will do the same.</li>
            <li> The Hydrofloss is much larger than the Pik, so it takes up more room on the vanity, and it has a cord.</li>
            <li> What, exactly, is the purpose of this product?</li>
            <li> the water flosser actually made them feel a bit better :</li>
            <li> When I first tried this item, it did not seem that it was working that</li>
            <li> The first couple of times you may want to use this in the shower until you get used to it.  </li>
            <li> Immediately after using the Water Pik Waterflosser Cordless Plus for the first time, I used string floss to see if anything had been missed, and surprise --</li>
            <li> and I actually make sure my sink is spotless so I can see the results.    </li>
            <li> , I wonder why Waterpik didn&#x27;t do this in the first place?  </li>
            <li> sure enough, one of the prong had water corrosion.</li>
            <li> I love the waterpik and use it daily.  </li>
            <li> I first used WaterPik as a teenager when I had braces.</li>
            <li> Price is ~70% higher than the</li>
            <li> This was my first water pik</li>
            <li> I went ahead,ordered one and gave it a whirl and used it twice today for the first time.  </li>
            <li> The first one I bought didn&#x27;t work and needed to be returned.  </li>
            <li> So, thinking it might work OK anyhow, I settled for one of these Water Pik Watterflosser cordless plus hand-held rechargeable units.  </li>
            <li> ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can swish water around my mouth with more force than the low setting generates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After the two weeks of using it, I went to my 6-month checkup and didn&#x27;t say anything at first.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powerful and really gets everything out from between your teeth.</li>
            <li> I really like it!  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even have to tell her that I tried first Amazon on Sunday who advised me to call Waterpik first in order to get this resolved.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even have to tell her that I tried first Amazon on Sunday who advised me to call Waterpik first in order to get this resolved.</li>
            <li> Evidently I have had this 2013.</li>
            <li> I did prefer the water pic as I felt I had more flexibility of working specific areas.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> At first this unit would stay charged for about a week.</li>
            <li> It seems to hold more water than his last one.</li>
            <li> None have lasted a year, even though I have followed the charging directions exactly.  </li>
            <li> I love my regular waterflosser</li>
            <li> My first order did not arrive after 3 weeks of waiting.</li>
            <li> First cleaning of the lower jaw in 2 years.</li>
            <li> The first one lasted about 5 months</li>
            <li> the product did not funtion when used it the first time it was used for 2 to 3 mintutes  </li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat it ;-)</li>
            <li> Protips for a first timer: fill it before every use, or you will run out.</li>
            <li> This product replaces the need for flossing (a function that never held much charm for me!).  </li>
            <li> the company would be willing to refund or issue a warranty that might improve my review, but I could not figure out how to contact the seller.</li>
            <li> This flosser no longer holds a charge, when first purchased I would charge it maybe every two weeks</li>
            <li> The first one lasted over three years, and then the battery just stopped fully recharging.</li>
            <li> First time the water went all over the bathroom, including in my ear.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think it will last more than one year, time will tell.</li>
            <li> me obsess now with oral cleaning ...and takes no time at all for 100% better results than the regular floss.</li>
            <li> The most recent flosser gave out after a month.</li>
            <li> I have been a satisfied user of the regular Waterpik for years, so decided to get the cordless for \\&quot;travel\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> The first was 10 days trip.</li>
            <li> My first waterpik cordless lost its power strength after about 6 months.</li>
            <li> this waterflosser works pretty well.</li>
            <li> Thanks!  </li>
            <li> so reviews from the dentist on the state of my gums and pockets, and had to have deep scaling done twice in 3 years, ON TOP OF getting cleanings</li>
            <li> The corded version is way, way, way better and the newest one is about the same price as the handheld.</li>
            <li> My first hand held lasted one year.</li>
            <li> First, there was an issue with charging.  </li>
            <li> It took some getting used to when I first started with this device.  </li>
            <li> Okay, I sent it back and had another one sent.</li>
            <li> very convenient and works well!</li>
            <li> Much better than traditional floss.  </li>
            <li> there&#x27;s no issues at all but the first time....  </li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says it does</li>
            <li> I have made my self bleed a bit once, but it was most likely a bit of plaque build up &amp;</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a bit pricey, but if you can seem to reach a spot in your mouth, this will most likely do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so you simply do use it more.</li>
            <li> this is exactly what I wanted in a product.  </li>
            <li> and they tried to say it was something I did, like leave it on the sink counter while taking hot showers</li>
            <li> I replaced it with the larger non-portable waterpik which I&#x27;ve had for a couple years and is so much more convenient.</li>
            <li> For people who have debris that gets caught in the very back and also this does a better job of removing plaque below the gum line than flossing.  </li>
            <li> This second generation model is much better than the first.</li>
            <li> It sits on the shelf in the shower ready to use every morning!</li>
            <li> It stopped working after the first couple uses.</li>
            <li> Reservoir could be larger, but satisfied.</li>
            <li> I use it more often - although not often enough -</li>
            <li> would be better if it came with a travel bag for the different heads.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is that I wish the resevoir had about 30% more capacity.</li>
            <li> Better for the gums than standard flissing.  </li>
            <li> You get used to the clunkyness..which it is, at first.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am pleased with the purchase although I have yet to see if the container is removable for cleaning.</li>
            <li> is my first experience with the hand held battery powered unit.  </li>
            <li> I  also love the low price on the attachments.</li>
            <li> Much, much better than regular floss.</li>
            <li> The first one we bought had the motor seize up</li>
            <li> The Waterpik Waterflosser Cordless PLUS has been exactly what we needed.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how much better it cleaned my teeth than just regular flossing.  </li>
            <li> Be warned - at first you will squirt water everywhere.  </li>
            <li> battery on the first one lasted 10 months.  </li>
            <li> This pic can be used away from the electric socket as most pics have short cords.  </li>
            <li> It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.  </li>
            <li> Kinda funny..</li>
            <li> I purchased it from Costco along with the wired version of the unit and took this one for my overseas trip without checking it first.  </li>
            <li> I hope it is not designed in US or it will put US engineering in really shame!  </li>
            <li> and I sure like the smaller footprint on my counter.  </li>
            <li> First time I used it, the water was plashing all over my T-shirt.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> First it says &amp;#34;..</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t look like it&#x27;s worth so much.</li>
            <li> &quot; filling was easier as the fill opening was at the top and larger.  </li>
            <li> Amazon, indicate in your product description if the item can only use 110 volts, most of this world uses 240.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> I have a suggestion though for the manufacturer:  an indication light that there is a full charge, or low battery.  </li>
            <li> However, just over a year later, the battery refuses to accept charge at all any more.  </li>
            <li> maximize the capacity and life of the rechargeable batteries, the unit should be charged for 24 hours before the first use.  </li>
            <li> will add that the customer service at Waterpik is STELLAR.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m going to use it only until I buy a better model.  </li>
            <li> If the reservoir had been any bigger, the unit would have weight and balance issues, so I feel satisfied with the design.</li>
            <li> For those who are buying your first Waterpik, it is a must-have for a clean-feeling mouth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a recent convert, using it since my husband got one for use with his braces, and I love it.</li>
            <li> Yes, I do not like it despite the fact that -- when it was working -- it did exactly what it was supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Next one I had for more than 2 years</li>
            <li> The first lasted 2 years.</li>
            <li> After reading that review, I checked the terminals on my unit and sure enough they were corroded.</li>
            <li> I always kept the first unit connected to the charger when not in use.</li>
            <li> Having borne the expense of deep cleaning, I am glad I have it in my dental toolkit.</li>
            <li> I used my waterpik for the first time today.</li>
            <li> I was pretty dissapointed and</li>
            <li> it really does pay off!</li>
            <li> but they don&#x27;t  last more then a yr.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t see how they could possibly work better.  </li>
            <li> I am sure this one will do the same because it looks like that wasn&#x27;t taken care of in this product either.  </li>
            <li> But this product does  work the same and maybe even better.</li>
            <li> This was not the first time I&#x27;ve purchased this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used one before, so this is my first experience.  </li>
            <li> A very inexpensive method to prevent THAT madness!  </li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t - so do find appropriate ways to carry especially the tips.</li>
            <li> I got this larger model WP-450 because the warrantee is better, suggesting that this larger one is better.  </li>
            <li> Bought this on recommendation of ortho when son first got his braces.  </li>
            <li> I will know more on my next dental checkup and cleaning.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately not on long-lasting product.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s better to buy bigger item.</li>
            <li> Like many others, I thought this would replace my countertop unit, which finally gave out after 20 years.  </li>
            <li> no, sorry, it just doesn&#x27;t cut it.  </li>
            <li> Finally, like many before me, I find that the tips just rotate all by themselves.  </li>
            <li> So, I use the first level.</li>
            <li> On the more recent one, the two speeds became one speed within weeks.  </li>
            <li> Charge last long and does a great cleaning job on my teeth.</li>
            <li> This view was changed as soon as I tried it for the first time.</li>
            <li> Many different tips to choose from.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s pretty horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My gums are in better shape after only ten days of use than they have been in many years.  </li>
            <li> quality product... better than the big bulky one they sell with a cord</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the 3rd one I&#x27;ve bought because the battery doesn&#x27;t hold up much more than a year or so,  </li>
            <li> I love waterpiks and use it daily.  </li>
            <li> I hope that he likes it as much as I do!</li>
            <li> I rinsed out the inside with hot water and used a brush to get the mold out of all the nooks and crannies.</li>
            <li> I first brought it.</li>
            <li> My favorite is still the standard tip</li>
            <li> but I love it for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> It works exactly as promised.</li>
            <li> This is the third Waterpik Cordless Waterflosser I have owned and love the product.  </li>
            <li> They flow water deep into the gum line to promote healthy gums.</li>
            <li> I had a shower one prior to this, but this one is much better.  </li>
            <li> I suppose they&#x27;re compensating dentists for recommending it, but n one is compensating me for the cost of sending it back. :)</li>
            <li> I do wish there was a light showing when it is completely recharged.</li>
            <li> Because the picture shows exactly what I get and because of that I recomend this product and this saler for everyone.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because of the ease of use of this relative to flossing, I am &amp;#34;flossing&amp;#34; more than I would with the string.</li>
            <li> It is a good portable solution to an otherwise messy job.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts a good week before needing a recharge, which I do overnight, and its ready for action the next day.</li>
            <li> However, a few were really good</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to stay full through a week&#x27;s worth of teeth cleaning, but emptying before one brushing was complete was not acceptable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Had this for a few years and loved it.</li>
            <li> Each full charge is good for at least a week of once-a-day use...</li>
            <li> It is nice that it can be used away from an electrical outlet; once I even used it to clean a spot in my toilet, holding it several feet away, of course (it did exactly what I wanted it to do!).  </li>
            <li> will have about 30 seconds before the unit runs dry, but it refills very easily.</li>
            <li> Strong enough to do a good rinsing job and soft enough to not hurt the gums.  </li>
            <li> This brand is not as powerful in its flow and has a small resevoir but will do ok and is easy to pack for travel.</li>
            <li> Waterpik was courteous enough to send me a new unit.</li>
            <li> Worked as advertised, easy to use and clean, but does not hold a charge for very long.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not like my electric toothbrush where you have time to kind of focus on each tooth, since this one has a limited reservoir, and it runs out pretty fast, plus your mouth fills up with water</li>

            <li> My gum health has greatly improved per my hygenist and my teeth are much less temperature sensitive.</li>
            <li> Since my sister had experienced far less gum inflammation using a water pik, I purchased one.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick, painless, effective and adds just a few minutes to the oral health routine, for (according to all the research I could find on it)</li>

            <li> The corded replacement works just fine, &amp; if the hose was just a little longer, I&#x27;d be able to use it in my bathroom.  </li>
            <li> But it vibrates so much that it won&#x27;t do the job right.  </li>
            <li> but that really isn&#x27;t a problem since I&#x27;m right at the faucet.  </li>
            <li> By design it seems that a user could easily move his/her thumb slightly to rotate the spout to either left or right and thereby more accurately cover all areas of the inside gums and teeth.  </li>
            <li> I had to return the Waterpik Waterflosser because the high-pitched sound was too much for my sensitive ears!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve been using it for a week and only just read the complete info and its even better now!  </li>
            <li> I add some Listerine with warm water leaving an extra actual and clean feeling.</li>
            <li> does the job as expected, I would recommend this to anyone who wants to get a deeper clean and healthy teeth</li>
            <li> This product makes quick work of what would normally be a 10 minute process.</li>
            <li> She said this portable unit is good for just taking it in the shower and blast away at your teeth while you shower and that way it doesn&#x27;t make a mess all over the sink!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use it on low pressure as the high pressure should have been more useful.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly as described in the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> but I often fill it a second time to spend more time in certain problem areas I have.  </li>
            <li> the huge benefit of far superior oral hygiene, for us lazy flossers out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the huge benefit of far superior oral hygiene, for us lazy flossers out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> user friendly as far as ergonomic design.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is excellent for individual who have a hard time flossing or getting in between teeth.</li>
            <li> It did take a couple tries to get the right momentum with the water flossing process, but now it is a very important step in my oral hygiene.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve replaced the ni-mh battery in mine with a cheap new ni-mh battery from China, removed the diode from the circuit, and replaced the charger with a cheap universal ni-mh charger from China.</li>
            <li> I suppose this is comfortable for some people, but all I experienced was an uncomfortable stream of water into my mouth, without any noticeable pressure into or between teeth.</li>
            <li> The resevoir is easy to fill and remove, but there&#x27;s no way to empty and clean it.</li>
            <li> I am able to hit my upper and lower teeth front and back before the reservoir runs out and if I do run out the reservoir really easy to refill.</li>
            <li> Having used my girlfriend&#x27;s platinum model, and now owning the classic myself, I was not crazy about the cordless model.</li>
            <li> It might be useful for the mfgr to find a clever, compact way of containing the optional 2 or 3 nozzles.  </li>
            <li> Maybe, but it was so easy to stick it in the old unit&#x27;s closed storage area when you inverted the top.</li>
            <li> Using it is easy enough, but that&#x27;s the only redeeming aspect.</li>
            <li> It cleans very nicely, easy to use and has good power, however, after only a few months, it quit charging.</li>
            <li> He has figured out how to work it, so if the product is only half as effective as string then I am about 10X better off in</li>
            <li> I simply plug it in at night every couple of days and I am good to go the next day.</li>
            <li> It really blasts away food debris much better than just brushing or using regular dental floss.  </li>
            <li> such that you need several refills to do a good cleaning.   </li>
            <li> My secondary reason for giving it a great rating is that the temporary issue notwithstanding, the product works very well.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I need to fill the water reservoir a second time I am having such a good time.  </li>
            <li> Does a good job and holds a charge so daily recharging is not necessary.  </li>
            <li> If it doesn&#x27;t get fixed, I won&#x27;t be giving Waterpik my money again, since this is obviously a design flaw, and they should own up to the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does a good enough job on flossing, with the annoyance of using actual floss.</li>
            <li> This tells me that my gums really are getting stimulated and healthy from regular use of the waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Your child wants to come into the bathroom and you&#x27;re enjoying 45 seconds of peace and quiet?</li>
            <li> so I was looking for a better, quicker way to accomplish some good oral hygiene -- basically a cheat for being a lousy flosser....</li>
            <li> The low pressure setting is gentler than others I have used which is nice for people with sensitive gums.  </li>
            <li> those who complain about battery - the instructions clearly say that the device needs to be charged for a full day before first use.</li>
            <li> The product was great at first, but if you have weak gums, this should not be your first answer to healing your gums.</li>
            <li> Finally I have found a way to keep my teeth clean when on the road!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The only reason I got the cordless is to be able to easily store it, I have a little cabinet where I store all my dental stuff and the corded one wouldn&#x27;t fit there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wish it could hold more water, but it good for a quick rinse or a tough spot that only a pick can get to.  </li>
            <li> ...loved the old one, so why change right!  </li>
            <li> Although this is probably a good waterpik, it feels to me like there is very little pressure.</li>
            <li> me, a full water tank is about 35 seconds more or less.</li>
            <li> The other reviews are right, the water reservoir is too small, but for travel this is great, I don&#x27;t mind refilling a couple of times!  </li>
            <li> The positive reviews that answer all the negatives are pretty much dead-on, folks, and you can buy this in confidence.</li>
            <li> This one is powerful and a pleasure to use, especially since I noticed a great improvement in gum &amp;#34;pockets&amp;#34; within a few days.  </li>
            <li> -- I kind of doubted that it would be able to get the trapped food particles out from between my crooked teeth as well as string floss does.  </li>
            <li> And its really lost a lot of power since when I first got it.</li>
            <li> There is a different one with a larger reservoir and it has more speed options available.  </li>
            <li> When I first got it I thought it was a bit bulky and didn&#x27;t hold much water.</li>
            <li> Thanks much, Comfort &amp; Warmth!</li>
            <li> Works really well when you floss first.</li>
            <li> The first one worked very well until it quit (6 months).</li>
            <li> No, but it goes well with flossing or is a good stand-in.e units in the past.</li>
            <li> Waterpik usually puts out a good product but this one missed the mark.</li>
            <li> go anywhere, small, good power.&lt;br</li>
            <li> tradeoff is that the water reservoir is small and to do a really good job, you&#x27;ll have to refill it once or twice depending upon how thorough you are.  </li>
            <li> Has good battery life and a small foot print on the vanity.</li>
            <li> Its good for a once over and usually needs to be refilled to finish the job.</li>
            <li> Firstly, there is no indicator anywhere that tells you how much charge is left; basically you have to depend on your ability to sense a decrease in power as it steadily un-charges over many days, which is akin to watching grass grow.</li>
            <li> Leaves a fresh clean feeling, even after electric toothbrush and traditional flossing.</li>
            <li> The jet is powerful enough to clean between teeth and massage the gums.</li>
            <li> Those who take their teeth more seriously than I do should probably invest in a table-top flosser with more power.</li>
            <li> It seemed the older more simple units lasted longer.  </li>
            <li> I have had extensive peridontal work done and this item works even better than my older waterpic  </li>
            <li> The high power setting is sufficient for cleaning with any of the standard piks; I do not need any more power.</li>
            <li> Just sounds like its working pretty hard to delivery its good pressure.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use and the low pressure has been strong enough for me so far.  </li>
            <li> It took a little getting used to, but now I love it!</li>
            <li> After a 24 hour charge it was like a new unit, providing a weeks worth of use</li>
            <li> Excellent for general flossing, especially if you have tight spaces between teeth, irregular spacing, or implants.  </li>
            <li> It would have been better if Water-Pik had provided some sort of plug/barrier to keep water out of the plug-in cavity, or, better yet if they had used an induction-charge system with no contact points or pins as do many electric toothbrushes and other devices (either would make the product slightly more expensive, the later more so, but it would be well worth the extra dollar or</li>
            <li> This is not a big deal -- it&#x27;s so easy to refill, takes about 10 seconds.  </li>
            <li> Will hold a charge for over two weeks and that makes it easy to store for daily use.</li>
            <li> Overall, we are very pleased with this flosser and would buy another if our current unit ever needed to be replaced.</li>
            <li> I especially like the flexible gumline tip, and the easy fill.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is easy to use and it comes with 4 different heads.  </li>
            <li> The only drawback I found is that the setting of the pick turns too easily and away from the direction one intends.</li>
            <li> The included instructions are simple and easy to understand.</li>
            <li> Because this unit is so easy to use, I now use it daily as my dentist recommends.</li>
            <li> I easily go a week between charges and do it only as a precaution.  </li>
            <li> I have a feeling it will do fine for the gum line, but not sure water pressure alone is good enough for inbetween teeth.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t seem to be reparable and I sure can&#x27;t figure out a way to keep them dry.</li>
            <li> Cleaning the unit itself is simple and charging is as easy as plugging it in overnight.     </li>
            <li> I find that the unit lasts about one year before it starts to lose power and becomes less effective.</li>
            <li> How much water does it use bcoz of horizontal filling - 90-95% (pretty much all water can be used)&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the disadvantage of a smaller, portable unit that is easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> Easy grip simple to use.  </li>
            <li> The blue plastic tank comes off easily</li>
            <li> and this is a lot smaller and easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> My grandson has one and it looked so easy to use, and found out that my dentist recommended one, so I ordered it and some extra tips.  </li>
            <li> I had to send the first unit back because it wouldn&#x27;t fit any of the included tips.  </li>
            <li> I checked for clogs, battery charge, etc to find and easy fix, but it seems the pump simply lost</li>
            <li> Still takes up some countertop space but is easy enough to tuck in a drawer.</li>
            <li> I make sure I dry it thoroughly after use and blow out any residual water in the recessed plug-in spot on the device.  </li>
            <li> I had the same problem but noticed that the plug to the flossed would slide on too easily.  </li>
            <li> Once I get more used to it I will switch back to the normal tip.</li>
            <li> This streamline waterpik does the job with good pressure, long lasting charge and it doesn&#x27;t clutter up the counter.</li>
            <li> Strongly recommend this to people who care about their oral and overall health.</li>
            <li> It provides a strong jet of water even on low pressure setting which I use.</li>
            <li> On low pressure, it was strong and even stung my gums a couple times.</li>
            <li> The second one was just as strong when it went out.</li>
            <li> although the stream is not as strong as the larger model, the cordless suits my purposes.  </li>
            <li> All in all, it&#x27;s a small price to pay for a nice smile.</li>
            <li> This is a great product but it breaks down after 7 months and you only have one month to return it.  </li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend it for anyone that has permanent bridges or capped teeth.</li>
            <li> However, I found it to be quite large and cumbersome</li>
            <li> This product certainly does the trick.</li>
            <li> It is certainly a convenient waterpick design.  </li>
            <li> If you do, buy the countertop unit with the large water container.    </li>
            <li> I had a large Waterpik flosser before but did not like the coiled water tube.  </li>
            <li> The AC powered unit had a large removable water tank and a spring loaded coiled semi-flexible hose connecting to the hand wand.  </li>
            <li> It is somewhat large</li>
            <li> and a large container for water.</li>
            <li> You have to hold it at a certain angle when the water level drops.  </li>
            <li> As a guy with LARGE hands...</li>
            <li> Now that I can&#x27;t live without it, the battery died!!</li>
            <li> Amazing what even the sonicare toothbrush can mess.</li>
            <li> If the water tank was larger, it would make it even less handy, so the water tank is fine.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this thing for a few months and love it!</li>
            <li> True the regular style has a larger tank and more pressure settings, but this cordless model serves the purpose for me, for now.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Believe this product to be good but had to return it as voltage is not suitable for Australia (240 Volts).</li>
            <li> When the product works, it&#x27;s great, though I&#x27;ve only had this unit for less than four weeks and the motor makes a lot of noise, though isn&#x27;t pushing out water.&lt;br</li>
            <li> would recommend this instrument to anyone who wants to ensure effective plaque removal, healthier gums therefore the need for less dental work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I make sure to dry out the connection site with compressed air and really push the charger in</li>
            <li> They still haven&#x27;t fixed the design flaw that diminishes battery life much too quickly.</li>
            <li> and I was quite impressed with the gentle pulsing action (for such a small unit)</li>
            <li> very loud and you have to fill it several times, should have done more research regarding this</li>
            <li> I originally reviewed this item as a 5-star item, but that was back in September 2011 when I first bought it.  </li>
            <li> It worked fine and then suddenly stopped working at all!</li>
            <li> Finally had my fill; I threw it out and bought a corded-type waterpik which works fine.    </li>
            <li> After one month of daily use it works fine.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li> Unlike the ones that attach to your faucet you can mix in a little mouthwash, which is nice</li>
            <li> However, the technique for containing that nice forceful water jet over your sink will require a little practice.</li>
            <li> until you are a master Waterpik user, keep that glass cleaner in full supply as the over-spray will attack your mirror like no other.</li>
            <li> First, let me say that this unit does what a Waterpik should do: clean between the teeth and under the gums, especially with gingivitis.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice little product, and it works very well.  </li>
            <li> It could be a little more powerful.</li>
            <li> The product is a little bulky in your hand (and a bit more messy than I expected).However, it does a good job flossing the teeth.</li>
            <li> Well, I sure don&#x27;t get the bad reviews of this great dental hygiene booster.  </li>
            <li> Since they are very close together, this is real progress for me and much appreciated.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get the food properly out of your teeth and anyone who says it does probably has huge gaping spaces between their teeth.</li>
            <li> It works great and shoots out water with enough power to get out trapped food after brushing.  </li>
            <li> I wish Waterpik would get it together and make a charging system more like the Sonicare products, which are a closed charging system and they hold a charge much longer.  </li>
            <li> I feel they make a huge difference for flossing around my caps, especially the front of the caps where you can&#x27;t really floss</li>
            <li> this unit has a redesigned plug-in for the charger cord end to fit into the unit and a larger water tank...excellent unit.</li>
            <li> Really?</li>
            <li> Really?  </li>
            <li> This device is very helpful during travel time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very convient and works very well.  </li>
            <li> I much prefer using the cordless waterpik to flossing with floss.  </li>
            <li> Much tidier on the bathroom counter.  </li>
            <li> I really like the cordless</li>
            <li> Really like the charging stand with nothing to remove.</li>
            <li> I expected more power.</li>
            <li> Very bulky.</li>
            <li> I have a bulky Interplak that really removes debris.  </li>
            <li> Very prompt shipping.  </li>
            <li> this water pik get things that brushing misses, and i brush really well.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Thanks a lot for it being here before Christmas</li>
            <li> You think that your electric toothbrush really cleans your teeth until you use the Waterpik.</li>
            <li> Since I got my wp450, I use it every day, and my visits are much happier.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I really like the Waterpik...</li>
            <li> \\&quot;They are really hammering derp product.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let</li>
            <li> think that the problem is that these days people do not take the time to complain to the Company because they feel that, even if they do, no one really cares.  </li>
            <li> The product works very well, as advertised by the manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;Try</li>
            <li> You need to refill the water tank twice to do your whole mouth.</li>
            <li> A lot of people might find they need to stick to the gentle setting.</li>
            <li> The item works very well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve taken extra care with this one to ensure that the connection for the recharger remained free from corrosion or build up of gunk.  </li>
            <li> The Waterpik Waterflosser does what it&#x27;s supposed to do really well.</li>
            <li> Much faster than dental tape.</li>
            <li> if even that, goes trough way too fast.</li>
            <li> but it really does the job of cleaning between the teeth before you brush.  </li>
            <li> More than I expected.</li>
            <li> Very helpful.</li>
            <li> But after couple of uses, you will get used to how to handle it, and it does the job quite well, cleaning up the gumlines and flosses out food debris from your teeth very efficiently.</li>
            <li> In all, it does the job very well.</li>
            <li> The Waterpik makes me feel that much cleaner and refreshed.  </li>
            <li> Almost no loss of power until the batteries are ready to quit.  </li>
            <li> I really need this thing</li>
            <li> I found that the \\&quot;AdaptaPlug\\&quot; connector system available at Radio Shack has the same pin diameter and pin spacing.</li>
            <li> Your patience is greatly appreciated and we apologize for the inconvenience.    </li>
            <li> The power cord is also detachable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For around $40-$50, I guess you really can&#x27;t complain with this unit.</li>
            <li> Why companies can&#x27;t put together an item like this with components that have semblance of a reasonable life-cycle is beyond me.</li>
            <li> and I really missed it.</li>
            <li> The outside, the pik itself, and the tank are easy enough to keep clean, but the inside of the pumper is not.  </li>
            <li> I really have to get the water out after everyuse.</li>
            <li> but I really would recommend the Waterpik to everyone.</li>
            <li> dollars then it would have been a reasonable product for the price, but $45 is too much.</li>
            <li> If someone wants to try - ignore all the complainers and try this.  </li>
            <li> I use this portable unit and &amp;#34;flush a whole meal&amp;#34; out from under my gums and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than I expected for a cordless.  </li>
            <li> Of course it doesn&#x27;t hold much water -</li>
            <li> Now, my wife wants one also; I&#x27;ll be buying the combo pack that includes both a tabletop and this one.</li>
            <li> Once, you catch-on, it works very well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Secondly, the unit lacks power even on the intense setting.</li>
            <li> It is much easier to control the stream of water and keep it from spraying all over the bathroom.</li>
            <li> I made sure that the front of the unit was properly closed.  </li>
            <li> Too much pressure for me, even in the lowest setting.  </li>
            <li> Runs out of water too fast.  </li>
            <li> well since I expected the power of the water stream to be more pronounced.  </li>
            <li> This is very thorough, and painless.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product on the advice of a dentist and could really prove that it works.</li>
            <li> And since you can&#x27;t replace the batteries in the unit, the whole thing is going into the trash.  </li>
            <li> water jet is very week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what WaterPik would evolve into if they really cared about quality.</li>
            <li> you realise how much you needed</li>
            <li> I really like the Waterpik Waterflosser.  </li>
            <li> Takes too much time with all the refilling.</li>
            <li> I cleaned up my bathroom, and not knowing what the charger was in my cleaning frenzy (because I really didn&#x27;t use it often)</li>
            <li> and I might not use as much water though.</li>
            <li> It is more noisy than I expected.  </li>
            <li> Versatile with 4 tips supplied, travel ready, and charge lasts a week for me.  </li>
            <li> This thing really works very well.  </li>
            <li> I use daily and enjoy the gum massage while cleaning my teeth,</li>
            <li> It is easier for me than using dental floss - and much faster to use.</li>
            <li> I really like to travel, but...  </li>
            <li> In my opinion portable items must be capable to work everywhere, like you cellphone, laptop, e-razor else advantages of portability are vanishing.  </li>
            <li> The electrical inlet and the water chamber are very close and water from flossing runs very close to the inlet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am not used to floss my teeth, and this product make flossing much easier and efficient.</li>
            <li> The whole idea is to get the water to the gumline.</li>
            <li> I have to fill water four times to cover the whole mouth.  </li>
            <li> The whole idea of water jet is even doubtable.</li>
            <li> They really ought to try using this thing before even going into production.  </li>
            <li> When I say it really works, I have proof.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are generally very close together</li>
            <li> and my gums looked much healthier.  </li>
            <li> and it really doesn&#x27;t need it even then.  </li>
            <li> This is SO much easier.</li>
            <li> I found this item very inadequate.  </li>
            <li> It works very well, and my dental checks have improved since using them.</li>
            <li> My check-ups have been much improved.  </li>
            <li> I really like it.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping...</li>
            <li> there is a known issue with the charging contacts that really makes charging fail.&lt;br /&gt;Why</li>
            <li> great for when I am too tired to manually floss my</li>
            <li> No pressure after 1 month of use&lt;br /&gt;not fall, used carefully, very disappointed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very inefficient battary life.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a unit that doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of real estate on your counter</li>
            <li> but it cannot take the place of flossing (as the advertising wants you to believe) ... not at all per my dental hygenist.  </li>
            <li> I bought this model because we don&#x27;t have much counter space in our bathroom.</li>
            <li> It does the job of cleaning very well.  </li>
            <li> It works so much better than I expected.</li>
            <li> and I was amazed at how much I missed with the toothbrush and floss.</li>
            <li> When we traveled out of town for a week, I really missed it.</li>
            <li> It drains incredibly fast even charging whenever not in use.</li>
            <li> I really like this item.  </li>
            <li> Reasonably priced and works well.</li>
            <li> I think this takes up a reasonable amount of room on the counter, too.  </li>
            <li> however, I expected better performance from this product.  </li>
            <li> Very time consuming and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a dental irrigator before so this was an unusual experience, but here goes....</li>
            <li> It comes with a variety of &amp;#34;jet extensions&amp;#34; to fit various needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this product saves a lot of time and works very well.</li>
            <li> and you can fill the resevoir with germ killing mouthwash or a prescribed peridontal rinse to really push it into any problem spot.    </li>
            <li> Also, the tank design weighs the unit such that it is comfortable to the hand.      </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m scared to see what high feels like!    </li>
            <li> My teeth are very close together</li>
            <li> (My husband wants me to add it</li>
            <li> I also have taken to blowing the water out of the connector after using it, though I doubt that really makes much of a difference</li>
            <li> never realized how much food residual could be stuck.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works really well.</li>
            <li> Depending on your needs &amp; wants I&#x27;d would probably recommend it.</li>
            <li> You need to use it fast before the water runs out.  </li>
            <li> It really seems to make a difference when I go to the dentist.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone who is very mobile.</li>
            <li> This newer version holds the battery charge much longer.</li>
            <li> I bought this one because of the cordless aspect... makes it very convenient to use.</li>
            <li> Be gentle when you floss manually.</li>
            <li> You have no control over how gentle the pressure is on this flosser.</li>
            <li> , I realized there really is no need for more time/bigger tank.</li>
            <li> It works really well.  </li>
            <li> is efficient and gentle on my gums.</li>
            <li> The whole thing is very convenient to use.</li>
            <li> but it goes fast because of the flow settings even with the narrowest attachment being used.</li>
            <li> I really like my waterpik.  </li>
            <li> My mouth and teeth feel much cleaner</li>
            <li> I really prefer the battery unit.  </li>
            <li> I really like the way it works.</li>
            <li> Is so much that goes away when you use it, and I&#x27;ve already improved my dental care, so much that my dentist is also amazed.</li>
            <li> Highly advisable to use this!</li>
            <li> My gums get inflammed and sore and this absolutely solved the problem.  </li>
            <li> Really.  </li>
            <li> Seems to really do the trick.</li>
            <li> I wear braces, so this has really been a life-saver for me.</li>
            <li> He has been using the water jet every day and feels it is really helping his gum issue.</li>
            <li> 50 years later, with gingival issues, I didn&#x27;t realize then how important</li>
            <li> Amazon kept ture to the 14 day refund and issued it in a very timely fashion.</li>
            <li> I really like it being handheld.  </li>
            <li> I need to charge it every 2-3 days during whole night.</li>
            <li> I really  have no complaints</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using this product I&#x27;ve noticed that my mouth feels much healthier than it did before I began using it.</li>
            <li> My husband really likes this waterpik waterflosser.  </li>
            <li> would recommend this to everyone who wants to protect their teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> I bought mine in 2013 and have really tried to like the thing, but I can&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> but I really like the variety of heads this offer as well as the fact that the water container comes off.  </li>
            <li> This cordless model works better than expected.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It works very well.</li>
            <li> Your mouth feels so much cleaner</li>
            <li> The water reservoir used fast.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels much cleaner with it.  </li>
            <li> I really do like the waterflosser, it makes my flossing time faster.</li>
            <li> 15 months with nearly daily use primarily by my wife.  </li>
            <li> Fits our tiny space, does the job, is quiet, easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> - It has really helped with my breath and gums.  </li>
            <li> so i would not recommend this product most of the 5 star reviews are most likely written by the company itself or inpatient people that just received the product in hand and played with it a few minutes</li>
            <li> While the product had battery life, I found it very efficient.</li>
            <li> It works very well.  </li>
            <li> it help me so much</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t have any complaints, it has plenty of water pressure and does the job.</li>
            <li> You have to keep the darned thing straight up in order to use it, meaning that you are drooling all over it and your hand.&lt;br</li>
            <li> We also invested in the carrying case, which is very handy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My wife really wanted this.  </li>
            <li> Now I really miss it if I don&#x27;t use it.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for anyone who needs healthier gums and wants to improve dental hygiene, etc&lt;br</li>
            <li> whole mouth feels fresher and cleaner</li>
            <li> I did wipe the unit each time, but I did not spend much time drying the terminals, if at all.</li>
            <li> really like this device, except for the cost.</li>
            <li> she seldom has to spend much time cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li> This thing really gets the food particles out from between your teeth and under your gums.  </li>
            <li> All I know is I was looking at some that cost twice as much</li>
            <li> Customer service graciously replaced one unit but now wants receipts, etc.  </li>
            <li> Very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;Cunfunit</li>
            <li> My  gums are much healthier (per dentist)</li>
            <li> I find it much easier then flossing with the string</li>
            <li> It just gets really weak.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Flossing with water really works.</li>
            <li> do absolutely recommend using a waterpik every day.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for the chance to write this review.  </li>
            <li> It does not adjust as much as we would like</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve charged it once for the whole night</li>
            <li> and she absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> I like it because it doesn&#x27;t take up too much space.  </li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s just too much of a pain.</li>
            <li> No one wants to eat pie after they cleaned their teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would have given it four stars except I find the fact that there is no docking station and I have to plug it in for charging and then unplug it to use it a real pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> which really put me off about ordering from any merchant on Amazon that will charge you to return it.</li>
            <li> I am very displeased.</li>
            <li> but really think it should work longer than 5 days.</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> Much like my sonic toothbrush thingie</li>
            <li> might fast too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> might fast too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very bulky.</li>
            <li> Both machines have been returned to Amazon and I have, very reluctantly, ordered an Oral B Oxyjet.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no neat, non-messy way to use this product, as it almost has to be standing straight up to use; any tilt to allow you head and mouth to pour over into the sink, and the thing gets clogged and the water starts leaking and dribbling onto your hands.  </li>
            <li> MUCH EASIER TO USE THEN</li>
            <li> It is much messier than using the waterpik corded flosser.</li>
            <li> It suits me very well.</li>
            <li> Much easier for me to handle than the corded one.</li>
            <li> Works very well and has 2 speeds.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Before you buy, ask yourself if you really must have the cordless model.</li>
            <li> It really gives a feeling of dental cleaning.  </li>
            <li> Mine does, but after verifying that it rotated I haven&#x27;t tried to rotate the tip again as  it is easier to rotate the whole body.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> My teeth felt so much cleaner...</li>
            <li> this one is way too bulky, cant be charged while in use, and doesnt hold much water.</li>
            <li> Really helps to get into nooks and crannies while massaging the gums.</li>
            <li> I have an irrigator waterpik wp 70, and I really like it.</li>
            <li> She loves it because it&#x27;s so much easier than having to thread floss between braces and teeth.  </li>
            <li> I have to refill it 2-4 times while using it depending on how fast I go.  </li>
            <li> I really like it and it does the job</li>
            <li> : I find it convenient because it is cordless and does not take up much counter space.</li>
            <li> Unlike the cord one, you can hold it at any angle and you can put as much water as you want.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> is fast</li>
            <li> This really is an alternative to flossing that is getting in there and doing the job like floss.</li>
            <li> I really like the ease of handling the  cordless unit.  </li>
            <li> But the convenience of taking the cordless unit on the road is a real advantage.  </li>
            <li> , I wished it held more water, but after using it daily, I manage to waterpik every tooth and completely cover all gum&lt;&gt;tooth areas with one filling.     </li>
            <li> Despite my efforts, however, it is starting to require more frequent charging.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more trouble than its worth.</li>
            <li> The WP450 is far better than the earlier WP360.  </li>
            <li> It keeps a charge for several days and is so convenient to use as it is nice enough to leave sitting out on the vanity.  </li>
            <li> I actually like the Waterpik concept, and own a larger unit.</li>
            <li> I learned a few thing on my own that were not mentioned in the instructions.  </li>
            <li> After using the flossed for a few weeks I find it does a nice job.</li>
            <li> Not enough pressure to actually do anything, the regular ones by waterpik are far more effective.</li>
            <li> I liked to use it everyday and even sent a couple of these waterflossers to my relatives abroad.</li>
            <li> I use it on a daily basis and love this product but don&#x27;t completely trust it yet</li>
            <li> However, the water force is not as strong and the water reservoir, naturally is smaller so you might have to fill it twice to get a decent cleaning.</li>
            <li> No wet, corroding terminals and the unit seems as powerful as the first time I used</li>
            <li> the way my dentist told me to add a few drops of bleach to the water to really be effective in healing your gums.</li>
            <li> Flossing the opposite side of your mouth will cause all the water to flow over your hand, which is tolerable but kind of gross</li>
            <li> Even when we fly for a warm vacation, we like to travel light, and the bulk of the regular unit was annoying, so once again, we&#x27;d suffer through yucky</li>
            <li> It travels easily, holds a charge for up to a week, and is a pretty powerful little tool.</li>
            <li> My husband uses the &#x27;regular&#x27; floss tip and is able to clean his teeth with a single fill of the reservoir.</li>
            <li> I had my first root canal and cap down and the dentist suggested that I get a water flosser to make sure I kept the area clean...especially since my teeth are really close together</li>
            <li> bought this portable job after researching the counter top edition and seeing that this one performs the same task, with the same assurances of better oral health, but doesn&#x27;t take up counter space (of which I have none) and is just a lot less to fuss with in terms of cleaning, worrying about hose length, and generally just being a lot more bulk to deal with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It comes with a bunch of fancy-smancy other tips (which I think are funny imo) but all that matters to me is the standard nozzle is good and the pressure on high meets my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So far it has emptied over ten tanks of water and is still going strong on the first charge.    </li>
            <li> particular portable model has an easy fill reservoir with the fill hole located on the side so when it&#x27;s tilted under the faucet of a small sink it fills easily.  </li>
            <li> wow!!!</li>
            <li> the box)&lt;br /&gt;This unit is powerful, portable, sits right next to the basin</li>
            <li> I recently purchased a new portable waterpik that works great, but now the battery has gone down and the recharge coard does not work.</li>
            <li> This is a very fun product and I can only trust the science that it does what it claims to.</li>
            <li> first thing I noticed was that it really was very loud.  </li>
            <li> First let me say I can&#x27;t live without a waterflosser.</li>
            <li> Of course, the time you remember that it needs to be recharged is right after you use it, and getting all of the water out of that hole is near impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just the right amount of pressure and water to complete the job.</li>
            <li> but then, you&#x27;re holding the motor right near you ears.</li>
            <li> with plain warm water using my cordless</li>
            <li> Had the previous model which worked well, the new model has more power and the accessories provided are useful also.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never needed high as it does just fine on the low setting.  </li>
            <li> The battery lasts a long time between charges, and the water compartment is easy to fill, even by children.  </li>
            <li> I can more than adequately clean my entire mouth in the time it takes for the tank to empty.</li>
            <li> You have to be careful though, because after one dentist told me it&#x27;s great to use to prevent gum disease, another dentist told me it could cause problems by allowing food stuck between teeth to get moved to other pockets between gums.</li>
            <li> actually one and a half does the trick), but it&#x27;s easy to fill, and it sure beats feeling yucky for two weeks.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and stayed charged for a long time ( 3 weeks).</li>
            <li> The flosser can be replaced easily and the charge lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> like that it does not take up too much space on the counter because i have so many other products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Hopefully, they read this stuff and will either add some sort of (attached to the unit) plug or go to an induction-type re-charge method on the next version of the PLUS, if they haven&#x27;t already concluded that one or the other is a good idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> It also has a high and low setting which gives more options for sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> At home, I definitely prefer the regular one, which I love very much.</li>
            <li> With this one, the strength of the water isn&#x27;t quite strong enough, but I could live with that.</li>
            <li> But don&#x27;t get me wrong, despite wearing braces, my hygienist complimented about how clean I maintained my teeth and good part of the credit should go to this device.  </li>
            <li> Not enough to clean whole mouth.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, works great in those hard to reach areas, especially in the back &amp; around bridge work.</li>
            <li> I have an other water pick product that is counter top</li>
            <li> Very low pressure and doesn&#x27;t compare with  the original  Waterpik.  </li>
            <li> Having learned from past purchases of products with questionable reviews, I had purchased it from another source that has a great return policy, so I just returned it to the purchaser rather than wait months for the manufacturere to make good.</li>
            <li> As with many of the other reviews there is a flaw in the way that the nozzles were designed, once put it there</li>
            <li> The other interesting thing the Customer service person mentioned, which sounds counter intuitive to me, is that I need to keep the Waterpik plugged in all the time expect when it is in use.  </li>
            <li> It is a significant improvement to have the entire unit built into the handle.</li>
            <li> other than that, im satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I love the product.</li>
            <li> like it better  than the other one I had.</li>
            <li> When we first discovered that, I tried pushing all sorts of skinny things through the little hole to get to the mold to wipe it off, but nothing was able to reach all the areas of the tank&#x27;s interior.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t imagine any of the other brands are any easier to use except for the counter top models where one just has to manage the tube and not a bulky device with a built in tank</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll be able to buy a replacement from some other outfit this time.</li>
            <li> Used one of the original plug-in-the-wall Pik units back in the &#x27;60s as a kid.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this I ran out of water, but the second time the extra fill gave me about 10 more seconds.</li>
            <li> but that could change with more experience using the other 2&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> I can honestly say this is a convenient product but not very effective.</li>
            <li> high isn&#x27;t very high.</li>
            <li> It keeps a charge for a remarkable length of time -- I only need to charge it every few weeks &amp; do so overnight</li>
            <li> The entire reason for the water pick is to power clean your teeth and without power that goal is not met.    </li>
            <li> Next, the pressure is insufficient to really clean your teeth.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t recall my teeth feeling so clean, especially under bridgework!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The water container does not hold enough water to completely clean all my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it a few weeks now and am pretty satisfied.</li>
            <li> I also just got back from vacation for a week and did not bring it with me, and I could tell that my teeth were not as clean.  </li>
            <li> Two to three extra minutes for REALLY clean teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li> You have to fill the reservoir twice in order to clean both upper teeth and lower teeth</li>
            <li> It holds enough water to clean your mouth.  </li>
            <li> I think this newer version does not have as much pressure as my older model.</li>
            <li> BUT I used it (only twice) and the water was every where, had to clean my mirror</li>
            <li> This product leaves us short of satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;The water reservoir leaks when the Waterpik Cordless is tipped to clean the teeth.  </li>
            <li> The first Waterpik funtioned very well when received but after about (1) year after purchase the product lost water pressure and had to be charged frequently just to operate.</li>
            <li> unit works very well and has just enough water to floss your whole mouth quickly.  </li>
            <li> though the tank is bigger, it still takes 2 fills to clean my mouth satisfactorily.  </li>
            <li> my teeth never felt so clean even after regular flossing.  </li>
            <li> it has some serious flaws: the reservoir tank is good for 1/3 of the mouth and the tip keeps jumping out of the holder and rotates.  </li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;ll just be able to use the Water Pik with its special orthodontic tip (which comes with this model, along with several other tips).  </li>
            <li> Battery good for about 2 weeks of use (once with regular tip, once with pocket-pic, daily,) and a large enough water reservoir.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This would be a nice travel Waterpik, as it is one piece plus charging cord, but it is somewhat larger than my very old battery-operated Panasonic Travel Oral Irrigator, which is not rechargeable but is similar in effectiveness to this cordless</li>
            <li> Both had FAR more power (needing to be set well below their highest settings for my use), ran for about five to ten times as long on a filling, and allowed me to easily and successfully direct the stream at every point where gums meet tooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seems kind of odd that nobody around here carries any of the standard countertop units right now.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s still better than conventional floss so rated \\&quot;Ok\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Although it ideally could be a little smaller for that use, I will definitely find room to take it along when I travel --</li>
            <li> If someone really wants to use it for a long time though, they should stick with the original model.  </li>
            <li> Waterpik does carry a model which is suitable for my travel needs, but that model was not available at Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li> Now I must find out if I can get a charger suitable for the country or do I just have to throw away the device, which to me is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in this travel pik as I have the full size  Waterpik that is over 20 years old and perfect in what it does.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d need gigantic hands to do that with this one, especially when the reservoir is full.    </li>
            <li> Stick with a full size water pick, not necessarily Waterpik brand.</li>
            <li> It started to act funky about two weeks ago when it began to make a loud chirping noise (which it did not do when I first bought it).  </li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s true that this is NOT a total replacement for flossing (braces or not) it does help a lot in getting rid of  all kinds of things that get stuck to teeth and in between teeth.  </li>
            <li> so I had to take it apart and service it like a car - which is not something an average user would be able to do.    </li>
            <li> I use the unit twice a day on average, and I can go more than three weeks between charges.  </li>
            <li> One full charge lasts over a week with daily use.</li>
            <li> Good idea in theory but not good in practice.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on it and found that the complaints of water every where was true but only if you don&#x27;t keep your head over the sink.</li>
            <li> I find the amount of fluid is more than enough to get along all the gums very thoroughly.</li>
            <li> One full battery charge allows for several applications.</li>
            <li> I purchased a cheaper one first and there is no comparison as far as cleaning my teeth and gum spaces.  </li>
            <li> Replaced same unit when battery would not hold a full charge.</li>
            <li> Once I figured this out, my unit went back to full power.</li>
            <li> Personally find cordless units very easy to use Wish the 4 tips were all the same rather than 4 different styles as only use standard type and spare tips are good to have (replacements at $10 each justify just buying a new unit)</li>
            <li> he only drawback is the limited capacity of the reservoir, but refilling it is quick and easy.</li>
            <li> It works very well and does what it is supposed to, the only problem I have with it is it runs out of water rather quickly when you run it on the high setting.</li>
            <li> the only thing i can say negative is that it is not as powerful as the one you hook up to your faucet, but the attachments for this clean the gumline better.</li>
            <li> I broke one getting it down off of the top of my medicine cabinet.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to turn the thing upside down as fully upright and moving my head, I am able to angle it to hit everywhere.  </li>
            <li> I cleaned it out as well as I could, and it worked better for a while and then slowed down again -</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too early to tell if it fixes the main problem of the cordless Waterpik 360, which is that before the first year is out, the rechargable battery will no longer hold a charge</li>
            <li> The second one never did work properly -- the nozzle always was in free float: you had to hang on to it to keep it pointed in the right direction.</li>
            <li> The opening for the stream of water seems to be too large; I end up with a mouth full of water long before I finish using the waterflosser, and have to keep refilling it.</li>
            <li> A little bit of mouthwash, with the water, and you got a super clean moth.  </li>
            <li> my new dentist recommended it!</li>
            <li> On a brand new item!  </li>
            <li> She called Waterpik, asked for a replacement -and Waterpik sent her a new one!</li>
            <li> I had used the older, \\&quot;big\\&quot; version of the Waterpik with a large reservoir and the wand with a cord many years ago - noisy, messy, took up a lot of counter space.</li>
            <li> Cons have to charge every day, taking the tank off be gentle, cleaning is kind of hard because of shape of tank</li>
            <li> by far not so strong and effective as the normal standard Watepik which, by the way, has a very short life as the hose breakes no matter how careful you handle the Waterpik.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it compares to other handheld waterpiks, but it&#x27;s definitely so much nicer to use than the plug-in waterpiks which sound like jackhammers and take up so much space.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this unit last year on May 6th, and i am using it almost everyday, and now I can review it correctly, for me, it is a perfect unit, I have no problems with battery, noise and size all other reviewers talking about.</li>
            <li> reviewers have said that the new model dies after awhile, not so much because the battery wears out (although it seems to), but because the contacts get corroded and the battery will not fully charge.</li>
            <li> A real PITA to have to keep mixing new rinse solution if you are not Piking with</li>
            <li> but this one worked better and longer than the one I had previously.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a trade-off of cordless and less pressure vs. corded and more pressure.</li>
            <li> It is ergonomically designed for better functionality compared to the previous editions of the Cordless Waterpik.</li>
            <li> This one seems to work much better and has faster pulses than the previous one.  </li>
            <li> The dental hygienist could not believe how much more plaque I had since the previous 6th month appointment-</li>
            <li> I agree with a previous reviewer that Waterpik should fix this problem rather than me buying something at Radio Shack to make it better.</li>
            <li> There was only a quick start guide which says to 1) charge for 24 hours, 2)</li>
            <li> It holds enough water for a quick once-over</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t appear to be particularly well-made.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hold enough water for thorough  cleaning nor is the pressure adequate.</li>
            <li> The jet wand can be rotated (the wand rotates and clicks in place, holding steady...</li>
            <li> I decided to get the cheaper classic model.</li>
            <li> Thank goodness all the older heads work</li>
            <li> Delivery was quick and unit has been utilized daily without any problems.  </li>
            <li> I always had a challenging time flossing the back teeth with them and as a result I never flossed regularly.  </li>
            <li> and it is more than enough for my (currently) tender gums.  </li>
            <li> like this unit because it is portable and has a decent battery charge.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, they are that good that I am looking to buy another after last stopped charging few days ago.  </li>
            <li> It seems to hold a charge pretty well, you have to charge it for several hours before the first use, so</li>
            <li> but I moved to an older house that didn&#x27;t have outlets in the bathrooms.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it daily for about a month now and fairly satisfied overall.</li>
            <li> Recently my older Waterpik Ultra had its hose break necessitating a replacement.</li>
            <li> obviously, if it were smaller, the water reservoir would have to be refilled more often, so there is that trade-off.  </li>
            <li> It replaced an older model.  </li>
            <li> Item too big to hold and takes up more space than necessary.  </li>
            <li> Nice, compact device that&#x27;s fairly simple to use and takes up minimal space on your bathroom sink or shelf.</li>
            <li> I either do that to control as a \\&quot;pause\\&quot; button or just turn it off with a quick flip of the on/off switch and then flip it back on when I want the water flow to resume.    </li>
            <li> We had an older version.</li>
            <li> I chose this particular unit because it said it came with a nozzle designed for braces</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sticking with my older version.</li>
            <li> This is the second one of this model we have owned, and we bought it only because we need an oral irrigator to take on trips (we bought the Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser for use at home, and we are pleased with it).</li>
            <li> This is a decent product.  </li>
            <li> It is not silent but the sound isn&#x27;t particularly loud.</li>
            <li> Yes, it does run out of water quickly (as stated in one review), but simply fill it up while you are showering and press on.</li>
            <li> works but thin cheap plastic case;  water capacity adequate but must rinse teeth quickly or will run out &amp; have to refill</li>
            <li> The chamber holds enough water to rinse the gums once over, but needs refilling if more rinsing than that is needed, but this is not a big deal.</li>
            <li> I have never used one of these before so after reading multiple reviews I decided to go for the cordless one so that I didn&#x27;t have a big machine on my counter top.</li>
            <li> On the plus side, it basically does the job, just not as conveniently as my older one.</li>
            <li> It did have decent &#x27;power&#x27; on the pik.  </li>
            <li> the older model was better (now at half the price).</li>
            <li> i will either get the older model or it may be time to try the panasonic with rechargable batteries and see how well that works.</li>
            <li> Definitely get better result than using the regular floss.</li>
            <li> Much better than using regular wooden or plastic picks.</li>
            <li> All I can say positive--which is of course the main thing--is that it goes where no floss and toothbrush have gone before, flushing away debris</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I hit my significant other in the face.</li>
            <li> I bought this model as it was cordless would actually be used (as opposed to the static wall plug types which invariably end up back in</li>
            <li> Plus, they only come with one of each type of flossing head, so if two or more people are using it, they have to share the same tip!!!</li>
            <li> Most people stop flossing after starting the waterpik and that is a big problem</li>
            <li> I had to replace my older cordless water pik.....</li>
            <li> tank is quickly refilled, so I&#x27;m not too concerned about the (admittedly surprisingly) short operation length per water</li>
            <li> /&gt;Couple areas for improvement (hence only 3 stars at this time):&lt;br /&gt;- the biggest flaw in my opinion is that the tips should have a much smaller hole - I was hoping for much more of a water jet stream than a flowing one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok for travel however for a home model I would choose the regular standard ones again.</li>
            <li> This waterpik only has two settings which is high and low and high is just a little too much for my gums but the low level works perfect for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good to travel with, if you really feel you can&#x27;t miss a few days, but if you have limited luggage real estate, leave it home.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little akward holding the whole unit at first, but the pivoting head allows you to hold it however it is comfortable for you.  </li>
            <li> The tank does empty very fast, but the workaround - just keep the faucet running and from time to time just fill in the water without stopping, just bend low :)</li>
            <li> Not sure why they changed what previously was a very good product.</li>
            <li> It has no battery level indicator, and no LED to indicate when it is successfully being charged (or fully charged), and the battery only lasts for a short, unknown number of uses.  </li>
            <li> but when it runs out of water the pitch of the fairly noisy thing gets even higher and more annoying.   </li>
            <li> The water tank will empty pretty quick</li>
            <li> The other reviewer suggested getting a different charging cord that had a tighter fit, but the solution I found was just use a bobby pin to clean off the funk that builds on the charging tips on the device.</li>
            <li> While I didn&#x27;t have high expectations of quality with a cordless waterflosser, it never occurred to me there wouldn&#x27;t be a charge indicator.  </li>
            <li> No warnings about how high pressure water can cut through tissue, no shock warnings.  </li>
            <li> The design and functionality of the unit satisfactory, on high</li>
            <li> Highly recomend this prodact.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone with braces.</li>
            <li> And yes I am using the High pressure setting.</li>
            <li> And yes I am using the High pressure setting.</li>
            <li> On the high pressure setting, the water runs out after probably 15 seconds.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> On the recommendation of my dental hygenist to use a water pik, I got this one and also the Waterpik Dental Water Jet Replacement High Pressure Jet Tips</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I use the flosser on the high setting.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this.  </li>
            <li> I prefer the high, but again, I have braces.  </li>
            <li> so at this point would highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product to anyone with it without braces.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for anyone with braces.</li>
            <li> The tip keeps popping out if I set the power to high.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I was using it 1-2 times/day on the high setting.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
            <li> With high hopes I got this.  </li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I finally got a full size corded waterpik because they came out with a newer version that has a smaller footprint that just barely did fit on my sink.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to any of my friends or family.</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I still highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> any case, I still HIGHLY recommend the PLUS.</li>
            <li> Recommend highly.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> The high setting is a bit weaker than my home unit dial</li>
            <li> The high spray adjustment does the job without hurting gums.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I get one or two uses on high</li>
            <li> If you use it on high speed - it seems to run out of water faster than what I would like</li>
            <li> On high, the water runs out in 20 seconds.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> On the high setting it uses all the water in about 10 seconds max.  </li>
            <li> On the high setting, I&#x27;d say it runs out of water after about 35 seconds.</li>
            <li> close your mouth somewhat to keep in the spray (very important ahaha, as I found out when I forgot to do that), then hit the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; button, and it does the job, shooting a firm stream of water.  </li>
            <li> , then eventually going to the high</li>
            <li> highly recommend!!!sy to do a section at a time, turning it off in between</li>
            <li> , then eventually going to the high</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t switched  it to high yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product for people who have braces.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I asked a couple of my dentist friends and they highly recommended it too.</li>
            <li> dentist says I should use it on high setting.&lt;br /&gt;this portable model cannot do that.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Our mouths feel fresh and clean and I look forward to using this little appliance each night.</li>
            <li> Pretty cheap, pretty loud, doesn&#x27;t hold much water, leaks, charge lasts for very little time so has to be plugged in all the time anyway.  </li>
            <li> Low doesn&#x27;t seem quite strong enough and high is too much pressure.</li>
            <li> It seems a bit more powerful than the previous model, and  I started using it on the low setting.</li>
            <li> Remember to use with warm water for better cleaning and minus the shock of 40 psi of cold water blasting your teeth and gums- unless you are into that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reaserching several dental websites, it is apparant that this does not replace flossing; this is good for cleaning gumlines and overall food removal.</li>
            <li> The pressure could be a little more now that my gums are used to it</li>
            <li> I wish it was designed a little lighter in weight, and had a better battery/charger system.</li>
            <li> There are some pretty major design flaws on the cordless model.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m suprised to see so many cry babies nit-picking over every little thing.</li>
            <li> have to say, I love it for getting out all the little bits of food and stuff that get stuck in-between</li>
            <li> As someone else mentioned, you can probably swish water around your mouth and it will have more power than this little machine.  </li>
            <li> A little clunky, could be designed better somehow.</li>
            <li> I just feel that the water tank should be redesigned in order to have just a little bit more of capacity.</li>
            <li> It is a little more cumbersome when you are doing the backside of the teeth</li>
            <li> Maybe as I get more used to it, it may go a little faster</li>
            <li> The flosser appears to work although it&#x27;s a little soon to tell for sure.</li>
            <li> anyway so it just takes a coupld of seconds to add a little more.</li>
            <li> On to the next part... I used it for the first time today!</li>
            <li> WOW!!</li>
            <li> I will re-rate my purchase at 2 stars because this item lasted little more than 1 year.</li>
            <li> The tip DOES rotate easily, like other reviewers mentioned.</li>
            <li> have my wisdom teeth, didn&#x27;t need them taken out, &amp; this really is the only way I can really get back there to clean the area.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> It has more water capacity, but the force is less than my old one, and the battery runs out too quickly to keep from carrying the charger for even a very short trip.  </li>
            <li> Shooting a stream of pressurized water into your mouth pretty much guarantees a somewhat messy outcome...but the cordless PLUS is an efficient unit and way more contained than the older traditional Waterpik set up.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the high setting yet since the low setting seems to shoot out water at a pretty fast pace.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never before written a review on a product, but this product is so bad that my best recommendation is not to purchase it.</li>
            <li> I proceeded to clean and dry the terminals and plugged it up; no change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Will let you know if my opinion works, but so far I can really see that this will make a difference.  </li>
            <li> But it lacks the real power that my old piks had, which made me feel the old pik was really doing the job.  </li>
            <li> I was replacing an old one,new one much improved,shaped grip easier to hold...</li>
            <li> is always yelling at me (okay not really yelling, but at least scolding me) that I need to floss more.  </li>
            <li> I see that the &amp;#34;free shipping&amp;#34; that you get through Prime pays for itself as the products that are Prime-eligible are are about $10 higher in general.</li>
            <li> This one is so much an improvement over the old Waterpik which was cumbersome with those coily cords and the motor from heck.</li>
            <li> additionally, the button placement and button feel and action are not up to modern day standards.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So far really like this product</li>
            <li> Also the water tank was redesigned and I think the old design was much easier to fill.  </li>
            <li> There was nothing wrong with the seller and their service was great.  </li>
            <li> This Waterpik works very well so far.</li>
            <li> Most probably, the battery is dead.</li>
            <li> After using it for a few weeks,  i love it, use it every night before bed</li>
            <li> but the battery pretty much had to be charged every week if used daily.</li>
            <li> Since the TSA regularly searches my luggage and disturbs the contents, I am not unhappy with the life of the unit.</li>
            <li> I use this combined with normal floss and an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Not enough pressure to be useful to me.  </li>
            <li> I had no problem and enjoyed using it everyday to the amazement of my wife.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love that moisture gets trapped in there.   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had to recharge once so far with almost daily use, so that&#x27;s ok too.</li>
            <li> I initially charged this unit for a full 24 hours prior to first use (Waterpik suggests 16 hours).</li>
            <li> It was worth the considerably larger expenditure.</li>
            <li> I love my waterpik flosser…I have bought one for my 3 daughters and a few friends.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I do for few weeks, more often I don&#x27;t.   </li>
            <li> is powerful enough to do the job.  </li>
            <li> but I can close my mouth around it for a few seconds and then just spit out the water with no problem and love it vs flossing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve babied it along for a couple of months now, but at this point the water pressure is too low to do anything, even fresh off the charger.</li>
            <li> I have two complaints, but it is such a useful piece of equipment that I still give it five stars.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended I purchase a Waterflosser to avoid erosion and I&#x27;m glad I did - after just a few weeks use, I couldn&#x27;t do without it.</li>
            <li> and they just aren&#x27;t powerful enough.  </li>
            <li> When I plugged it in, you could feel it plugged in smoother and more firmly.</li>
            <li> After a few more uses to see if it gets easier to use, I will review it again.</li>
            <li> You can just add more water if it didn&#x27;t run long enough.</li>
            <li> and if i brushed before flossing (really can you complain abt it ;-)&lt;br /&gt;6) can i take in my wallet or purse -</li>
            <li> I got this thing from Costco as part of a kit that has the normal plug in to the wall one, and this cordless one.</li>
            <li> I usually fill it twice more before I feel really finished.</li>
            <li> I think it is strange that for 1 full flossing sessions, I need to fill the reservoir 3 times.  </li>
            <li> well it&#x60;s worth the money i will tell my friends about this product in the future</li>
            <li> I would recommend spending a bit more for a countertop model that plugs in, and don&#x27;t waste your money, time and aggravation on the hand</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s powerful enough to stand on the porch and squirt the cats stalking the birds at the feeder.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly good power and pressure for such a small device.</li>
            <li> The instructions say to just let the water run out of your mouth, but that is a bit more messy, and I wasn&#x27;t a fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The instructions say to just let the water run out of your mouth, but that is a bit more messy, and I wasn&#x27;t a fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I skip on some of the above steps and as long as I don&#x27;t skip often my mouth stays healthy.</li>
            <li> They pretty much speak fpr themselves and withstand countless droppings but eventually the break.</li>
            <li> Supposedly this is normal and will not happen</li>
            <li> Not as powerful as the regular water pic.</li>
            <li> Good idea poor follow thru.    </li>
            <li> Start off slowly and learn your own limit and tolerance level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> if you live in Gulf Coast or areas of high MOLD activity.  </li>
            <li> This is hands down better then the old but still selling WP-360.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated 20 June 2016:&lt;br /&gt;Been</li>
            <li> This is hands down better then the old but still selling WP-360.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated 20 June 2016:&lt;br /&gt;Been</li>
            <li> My old waterpik with the separate tank was thrown away years ago because of the space it took, the need to stretch the hose and electric cord down the cabinet to use it, and the moldy slime that tended to form in the tank top.  </li>
            <li> Love my waterpik waterflosser and I use it at least once a day,  very powerful on low setting  </li>
            <li> The WaterFlosser is HUGE, and certainly not an option for travelling.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it seems to work fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never used a waterpik before this one and after having used it several times I agree with other reviewers that it is best used in the shower as its hard not to get water everywhere unless you just keep it in your mouth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Batteries are living things, and unless new, corrosion free and kept on a charger they become an unknown quantity.  </li>
            <li> It does get the teeth very clean, in every little pocket.</li>
            <li> The waterpik works far better and takes less time.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would change about this is to have a better way to allow the tank to dry.  </li>
            <li> This rapid action emptys the reservoir to quickly even on low speed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not been a faithful flosser but find that using this Waterpik daily is easy and I hope it will be notice by the dentist on my next visit.</li>
            <li> for something that i can only use for like 6 minutes before it requires charging, it would be nice if said charging took less</li>
            <li> easy to use and handle while flossing; the price is right;I especially like the number of different flosser heads with the unit; battery holds it&#x27;s charge too!</li>
            <li> It arrived in a timely manner, less than a week after I ordered it, full marks for that, but when I took it out of the box and went to plug it in I first checked what was written on the charger....</li>
            <li> The modelling is far better and it makes less noise.</li>
            <li> Indeed, the male prongs on my unit showed some corrosion and the female plug did not seem to be a tight fit any more....</li>
            <li> Sometimes I do refill it for a single use, but only when I am enjoying the gum massage and not just cleaning my teeth.  </li>
            <li> On low, I get plenty of pressure because I place the tip of the spout right up between teeth and between teeth and gums.       </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to order right now a different product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not going to happen right away, but the batteries will never be the same</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll likely have to refill 1-2x to get the job done right, but if you need a waterpik, I think this is the way to go.</li>
            <li> It died right after the initial battery charge ran out, and refuses to charge up again...</li>
            <li> I have placed a clean pic next to the one with mold, note the darkened clear plastic vs the clear unused pic.</li>
            <li> My older one filled differently and all the extra water in the container could be drained out.  </li>
            <li> after many years of the other model and use i recently upgraded to this one and really like it so far!</li>
            <li> you have immediately shortened their lifespan and limited there capacity to hold a full charge.  </li>
            <li> too read all the reviews and thought it was interesting that there was such polar disparity in the reviews.  </li>
            <li> It really is not very user friendly.</li>
            <li> The product itself works great, but the downside of it is that the water reservoir is to damn small, and has to be refilled several times before it actually gets the job done.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much nicer than the full sized one, comes with four different heads so multiple people can use it.</li>
            <li> This is crazy good!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m only a few days into using it, so, as a say, I&#x27;ll update if things go sideways, but, my first experience is that I really love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> my first use I was surprised by how much this actually hurts.  </li>
            <li> I warm the water prior to putting it in the unit and add a little antiseptic mouth rinse</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m going to see if I can find a new corded version that&#x27;s maybe a little more sturdy than my old unit.</li>
            <li> My only comment is, it certainly cleanses my teeth thoroughly but it runs out of fluid quickly..</li>
            <li> Somewhat bulky;  however, I can live with this.</li>
            <li> This is a teeth saver for my child with new braces.  </li>
            <li> So even after reading the reviews on the new Waterpik Cordless Dental Jet</li>
            <li> I fill my units up to max and the new Water Jet holds twice the amount of water then</li>
            <li> If it were not for this product I would be hopeless in cleaning my teeth since I had my new braces put on.  </li>
            <li> The tips on my new 450 Waterpik [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I cleaned the posts with WD-40 and the unit is re-charging like new.</li>
            <li> where I live the voltage is 240v, so I could not use the product.</li>
            <li> Lifespan:  When it was new, I had to charge the battery once a  week.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended the WaterPik to me whenI had new crowns put in.  </li>
            <li> We could just order new batteries and replace them and not have to buy a new unit, which is what my wife and I have to do about every year or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is sitting in my recycle bin awaiting a new fate.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m guessing that means I&#x27;ll be getting a new one soon.</li>
            <li> So I don&#x27;t bother to buy a new tip.  </li>
            <li> I do not like the shape of the new one</li>
            <li> I bought this to help with my new braces and it does the job.</li>
            <li> BUT MAY NEED TO REPLACE FOR NEW ONES; TOO SOON?</li>
            <li> I was sent a new waterpik waterflosser within two weeks.  </li>
            <li> The con about it is that if the battery dies, you have to get a new product.</li>
            <li> This means I would have to buy a new waterpick every 1.5 years at this rate.</li>
            <li> Contacting customer service to try and get a new one.</li>
            <li> I ordered a new one and the problems began.</li>
            <li> I need a new 3-volt output AC/AC Adaptor.</li>
            <li> So when the battery goes, you just toss it and get a new one?  </li>
            <li> I contacted Customer Service and was told they would ship me a new set of tips, that was in December 2010, and as of today, Feb 13, 2011, I have not received the replacement tips.</li>
            <li> and id just have to toss it and buy a new one.  </li>
            <li> this is the \\&quot; new improved \\&quot;portable water pik.</li>
            <li> looks like and performs like new.</li>
            <li> When the battery dies, I get a new one because I like it.</li>
            <li> I live overseas, so I&#x27;m charging it on a converter.</li>
            <li> I bought a new W450WP and after about 18 months the battery is deader than a door nail.  </li>
            <li> When I received my new Waterpik Waterflosser Cordless Plus from Amazon, I charged it for 24 hours.  </li>
            <li> If I ran into these problems with a new unit at list prices I would not be so generous.  </li>
            <li> My wife loves this for her new braces and says it gets everything out without the hassle of the toothbrush bristles getting stuck in her braces.  </li>
            <li> Also gives her a new freshness to her breath.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this.</li>
            <li> the problem is that these should be used in the shower and the new waterpik does not have a rubber cover for the recharging input.</li>
            <li> &quot; I live in Australia where the voltage is 240V.</li>
            <li> I hope the new one lasts a bit longer than two months.</li>
            <li> and I cannot live without it.</li>
            <li> I figured it&#x27;s time for a new one anyway.</li>
            <li> I had started shopping for a new device, determined to never purchase another WaterPik flosser.</li>
            <li> WaterPik replaced my leaking unit with a new one.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even bother calling on the warranty to get a new one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m discarding the new unit and will not bother to replace it.</li>
            <li> Read the reviews about buying new adapter @</li>
            <li> The oral surgeon found nothing new.</li>
            <li> The new one is still working fine over the past year, but I have used other waterpik products more to my liking.</li>
            <li> read the reviews out there about it and 2) if you purchase it, be sure to keep your receipt/box as more than likely you will be returning it after a few months due to charging problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I literally had to plug it in over night and bet on the 50/50 chance of it actually charging or not depending on pure luck!    </li>
            <li> I expected it to clean in between teeth</li>
            <li> But it can be easily rotated by slightly turning it.</li>
            <li> This feature will make it easier to clean and to empty for travel.</li>
            <li> Ok...so if you&#x27;re in need of a great way to achieve the effect of flossing without dragging out the dreaded strings of wax that turn the tips of your fingers numb, this is the real deal.</li>
            <li> Main problem is the tip won&#x27;t stay fixed, it keeps rotating, so it sprays water everywhere</li>
            <li> Main problem is the tip won&#x27;t stay fixed, it keeps rotating, so it sprays water everywhere</li>
            <li> I bought this only a couple of months ago, it worked great, but is now completely broken and will not recharge.</li>
            <li> I expected this to last more than 4 months and would never buy another waterpik.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also not sure that it&#x27;s cleaning any better than normal floss.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend it only if you could get it at a price that would make it worth your wild to buy.</li>
            <li> had to chase up a non standard charger with an unusual input voltage and an unusual output voltage</li>
            <li> Using a waterpik is a great relief to wash away the gunk that is still left behind from floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a pocket in my gum and the dentist suggested mixing water and peroxide in equal parts to reduce inflammation, so this device makes it easy with the fluid levels marked on the side.</li>
            <li> Main problem is the tip won&#x27;t stay fixed, it keeps rotating, so it sprays water everywhere but your teeth.</li>
            <li> In short - it&#x27;s awkward at best.</li>
            <li> so you either have to fill it back up after you do one side of your mouth or be REALLY fast at getting your whole mouth done.</li>
            <li> So far this one seems to hold a charge for longer than my older ones.  </li>
            <li> (ample amount in fact since I often have contents left over) Is light and maneuverable has 2 power ratings although I only need the hi setting.</li>
            <li> Sure, it&#x27;s a bit bulkier than I would prefer, but I&#x27;ll take a useful product over a broken one any day.</li>
            <li> By the way, I&#x27;d checked prices prior to puschase and found Amazon not only got the lowest price but also provided free shipping.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s handy enough, but often lackluster in power, especially as it aged.</li>
            <li> not so much, because I had used a previous model (same company) that had more pressure for cleaning.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the device is a bit bulky and takes a good amount of space in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> I took it apart and found that the entire internal cavity housing the mechnism was filled with a slimy gray substance with the consistency of stringy Jello, which was strangling the moving parts.</li>
            <li> In the interim I got the Panasonic oral irrigator and love it:  they fixed the one weakness of the Waterflosser:  - dead or dying batteries -by making them replaceable; which also eliminates the problem of lost chargers and corroded connectors.  </li>
            <li> Main problem is the tip won&#x27;t stay fixed, it keeps rotating, so it sprays water everywhere</li>
            <li> I had the dentist put some crowns on, this Water Pick is fantastic is big, hold a lot of water, I found out that when I eat some food is left on my teeth</li>
            <li> Got one for the kid at college that she can keep charged in her room and carry to the bathroom down the hall to keep the mouth in fine order.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very loud and noisy.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that it requires recharging far too often and, if you want full speed operation, even more often.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> when the tube on my (very) old one sprung a leak, I decided to try this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The water pressure isn&#x27;t as high as the old unit...</li>
            <li> very loud, and water leaks out</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty intense, and there&#x27;s definitely a learning curve, but overall, my teeth are much freer of plaque than they used to be.</li>
            <li> , don&#x27;t worry about making a mess, life is so easy now, wish someone would&#x27;ve told me this 10 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I looked for a replacement and was interested to see the new and actually 2nd gen cordless ones but worried about the lackluster reviews.</li>
            <li> The water can get a bit messy but you learn to wrangle the beast pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Worse than my travel pik which is not as strong as a full size</li>
            <li> And yes, I had the sprayer in my mouth the whole time, but the back-splash made a huge mess!</li>
            <li> Mild diluted dish soap can be used, and a soft damp toothbrush can be used to clean hard to reach areas and crevices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She thought this would be a good idea, but it isn&#x27;t IMO.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s bulky, hard to control and aim, just as noisy as the old ones were and does not hold enough water.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s powerful enough on the low setting to pik through the spaces between teeth, though quite a bit less than the counter top model.</li>
            <li> It works well and is invaluable, as far as I&#x27;m concerned, because healthy gums mean a healthier body, and this certainly makes your gums healthier than flossing alone</li>
            <li> Since I was short on time when the first stopped working, I went to Walgreens expecting to find another WP-450, but all they stocked was a WP-360/365</li>
            <li> you use the higher pressure, you are likely to run out of water before flossing completely.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> it first in the LOW position to check your sensitivity to it.</li>
            <li> It is actually 61.4 % higher in cost.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not excessive.  </li>
            <li> The battery weakens after two washes, so do the lower inside first; then the lower outside; then the uppers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Coffee grinder loud!   </li>
            <li> It is actually 61.4 % higher in cost.</li>
            <li> My first impression is this water flosser was quite big with water reservoir and it requires some pratice to hold the flosser to make it work.</li>
            <li> First one last about 6 months and then stopped charging.</li>
            <li> The first version I bought had a larger reservoir and had to replace the unit after 7 months since it no longer accepted a charge.</li>
            <li> When I first plugged it in, I could only assume and hope that it was charging.&lt;br /&gt;Time</li>
            <li> Wow, what a difference!  </li>
            <li> My countertop version has a ring on the top of the small handheld assembly</li>
            <li> Because my bathroom is small and there&#x27;s no storage room on the sink, I love the cordless model.  </li>
            <li> In my research I was not able to find another product that seemed any better than this one which is why I ended up purchasing it.  </li>
            <li> one is the exact same thing as I had.</li>
            <li> I charged it for 24 hours prior to the first use, just as instructed.</li>
            <li> No invoice was requested, so obviously they are aware of this design flaw.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powerful and holds a charge for a long time.  </li>
            <li> When I first got it, I brushed my teeth and flossed, then used the Waterflosser</li>
            <li> Why in the world Waterpik would be willing to damage its reputation by keeping this albatross on the market is the big mystery.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it needed to be recharged but after charging it overnight I had the same problem.</li>
            <li> My hand is pretty big</li>
            <li> Without the niggles, this could be a five star product, but I give four stars for a pretty solid showing.</li>
            <li> At first the battery would last for a 2-3 day trip - then it would not hold any charge</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll check amazon next time first</li>
            <li> However, some 2 weeks ago, when the warranty year expired, it works for not more than 10 seconds after a recharge of more than 5 hours.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first time in 6 months (when I got my last root canal) that I have not been in pain from the inflammation.  </li>
            <li> My first one died in 2 months and the second one in 6 months.</li>
            <li> The first one died after a year and probably a total of 25 days&#x27; use.</li>
            <li> Downside is that you have to recharge it, but after daily use for a month, it is still on its first charge.</li>
            <li> This model is the second pik i&#x27;ve gotten that has been pretty sh&amp;tty.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But if you&#x27;re going to buy one of these you need to be aware that the current charging instructions are to either keep it on charge when not in use, or to recharge it for 24-hours after seven uses.</li>
            <li> The tab that closes the reservoir opening broke in the first or second week of use.  </li>
            <li> That has been pretty much standard for any device if this type except the waterpik.</li>
            <li> I am anxious to continue using it and seeing how much better my teeth will look (eventually)</li>
            <li> I used the first one for several years before needing a replacement.</li>
            <li> I bought the first unit in March 2012 and it worked well initially but stopped charging after three months.</li>
            <li> I purchased another Waterpik for my husband for Christmas and thought it was the same exact model.  </li>
            <li> If I can get a Waterpik to last for over a year I&#x27;ll give it a higher rating because they do get a lot of food out of my teeth.</li>
            <li> this one conks, I will replace it with the exact same one.</li>
            <li> - at first I had to refill and continue, but now I only use one fill.  </li>
            <li> Upon receipt:&lt;br /&gt;My second water pic..after 5 years the battery on my first one woudn&#x27;t hold a charge.  </li>
            <li> The high power mode on this hand held puts out less pressure than my counter top waterpik on low pressure.</li>
            <li> but I do know it&#x27;s easy to use, takes up LITTLE counter space and is rechargeable.  </li>
            <li> The water presser is a little to strong.</li>
            <li> The one really big issue I have with this appliance is that there is no way to clean and totally drain the reservoir after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> To clean deep gum pocket daily, this is the one nothing else can replace.</li>
            <li> Deep pockets will give you gingivitis, unless you clean them 2X daily.</li>
            <li> Long story short, my July cleaning went just fine, the hygienist was pleased with the results, the dentist noted that my wisdom teeth, which I&#x27;d always had a hard time keeping clean, were much cleaner than previous visits.</li>
            <li> New unit works fine but is a little noisy.</li>
            <li> MAJOR improvement two settings low and high both not as strong as the one on my other which was way too much.</li>
            <li> I find that many other water piks are bulky and messy, but this one is easy to maneuver and actually fits in my medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a dentist and don&#x27;t know how many pounds per square inch are recommended to chase scum away from teeth and gum, but where I once started out clicking up the water pressure output to high</li>
            <li> If Waterpic told the world that this thing is tricky to use, they would sell very few of them - but in truth all sophisticated gadgets have their idiosyncrasies.  </li>
            <li> It has very ample jet action and will clean a mouthful of teeth before running out of water with a little practice.</li>
            <li> I was pretty annoyed about that until I read on this site the positive customer review that included a detailed and well-conceived explanation about the care and charging of the battery.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-This unit takes up very little counter space, or goes in a drawer nicely, as compared to the larger units.</li>
            <li> so I swapped the old one onto the new one.</li>
            <li> I replaced my old portable water pik with this new version.  </li>
            <li> The new waterpik arrived 17 hours after talking to them (Amazon) and I now have the product that far outdoes the &amp;#34;new improved&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> will probably return this new one and get the old model waterpik.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE am hopefol that the new charger cord will solve the problem but am abs horrified that i may have discarded the old ones for no reason.</li>
            <li> Also, as he said, there is no indicator or light or anything to tell you whether it is fully charged which is odd.    </li>
            <li> Got my replacement unit for free in less than a week.  </li>
            <li> I slightly bent one of the tangs on the flossed so the plug fit tighter</li>
            <li> With water the electrode can be easily oxidated to become green and no protection had been considered.</li>
            <li> I think this might be bulky to carry around everyday, but if you leave this in the office it enables you to floss easily even when away from home.</li>
            <li> I really liked the unit (4 stars at least) and in considering alternatives I looked on Waterpik&#x27;s site and noted that a replacement part was sold for the female charger unit that did not look like the two prongs of the older unit that I had.  </li>
            <li> Works easily, does the job and is not as messy as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> The small size is nice and the fact that it is cordless is a big plus.</li>
            <li> Same problem - it doesn&#x27;t charge enough for a full use.</li>
            <li> I finally wound up soaking it with white vinegar, full strength, overnight.  </li>
            <li> I find that the reservoir is big enough for a full cleaning,</li>
            <li> The flow of water is quite strong, the portability of it allows me to use it in a small bathroom where I have no room for our older Waterpik flosser.</li>
            <li> Third, I put mouthwash in my mouth (crest whitening) and brush again with the sonicare and mouthwash for a second full 2 minutes of brushing.  </li>
            <li> Trying to control the tip position, hold your head over and down in the sink, tilt the body so the fluid is around the intake tube and slide the on/off button to the position desired is fairly challenging.</li>
            <li> It makes a huge mess in my opinion but thats just probably operator error.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Additionally, it&#x27;s not nearly as powerful as the original waterpick</li>
            <li> I purchased this as an alternative to a full sized model, mostly due to space requirements on my sink/vanity.</li>
            <li> Also, not knowing how long the machine sat on the shelf with the internals corroding before I bought it, it seems only fair to allow for a dead battery and score it as it runs after repair.  </li>
            <li> The new version is much better but a little larger.</li>
            <li> I previously had an electric model that was a little more powerful</li>
            <li> In short, the Waterpik Ultra WP-450 is less (performance) for more (money).</li>
            <li> I always had problems sticking with flossing as my gums tend to bleed easily and therefore never really pursued it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> The tank did seem to empty quickly, but now I can complete my mouth on one filling.</li>
            <li> Only conplant is water tank could be larger, you have to be quick.</li>
            <li> The only issue I&#x27;ve seen is that it runs out of water quickly, so have to refill several times.</li>
            <li> The negative reviews were very credible.</li>
            <li> Very loud and does not hold enough water to do your whole mouth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but I found it didn&#x27;t have nearly the pressure as the corded model, and did not hold enough water to go long enough for me.</li>
            <li> The nozzle sometime pops out of the main unit especially at the high pressure setting.    </li>
            <li> Since this is cordless and the water resevoir is in your hand and not on the counter or back of your sink, you can be more mobile in reaching all teeth and angles without spilling water or making a mess in your bathroom.  </li>
            <li> No excuse why everyone shouldn&#x27;t own one and use it at least once a day.  </li>
            <li> The result is a big mess, and consequently the applicance sits unused in my medicine cabinet most of the time.</li>
            <li> The first one didn&#x27;t have what I was looking for, so I tried the other one, and it didn&#x27;t have what I really wanted either.  </li>
            <li> one.&lt;br /&gt;This model will last one week or more on a single charge with the same amount of use.</li>
            <li> You must hold the entire large unit when you use it.</li>
            <li> If the resevoir was larger, it would be too large to be a cordless unit.</li>
            <li> The water reservoir seems large enough as well.</li>
            <li> I would say don&#x27;t bother to order the extra &amp;#34;brushes&amp;#34; unless you need them for a large family.</li>
            <li> think if you have the room, you should get the regular one with the large reservoir.</li>
            <li> You need to rock the unit back and forth a couple of times to drain all the left-over water from the large reservoir.  </li>
            <li> The pressure is well-calibrated and the water reservoir is large enough for a thorough cleaning.</li>
            <li> Compaired to the large models it quit even though its next to your ear.</li>
            <li> There are two settings, LOW AND HIGH, I just start using HIGH setting</li>
            <li> ... it&#x27;s a little too bulky to fit into a toiletries bag.  </li>
            <li> Water reservoir lasts just long enough to clean teeth thoroughly.  </li>
            <li> I then used rolled up paper towel and stuff it down into the reservoir, took a chopstick and tried to swish the crumpled paper towel around to clean the interior.  </li>
            <li> Just what I wanted....sits unobtrusively on my counter..ready to use several times a day without having to haul out from under my sink, my old reservoir model..which is too large for the counter.  </li>
            <li> A little bit of Mouthwash mixed in with the water brings forth a refreshing result.   </li>
            <li> The reservoir is too small, you can not complete a full clean unless you refill the reservoir five to six times</li>
            <li> It takes up less space on the bathroom counter than the original size one.</li>
            <li> so I may invest in the more expensive sink-top model later on, but for now this one is doing a fine job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Personally, I would like a little more pressure.  </li>
            <li> So, Amazon gets its usual high mark from me, but Waterpik should be chastized mightily for allowing this product to go out the door as ineffective as it is.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what I expected and would recommend highly.</li>
            <li> but it is a huge waste of money and resources if it has to be replaced every year.</li>
            <li> A huge waste of money.</li>
            <li> Wish Amazon made this clear on the product description.  </li>
            <li> I really miss my old corded model for the following reasons;  </li>
            <li> But clearly it make take some practice to not have 1/2</li>
            <li> unit was supposed  to clear food particles</li>
            <li> On another note, my dentist suggested running hydrogen-peroxide through the waterpik and after finishing, let the unit run a cycle of clear water through it.</li>
            <li> or it wasn&#x27;t too clear</li>
            <li> and they told me to run a couple tablespoons of vinegar along with the water through it and then clear water and that I should charge it for 48 hours.  </li>
            <li> Clearly, the batteries were dying and would not take a charge.      </li>
            <li> I still have to floss, but this does clear away the debris.</li>
            <li> Water pick developed a flaw and forces the clear plastic tube out of the base.&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I purchased this brand on the recommendation of our hygienist for my 89-yr old father.</li>
            <li> We have a 10 year old who just got braces, and his dental hygienist recommended buying this for him.  </li>
            <li> The reservoir is much easier to fill than the last one I had.  </li>
            <li> It is so loud it will wake anyone sleeping.</li>
            <li> Yes I guess it is loud as it is near you</li>
            <li> But not that loud to me(i.e.</li>
            <li> My woman says it is not that loud</li>
            <li> the old WP-360 **&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8.</li>
            <li> Allot of people keep going on about the old WP-360</li>
            <li> Allot of people keep going on about the old WP-360</li>
            <li> I ended up giving it my granddaughter (11 years old)</li>
            <li> although not quite coffee grinder loud.  </li>
            <li> and I went to their online service site yesterday to request info on how to get it fixed as the battery can&#x27;t be user replaced.  </li>
            <li> Loud as any waterpik has been for decades.  </li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.  </li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON WATERPIK.</li>
            <li> It is so loud it will wake anyone sleeping.</li>
            <li> Yes I guess it is loud as it is near you</li>
            <li> But not that loud to me(i.e.</li>
            <li> My woman says it is not that loud</li>
            <li> I always run out of water just before I complete the circle...</li>
            <li> so I could direct the stream.  </li>
            <li> My 12-year old has braces and he was struggling with the flossers and getting them in between the metal in his mouth.</li>
            <li> It fits well in my 12-year old&#x27;s hand and he can get into all the areas of his mouth with no problem.</li>
            <li> Completely unusable for the reasons already mentioned.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product about two months ago and, so far, it is working just as advertised.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far, so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I get up early and it wakes up my family.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion, it&#x27;s not too loud.</li>
            <li> The power seems to be much lower, and even lower once it encounters resistance such as your tooth or gum.</li>
            <li> BOTHERS MY NOW SENSITIVE TEETH</li>
            <li> After owning this device for 7 months, the battery has completely given up the ghost, without warning.    </li>
            <li> I sent it back immediately and spent money on a larger better one.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot and am glad I didn&#x27;t listen to the negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> I do agree with one of the comments about it being loud.  </li>
            <li> and it is not an accident, but a complete rip off.  </li>
            <li> and therefore they are DISHONEST to be sure.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying the old reliable.  </li>
            <li> Frequently my wife&#x27;s hair dryer, after usage, trips the GFI circuit and as a result no power is supplied to all the circuits unless it is reset.  </li>
            <li> I never thought that there are still parts of the developed world that still use 110 V electricity&lt;</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, with my frequent traveling I needed something simular and portable.</li>
            <li> My suggestion is use an old toothbrush and spray some Hydrogen Peroxide while scrubbing with the tooth  brush...</li>
            <li> I am NOT going to pay this much money for something built to last two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No complaints so far.</li>
            <li> Our 16 year old is still in braces.</li>
            <li> But then she can be a bit hyper sensitive at times.</li>
            <li> so I  would know when it is charging and how much of a I have left like I have on my electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> runs out of water if you tip it too far to the side</li>
            <li> This really cleans the tiny gaps of your tooth</li>
            <li> I find that the reservoir will be enough for my whole mouth.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised at what washed from between my teeth that the floss and brushing did not remove.  </li>
            <li> The low speed is gentle on teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> My next check up will be the real deciding factor.</li>
            <li> This one is working well so far and will stay charged for a week at a time.  </li>
            <li> For a 70 year old to be told her teeth look like a 30 year old&#x27;s is quite a compliment.</li>
            <li> If that gets fixed then it&#x27;s five stars.</li>
            <li> I have 9 implants and nearly all my teeth are bridged  </li>
            <li> It has two settings: low and intense.</li>
            <li> After using the Waterflosser several times I really am happen with</li>
            <li> After a few times you can use it comfortably at the sink.  </li>
            <li> Takes care of the problem completely.</li>
            <li> then it developed the battery issue.</li>
            <li> - so far it is working just as well.&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li> It is also bulky and loud.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my old travel waterpik.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see it as an improvement over the old one.</li>
            <li> The spray itself is underpowered and the battery degraded early on not holding a charge.</li>
            <li> I had the old WP-360</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it so far.</li>
            <li> and now it does not hold a charge for one complete use.</li>
            <li> It is so loud it will wake anyone sleeping.</li>
            <li> Went ahead and purchased and have been pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> and it last the whole week.</li>
            <li> The design is ergonomic and it is not as loud as people write here...  </li>
            <li> I used to have the old type waterpik that had the tank of water you had to fill.</li>
            <li> It is really too soon to tell if it will continue to chatrge, but the charger is configured differently so I hold out hope.</li>
            <li> So as far as Waterpik knew, I was one day out of warranty</li>
            <li> So as far as Waterpik knew, I was one day out of warranty</li>
            <li> The biggest problem is that the pressure it creates is much too low.</li>
            <li> still love this thing and use it at least once a day.  </li>
            <li> Tried cleaning the pins on the charger connector, hasn&#x27;t helped so far.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait till my next dental appointment to see how much improvement I&#x27;ve made</li>
            <li> I thought I was looking for the old timey water pik and saw this and thought I would give it a try.</li>
            <li> Many people may have complained about the corrosion of charging spots: both body and charger.</li>
            <li> I like it so far and for the price?</li>
            <li> I use it only for travel, and for this it&#x27;s very convenient.</li>
            <li> For this amount of money this should last much longer.  </li>
            <li> That old unit with its separate water tank had always been semi-inconvenient and noisy to use... and my irregular use of it was the result.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised at how well this works.  </li>
            <li> Some of us have sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that they completely die..</li>
            <li> It traveled directly into the trash.  </li>
            <li> My adult son got braces, so I bought this Waterpik for him, as his orthodontist recommended it.</li>
            <li> This way my whole family can use it in different places.</li>
            <li> I developed a technique that allows for this and the pattern lets me keep going without having to stop and start.  </li>
            <li> Just doesn&#x27;t have enough power to really flush out between the teeth.  </li>
            <li> and they pretty much told me they dont last long</li>
            <li> I personally needed a cordless even though I knew it wouldn&#x27;t hold as much water in one use</li>
            <li> I wish there was a battery indicator on it to let you know how much charge is left though.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for our old one.  </li>
            <li> I  like it  so far.</li>
            <li> I have had one of the old style, sit on the counter units.</li>
            <li> The one said it was loud, coffee grinder loud.</li>
            <li> Bought this for our young son with braces.  </li>
            <li> The water level lasts the whole cycle and he likes the different spray patterns.  </li>
            <li> Battery charge holds up for nearly a week.</li>
            <li> The unit wouldn&#x27;t re-charge, and I discovered that the brass contacts where the cord plugs in, had developed a layer of corrosion.</li>
            <li> I took it apart and found that one of the pump reed valves was deformed but easily fixed.  </li>
            <li> This model did not allow the tank to be emptied completely as the opening was on the side.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that it lasted a week on one charge.</li>
            <li> Product arrived properly packaged and in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li> the first charge lasted a long time and I&#x27;m just today re-charging it.</li>
            <li> the old model does have this.</li>
            <li> furthermore, i believe it uses up the water supply faster than the old model.</li>
            <li> with the old model this \\&quot;active\\</li>
            <li> completely discharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit should be fully charged before extended periods of no use.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised at the bits of debris that came out of my mouth even after brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li> &quot; WOW.</li>
            <li> it loud?  </li>
            <li> after a couple more clumsy attempts (during which I changed tips three times) and two refills I turned it off.</li>
            <li> My dental exams are markedly improved after using this.</li>
            <li> The pressure on this flosser seems to be lacking in comparison to the old Waterpik cordless flosser I had.  </li>
            <li> Broke the old one and tried this because of the price.  </li>
            <li> DOES WHAT THE BIG ONE DOES ...DOES NOT TAKE UP MUCH COUNTER SPACE ..</li>
            <li> The Cordless Plus is convenient to use, holds its charge well, and so far (5 months)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since switched over to the travel model with global voltage as it&#x27;s much easier for</li>
            <li> Do NOT waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another issue is that the unit is designed for use only with 110 - 120v electricity, which means if you have to take it to a country with 220-240v electricity, as I had to do, you must get a transformer which is additional cost and sometimes dont work very well.</li>
            <li> This waterpik completely surpasses my old technique of clearing food particles from between my teeth.</li>
            <li> The improvements are so obvious and make so much sense you have to wonder what Waterpik&#x27;s product development team are doing.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how much this water flosser is essential to my life.</li>
            <li> It is so loud it will wake anyone sleeping.</li>
            <li> My old plug-in-the-wall model bit</li>
            <li> It takes some used to getting used to as far as timing.</li>
            <li> I rated this 5 comparing it to the larger ones that I had that the tubing always breaks and is much loader.</li>
            <li> I use my flosser one or two times a day, and I have no trouble with it</li>
            <li> Reasonable power, short battery life.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found it holds enough water for one cleaning session which is really all you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My mouth feels refreshed when I finish--just like the old dental flossing.</li>
            <li> My 3 year old loves to use it too.  </li>
            <li> Only complaint I have about it is that it is kind of bulky</li>
            <li> As attractive as the whole cordless concept may be, the fact is that a standard base unit with a generous reservoir and a small, easy-to-aim handpiece connected by a small hose turns out to be the best design in my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It looked like my third attempt with this 2nd generation WP 450 would be a success.</li>
            <li> I suppose it would do in a pinch if you travel a lot, but for everyday use, much better to purchase the standard countertop unit.</li>
            <li> I hate flossing but love the feel of a super clean mouth.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s a secret no one will tell you: It may very well work better than floss, but...</li>
            <li> Also, the &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; setting is not really that powerful compared to another model (Gurin Hydroflosser)</li>
            <li> Unless you are prepared to solder on your own transformer as I had to, don&#x27;t buy this for travel overseas, besides,it is really poor anyway.  </li>
            <li> The seal had failed and the battery was fairly corroded.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not all that expensive and does a really good job.  </li>
            <li> This cordless model is a bit more difficult to control due to the size (as opposed to the small easy to handle corded models), the tip tends to swivel much too easily (easier than the corded models)</li>
            <li> when my cordless was new, &#x27;high&#x27; on it was about equal to &#x27;7&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Provides a good excuse to wipe down the bathroom mirrors since they were already wet.</li>
            <li> Tip choices (easy to switch); takes up very little space; easy to clean and fill with water (or mouth wash); relatively quite compared to the big model; delivers a powerful stream at the high setting; minimal mess if you keep your lips closed around the probe.  </li>
            <li> The old unit uses Ni-Cad batteries as the new one uses more expensive L-Ion or NiMH batteries hence the higher cost and the L-Ion battery can hold a charge longer.</li>
            <li> The old unit uses Ni-Cad batteries as the new one uses more expensive L-Ion or NiMH batteries hence the higher cost and the L-Ion battery can hold a charge longer.</li>
            <li> made a mess on my mirror, and didn&#x27;t clean between my teeth anywhere near as well as I was doing before buying it.</li>
            <li> It makes a splashy mess, but does seem to clean between my teeth</li>
            <li> This was the biggest issue, as it made it difficult to make sure the tip was facing the right direction.    </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t have a light indicating if it is charging and auttomatically shuts off when fully charged as most other units that are rechargible do.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, as is typical for many rechargeables, it seems to me that it is less powerful than my former plug-in Waterpik.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try and repair it because other reviews said the battery stops charging, anyway I dismantled it which was pretty easy and found that the problem was water and dirt had got onto the contacts on the power button so cleaned them with a swab and put a little petroleum jelly on the contacts</li>
            <li> It never held a charge for very long in the first place.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to avoid having removed and it&#x27;s really been hard to keep the gum area clean.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s a safety issue, but it is rotating way too easy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;What is not normal (or maybe it could be normal, I really don&#x27;t know)</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think they could make it smaller and still have enough water to clean one entire mouth.</li>
            <li> It is less toxic to you than Clorox and less likely to ignite from a  spark from an electric motor than EverClear alcohol which is also good to kill mold.  </li>
            <li> However, it was not out of water, it was half full.</li>
            <li> Appreciate the different brushes and the new design for filling the tank as well as the new charging method.  </li>
            <li> I am long experienced in rechargeable battery maintenance and usually amaze people with how long my cordless items last.  </li>
            <li> so I got the little one to keep my teeth clean</li>
            <li> me - dental floss goes like this - I pull out a long piece and wrap it around my fingers and start flossing - then the string breaks (is cut by my sharp teeth) - then I have to &amp;#34;re-wrap&amp;#34; - now my hands are slippy and the string loosens on my fingers and slips - more string - more breaks - soon the fingers must be dried to keep the string from slipping - then it breaks again</li>
            <li> He would have liked the reservior to be bigger so that he doesn&#x27;t have to refil as often, but being that it is cordless and smaller it fits well in our small bathroom vanity.</li>
            <li> I can take in the shower and not mess up my bathroom mirror.</li>
            <li> YEAR LATER: battery life extremely short, only 4 or 5 sessions per charge and none of them at full speed.</li>
            <li> so there is no mess.</li>
            <li> No mess</li>
            <li> I normally refill it and use it twice as it only lasts 45 seconds, but it&#x27;s so much nicer than keeping the larger one on the counter!</li>
            <li> I CHARGED IT FOR A FULL 24 HRS PRIOR TO 1ST USE AS INSTRUCTED, BUT FOUND IT TO BE GROSSLY UNDERPOWERED IN COMPARISON TO THE TRADITIONAL PLUG IN VERSION</li>
            <li> I definitely prefer it over normal flossing (despite the water mess, but then again normal flossing is also kind of messy,</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a few weeks, the high speed is still too powerful for me.  </li>
            <li> make my gums feel clean, improves circulation (due to water masaging the gums) and it gets more food particles out that floss or dental picks tend to leave behind..</li>
            <li> It takes up considerably less counter space then traditional waterpiks and even though it doesn&#x27;t hold as much water, I don&#x27;t mind having to fill it twice to keep my smile</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had two in the past that worked fine &amp;</li>
            <li> This portable unit has pressure to clean, but it is so messy to use.  </li>
            <li> The tank is SMALL, I admit and I have to fill&#x27;er up twice, but it works fine</li>
            <li> love my Waterpik, but it&#x27;s ridiculous to replace it every year.</li>
            <li> I purchased this model to replace an older water pik that finally quit.  </li>
            <li> , it holds a charge for many hours, it is small enough to take along if traveling.   </li>
            <li> love the potential of this specific unit, especially for travel, but with its likely battery problems and total lack of customer support, I would not recommend buying it.</li>
            <li> Both of these were the standard counter-top type with a reservoir on top and the nozzle/handle connected by a small hose.  </li>
            <li> The Cordless PLUS has adequate power and enough capacity to do the job, but the inexcusable problem with it is that the connector for the charging cord is totally unprotected from the water that necessarily runs all over the machine while it is in use.</li>
            <li> No more touching the gross floss</li>
            <li> The water pik water flosser is pretty effective and convenient but disappointing in the end.</li>
            <li> Eight weeks in the device wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge -- and the entire assembly where the reservoir meets the main unit was moldy.  </li>
            <li> the first one lasted for 6 months and the second one only three months.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Small enough to leave on the counter top.</li>
            <li> However, the first of these stopped working after 6 months and bought the second lasted only three months and stopped working.</li>
            <li> AS stated above the charger stopped working after the first charge, works only on 110 V and not dual voltage</li>
            <li> You can easily bye the cheaper item with little bit smaller waterbox.</li>
            <li> However, the pressure of the waterpik (on high setting) feels just enough when the battery if fully charged, and quickly decreases into less than satisfactory.</li>
            <li> major gripes about this flosser so far</li>
            <li> There are two setting for pressure, low and high.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no need for high pressures, just enough to remove the food particles.  </li>
            <li> its high pressure setting is really a low pressure setting.</li>
            <li> It has a high &amp; low switch.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a high and a low</li>
            <li> As of now we can not tell difference between high and low water pressure.</li>
            <li> You can adjust the water stream between high and low pressure.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s high or low speed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Settings are set to either high or low.</li>
            <li> Initially, the high setting on this made my gums bleed quite a bit.</li>
            <li> I just bumped it back to high setting.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend w/ flossing for your daily routine ...</li>
            <li> highly recommend water-flossing to remove junk you&#x27;d never know was back there, thus improving your breath for hours.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend using it because, as for me, it is very essential!</li>
            <li> I noticed that it was always on high setting and it could not be changed to low.  </li>
            <li> The setting cannot be changed from high to low.  </li>
            <li> I understand the reservoir issue but that is only if on the high setting, had no problem with charging, the issue I have and continue to have is there is no pressure now</li>
            <li> There are 2 settings; high and low.</li>
            <li> One tank lasts about 28 seconds and it doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s on low or high pressure.  </li>
            <li> I use it for ear lavage on low and as a dental waterpik on high.</li>
            <li> My dentist highly recommended a waterpik for my daily use.</li>
            <li> I use the high setting always with the regular jet tip.</li>
            <li> and then the high setting became like the low.  </li>
            <li> but personally I didn&#x27;t find that part significantly useful compared to the regular attachment that comes with it other than the fact the water pressure was lower in the orthodontic attachment which made it easier to get used to the whole concept of blasting water on to sensitive gums.      </li>
            <li> Fits nicely in my hand and the tank holds enough water to do half my teeth then a quick refill and the other half.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a little learning curve to holding the unit, but by the second use I was able to do the outside and inside of mygums.</li>
            <li> (I swear on my Catholic upbringing, I do not mean this the way you think</li>
            <li> (I swear on my Catholic upbringing, I do not mean this the way you think</li>
            <li> and after I use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend spending a little more and getting one with a larger tank, however it is not a big deal to refill it a couple</li>
            <li> stays charged over a good few days.&lt;br /&gt;I can fill up the little water reservoir and it will last for all of my teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And it was $10 less on Amazon (with free shipping) than at the big box stores.  </li>
            <li> But refilling is easy and takes only a few seconds.  </li>
            <li> Takes a little practice to do it right without hosing down your bathroom, but your mouth feels really clean after.  </li>
            <li> It was huge, loud, a hassle to fill, had a short tube that could accidentally get yanked, and took one of my few outlets in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> The big problem is that after about 3 weeks of normal use, the unit does not fully charge.  </li>
            <li> It works quite well, but does have only two positions, the \\&quot;low\\&quot; being too weak and the \\&quot;high\\&quot; being kind of \\&quot;low\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Secondly, for a device that is meant to be used in an environment full of water for an activity that involves a lot of water flowing and splashing around, it is not exactly water proof.  </li>
            <li> I love the travel version of my big Waterpik, actually I use it everyday and not just for travel.  </li>
            <li> Resulted in going back using normal</li>
            <li> I have a full size waterpik which I use everyday and wanted this item for travel.  </li>
            <li> Easy to fill and empty, I leave mine open to dry completely.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t plug it back in right after using it so that the socket can dry, someone commented that the nodes can get corroded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little unwieldly to hold, but you get used to it quickly.  </li>
            <li> then it&#x27;s little brother and get the job done quick.</li>
            <li> The resevoir is large enough to do a twice daily cleaning.</li>
            <li> Not the case easy to use and gets to those hard to reach places.  </li>
            <li> They should make a portable device with a seperate tank with a hose - something similar to the regular full size model, but with a smaller tank, shorter hose, and smaller handle.  </li>
            <li> I was buying the handheld because my bathroom sink is a pedestal-type with only a tiny ledge, not big enough to handle the full size, boxy, corded waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I decided it is not worth taking a chance on this model again as more than likely the same problem will occur so will be purchasing a different brand.</li>
            <li> I would be required to purchase an entire new tank for $8 plus shipping.  </li>
            <li> Finally got it to charge but decided to order the new model wp450 ultra.  </li>
            <li> I was foolish enough to give a new one a chance.  </li>
            <li> I bought my Phillips Sonicare toothbrush at the same time, and it&#x27;s still working like new, so</li>
            <li> The dealer executed a warranty claim and I just got a new one (not the same model)</li>
            <li> I sent the Cordless back today and ordered a new Waterpik Ultra.</li>
            <li> I sent the Cordless back today and ordered a new Waterpik Ultra.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this new cordless Waterpik for several weeks</li>
            <li> Since it has a very short warranty, a year I believe, I had to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> Replaced it with a corded waterpik and a new shelf next to the sink.  </li>
            <li> Because how itwas listed when you put Waterpik into the search boox, a different irrigator is snuggled in below the waterpiks and says its the NEW AND IMPROVED version MISLEADING one to believe it is also by waterpik.</li>
            <li> I chatted with Amazon and they said they would send me a new waterpk on SAME DAY SERVICE at their expense for the confusion.</li>
            <li> The new unit is having the same problem.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m debating whether to go through the dance to get it warrantied or just junk it and get a new one (possibly not Waterpik brand).  </li>
            <li> Waterpik sent me a new one and now 6 months in I am having the same problem.</li>
            <li> We are on vacation with our new Waterpik and want our money back.  </li>
            <li> It leaked water in big puddles after emptying, but I could live with that.</li>
            <li> It was noisy and screamed when the water got low, but I could live with that.</li>
            <li> I notice the new units in the stores have only a 1-year warranty.</li>
            <li> Meaning that: while new, I would only need to recharge it after say, six uses.</li>
            <li> On this new model I noticed a redesign of the charging connection and the charger itself is different.  </li>
            <li> nope, just not enough umph even brand new &amp; fully charged.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I truly do love this little bugger!!!  </li>
            <li> It tries to miniaturize its traditional water flosser into a smaller version, but still cumbersome version, and keeps the cordless and potentially easily portable version constrained with the above</li>
            <li> L-Ion / NiMH batteries do not suffer from this problem that I know of, but it is always better to only charge any battery after it loses its charge.</li>
            <li> L-Ion / NiMH batteries do not suffer from this problem that I know of, but it is always better to only charge any battery after it loses its charge.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised that this one isn&#x27;t too loud yet still has the same pressure.    </li>
            <li> I use my regular waterpik daily but it takes up so much space when traveling.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is loud but every water pick I have ever tried has been loud and given that you only use it for 30 seconds in my opinion</li>
            <li> I use it only sometimes because the lowest selection (it only has two) is too intense for my gums.</li>
            <li> Even on low, the amount of fluid squirting through the jet is to much.</li>
            <li> With all the problems above, I actually don&#x27;t care too much on this.    </li>
            <li> I had the prior model and this is a big improvement in handling it as it has a curved body now instead of straight.</li>
            <li> However the tank is not big enough to do the whole mouth.</li>
            <li> It is not as powerful and holds much less water.  </li>
            <li> I should be able to use it at least 2-3 times before having to charge it again instead of the one time that I&#x27;m currently getting.</li>
            <li> my only least favorite thing is that I travel for work</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t blame this on the product itself since I should have realized that a cordless Waterpik with this capacity was going to be big, but it does not fit comfortably in my hand.  </li>
            <li> I have found that the smaller, &amp;#34;waterpik&amp;#34; flosser does the job every bit as well, and is much easier to pack for travel if necessary.</li>
            <li> so I try to really hit my rough spots early on.  </li>
            <li> for its effectiveness, my teeth definitely feel cleaner but the real test will come when I see my dentist next.</li>
            <li> times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am currently using the tip that has a lot of brushes on the end as it does not seem to be as intense as the regular tip.  </li>
            <li> Yes, presently, I have to refill frequently, but in my opinion, it&#x27;s a minor inconvenience compared to a large unit sitting on the counter</li>
            <li> Whatever, the old electric pik was easier to control, just a tiny attachment on a long tube, easy to aim and didn&#x27;t tend to send water down my arm and onto my pajama&#x27;s arm like this cordless one does.  </li>
            <li> my only complaints I have about it is it&#x27;s very loud and it leaks.  </li>
            <li> Liked cordless feature for ease of use and smaller profile for counter space, however jet stream was simply too weak compared to old corded model I was replacing.</li>
            <li> The thing comes with clear instructions to charge it like 24 hours before first use, and to NOT run it all the way down.</li>
            <li> It will make a huge mess in your toilet if you plan to use it with a mirror.</li>
            <li> I actually got a customer service rep in less than 5 minutes, to whom I explained my problem to, and then I provided her with the serial number and the model number of the machine, and she assured  me that it would be no problem, and they would send another one out as a replacement right away!</li>
            <li> I just need to decide if the mess is worth it.</li>
            <li> The only other cordless oral hygiene product I can compare it to in terms of its lifespan and design is the Phillips sonic toothbrush,  My original toothbrush lasted 5+ years before dying and had indicator to inform you the level of charge left and/or amount of the battery charged during recharging.  </li>
            <li> This is my first Waterpik and I bought due to braces.  </li>
            <li> Took back to the store and exchanged for another one, and had the exact same problem with the second one.  </li>
            <li> There were suggestions given in other reviews how to make the first one work again</li>
            <li> One major disadvantage is I won&#x27;t have the option of using mouthwash (e.g. Listerine) instead of water alone in the spray with it.    </li>
            <li> I was in target the other day and found this exact one for cheaper than I paid here.</li>
            <li> But the funny thing is that the same problem happened to my relative&#x27;s Waterpiks after the same period of time!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve followed the care instructions, but the fact that it&#x27;s cordless is the major problem.</li>
            <li> I love the way my teeth feel after using it, but it is messy, and the water doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> product did take a little getting used to the first time i used it and took longer than 60 seconds!</li>
            <li> However, it is cordless and lasts a very long time without recharging (I barely have to charge it) which is really convenient.</li>
            <li> I find this model has plenty of power and lasts long enough to get a single clean out of the water reservoir.</li>
            <li> It is adequate but the water stream is not nearly as powerful as the tradiional model nor does it hold enough water.</li>
            <li> I had a difficult time using regular floss and this works great, especially with 2 different pressures of the water.</li>
            <li> It is powerful enough for me, but I never used the larger unit above the third setting anyway.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say how many times I left it to charge for 24 hours and came back to use it, only to find out it was still dead.</li>
            <li> BUT, my daughter never used a previous model so this feels right to her.</li>
            <li> Overall the waterpik performs as advertised and thus far I have found no down side.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t any way to clean this reservoir either unless you can get a brush into the small hole and even so, you would need to bleach it to kill all the bacteria.  </li>
            <li> Small water capacity sometimes not finish to clean and have to refill&lt;br /&gt;Oxidation on the battery charger conector</li>
            <li> Lighter, more portable, much less trouble than those clunky reservoir units of old.</li>
            <li> On about ONLY the 6th use, half way through a session, the pressure suddenly dropped and the sound of the pump increased...</li>
            <li> tank last just long enough for me and the battery life is better than I expected, lasting a couple weeks on one charge.</li>
            <li> My dentist&#x27;s lab tech said I needed something more than brushing, and she knew I had trouble flossing due to my permanent bridges.</li>
            <li> one even had 3 streams which I did not see as being useful), but I only find use for the regular single stream nozzle; all the others can be discarded.  </li>
            <li> I admit that I purchased the unit locally rather than on Amazon because I was not sure that the unit on Amazon would be the re-designed unit or the old original.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that with practice you get the job done in less time and with less refills.</li>
            <li> The reservoir is SMALL enough to easily be held, emptied back out, and to fit under the faucet in a small sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s plenty to clean your mouth, front and back, all the way around, a few times on a fill.</li>
            <li> Not only does it clean debris between teeth and gums, it has removed a lot of a patch of tarter in just a few days with twice a day use.</li>
            <li> (My brother recommended this particular model and tip type, and he says his gum pockets were noticeable smaller are using it regularly).</li>
            <li> - It came with extra tips with different names and shapes, but I just use the classic one.</li>
            <li> I was lucky to have purchased from a big box store with a 90 day return policy (yes, this happened to me in less than 90 days).</li>
            <li> Because of their inherent convenience and ease of use, I am a big fan of battery-powered oral irrigators and have had several of Waterpik&#x27;s older WP-360W model.</li>
            <li> The fact that it did actually work, and kinda decently, for a couple months, is the only reason it didn&#x27;t get a 1-star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had major problems with gingivitis that developed suddenly.</li>
            <li> You only have two choices, low and high.  </li>
            <li> The low setting is pretty much worthless and the intense as I&#x27;ve already stated is more a setting of \\&quot;4\\&quot; on my older Waterpik Ultra.</li>
            <li> In general terms I like the device</li>
            <li> This one has two speeds setting, which is not strong enough to clean teeth.</li>
            <li> especially when so many people on this review board said that it was not a good machine.  </li>
            <li> As to it not running long enough, this one really leaves me wondering.</li>
            <li> Amazon should have known this and made it clear that this model will only run on 110 volts.</li>
            <li> The real test of these things is how long do they Last.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First let me start by saying that this was my first waterflosser, and since I&#x27;ve never liked flossing I was really looking forward to this being good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve only used it once.  </li>
            <li> water is all over the place, the reservoir is EMPTY, and user is ready to throw it against the wall.    </li>
            <li> Apparently, the reservoir was leaking and air-borne or water-borne</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s only one year old</li>
            <li> Time will tell, and I will update my review if any problems come up in near future.</li>
            <li> I have another Waterpik at home (works completely on electricity) has a very low setting</li>
            <li> As a result, it sat in my bathroom closet for nearly three years before I finally tossed it in the trash.  </li>
            <li> The third one (the Professional model)</li>
            <li> The problem I had with mine, is that it stopped working entirely when it was four months old.</li>
            <li> I travel frequently and take a current converter with me anyway,</li>
            <li> Split decision because there&#x27;s no storage for extra heads in or near the unit.</li>
            <li> next thing I noticed was that, try as I might, there was no way to get all of the desired angles without causing the unit to suck air because the reservoir, naturally, must move with the handle.  </li>
            <li> battery barely makes 2 weeks, not that</li>
            <li> pics come only with complete box.</li>
            <li> and apparently it takes practice.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, more difficult to clean since the reservoir has only a small round egress that does not allow all the water to be emptied.</li>
            <li> I bought this one after my old one pooped out after only a year of use.</li>
            <li> My gums are much healthier and exhibit a pink color.  </li>
            <li> It is far inferior to the regular plug in version.</li>
            <li> it will not recharge - takes me a minimum of 3 tries to get it to really charge.  </li>
            <li> (especially if you don&#x27;t flush or have sensitive gums).</li>
            <li> can i take it in my back pack to school/office - absolutely yes (not too big for a pocket in back</li>
            <li> I just replaced my old one with this model, after constant use for three years.</li>
            <li> This portable one is a bit larger than I imagined but not heavy.</li>
            <li> Wow - it&#x27;s a different machine:  </li>
            <li> They all worked for years but this one worked for barely 5 weeks, then died..</li>
            <li> finished water flossing, we recommend completely emptying the internal pump housing of water.</li>
            <li> After careful brushing and flossing, there are still bits of food that are flushed out from the gums, and your mouth feels much cleaner after using your Waterpik,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quieter and completely tolerable when it&#x27;s pumping fluid.  </li>
            <li> Thus, I spent as much time drying out the electrical connections as using it on my mouth.  </li>
            <li> The Waterpik is a vital part of my daily dental hygiene.</li>
            <li> Not so apparently, I asked a friend who is an electrical engineer to check it out - his verdict is that there must be a fault with the device.</li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t tried using all the different tips.</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to temperature, especially in the winter, so I run the hottest tap water, and it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.  </li>
            <li> As I noted in an earlier review of my experience with several of my last few counter top models......  BEWARE of MOLD buildup internally.....</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m covering up the hole with tape during normal usage and only charging it when it&#x27;s going low.</li>
            <li> I have several crowns, bridges and implants, made necessary because all my life I&#x27;ve had an auto-immune disease that prevents me from producing a normal level of saliva.  </li>
            <li> However the hygiene is worth the trouble.</li>
            <li> I liked the look of the one with the brush attached, thinking it would be quite efficient - wrong -</li>
            <li> I have a small bathroom and no counter space for the full size waterpik.</li>
            <li> ANYWAY, IF YOU HAVE THE UNIT LOOK AT IT BEHIND THE WATER RESERVOIR AND MAKE SURE</li>
            <li> Sometimes I take more time squirting, so I have to refill the reservoir, but that takes approximately 5 seconds to do.</li>
            <li> After a few days of working beautifully the battery on both failed to charge.</li>
            <li> being this small, it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> That pause button is very useful and shouldn&#x27;t be that hard to implement on the Waterpik Ultra.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take up much room on the counter, and I have now gotten the wrist action down</li>
            <li> reading the reviews on this water flosser as I am looking for a replacement, there has been a very high volume of complaints about the unit not charging at less than 1 year old.  </li>
            <li> As far as water capacity goes, I usually am done flossing right about the time I&#x27;m about out of water.  </li>
            <li> (I am at least on week 3 of the initial charge; it is still going strong).  </li>
            <li> so I won&#x27;t have to live too long without it?    </li>
            <li> did have a problem after a long time of using mine, but since it has a warranty, I e-mailed the company, and they sent me a brand new one.&lt;br /&gt;Great customer service.</li>
            <li> Since I had long since thrown out the box and paperwork I had forgotten that there was a two-year warranty on it and went ahead a bought a new one.</li>
            <li> (the number is on their website) and as long as you are in the warranty period, they&#x27;ll send a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My first unit lasted about a year and a half</li>
            <li> The stream is much too weak to be useful to me.</li>
            <li> When I first started using the Ultra, I had to start on the low setting due to gum sensitivity.    </li>
            <li> Not sure what other people are using it for that they need more than that.</li>
            <li> The first one, due to corrosion on the charge wiring and male connectors of the unit.</li>
            <li> but if I&#x27;m quick I can usually get my teeth done unless there&#x27;s some food</li>
            <li> The only hitch, which I blame the manufacturer, is there are only 2 settings for the water flow, high or low.</li>
            <li> The play between high and low pressure is slight and often high comes on with a slight move of the hand and ouch too much power on the gums!</li>
            <li> Now it operates fine for ONLY 3 seconds then quickly loses all its power.</li>
            <li> and I have hardly a cleaning where I don&#x27;t need to clean myself and</li>
            <li> On the other hand, I really did like this one</li>
            <li> My husband suggested I get this for my bridge - it&#x27;s hard to get between the bridge to clean.  </li>
            <li> They say it is because of hard water and to clean it with vinegar and change the tip.</li>
            <li> I was unsure about getting this or the countertop model but decided on this one as the other one seemed much too bulky to display on the countertop.</li>
            <li> I still floss at night but very seldom is any other residue dislodged.  </li>
            <li> and it is hard to clean it out.  </li>
            <li> Water in the storage part last long enough for me to do my whole mouth, what else do you need?</li>
            <li> True enough, I got it in a few days with no extra charge.</li>
            <li> I am comparing this new Cordless PLUS unit to the old one, not against other cordless units.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noise</li>
            <li> I use on low pressure because the high pressure depletes the water too fast and makes an even bigger mess.  </li>
            <li> It is easier for me to simply leave the little spout in one place and hold the waterpik with two hands and very carefully trace the gum/tooth line for the top and bottom front and bottom back.  </li>
            <li> The product itself looks a little clunky in a very modern bathroom so my wife makes me store it under the sink rather than leaving it</li>
            <li> Furthermore, my jaw appreciates that I don&#x27;t have to open it very wide to have clean gums and minimal pockets.  </li>
            <li> Well, if one avoid pour the unit it would work fine, but this is not a good idea for anything used in a bathroom.</li>
            <li> Still, at least the contacts have stayed clean, but it does seem that Waterpik could design a waterproof way to close the portal when it&#x27;s not in use, or even a sealed arrangement with inductive charging.  </li>
            <li> You will need to stop and refill at least 5 times to clean your mouth once.   </li>
            <li> But I freely admit that I can&#x27;t think of how such a system could be worked out without some complex system of automatically-operated valves or the like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really wish I had counters in either bathroom to just get a standard countertop tank Waterpik, but we&#x27;re stuck with standalone sinks.</li>
            <li> I am always surprised by what is washed out of my gums, especially if I had brushed first.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only takes a couple of tries to become very proficient at using.  </li>
            <li> Also, to the person who says it lasts 10 seconds, can you imagine how big this thing would be to hold a few minutes worth of water?</li>
            <li> The small charging station and handle reservoir make this so handy for small spaces and travel.</li>
            <li> Only draw back is that you have to get use to the product because the water comes out rather quickly &amp; can be messy.</li>
            <li> I love the little brush attachment it came with as opposed to the plain tube.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I gave myself a facial and washed the mirror down.</li>
            <li> it had a little higher pressure.  </li>
            <li> I use this in the morning only and it has been a major benefit.&lt;br /&gt;At 64</li>
            <li> If I could change something, I wish the higher strength setting was a little bit stronger, but I guess that is the sacrifice you make with a portable unit.  </li>
            <li> However, our first one lasted a little over a year then quit.</li>
            <li> I have owned two (three, if you count the first one which never worked due to an initial battery problem) lesser WaterPik flossers.  </li>
            <li> The other reviews have accurated stated that it takes a little effort to get comfortable with using this item.  </li>
            <li> The reservoir&#x27;s filling hole is too small to do anything more than rinse it out, and even in a dry climate it doesn&#x27;t dry out between uses.  </li>
            <li> can select water pressure (strong, weak).</li>
            <li> If you live long enough ever one will need one.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Highly recommend to anyone who wants to give up conventional string flossing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first problem with this model is the capacity, which is about half the size of the regular model.  </li>
            <li> The small reservoir needs to be refilled several times to do an adequate job.</li>
            <li> the water reservoir is larger but, on high, does not last as long (42 seconds).</li>
            <li> for general rinsing only, and doesn&#x27;t replace the dentist.</li>
            <li> This works really well and works with my other cleaning tips on my larger waterpik.</li>
            <li> I just used it for the first time and it was a total mess.</li>
            <li> Really like the item until I had to recharge about every other day then daily.</li>
            <li> The earlier model was a barely working toy.  </li>
            <li> There is no excuse to market this junk.  </li>
            <li> I barely get one use out of it after charging for several hours.</li>
            <li> Now, a twelve-hour charge barely gives me three or four days, same amount of time nightly.</li>
            <li> This has never work well at all, I had to finally go out &amp; buy another one, I feel I should be able to return this and at least get a partial credit.</li>
            <li> First few uses</li>
            <li> Then more recently for several months now, its been leaking water and it keeps getting worse.</li>
            <li> My first one (the Plus model) basically fried the battery with green foam pouring out of the charging slot.  </li>
            <li> teeth were so sore the first few weeks and</li>
            <li> It was small and powerful.</li>
            <li> It is a bit messy to use at first, but got the hang of using it soon.</li>
            <li> First one lasted a few weeks before doing this.</li>
            <li> I notice that my gums bleed for the first few days of use.  </li>
            <li> you have to really hang over the sink so you don&#x27;t get water all down your front.</li>
            <li> This Waterpik may feel a little bit bulky at first compared to a regular toothbrush</li>
            <li> corded model takes a little more counter space but not much more.</li>
            <li> Though the time is given, this waterpik is a short-lived glory; the water runs out quickly, and the pressure isn&#x27;t as hard as I was used to with a plug-in type.</li>
            <li> The tank quickly drained and I had a hard time controlling the water as I flossed.</li>
            <li> The reservoir is one piece molded plastic, and except for the small filler opening, there is no way to clean and dry it -</li>
            <li> it is not that much of the difference from previous one.  </li>
            <li> However, it works very well and recovers hidden food particles all of the time.</li>
            <li> At least the company is willing to replace the units that die young.</li>
            <li> I would barely feel the water stream hitting my teeth, but then I noticed that several food particles would come out, even after doing a regular floss.  </li>
            <li> like you normally would- just to get the minimal amount of respect and for them to believe that their product is actually malfunctioning.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize just how thin and strong the water stream is.  </li>
            <li> We love to take road trips in a tiny little sports car, where space is at a minimum, and in the past it meant leaving the Waterpik at home.</li>
            <li> One reviewer said they don&#x27;t last because the parts don&#x27;t fit tight enough and water entering the interior ruins them prematurely.</li>
            <li> Pump motor is not able to spray the water - but runs fine when empty!</li>
            <li> I have a Waterpik for home use in my bathroom, but it is a little too large to travel with.</li>
            <li> - It is a little large to travel.  </li>
            <li> it is pretty loud - I live in a condo, and at night I&#x27;m almost concerned it might wake up my neighbors (that said, this might not be as dramatic when you&#x27;re not the one who holds it in hand)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live with the fact that it loses it&#x27;s whole charge after about 2 1/2 days though.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve made a few improvements to this new model, but I never had any problem with the old one.</li>
            <li> Also, this has two power settings, Low or High, where the other one is continuously adjustable over a wider range of pressures.  </li>
            <li> It did clean my mouth rather well, its small and compact, it fit nicely on my small sink, and although I had to refill it a few times for the entire mouth, this did not bother me.  </li>
            <li> &#x27;S BACK, WHEN I SAW IT, THE WHOLE INSIDE WAS COVERED IN BLACK MOLD.</li>
            <li> , that actually makes it a fast job -- as they say in the instructions, about a minute and a half</li>
            <li> , that actually makes it a fast job -- as they say in the instructions, about a minute and a half</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it runs out of water quickly.</li>
            <li> but there is no good way to clean the tank.</li>
            <li> It seems to not have as much water pressure as the other models that have a separate water reservoir and a long cord attached.</li>
            <li> The larger tip is useless; it pours out too much water and empties the water reservoir too quickly.</li>
            <li> The water power itself is decent; it&#x27;s definitely not as powerful as a plug-in flosser</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind spending money for a piece of poor engineering and replace it every 8-12 months it works fine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After the quick failure of the replacement sent by Waterpik, outlined below, I e-mailed them about it.</li>
            <li> It also gives less control over angling the thing in the right way, and combined with the moving tip, it&#x27;s just that much harder.    </li>
            <li> I CANNOT believe this little machine could do THAT much in ONE use.</li>
            <li> Using the waterpik, I see many small particles being removed!!!</li>
            <li> Our (new) dentist recommended that we both start using a WaterPik and Sonicare electric toothbrushes due to &amp;#34;issues&amp;#34; with our gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a tight jaw, so I can&#x27;t really get to my back teeth with regular floss.  </li>
            <li> need that size for travel (3-4 days of the week) and are now considering buying an additional more cumbersome base unit that is far better at flossing and cleaning the teeth, even though it is not suitable for travel.</li>
            <li> It comes with a very small water container which you can run out of water quickly, you have to refill three or four times to get work done.</li>
            <li> I use very warm water and turn on the pik so that the initial cold water (which remains from my previous use)goes into the sink, not my mouth.  </li>
            <li> Despite being rechargeable, It works just as well as my old hard wired apparatus that took up too much space.</li>
            <li> Only 2 water pressure speeds and high is not powerful enough after using for 1-2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> The only drawback is that the water pressure isn&#x27;t as high as I would like, but that is a personal preference, and one that should not be an issue for the average user.</li>
            <li> The only think I found annoying in the beginning is that the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; button in not also the &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; button - two separate buttons for each state and that took some time for me to learn :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are plenty of things that I use every single day but none have made such a significant difference to my health.</li>
            <li> bad quality for a good name.</li>
            <li> Good idea, bad implementation.</li>
            <li> It really gets the crude out from between the teeth and works better than just flossing alone.</li>
            <li> Since the unit can only suck up water when it&#x27;s being held more or less vertically, that seriously restricts the possible aim angles of the nozzle.  </li>
            <li> Now I place a piece of clear tape over the terminals until the unit needs to be charged; I only charge the unit when the battery is spent.</li>
            <li> and, although it is small enough to easily store in the bathroom cabinet, I believe the reservoir could be a little larger without compromising the portability of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> People complaining that this thing isn&#x27;t quite powerful enough, I&#x27;m not sure what they&#x27;re using this for!  </li>
            <li> But the battery giving out after 4 months, when I was careful about keeping it on the recharge most of the time, is ridiculous!</li>
            <li> Recently it broke down, so I decided to try new model.</li>
            <li> The 360 reservoir is a little small but works fine.</li>
            <li> A little messy to use, and have to refill the water couple of times, but it leaves my teeth clean.</li>
            <li> The pressure is a little low even on the high setting, but on the upside it doesn&#x27;t wake up the neighbors like the plugin ones I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> and I unwind the whole slippery mess from my fingers and dump it and give - up)!</li>
            <li> What I observed on this new water jet was the charger contact is now enclosed in plastic and has been moved to the back of the unit where their is less chance of water getting in to the charger contacts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What I observed on this new water jet was the charger contact is now enclosed in plastic and has been moved to the back of the unit where their is less chance of water getting in to the charger contacts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> battery just died in less than 6 months, at which time cannot be recharged.&lt;br /&gt;Happy to buy a new battery, but cannot open the unit to find a removeable battery.&lt;br /&gt;Get</li>
            <li> Replacement tips are very brittle, so they break easily, are non-standard, and impossible to find in a store.   </li>
            <li> I like the idea behind the waterpik, but unfortunately they use very cheap parts which break quickly.  </li>
            <li> First time around I bought a less expensive flosser - which did not last long-this one does even better than I expected!!</li>
            <li> So what I did was buy a clear hose at home depot, shoved it onto the handle nozzle, and the other end into an 42 oz.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even know if it accomplishes anywhere near what my other waterpik does.  </li>
            <li> I got one of these for Christmas 2008 and agree with the other review that it&#x27;s loud --</li>
            <li> /&gt;Battery - Lasts longer than other electric toys of that power (like electric razors) and has kept charge so far.</li>
            <li> so I can only use Glide floss, but I also have pockets that collect food in the back plus my gums usually would bleed every time I flossed regardless of how gentle I was.  </li>
            <li> I read the reviews about the battery not lasting long enough or holding enough water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> is not easy to reach your teeth from backsides   but in general, it is way better than the traditional flossing for your gum but not great for removing 100% of the food leftovers between your molars    </li>
            <li> this product is very bulky to use and not very handy.</li>
            <li> The only major complaint is the lack of high power, and I guess for now that is compensated for by the lower price and convenient smaller size</li>
            <li> it does an okay job; my minor complaints are mere inconveniences.  </li>
            <li> If Waterpik wants to know: please put a small LED-type battery strength indicator on the next model.  </li>
            <li> I had previously read reviews by others and was concerned about the constant refilling of water before the entire mouth was completely cleaned.  </li>
            <li> In the distant past I used a corded waterpik, but eventually gave it up - not finding it useful.  </li>
            <li> Has been acting &amp;#34;finicky&amp;#34; switching off unpredictably and nursed back into action for months.  </li>
            <li> As of today, the charge doesn&#x27;t last long enough for one flossing.  </li>
            <li> There is no specific instructions on how long to charge the battery for aside from the initial charge.</li>
            <li> The charge last long enough, I have not had it run out on me before the water runs out.</li>
            <li> Have used one of these for several years now, long enough to wear out the battery &amp; put plenty of wear &amp; tear on it.  </li>
            <li> I could tell in the first few seconds that her scraping was minimal.  </li>
            <li> A little less powerful than the plug-in variety.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product because my old 350 M finally broke down.  </li>
            <li> I am on my third one, different brand, which is only a few months old, so we shall see how this one will be....</li>
            <li> First one stopped working after about a year because we have hard water</li>
            <li> Finally after about one year, the gears that make contact between the motor and the pump simply kept skipping and it got to a point beyond repair even for somebody like me who really kept trying hard to make it work.</li>
            <li> The reservoir is so small that it empties before you are ready to stop using it.</li>
            <li> The reservoir is so small that it empties before you are ready to stop using it.</li>
            <li> Read the instructions, first thing is to charge it for at least 10 hours, or overnight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I like this too much.  </li>
            <li> the reservoir is so small that it empties before you are ready to stop using it.</li>
            <li> As for the Waterflosser, the reservoir is much too small.</li>
            <li> It works very well, considering its small size.</li>
            <li> The reservoir is so small that it empties before you are ready to stop using</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it is because the Waterflosser is cordless and does not have as much power, but this was not cleaning my teeth and gums so I returned it.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use in my dorm because I&#x27;m too lazy to take care of a plug-in unit, and also because it would take up too much space on the counter.</li>
            <li> It does not last over the long haul.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually going to ask for a refund no matter how long it takes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely not as loud as a standard plugged-in Waterpik.</li>
            <li> only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is, after all the comments about the battery charger, the fact that there is no &#x27;low battery&#x27; indicator is a minus for the overall design/functionality of the product.  </li>
            <li> As long as I keep it plugged in, it seems to work, but only for about three fillings.   </li>
            <li> and they told me I shouldnt let it go flat</li>
            <li> The tips are long enough that I can put it in my mouth and sort of seal my lips around it.   </li>
            <li> But in about a week the batteries were flat and I had to recharge it, but with no result.</li>
            <li> We have had 2 WP360s and their life was about 1 year with no apparent possibility of repair.      </li>
            <li> We have not had the WP450 long enough to assess its longevity.  </li>
            <li> Battey doesn&#x27;t last long before you have to recharge.  </li>
            <li> To extend the battery life for as long as possible, the user manual recommends keeping the unit plugged in for charging ALL the time EXCEPT during use.  </li>
            <li> They never last too long...</li>
            <li> It runs long enough</li>
            <li> The internal battery hold a long charge.</li>
            <li> They are more expensive now and not very well made to last.  </li>
            <li> They do not last long for the money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how long it will last (3 months &amp; counting at the moment)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lets wait and see how long will it last</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve made a long research on different brands and types of waterflosses.</li>
            <li> How long does it last after one charge - a week, given i floss 3-5 times/day</li>
            <li> before it finally became unusable, it was like &#x27;3&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;-it takes too long to charge.</li>
            <li> The Battery cannot last for long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this is portable with a long lasting battery.</li>
            <li> (excuse the gross out) to, ahem, spit.  </li>
            <li> (excuse the gross out) to, ahem, spit.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the only (minor) issue I have with it.  </li>
            <li> Battery doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to judge the length of time</li>
            <li> I found it very difficult to use effectively.</li>
            <li> What everyone says re poor battery life is true.  </li>
            <li> After using my new flosser for a little bit over a year it died and stopped charging.</li>
            <li> It was decent pre-braces, I&#x27;d generally make it to the end on one fill but now with braces I have to fill it up 2-3 times at least.</li>
            <li> My main reason for purchasing the cordless model is the fact that my small, vintage bathroom has a wall mounted sink and NO counter space, thus no place for a traditional water flosser to sit while in use.</li>
            <li> The only negative, and I guess it has to be, is that it is large in size.</li>
            <li> A little messy until you get used to it but worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is just a design flaw but the high and low sometimes work.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Regarding the charging not working after a few months (as many people have complained about), the other reviewer here correctly explained the issue (the contact points stop contacting the cord to receive the charge).</li>
            <li> I purchased the second unit and only after a few months, the same symptom appeared on the new unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to one of the other reviews, I looked at the connector at the bottom of the unit and</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product unless you can buy a new one every few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I keep the fill cap lid open to help it dry out.  </li>
            <li> This cordless waterpik is more awkward to use than the traditional tank-type waterpik.  </li>
            <li> However, there&#x27;s no way that you can dry this area properly after using the unit without the aid of a blow dryer.</li>
            <li> less tartar build up so far than with flossing</li>
            <li> but then it would get bigger and perhaps more awkward.  </li>
            <li> It was not good in the first place, charge was not enough to use by just two people twice a day.</li>
            <li> Now it has stopped working completely - all of this in less than 12 months.</li>
            <li> Less than a year old.  </li>
            <li> The smaller capacity means I have to refill it at least once to floss my entire mouth, and the fill door is not in a particularly convenient place...</li>
            <li> Not only did it have absolutely NO power (and, believe me, I know that I charged it properly)</li>
            <li> I realized this a few weeks later the it was completely discharged.</li>
            <li> The water reservoir is big enough to allow for 30 - 40 sec of flossing at a time.</li>
            <li> The intensity settings are just low and&lt;br /&gt;high, but not really &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; as the regular model.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powerful enough to dislodge particles without irritating the gums.</li>
            <li> Using a waterpik certainly makes a big difference in cleaning my teeth - pity it is not more robust.</li>
            <li> This compares to cancelling a magazine subscription earlier in the day, that took five minutes of voice mail prompts, and never a live person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The size of it isn&#x27;t necessarily convenient if you have limited bathroom storage space.  </li>
            <li> The Waterpik works well, but has limited features, such as pressure settings.</li>
            <li> Yes, to do both upper and lower gums requires a single refill for me which  takes about 10 seconds.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After reading both the negative and positive reviews for this product I decided to try it b/c</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, even though I only use the Ultra at about 60% of the full power setting I found the Cordless Plus did not provide equal power even at its highest setting.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also comes with several different tips for different purposes although it is sometimes hard to reach far ends of the mouth.</li>
            <li> However, the oring which seals the water chamber seems a bit loose and I am thinking I should send it back for replacement.</li>
            <li> I wish the Waterpik company would design a battery operated waterpik with a large reservoir that&#x27;s ergodynamic;  now how hard could that be?</li>
            <li> This should last as long as you keep the charge port dry to prevent corrosion.</li>
            <li> It just is not strong enough to do a complete job of flossing.  </li>
            <li> This new model is not easy to drain after it has been used.  </li>
            <li> And if you tip the unit even slightly while using it (which is inevitable unless you&#x27;re a contortionist), the water flow stops and you get blasted with an ear-piercing high pitched whirring sound.</li>
            <li> It works fine, don&#x27;t get me wrong.</li>
            <li> Ergonomically this isn&#x27;t necessarily an upgrade from previous models despite their advertised claims, rather it&#x27;s a clunky more difficult design.</li>
            <li> Given that this is such an obvious flaw (and I have read it in a number of other reviews)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love it but the previous model did not last 9 months.  </li>
            <li> In a very small bathroom, it&#x27;s really the only choice.</li>
            <li> Yes that is usually the case for older models.</li>
            <li> Yes that is usually the case for older models.</li>
            <li> The unit is a little bukly but is not heavy.  </li>
            <li> : The charger is 110/120V only meaning it&#x27;s not suitable for frequent international travelers.  </li>
            <li> However, its not really good for short trips or on airlines because its fairly large.  </li>
            <li> I wish the reservoir was a little larger as I generally refill before I am finished.</li>
            <li> I am really trying hard to like this one...</li>
            <li> I was hard to hold and very cumbersome to use.</li>
            <li> The water fill is very limited and the pressure isn&#x27;t enough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a regular water pik (electric) and was a little concerned at first that the water reservoir was small, but I&#x27;ve adjusted my expectations</li>
            <li> It is a little upsetting because I only had the last Waterpik for a short period of time before it would no longer hold a charge.  </li>
            <li> My only (small) complaint would be that although the water reservoir seems big, it empties very fast because it sprays a lot of water, even on the low setting.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, the water tank only holds enough water for one single use.  </li>
            <li> the last one last for 2 years, Is not too bad for 42usd, the problem is the battery, doesn&#x27;t charge any more.</li>
            <li> I am very picky here and this at least meets my expectations.</li>
            <li> If this is really meant to be portable, I&#x27;d expect at least a ventilated travel container for the attachments.    </li>
            <li> I almost didn&#x27;t buy this product because the first reviews were not good at all.  </li>
            <li> I  have to fill the resevoir at least twice to do my whole mouth.</li>
            <li> Not sure it&#x27;s a complete replacement for regular flossing, but it seems to be beneficial.  </li>
            <li> This waterpik model developed problems after only 6 months of usage -- water leakage and small plastic catches for the water tank fell off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The reservoir does not hold enough water to go thru all my tooth, I will usually need 2 water servings to complete a session.    </li>
            <li> Not powerful enough to use on daily basis.</li>
            <li> When you direct the small jet of water back between and around your teeth...</li>
            <li> It has a ton of power and a long battery life.</li>
            <li> The battery holds charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> I expected this to be smaller</li>
            <li> After 6 months use, it started taking a long time to re-charge.  </li>
            <li> Even when I did not break them they did not hold up long.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a complete idiot.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My tips will not turn while waster is spewing out as long as my tooth or tongue doesn&#x27;t hit it.    </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take long to adjust your mouth/lips so as to hit the target teeth and limit the water splashing.</li>
            <li> I found a piece of crushed red pepper that I didn&#x27;t know was there, nor do I remember eatting.</li>
            <li> So I spent $50 for so on the waterpik to avoid the deep cleaning.  </li>
            <li> This is a complete waste of your money.</li>
            <li> You have to unplug and plug it back into it&#x27;s electrical connection every time (it&#x27;s wet after use - think about that).  </li>
            <li> We will see how long the replacement product lasts.  </li>
            <li> Takes too long to re-charge.      </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sending it back for a partial refund and move on to something else.</li>
            <li> The plastic IS  fragile so be careful.  </li>
            <li> This product is a complete waste of money.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a complete waste.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, Waterpik doesn&#x27;t seem to have any interest in fixing the problem, as they done nothing but a minor redesign over the course of 6+ years.  </li>
            <li> I do only use it once a day, but even at 2x a day that&#x27;s not very often to need to charge it</li>
            <li> I should have bought one long ago.  </li>
            <li> down.&lt;br /&gt;The switches are a minor problem too.</li>
            <li> The charge holds for a long time.  </li>
            <li> so you have to be careful where you aim it as it could potentially damage your gums if improperly used.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Excuse me??</li>
            <li> Holds charge long time.</li>
            <li> so you cannot accidently push it when using it like I did a few times with the old one.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know how long to charge it</li>
            <li> : the battery seems to have some minor problem.</li>
            <li> I hope it has a long life.</li>
            <li> Even on low power setting it is empty before you hit all your teeth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Would buy again hope it lasts the long haul</li>
            <li> Initially, the tank seemed to empty before I was done</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not loud at all.</li>
            <li> It is not what i expected and i have only tried it once.</li>
            <li> The second one just died after about two years and roughly 50 days&#x27; use.</li>
            <li> I noticed minor corrosion almost immediately.</li>
            <li> The water does not completely come out.</li>
            <li> Though this product is cordless, it was still larger than I expected.</li>
            <li> I question its long term shelf life because that area cannot help but get water in it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not loud.</li>
            <li> Much bigger than I expected.</li>
            <li> After a year, I have noticed that it is not holding a charge as long as it used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Empty the reservoir and then run the unit for 7-10 seconds to remove the excess water from the internal sections of the water flosser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Battery lasts quite long.  </li>
            <li> Not really that big, holds plenty of water, and has 10 pressure settings.</li>
            <li> I never tried and now I wonder why I waited so long.  </li>
            <li> You might have to fill it twice, but a minor inconvenience.  </li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s not a very convenient product.</li>
            <li> know it is a long routine, but it saved my teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li> Charge lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s about how long they each lasted.</li>
            <li> and it keeps it charge for a long time.  </li>
            <li> As a side benefit, a smaller hole in the tip should also increase the 45 sec operation to 60-90 seconds in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> /&gt;Those minor shortcomings aside, I think</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s also messy (water dripping everywhere) and it barely holds enough water to be of any use.  </li>
            <li> Overall, it is better than just brushing and it is very difficult for me to floss since I have braces</li>
            <li> It all depends on how fast or how slow you move the waterpik through your mouth.</li>
            <li> Even after I plug it in overnight, it&#x27;s about 5 second of gung-ho waterpikking, and then it slows down over the next 20 seconds until its a dribble.  </li>
            <li> far as use, they recommend that you hold your mouth open while you use it to allow the liquid to drain out; however I have found that method to be very messy.  </li>
            <li> Reservoir is not large enough, so you have to fill it 2-3 times per use.  </li>
            <li> I paid almost $50.00 for this 4 months ago at Target and certainly do not want to purchase another entire unit.</li>
            <li> It is harder to manipulate the entire large container attached to the little end than it is to manipulate the end at the end of a narrow hose.  </li>
            <li> They usually do cost less than newer models as the cost of production is higher than years ago.</li>
            <li> They usually do cost less than newer models as the cost of production is higher than years ago.</li>
            <li> My complaint about the cordless dental water jet (Waterpik Ultra) is that the charger loses its charge very quickly.  </li>
            <li> The water capacity is much less, and filling it is not as simple, especially if you want to use mouthwash in it.</li>
            <li> I went to Target and bought the slightly cheaper version (only one speed, smaller reservoir,</li>
            <li> I have previously used the traditional and larger &amp;#34;waterpik&amp;#34; device.  </li>
            <li> Also, because this has no \\&quot;hose\\&quot; connecting the tank to the sprayer, no liquid gets left in the hose and turns into black gunk that gets squirted into your mouth the next time you use it</li>
            <li> One tip for use is to shake water out after use, both upside down and out through fill hole, then leave cap open until next use to help dry out and prevent bacteria from forming.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a tad difficult especially as a beginner, although not impossible).</li>
            <li> expected it to be much stronger, very hard to get at the back of teeth in the back.</li>
            <li> I do not believe that this unit suffers from many of the problems that other reviewers have mentioned, especially if you keep in mind that this is a cordless travel model.</li>
            <li> This cordless one resolves that inconvenience issue... but does exchange it for a new one which is a somewhat overly small water tank.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not that technically or electronically savvy enough to have wanted to mess with them.</li>
            <li> This waterflosser make my tooth very clear ,Replace the ordinary toothpick.</li>
            <li> The cordless aspect makes using it far easier than a former waterpik that was tedious and high maintenance.</li>
            <li> Works fine but kinda bulky and inconvenient when you have to tip it to reach back in the mouth, at which point the water level will sometimes fall below the intake and it will spin its wheels, so to speak.</li>
            <li> I have used Waterpik&#x27;s cheaper portable models and have broken at least 2 of them by my own hand or my Wife&#x27;s by knocking them over in the dark.  </li>
            <li> The first lasted about 3 years before the battery became weak and would not charge correctly.  </li>
            <li> (plus it was smaller than the other types).</li>
            <li> Then I twist the jet sprayer and begin again at the back of mouth at the other side and work to the front again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what else to add that The Geekster hasn&#x27;t already covered (and I agree with every point made) other than; if you want a compact, hand-held, mobile (I don&#x27;t see why you cannot travel with this unit, I would) and sturdy waterpik</li>
            <li> Similar price to other electric</li>
            <li> This is a little messy, but it cleans your gums really well.  </li>
            <li> For me it was certainly a significant improvement over the nylon floss, although relatively an expensive solution.    </li>
            <li> I have big hands, so I would be concerned whether a child or someone with small hands could hold this well especially if trying to reach the back side of the teeth.  </li>
            <li> with all the other electronics I bring, this is no big deal.    </li>
            <li> I constantly keep floss in my pocket because I need to use it after meal due to pain and discomfort from lodged food.</li>
            <li> Besides being a little messy to use, it does work very well.  </li>
            <li> I regret not giving enough credence to the other reviews.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace my other Waterpic who&#x27;s battery totally died and wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also recently returned to the dentist after 7 years of avoiding due to severe  phobia.</li>
            <li> The last three months I had to charge it ever other day</li>
            <li> It is for sure wrong!</li>
            <li> I put it back on the charger since my other items  on my 2 outlets thinned out</li>
            <li> Problem is that charging is hit or miss, as was with another cordless Waterpik of the same model which led to buy this and replace the other.  </li>
            <li> The other flaw I found was the toggle between the Hi and Low pressure settings</li>
            <li> water everywhere, can&#x27;t open your lips to even see what you&#x27;re doing due to all the splashing.  </li>
            <li> I bought my Waterpik Ultra last night and was sad that I was asked to charge it 24 hours prior to first use.</li>
            <li> Since it was my first time, I have no idea if I was doing it wrong, or if it&#x27;s just difficult to manage, but even after all that I still LOVE IT.     </li>
            <li> I know from other products that rechargeable batteries don&#x27;t last forever.</li>
            <li> I fill it twice to get the same result as my other one.  </li>
            <li> On the other hand, the product life is just too short.  </li>
            <li> ONLY WISH THE WATER RESERVOIR WERE A LITTLE LARGER AND CLOSURE LEAK-PROOF</li>
            <li> I had to spend a hundred bucks to buy one in Italy that has a foreign plug on it and must be used with an international adapter, here in the USA.</li>
            <li> Fill it up, use it on one side until it runs out, fill it back up, use it on the other side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In July of 2014, 1 year and 5 months after purchasing this Water Pik, I had the same problem with my Water Pik that other users have had.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read other comments about how it has to be recharged often but, using low pressure, I have not had that problem.  </li>
            <li> The force of the water doesn&#x27;t seem that strong; I&#x27;m not sure it would actually dislodge plaque or small food particles that an ordinary flossing wouldn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> It stays charged for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> Flossing and brushing were just not doing the job - my gum area was sore and bleeding - it wasn&#x27;t going to be very long before I was going to lose the battle.  </li>
            <li> The high is too hard; caused bleeding of gums.  </li>
            <li> and it takes quite a while to dry.</li>
            <li> I found this to be terribly disturbing considering that I use peroxide in the reservoir and kept it clean and in a cabinet at all times.</li>
            <li> I found that it fit in my mouth awkwardly and did not hold enough water.  </li>
            <li> With your breath, blow out the remaining vinegar and let the unit dry.</li>
            <li> - it must air dry.  </li>
            <li> so I just take it out after each use and let it air dry.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll note here that there is a &#x27;dry&#x27; side of the unit that is sealed against moisture.  </li>
            <li> then it has to sit there and dry and be put away.</li>
            <li> I dry it after I use it with a towel which may or may not do anything.  </li>
            <li> not really, just one more thing to do and inconvenient when in a hurry.</li>
            <li> Maybe I missed something in the instructions, something about having to take the reservoir off each time and let the unit dry out?  </li>
            <li> The problems are that the battery only lasts for 1 or 2 cleanings and it can get messy if you don&#x27;t close your mouth enough over the sink.</li>
            <li> I brought this item only a couple of weeks ago and have only used it a few times (maybe 10 times) and it has already started to malfunction.</li>
            <li> Not to big to be packed in a trip and not too heavy for daily use.</li>
            <li> You can buy the string for a few dollars or a pack of the picks, either of which will last you several months for a tenth of the cost.</li>
            <li> I understand that there is one with a larger reservoir, however the refill only takes a few seconds on this one.</li>
            <li> As for the comments about it being messy to use, no different than the regular water pik.  </li>
            <li> I was using it on high (because the low setting was so \\&quot;limp\\&quot; as to be useless) and the reservoir proved to yield only enough run-time to get me about 1/4 of the way finished with the job.  </li>
            <li> My dentist had recommended one and do not live in the USA.  </li>
            <li> Just ok hard not to be sloppy</li>
            <li> This one is bulky and is hard to hold - have to change hands to get to all of the mouth areas and it only has 2 adjustments - not strong enough even on high.</li>
            <li> I picked this up because I have limited bathroom counter space for yet another object.  </li>
            <li> and I tried every single one to see if the attachments were hindering the strength of the water...</li>
            <li> I got this model because of limited counter space, but think I would like the one with separate tank better-only having to hold the nozzle.  </li>
            <li> Part of this is because of the limited water supply</li>
            <li> Drawbacks for me is the limited water volume it holds though I guess that could be explained as keeping the bulk</li>
            <li> Any comparison between this and the home unit it limited to the brand name.  </li>
            <li> a single charge.  </li>
            <li> Since I have limited space in my bathroom I opted for the cordless plus waterflosser.</li>
            <li> He suggested that I look into purchasing a water pick because I have limited dexterity in my hands.</li>
            <li> I cannot, for example, imagine that a Braun power toothbrush is single voltage and if you travel to Europe you can&#x27;t recharge it.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> used it 10 times max, and even after charging it during the whole night, next morning it doesn&#x27;t work properly, rush of water is very weak, so there is no point of using it at all.</li>
            <li> The only down side is that if you don&#x27;t keep the waterpik charge all the time, it doesn&#x27;t hold the charge very long.</li>
            <li> The only problem I see with it, it is not powerful enough.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews about the bits turning, the unit too loud, water tank to small, blah, blah, blah.    </li>
            <li> It was of course only used in an average way, once a day.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, it is not loud (it&#x27;s not silent but what do you expect, it has a water pump it&#x27;s going to make some noise); also, my attention was on my teeth and the newbie-user mess I was making.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive gums, so flossing usually causes them to bleed.</li>
            <li> The reservoir is far too small though.</li>
            <li> I like the portability of the unit but the tank is small and requires two refills to complete the flossing.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the recommended flossing time according to the instructions is two minutes, however the water reservoir only holds enough water for a shorter amount of time.</li>
            <li> chamber is very small and does not contain enough water for a complete floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine</li>
            <li> You have to stop and refill it several times in an average use.</li>
            <li> As an adult with braces (again) it&#x27;s doing the job of removing all the food stuck in them, so I&#x27;m not sure I needed the additional power anyway.  </li>
            <li> This hand-held rechargeable is not worth the money.  </li>
            <li> It is pretty noisy to begin with and gets worse as it ages.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately all the battery complaints are true.</li>
            <li> I guess you could tip your head to the side one way for one half, then to the other for the other half, but it&#x27;s really a pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> CAME LOOSE</li>
            <li> I thought this might be heavy or a little weird since it is larger than the counter top type.  </li>
            <li> My new unit as of now has a ratchet design that makes it hard to rotate without meaning too.  </li>
            <li> Works well to clean the gums but it is awkward to change the spray to get the inner side of the teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li> The tip moves so easily its impossible to keep the deep cleaning \\&quot;Pik</li>
            <li> The fundamental flaw with the product is that the charging receptacle is down at the bottom where it gets soaked with water, all the way back into the recesses of the receptacle.  </li>
            <li> The pump needs to be slowed down even at low speed</li>
            <li> Works well when charged up, the battery used to last about 5 days but after a year it is down to about 2 days.</li>
            <li> The reservoir fills thru a hole on the side (actually in the front of the reservoir about mid-way down).  </li>
            <li> SUPPOSE TO FLOP DOWN BUT BROKE OFF AND REQUIRES PUSHING BACK ON .  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work upside down can&#x27;t do back of the teeth.  </li>
            <li> I was used to using the regular Waterpik (not cordless) and it outperforms this one hands down.</li>
            <li> Still getting down how to use it, but it seems to hold exactly enough water for my mouth.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use one long after my braces are removed!!</li>
            <li> nature of virtually all types of rechargeable batteries (in particular any lithium polymer battery, but also nicad&#x27;s, and nimh&#x27;s) is once you have taken the batteries down past 20% of there capacity</li>
            <li> My only complaint about this product is the reservoir - the only way to completely empty the last bit of water is to disassemble and dry/shake it out.</li>
            <li> Cordless (great-no longer knocking over soap canister, toothbrush holder, toothpaste and other sink clutter), easier to fill (no, not really), possibly less messy when you insert or remove from your mouth?</li>
            <li> Our disappointment was huge when it turned out that it only had a 110V option and from other reviews</li>
            <li> I do appreciate that this Waterpik has a smaller footprint so that it takes up less space on the counter.  </li>
            <li> Another inconvenience which may only affect a small number of user is that although the WP-450 is described as a travel irrigator, its transformer only works with 120 VAC - the transformer that came with my 350W was dual-voltage.    </li>
            <li> I use mine for about 30 seconds until all food is removed and I still have half of the water left.</li>
            <li> The samll footprint on my model wp450 is a big plus in a typical crowded bathroom space.</li>
            <li> Reservoir can be left open, but it&#x27;s a small opening</li>
            <li> I use mine for about 30 seconds until all food is removed and I still have half of the water left.</li>
            <li> The reason I&#x27;m on my third one is the previous batteries gave out at 15-18 months.</li>
            <li> review is based on only 2 weeks of use, and experience with only tank-style units in the past.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m going to try a different brand, because the re-chargeable battery on this unit conked out after less than a year.  </li>
            <li> The Ultra lasted less than 4 months used twice daily.  </li>
            <li> My overdue update two and a half years later.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s earlier stage of a mildew appearance and will eventually reappear as black as it is allowed to age.  </li>
            <li> Note the black mold internally in the mouthpiece.  </li>
            <li> I am a previous owner of the lower level model with only one power setting.  </li>
            <li> It takes up less space on my counter than a traditional unit.</li>
            <li> at my last cleaning the hygenist said if its not better the next visit they will have to do a deeper cleaning.</li>
            <li> Had the same problem with this model as with the previous model: after less than a year of moderate use (4-5 times per week) the battery will not recharge.</li>
            <li> Not sure what others know about it not having enough water , if you use a smaller tip it seems im never</li>
            <li> I had the larger waterpik previously, which lasted me 5 years.  </li>
            <li> The water chamber is too small and empties almost instantly so you are constantly refilling it.  </li>
            <li> Just like the previous reviews - the only thing I do not like is the plug in area exposed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> just take the precaution to dry out the contacts (they can get wet) before plugging it in.</li>
            <li> matter, had this product worked for at least a couple years, rather than a few weeks, I was willing to tolerate the design flaws for the price.</li>
            <li> I totally used it for less than 30 times.</li>
            <li> The reservoir is small, so initially I felt like I should be reloading it multiple times.</li>
            <li> Carefully scrape any minor corrosion off of the pins with the tip of a knife and use an inch of tape (anything that&#x27;s about 1/2\\&quot; wide) over the plug-in cavity to keep water out of the plug-in cavity while in use between charges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hopefully the battery will last longer than the previous version.</li>
            <li> : So I read some of the other reviews and what do you know: Other people were having the same problem.  </li>
            <li> but if it doesn&#x27;t charge, is pretty useless and overall</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple to use, and small enough to keep on the bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> I bought a second one, after the first one failed.</li>
            <li> The only gripe I have is the battery on the previous 2 models lasted between one and two years.  </li>
            <li> Less desirable is the operating button is an on/off switch; it should be a a simple push button.</li>
            <li> fully charged (24 hours) they would last for less than three days, then 2 days then</li>
            <li> I hope the batteries in this model last longer than&lt;br /&gt;the previous models I have owned.</li>
            <li> I find that the water reservoir is adequate for one usage, and it takes mere seconds to refill it.</li>
            <li> but i moved too quickly and got the wrong one.  </li>
            <li> It is ok for casual use because the water tank is too small.</li>
            <li> The only down fall to this product is that the plug attachment is metal and in the front where it gets wet every time I use it.</li>
            <li> I simply shoot it across the gaps between my teeth, never directly straight down into the bottom of the cleavage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cordless feature means that he can use the waterpik in the shower (this is key in that the spray won&#x27;t mess up the bathroom, and it keeps him in the shower longer).  </li>
            <li> I must have been crazy purchasing a second one when the first one lasted about the same time.  </li>
            <li> I only thing I do not like is the mess made from the water.</li>
            <li> , the force is not as high as other models-it is not nearly as effective at removing food between teeth as is floss,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have lucked out and only have 2 cavities in my mouth as we speak, but I have extremely tight contacts between my teeth and my dentist</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t actually used this product yet, but I felt compelled to leave a high rating for this just because of all the low ratings I&#x27;m reading from people who are not reviewing how the product actually performs but on how it doesn&#x27;t work in different countries or how bad the seller was or how they got a defective product, which will happen with every product.</li>
            <li> another disappointment is that the new model does not seem to deliver the water quite as strongly - it is definitely not \\&quot;way better\\&quot; than the old model.</li>
            <li> I would have given the product one star, but the ease with which theCustomer Service responded and agreed to send me a replacement (without having to send the broken product back) earns them additional two stars as I usually do not experience or expect this level of quality service in this day and age.    </li>
            <li> The finger controls are no better or worse than the original.</li>
            <li> After a few months, the battery gradually began to loose charge capacity and finally did not work at all.  </li>
            <li> I have very limited counter and cabinet space in my bathroom, so I haven&#x27;t had a Waterpik in ages.</li>
            <li> and I believe they have lasted a little over a year, with twice daily use.</li>
            <li> Although it is a little bulky, it is smaller than my sinktop home pick and fits well in my travel kit.</li>
            <li> The redesigned WP450 allows you to fill the tank in an ordinary sink which the WP360 would not due to the height of the fill point.  </li>
            <li> It only holds a little water</li>
            <li> Never used a waterpik before and thought it would be a little smaller.  </li>
            <li> Just use it a little longer for the same results.  </li>
            <li> I wish it was a little smaller to hold.</li>
            <li> Rinsing it off, opening the latch to shake out water left in the tank, drying it on my bathtowel and blowing a little air in the jack takes a couple of seconds.</li>
            <li> So hopin&#x27; this unit will last a little longer.  </li>
            <li> I wish it was a little smaller</li>
            <li> The little reservoir on the back holds like 8 oz/30</li>
            <li> It has plenty of water-I don&#x27;t have to stop &amp; refill, and so far I hardly ever need to charge it.</li>
            <li> The water container is hard to drain completely.  </li>
            <li> The water reservoir holds enough for 1/4 wash, but only if the unit is held upright (yes, it gets a little messy).</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewers that this version does not provide the same amount of power as the previous one.  </li>
            <li> There were other sellers that were selling the same product for less.</li>
            <li> That said, it works amazingly well at getting crap out between your teeth.  </li>
            <li> This would be a great product if they didn&#x27;t leak - terrible engineering design.</li>
            <li> For the life of me I could not understand why so many negative and mediocre reviews on this unit.</li>
            <li> The battery charge has lasted a long time and the pik is small enough to travel with.</li>
            <li> With the plastic tab that requires you to detach reservoir when you fill it up, I will be surprised if it lasts 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good battery life, with at least 7 uses per charge.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that there is no international charger.</li>
            <li> I do have to refill the reservoir once during the process, but it is fast and if the reservoir was any larger it would be difficult to hold.</li>
            <li> When the unit is fully charged, it will last for at least a week without having to plug it back in.  </li>
            <li> This cordless model replaces an ancient waterpik (must be at least 15 years old?)</li>
            <li> but as time past, the electric does not last as long as before.</li>
            <li> It accomplishes what I expected it to do.  </li>
            <li> But this product, for me, does what it was designed to do and what I expected it to do.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t counted but it definitely needs to be recharged after a few days.</li>
            <li> I like the tip that&#x27;s made for people with crowns, implants and braces, and I use two &#x27;tanks&#x27; of water (only takes a few seconds to fill the reservoir).</li>
            <li> A year later, it&#x27;s officially dead.  </li>
            <li> Works as expected.  </li>
            <li> I admit that it is quite messy during flossing, but that can be managed once you get used to how to hold and orient the flosser and the tips to align with gumlines prior to deliver turn it on to deliver the pulsating water.</li>
            <li> This unit was found dead in the &#x27;on&#x27; position when I unpacked after my last trip, which was not how it was wrapped and packed.  </li>
            <li> This product has a fatal design defect: You can&#x27;t get it wet, but there&#x27;s no way to use it without getting it wet.</li>
            <li> Within a couple months, no matter how careful you are, the water will cause the metal prongs that connect to the charger to corrode.</li>
            <li> have only had it a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> Will report back in a few months.  </li>
            <li> The water reservoir stores a minimal amount of water</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how long I expected this product to last, but</li>
            <li> Plastic housing and controls are slippery when wet.</li>
            <li> Reservoir is difficult to fill completely because air has to be displaced at the same time and through the same hole used to add water.   </li>
            <li> br /&gt;It was disappointing to receive such a good product and being unable to charge it in Australia</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this model for only a few weeks, so</li>
            <li> For everyday use, it does not hold enough water.  </li>
            <li> After using it for a while and finding that it would remove food particles even after a thorough brushing and flossing, I was never comfortable unless I used it every time I brushed.  </li>
            <li> This product is not what I expected.</li>
            <li> And refilling this thing with its tiny opening is a messy operation</li>
            <li> Needs to be charged everyday if you use it daily, I use only a few days a week.</li>
            <li> Not very easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it is much harder to pack it to use on trips.</li>
            <li> but they were closed.  </li>
            <li> but they were closed.  </li>
            <li> Something is definitely wrong and while I rarely make comments one way or another, here it is.  </li>
            <li> Does what is expected.  </li>
            <li> Not very powerful.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Everything was what I expected</li>
            <li> 1.I expected the stream be stronger.  </li>
            <li> Arrived exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> (I just wonder what \\&quot;genius\\&quot; put contact charger which gets wet all the time</li>
            <li> It gets wet inside and causes all kinds of problems including biological things that grow inside</li>
            <li> Even though it gets wet during use, there is no corrosion in the terminal socket, as would be expected from gold plated pins.    </li>
            <li> This is a slider switch, and it gets wet during use.  </li>
            <li> They need a flap on the contacts, I use in shower so it gets wet.</li>
            <li> the product becomes unrechargeable  after only a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well, the product is as expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s messy, leaks water everywhere; the jet power is extremely low and inadequately cleans.  </li>
            <li> but it does get the water flushing around the teeth and gums and you will have to be careful not to end up spraying all over the counter.</li>
            <li> This is the second item in 6 weeks that has lost &amp;#34;High&amp;#34; pressure in just a few weeks of use.  </li>
            <li> One Amazon reviewer offers advice about replacing the power cord with a comparable model from Radio Shack...but for me, that&#x27;s too much trouble - I expect products at this price point to last for at least a couple of years.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.  </li>
            <li> I used the unit for a few months and then it began accumulating the same moldy substance.</li>
            <li> Waterpik works as expected.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s jammed.</li>
            <li> if you want to use it where there isn&#x27;t a sink just keep your mouth closed and drink the water as you</li>
            <li> Not really.  </li>
            <li> The fully charged batteries lasted only a few minutes, and the unit broke in a week.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The unit gets completely wet during use.</li>
            <li> Charge holds for a few weeks, and water capacity is enough to get job done well.</li>
            <li> but I soak everything including myself even though I have my mouth closed around the tip.  </li>
            <li> If you do not hold your mouth in a relaxed closed way and let the water trickle out, the water goes everywhere.</li>
            <li> I contacted Amazon and was given a partial refund, however I checked the box afterwards and it does not show this tip.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s louder when it&#x27;s empty.  </li>
            <li> Buy this if you want your bathroom to look like a wet dog shook off all over the</li>
            <li> it even runs dead, from fully charged, in the middle of an operation.</li>
            <li> (SO I COULD PUT IT BACK TOGETHER AGAIN, WHAT A WASTE)    </li>
            <li> , I just consider the empty reservoir to be my timer.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that there are no light indications to alert you of battery life.</li>
            <li> One of the reviewers commented that it appears te crd should not be used when wet</li>
            <li> Be careful with the maximum pressure setting, don&#x27;t get it too close to your gums.</li>
            <li> I realize I just wasted my money on something which is such a dissatisfying product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it only costs a few dollars more&lt;</li>
            <li> /&gt;The water tank does not hold as much as expected.  </li>
            <li> It performs as expected.  </li>
            <li> I keep my mouth closed,</li>
            <li> The water reservoir capacity is minimal.</li>
            <li> The charging contacts are out in the open so that they get wet and eventually one of the contacts will turn green and won&#x27;t electrically connect with the plug.  </li>
            <li> The small reservoir wouldn&#x27;t be such a pain if I didn&#x27;t have to mix mouthwash with the water, which means handling the thing with wet and slippery hands two or three times a session while blue liquid is dripping down my chin onto my shirt.       </li>
            <li> Consider the physics behind using this thing - if you are in a big hurry and grab it with one hand in the middle section, the weight distribution could cause two things to occur: 1) you bang the spout around in your mouth in a very ineffective manner and believe this tool&#x27;s performance sucks, or 2) you learn to hold the spout away from sensitive areas of your mouth in an ineffective manner and feel disappointed in the tools inability to reach and penetrate those areas adequately.</li>
            <li> So far, much better than previous small model portable Waterpick - bad battery life.</li>
            <li> I never plug it into the charger after use; it&#x27;s just not smart to do that wet - electrochemistry WILL happen if you do.  </li>
            <li> Second one stopped working in less than a week!</li>
            <li> However, this waterflosser is just too weak to do a decent job.  </li>
            <li> THE SMALL ELECTRIC PLUG-IN IS NOT LOOSE.</li>
            <li> my only other big complaint is the amount of water that ends up anywhere but in your mouth, that can take some getting used to.</li>
            <li> I use mine religiously every single day because I was often lazy and would sometimes skip flossing.  </li>
            <li> Not a smart design at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The hose never recoiled properly, was stiff, broke, and sometime the unit sprayed water all over the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I charged it according to the instructions, and have been using it once every night for the past 3-4 weeks without recharging it a single time, which was definitely a surprise.</li>
            <li> I charge it for days now because even on high power it&#x27;s weak.</li>
            <li> So I will caveat this with the fact that I have only been using this a few day, but since I hesitated getting it due to some of the reviews I wanted to add my 2 cents.    </li>
            <li> A sharp knife, and a few scrapes later</li>
            <li> It was impossible to do your whole mouth in one fill-up, but I could live with that.</li>
            <li> you are serious about wanting to remove debris and bacteria from your mouth in as efficient a manner as possible, the only \\&quot;real\\&quot; option is the Waterpik Ultra.</li>
            <li> you are serious about wanting to remove debris and bacteria from your mouth in as efficient a manner as possible, the only \\&quot;real\\&quot; option is the Waterpik Ultra.</li>
            <li> Then you realize why you are using one of these in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;-Since cold water is painful, use warm water.</li>
            <li> The only thing I am not sure about is how well this thing is going to survive getting wet every day (the power switch does get wet)....</li>
            <li> This might be due to getting wet repeatedly combined with corrosion and deposits.</li>
            <li> Well, all I can say is that when I get it into my head that I want something, there&#x27;s not much that can sway me in the other direction.  </li>
            <li> Not exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> The unit is not very powerful, but is convenient and does the job.</li>
            <li> Not very useful.</li>
            <li> Admittedly it flush out some very loose particles of food, but I&#x27;m not sure if they were coming from actually between my teeth.</li>
            <li> This one works fine, but now has mold inside the reservoir because it is impossible to completely empty it of water.&lt;br /&gt;Poor</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it at least 6 months with no problem and the batteries last long.</li>
            <li> The first level is all like, &amp;#34;I&#x27;m going to spray the *#$&amp; out of your teeth.&amp;#34; The second level is like, &amp;#34;I&#x27;m going to spray the*#$&amp; out of your teeth and then invite you over for pie.&amp;#34; As you can imagine, that&#x27;s awkward.</li>
            <li> an extra little polish--and the tea and coffee stains are g-o-n-e !  </li>
            <li> But I agree with some of the other reviewers who find that the reservoir is too small (it runs out of water in about 30 seconds even at the low pressure setting) and the water tip is harder to control than the one on the WP-360.  </li>
            <li> It feels a little strange using it instead of floss, but I&#x27;m getting use to the idea.  </li>
            <li> The hygienist had very little to do the last time I went to the dentist.</li>
            <li> You can have warmer water to make it less harsh, you can leave it in the bathroom without a plug for several weeks and</li>
            <li> The only way to know is to try it yourself and ignore the reviews because really the only time people write reviews is when they have something bad to say.</li>
            <li> It must be very uncomfortable and maybe ineffective for people to try to rotate that thing accurately with one thumb while it is in the mouth</li>
            <li> Not a good choice for really young kids.</li>
            <li> I did not get the travel bag that I have seen on other sites.</li>
            <li> My husband, on the other hand, has mastered doing his flossing non-stop.</li>
            <li> It tends to run out of water quickly due to the leaking.</li>
            <li> and I got about 3 years use from it until the unit stop charging due to corrosion where the charger plugs into the unit(This</li>
            <li> This has stopped a problem where my gum was growing away from a dental implant due to gingivitis.  </li>
            <li> The only reason this gets a \\&quot;C\\&quot; is there&#x27;s no better unit on the market.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But hey, all you nay sayers, just go buy that $189.00 job from that other company.  </li>
            <li> On second thought, the small reservoir may be sufficient for some folks.</li>
            <li> I have had the other models of WaterPik</li>
            <li> For the next few months, it took at least 24 hours to charge it enough to work.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I could not feel the water coming out from the other side and onto my tongue either.</li>
            <li> Waterpik&#x27;s other model also broke within 3 months.</li>
            <li> Other reviews expressed concerns about the reservoir size and battery life.  </li>
            <li> I gave it 4 rather than 5 stars because, while not sure, maybe it could have been designed w. a bigger tank w.o.</li>
            <li> Therefore even though the Waterpik is plugged in, you don&#x27;t know if it getting charged until you go to use it or have to plug some other electrical product with an indicator to know power is being supplied.         </li>
            <li> Other than the reservoir size</li>
            <li> (as has been mentioned in other posts)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure which one I&#x27;ll get next</li>
            <li> Perhaps one of the other users can enlighten me as I am probably \\&quot;gagdet challenged\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s still big and bulky but not as bulky as the Ultra) and a slightly small footprint on the counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got the other one at home which does the triple work.</li>
            <li> I was also hoping this item would be small enough to take along for travel.  </li>
            <li> I have none of the problems mentioned in other emails.  </li>
            <li> Plenty of other posts detail the device&#x27;s shortcomings.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I can&#x27;t complain -</li>
            <li> Purchased this product with some apprehension due to other reviews.  </li>
            <li> The battery charge doesnt last and the cord is kinda small in length</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t be returned or be replaced due to over the time of replacement.  </li>
            <li> Second, as also noted, the reservoir is small.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it is simply too small.</li>
            <li> But other than that.</li>
            <li> The reservoir is quite small so a regular flossing will take about 3 refills.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Based on other reviews, I am fully expecting it to lose it&#x27;s charging ability in a year.  </li>
            <li> Despite some other reviews, I have had no problems with this product.  </li>
            <li> Like some of other users, mine was died after about 2 months.</li>
            <li> I did have a problem after over a year with diminishing performance due to battery charging.  </li>
            <li> one due to the recharging contacts corroding on it.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s some responses to other concerns:    </li>
            <li> Other users commented on problem with charger connection; I have not seen that.</li>
            <li> than I did the other one.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Study the other reviews before you purchase this.</li>
            <li> and I will be investigating other brands.</li>
            <li> Would be somewhat cumbersome to travel with(its not exactly portable), but I&#x27;ll find a way.  </li>
            <li> Water tank capacity is too small to hold enough water for one cleaning cycle.</li>
            <li> this is my travel one i have the other model {home} .</li>
            <li> The battery will work for some months, but when it loses its life, it barely holds a charge.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> /&gt;About other complaints:  </li>
            <li> but it is certainly small enough to pack.  </li>
            <li> but the resavor is small and does not&lt;br /&gt;hold enough</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read the other reviews and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather fill it twice than put up with all of the other problems.</li>
            <li> Used it two times a day for 3 days and one time a day the other four.</li>
            <li> It takes two seconds to fill and usually contains enough water to finish the job without refilling.</li>
            <li> this would not be such a problem since, in the shower, which is were it belongs, you can fill it up during use if you cup your hand over the fill hole, but the fill opening is small and not well placed.</li>
            <li> I have not tried other brands, so I can not compare.</li>
            <li> Takes two fills to get through a full mouth cleaning which is inconvenient to stop for a refill.</li>
            <li> desire - charge it every other week</li>
            <li> It is small enough to take it along for travel.</li>
            <li> NOT what I expected!</li>
            <li> and... it is small enough not to &#x27;clutter&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> DUE TO</li>
            <li> BUT WAS UNSUCCESSFUL, DUE TO THE LOCATION OF THE MOLD.</li>
            <li> Having read other comments before purchasing, I kept the terminal opening covered with tape when not recharging.</li>
            <li> I bought a other Waterpik to solve this problem.</li>
            <li> of them suffer from the same problem, no more charging.</li>
            <li> For daily use, the water capacity is too small</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews and bought this.</li>
            <li> Other flaw was the packaging: it did not include the promised tongue cleaner.</li>
            <li> The Waterpik is quite noisy, but I think that is unavoidable, and it&#x27;s quieter than a desktop model, because other items on the counter don&#x27;t vibrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> in a while, a &amp;#34;tip&amp;#34; will get food stuck in it, and it is necessary to run it under water and/or use a small paper clip to remove it.  </li>
            <li> I can ignore other drawbacks if it comes with 220v charger.</li>
            <li> After about 4 months I due to see my hygienist for a cleaning.</li>
            <li> Now, there&#x27;s a slide lever (not really a button) that needs to slide up and down, all the while holding vertical.</li>
            <li> I am a HUGE fan of the large countertop Waterpik models, but this one is terrible!</li>
            <li> Tilt the unit in the sink in a position that you can pour a few drops of white vinegar in the little hole where the two copper contact prongs are.</li>
            <li> the only thing I do not like is it is hard to empty all the liquid out when you rinse it out.</li>
            <li> A used oral care product that was sold as new is criminal in my mind.</li>
            <li> Not very effective, by the time you actually start flossing, the water supply is empty and you have to keep refilling every few seconds.</li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t be so bad if the ring that turns the jet were easy to get to.  </li>
            <li> Tip is impossible to control and spins around freely, spraying water everywhere</li>
            <li> I quickly tired of having to drag a stool into the bathroom to place the flosser on while in use, complete with extension cord yada yada.</li>
            <li> I gave it such a poor rate because after only 9 months it no longer keeps a charge.</li>
            <li> Cleans the pieces of chicken and stuff between the teeth much faster than wooden picks, and that&#x27;s what I bought it for.</li>
            <li> the unit cannot pick up the water once it&#x27;s half empty.  </li>
            <li> I expected to either love this thing or hate it.</li>
            <li> This cordless unit holds too little water and the pressure was simply not strong enough.  </li>
            <li> Secondly, you have to use it while bending over the sink, or else you&#x27;ll have a small river flowing down the front of your body.</li>
            <li> Now that I need to replace this unit (no longer charges), with the two issues identified here, which I seriously consider to be major issues, I&#x27;m going to try someone else&#x27;s product.  </li>
            <li> MOLD will eventually build up in the seams, and behind the tank in this model and you should regularly  remove your tank by the plastic clip on the bottom and pull down to remove the blue tank.  </li>
            <li> The water tank is very small and I usually took about 3 refills on a normal cleanup.    </li>
            <li> I BRUSH MY TEETH WITH A CONVENTIONAL TOOTH BRUSH; MESSAGE MY GUMS WITH MY SONIC CARE ELECTRIC TOOTH BRUSH, FLOSS, I THEN USE THE WATERPIK.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to use a conventional Waterpik</li>
            <li> My assessment is that it&#x27;s too loud, too weak, runs out of water way too fast, and is difficult to manipulate to get all of the \\&quot;targets\\&quot; without it sucking air.  </li>
            <li> I have terrible arthritis in my fingers and hands and this makes it so much easier to get your teeth clean.</li>
            <li> A previous dentist informed us that we both required &amp;#34;deep cleaning&amp;#34; every (3) months due to &amp;#34;excessive pockets in our gum lines&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I had this model for the previous 3 years with no issues other than it wore out.</li>
            <li> I used my original unit for about 18 months before it became impossible to charge.  </li>
            <li> Contrary to what I read in other reviews, the reservoir ended up running out of water in less than one minute.</li>
            <li> It held just enough water to get the job done, it was hard to fill with water under the bathroom sink</li>
            <li> I have a hard time flossing regularly.</li>
            <li> I also have TMJ and have a hard time getting my back teeth without my jaw cramping.</li>
            <li> At first it&#x27;s a little weird having this thing</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s a plus too - just stick it back under the faucet and re-fill); might be a little bulky for small hands.  </li>
            <li> I have to turn it off manually to swivel the attachment, and then go back to cleaning those hard to reach teeth.</li>
            <li> tank is bigger and is hard to hold.  </li>
            <li> Hard to do when you are reaching to the back of your mouth or sides on lower teeth.  </li>
            <li> Compared to the plug in Waterpik we used to have, this one shoots water too hard on the low setting.</li>
            <li> and it left little to nothing left behind.</li>
            <li> This makes it impossible to use the device to clean your teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li> Not worth buying.</li>
            <li> I bought this on my dentist&#x27;s recommendation because my teeth are very close together, making efficient flossing difficult.</li>
            <li> If, when I go into my next check up, there is no spectacular results, I&#x27;m tossing it.</li>
            <li> Sorry I bought it because I really would like to use the Waterpik system when I travel.</li>
            <li> The crowns are very close together, meaning it is quite difficult for me to use floss.</li>
            <li> it no longer wants to stay in the open position, requiring two hands to use, which makes it very difficult for our child to use.  </li>
            <li> There was some confusion about delivery of the second one which appeared to be late.</li>
            <li> The only negative about this product is that there is no indicator of when the battery is fully charged.</li>
            <li> For instance, I got one for cleaning braces when I&#x27;m long past my teens.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as powerful as my countertop pik.</li>
            <li> But not worth it</li>
            <li> This handheld model is necessarily bulky since it houses the water tray, so it is a bit clumsy to hold.  </li>
            <li> Having braces sucks period especially when you want to floss but using a waterpik makes flossing a breeze.  </li>
            <li> : awkward for smaller hands, water only lasts for 20 seconds on low setting.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bulky, poorly designed, and one charge doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not powerful, could not be used in lieu of floss.  </li>
            <li> So unless my unit was a dud, the life of the product makes it not worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li> The battery lasts me at least 2 weeks, longer actually.</li>
            <li> Its not worth it, it is all a return product from customer who bought it and not liking how it works...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so, common, in fact, that retailers such as Amazon, Walmart, CVS, etc , might consider discontinuing this product.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the plug in on the device does get water into it</li>
            <li> I really like the way it is designed but the life is just too flawed.</li>
            <li> One side had become very sore and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not my experience at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only used string floss about once or twice per week before this tool, now I use at least once per day, often times twice.  </li>
            <li> the water compartment is small, but it cant be too big either, incase it gets too heavy and uneasy as a handheld device.</li>
            <li> than the missing indicator this works about as I expected it would.  </li>
            <li> With waterpiks, you either love em or hate em.</li>
            <li> Anyways, you&#x27;ll love it or  hate it.</li>
            <li> Very much worse than the old 350 M.</li>
            <li> I have the product for about 1 year now, I use it everyday and works, rechargeable battery has not died yet as I initially expected.   </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the reviews that said the reservoir is too small or that complained about it not holding a charge long enough.  </li>
            <li> It did a good job of terrifying the cats, too.  </li>
            <li> However, it now only has one flow speed, the slow one, and the button does not change the speed.  </li>
            <li> I HATE FLOSSING AND WANTED TO DO A BETTER JOB WITH MY TEETH.  </li>
            <li> The trouble just kept getting worse until the final death last week.</li>
            <li> If it wasn&#x27;t for the fact that parts were missing, which prompted me to look carefully at the tip that was there, I might have used some stranger&#x27;s toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It does the job but is heavy and awkward to use when full of water.  </li>
            <li> 2-It&#x27;s hard to empty so that the tank will dry between uses.  </li>
            <li> Tank is impossible to clean and dry and of small capacity.</li>
            <li> As a result:   1) Its impossible to tell how much charge is left in the battery    2) When its being charged you don&#x27;t know if it has completed charging.    </li>
            <li> The waterpik gets my mouth cleaner than I could flossing and brushing and the gingivitis has calmed down.  </li>
            <li> He likes to use it in the shower so all of the water can just run down his chin instead of dealing with it in the sink.</li>
            <li> Also: the jet intermittently starts jerking around, or up and down, like a sledgehammer ... jerking around on your gums, even making them bleed.</li>
            <li> and of course the water runs out of your mouth and all over the device and your hand, down your arm, etc.  </li>
            <li> Hate traditional flossing -- so this is a SUPER alternative.</li>
            <li> In addition as you are irrigating your mouth be prepared for everything to come down over the waterpik and into the sink, leaving the waterpik in need of a wiping down after use.</li>
            <li> Because once you have discharged the batteries all the way down, which at some point everyone is going to do, you have just signed the death warrant of this</li>
            <li> do NOT like the fact that water runs down the pik and into the charging portal</li>
            <li> Two thumbs waaay down.</li>
            <li> broke down in 3 months</li>
            <li> so it wouldn&#x27;t move without some effort and another over the on/off button and around the body pulling it down toward the off position so it shuts off when I stop pushing on it.</li>
            <li> There is a schottky diode between the battery and the charging contacts, which drops voltage from the charger (3V) down to 2.45V, that&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s it if it breaks down too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does take some getting used to because if you aren&#x27;t holding it correctly the water runs down your arm along with coming out your mouth.  </li>
            <li> so water poured down my arm and the sleeve of my sweatshirt is soaked.</li>
            <li> Also be standing over your sink so that you can let the water flush out and down the drain.  </li>
            <li> When it runs down</li>
            <li> Keep your receipt and register the product as I predict you will need it a year down the line</li>
            <li> The battery will bleed down its charge in 6-9 months.</li>
            <li> In an attempt to keep the splashes down</li>
            <li> That aside, it works as it should, its just a little cumbersome due to its size.     </li>
            <li> You need to know that your fingers holding the waterpic are going to get wet!!  </li>
            <li> I do not exactly recommend it!</li>
            <li> a hygiene point, I could not wait to obtain another water flosser, but I wish I could have due to the now lower price!</li>
            <li> Not very powerful, very messy and small water tank makes it a pain to do an proper job.</li>
            <li> I thought this would take up less counterspace, and it does, but it is not much fun to use.  </li>
            <li> The average is 7oz but may be a tad less.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed (easy set up)</li>
            <li> It works, but it is awkward to use especially when trying to clean behind the lower teeth.</li>
            <li> The newer one seems to be lower pressure,  designed that way possibly to prevent failure?  </li>
            <li> Cordless design removes the drips coming down the cord - convenient and less</li>
            <li> The time it takes to run down to zero charge has gone from 10 days to about 7 days or less.</li>
            <li> As far as battery charging, connector and decreasing water pressure problems, I have not experienced any of them, since I have the products a little over 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> The other models were too messy and cumbersome.</li>
            <li> I still keep some floss pics around for quick jobs after certain meals, but at least that string floss can be thrown out (I really hated that stuff).</li>
            <li> I expected a compact hand held container with a laser thin stream of water, but instead its like holding a big bottle of mouth wash, while water rapidly fills your mouth and spills out down your chin....</li>
            <li> My wife has a plug-in tank model and sets the pressure at about half which she says is plenty.   </li>
            <li> I used the product for less than one year.  </li>
            <li> Inside of the tank was covered with slimy black fungus.  </li>
            <li> flosser has an 8 oz tank - I wouldn&#x27;t get one with less capacity.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also costs 1/3 less than the WaterPik.</li>
            <li> Previously I had a water pik device that connected to the bathroom faucet</li>
            <li> It will cost $15 less.</li>
            <li> It might move slightly, you just have to move with it.    </li>
            <li> The inside of the reservoir still stays slightly moist, however, and I just noticed mold building up in the bottom of the reservoir.  </li>
            <li> but I did discover one day a black colony of mold growing at the seams of the water reservoir.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that I don&#x27;t like about water piking my teeth is the taste of blood when I&#x27;m done... not the product&#x27;s fault, my fault for being so lazy for the past 28 years.</li>
            <li> Can be hidden in a cabinet easier than the plug in models.</li>
            <li> way less water pressure than the plug in type.</li>
            <li> In less than one year it would not hold a charge.  </li>
            <li> Again, in less than a year, it would not hold a charge.</li>
            <li> It was actually quite a slow death as just a few months after getting it, it was already noticeably weaker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Typical of cordless devices, I guess.     </li>
            <li> I switched to the Panasonic Oral Irrigator (EW-DJ10-A), a portable water flosser that has a gasket-sealed compartment for its batteries (it&#x27;s not rechargeable, but it&#x27;s about half the cost of this Water Pik).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The water flossing technique</li>
            <li> but at half life of the alkaline AA batteries the power would began to fall off.  </li>
            <li> I had previously used a battery operated oral irrigator.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this waterpik for a year and half now.  </li>
            <li> (This happened with three previous Waterpik 360s).  </li>
            <li> I called Waterpik, and they&#x27;re sending a replacement; but given my previous experience with Waterpik portables, I&#x27;m not optimistic.  </li>
            <li> It also leaked, was difficult use, and overall a big pain in the ass.  </li>
            <li> previously had another model that was the bucket and chord style.</li>
            <li> This one broke in even less time.</li>
            <li> I read a few of the negative reviews and wondered if I&#x27;m using the same product.    </li>
            <li> It quit on me one day, less than a year after purchase.  </li>
            <li> Purchased this item to replace my previous one.  </li>
            <li> It holds a charge for about a week and a half of using it 1-2 times a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cost so much less than getting it through the Brick and mortar store.  </li>
            <li> I paid about $20 to $30 less on Amazon than I would have paid depending on which store I would have had to go to to purchase (</li>
            <li> but for me a lot less.</li>
            <li> I echo the comments in previous reviews, and add the question:  </li>
            <li> By the way, every time I had to service the electrics in this device, I had to disassemble everything, since the electrics are the deepest hidden part in the case.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The biggest problem is each have stopped working in less than a year.</li>
            <li> some black gunk that was freed up.</li>
            <li> You can cut your dental bills in half if you use a Waterpik Waterflosser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The Water Pic&#x27;s pressure is much less than I am used to with the Shower Flosser</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s faster and less work than flossing.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also almost virtually impossible to use adequately because of its design.</li>
            <li> , did I mention you have less than 20 seconds before you need to refill again?    </li>
            <li> My dental hygienist recommended this to me to help my gums from bleeding less.</li>
            <li> Over time black mold starts to form along the bottom and sides of the reservoir.  </li>
            <li> After you get used to it, you&#x27;ll probably have to fill the tank less</li>
            <li> It takes up less room on the counter, too</li>
            <li> The pump lasted less than 3 months.</li>
            <li> It is fried and drains the flosser within less than 8 seconds.</li>
            <li> Less pockets and peridontal disease has been eliminate.</li>
            <li> If it lasts less than 2 years, Waterpik will replace it, so keep your proof of purchase.</li>
            <li> It makes less noise than any electric razor I have ever had.   </li>
            <li> At both visits,  I had less plaque and tarter buildup than I had when using floss.</li>
            <li> I bought it less than 18 months ago and already the rechargeable battery is losing juice.</li>
            <li> i have had this product for four months it became nearly useless in the 3rd charge the battery just can&#x27;t last for one minute</li>
            <li> have to go to the trashcan after less than 2 years using&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve previously used the waterpik that you hook up to your shower which after returning this one, I bought again.</li>
            <li> Makes flossing faster and less of a hassle..</li>
            <li> is that I started to have to plug it in after less and less usage.</li>
            <li> I owned my &#x27;rechargeable&#x27; unit for less than three months when it would not hold a charge after two uses.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for less than week</li>
            <li> but I wish they would work on one that is less bulky.  </li>
            <li> I used my charger from the previous unit; and, that didn&#x27;t work either.</li>
            <li> The appointment took less than 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Although the product worked to my satisfaction, my cordless Waterpik waterflosser lasted less than two years before it would no longer take a charge.  </li>
            <li> Also, because of the design of the water tank, it is impossible to empty the tank completely, and it is also not possible to scrub the inside of the water tank, which raises concerns in my mind about cleanliness or contamination.</li>
            <li> a charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I opened the unit thinking I would need to replace the batteries and found a ton of black mold inside.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned two of these and the rechargeable battery did not recharge after less than a year.</li>
            <li> Found this cordless one on Amazon for $15 less than the sale price in Kohls.  </li>
            <li> And yes, the cordless unit has less water pressure than the corded Wp-100 at its maximum pressure setting.  </li>
            <li> Less than two months in, probably two dozen uses and it won&#x27;t hold a charge.</li>
            <li> Just like the other reviews, this product is a little messy.</li>
            <li> As I noted, a little water continues to drop down from somewhere and some of this can get into the jack, but it is all well sealed and does not seem to make a difference.</li>
            <li> Get one of those instead of this mess.</li>
            <li> No good, only 5 months now stop working, but when I bought it posted 2 years warranty</li>
            <li> but it makes one heck of a mess.</li>
            <li> Still makes a mess of the mirror</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done everything possible to try and bring it back, but it is DEAD unfortunately</li>
            <li> The reservoir is too small, it will empty in under 20 seconds.</li>
            <li> First, I do not tolerate cold water</li>
            <li> I agree with the reviewer that states, that machine is unreliable as to staying in place and makes a mess.</li>
            <li> I take it into the shower with me to avoid a mess.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t do it without making a mess and or running out of water too soon.</li>
            <li> As a result, the discharged water ends up running out on the device, and you end up with a mess on your hands.    </li>
            <li> I turn it on and after a few seconds it starts slowing down as the battery is almost discharged.  </li>
            <li> It can be a bit messy, as water drips down my arm.  </li>
            <li> You have to keep your head down with this one, so it is messy but everything goes in the sink and it doesn&#x27;t spray out unless you take it out of your mouth.</li>
            <li> but after a few months the pressure went down to the point where it couldn&#x27;t be used.  </li>
            <li> and I have to wrap floss so tightly around my fingers</li>
            <li> I have really tight teeth, so I got this per a suggestion of my dentist and a friend recommended this one.</li>
            <li> the product is marred in terms of its expected lifespan and what I consider a flawed design which was a major annoyance to me.    </li>
            <li> I was just looking for an alternative to regular flossing because my mouth is small and it is hard for me to floss.</li>
            <li> My electric toothbrush and floss, just do not clean the lower gun line as this does.</li>
            <li> It really makes me mad when I read reviews that have nothing at all to do with the product itself but other problems people have with their purchase.</li>
            <li> Pros: cordless, not sure how long the charge lasts, takes up small amount of space on counter&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> at the minimum at least two years, as this is the time of their limited warranty.  </li>
            <li> As I said, we need a portable model and we figure with the relatively little use it will get, it will last long enough before going bad to justify the cost.</li>
            <li> thought, maybe it can&#x27;t charge because the water gets into the little charge port and keeps it from doing its thing.  </li>
            <li> Here is a little contrast and compare on the reviews and my unit</li>
            <li> I have had this for a little over a year.</li>
            <li> A little messier than I envisioned</li>
            <li> Also, the little plastic tab that holds the tank to the handle also broke after repeated disassembly.  </li>
            <li> The changed the shape of the receptacle a little bit a couple of years ago, but that&#x27;s all they&#x27;ve done, and it didn&#x27;t help.  </li>
            <li> Whatever other design problems Waterpik has had in the past, I think they have solved them with this model.</li>
            <li> But in places that are sensetive it can hurt a little.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a pressure washer for your gum and it takes a little getting used to.  </li>
            <li> to Amazon for this little doggie...  </li>
            <li> It takes a little practice.</li>
            <li> A little bulky but could get used to it.</li>
            <li> It holds a charge for only a couple of days  and has a weak spray when fully charged.</li>
            <li> Two years later, the stock battery became weak, wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge for a while.</li>
            <li> It DOES get a little funky smelling inside the water compartment.</li>
            <li> The dental technician said there was surprisingly little plaque buildup.</li>
            <li> The tips are a little pricey, but</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m getting little to no water pressure.  </li>
            <li> It removes those stubborn little bastards between teeth well.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> This unit feels a little bulky</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist told me to start waterpiking because my gums were showing signs of irritation and receding a little.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about the experience of other reviewers but I&#x27;ve had this product for over two years</li>
            <li> We ordered this as we have an antique sink/no countertop space, and thought this could tuck away conveniently in a little cabinet.  </li>
            <li> This fits in well with the other battery powered tools that I charge with my pv panels through the small inverter.</li>
            <li> I expecially like the little brushes that I can use to give my front lower teeth</li>
            <li> Its a little noisy, but doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> Also, I save a little room to add a bit of listerene just before closing the latch.</li>
            <li> I should&#x27;ve listened to other reviewers who said that the reservoir is too small.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-I put a little mouthwash in it before I fill it with water</li>
            <li> Not sure about those other critisizing the product.</li>
            <li> Suggestions have been to put a little petroleum jelly into the plug area and/or cover the area with some duct tape when not plugged in.  </li>
            <li> My dentist was amazed at how little plaque build up</li>
            <li> Compact takes little space on sink&lt;</li>
            <li> This means the power runs low and the strength of the water is weak.  </li>
            <li> amount of water held is a little skimpy but this I can deal with by refilling the tank.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s convenient and takes up little space on the counter-top in the bathroom.  </li>
            <li> Although I have a little problem with keepng the waterpik directed properly,&lt;br /&gt;it works as advertised, and I already see an improvement.</li>
            <li> This one uses just a little counter space and it has two speeds</li>
            <li> and I felt the pressure was a bit weak but didn&#x27;t know if it mattered or not, till yesterday when I felt I had something stuck between my front teeth, and using the waterflosser did not help at all, unlike regular flossing.</li>
            <li> There is a little o&#x27;ring that is supposed to stop this from happening, but it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I have not had one instance of the attachment being loose or flying around as others complained about.</li>
            <li> Poor Reservoir Capacity -only 120 ml or 20% less than the already-tiny WP-360&#x27;s 150 ml&lt;br</li>
            <li> Luckily my dentist warned me that these things were messy, otherwise I would have been completely shocked.</li>
            <li> I have braces and have a very hard time flossing the regular way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to get the back of your gums.</li>
            <li> Heavy and does not clean well at all.</li>
            <li> I have found that jamming a very narrow piece of plastic (or other non-metal item)</li>
            <li> The fact that you have to hold it upright means you make a bigger mess, spilling dirty water all over the entire waterpik (which you can&#x27;t immerse in water, supposedly).</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give this 5 stars because it is a little messy to use.  </li>
            <li> A little messy but then that might be on me since I&#x27;m still learning.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s a little messy to use, but this is a device that shoots water out, so what do you expect?  </li>
            <li> Little too messy.  </li>
            <li> I still think I will use regular floss periodically to keep my gums tough, though.</li>
            <li> Two thumbs DOWN!</li>
            <li> this product dose not last it stops working after a few uses !!!  </li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s a little fun fact since a lot people are shocked by this... machines make noise.</li>
            <li> To combat the problems others have had with the plug attachment connection diminishing after a couple of months I have purchased very small band aids and place one over the plug attachment area while the product is completely dry to prevent water from entering the attachment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now joining the numerous negative reviewers who have complained, explained and offered solutions to the one glaring problem:  </li>
            <li> Water reservoir awkward to fill, can&#x27;t empty completely for storage because of location of fill hole.</li>
            <li> They clearly either didn&#x27;t put any research into this item, or they will just blindly sell whatever they can without any regard for usability or practicality.    </li>
            <li> waste of money, gets everywhere, wish I could return it.</li>
            <li> waste of money.</li>
            <li> Not comfortable to use.    </li>
            <li> Unit does not fit in my sink.  </li>
            <li> Was having trouble charging the wp360 and found out it was because of corrosion on charging plug area(hard to see).</li>
            <li> I bought one of these a few months ago.  </li>
            <li> Have already bought one for my son that had a poor dental checkup followed by several root canals, etc.</li>
            <li> I looked for a portable water flosser (don&#x27;t want to waste space at the sink and want to use it in the shower to avoid water spits all around) and was about to buy a \\&quot;Waterpick\\&quot; product.</li>
            <li> and it is now dead.</li>
            <li> Received the waterpik in just a few days..</li>
            <li> I got it because I had my wisdom teeth removed a few weeks before</li>
            <li> I bought this even after reading all of the reviews and almost 6 months after giving this as a gift to my husband, it is dead in the water.</li>
            <li> The instructions say to change every few months.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday and will avoid dentist visits.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a big change because I used to have a Waterpik brand corded large-tank-style unit and it was worse experience than flossing.</li>
            <li> THE RESERVOIR, LASTS APPROXIMATELY 30 SECONDS WHEN THE SETTING IS ON LOW.  </li>
            <li> Heavy.  </li>
            <li> , it is annoying that it doesn&#x27;t have an indicator light when it&#x27;s charging.</li>
            <li> Have had this for a few months and already I&#x27;m having problems with the rechargeable battery.  </li>
            <li> The battery was recharged but to no avail it did not work and was dead.</li>
            <li> I have never made a claim, too much trouble and who has time.  </li>
            <li> have had it a few months and no operational problems yet.,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it everyday ever since.  </li>
            <li> Overall, poorly designed and engineered.</li>
            <li> (oops, I meant green \\&quot;save the earth\\&quot; recycle bin).          </li>
            <li> Messy - this is not a criticism of this brand, it is just the nature of the beast.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered the portable Panasonic model, so we&#x27;ll see how that one works after a few months.</li>
            <li> If you see any darkening on the white surfaces behind the attached tank</li>
            <li> I used this for a few weeks and found myself rushing around my mouth before the water ran out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This product was suggested to me by my dentist because I have a few pockets in my gums.  </li>
            <li> if you are planning on traveling with it, I recommend you do that a few days in advance.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s messy.</li>
            <li> Takes just a few seconds to wash them out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few months now.  </li>
            <li> So I stick with using it for a few weeks then give up.</li>
            <li> I have never had any trouble with it.</li>
            <li> waste your money.</li>
            <li> It comes with a few diffrent heads.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what happened but dead.  </li>
            <li> looks like the battery was dead and wouldn&#x27;t charge&lt;br</li>
            <li> Soaked it in the vinegar for a few minutes</li>
            <li> I saw a shinning connector after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> A waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have to  say that it is extremely messy to use this waterpik.  </li>
            <li> just wish I had this device when I was still wearing braces a few years ago.</li>
            <li> If you are Bill Gates and replace every appliance you have every few weeks, go ahead and buy it.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday now.</li>
            <li> for a few years,</li>
            <li> A few areas are still bleeding, but this should stop soon.   </li>
            <li> Waste of time to purchase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back</li>
            <li> Have had it for a few months and doing well.  </li>
            <li> What a waste.</li>
            <li> The unit actually does the job of a 4 star rating but the battery is really poor and the deal-killer.  </li>
            <li> It is too harsh on my&lt;br /&gt; gums.</li>
            <li> messy, must use in shower, tip broke off with piece stuck in channel.</li>
            <li> threw AWAY  the Waterflosser, money wasted</li>
            <li> Can be messy if I forget to close mouth while using.</li>
            <li> Now dead.  </li>
            <li> Not the highest water pressure, but it does work well as an everyday flosser.  </li>
            <li> This was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> So if you want to take it with you then another gadget is needed adding to the price the bulk and the weight, all unnecessary if a proper charger had been supplied.</li>
            <li> Your teeth will feel cleaner, and you will even notice a few undetected food particles in your sink too.</li>
            <li> Worse, doesn&#x27;t hold enough water to get the job done.avoid the cordless model.</li>
            <li> Wow was I wrong...</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want trouble don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> Even after brushing and flossing it still flushes out trapped particles.</li>
            <li> and I even have trouble getting floss between them sometimes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> We use it everyday in order to keep our teeth forever.</li>
            <li> The electric motor just rusted and got stuck after a few months</li>
            <li> Waste of money and travel bulk.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday at work and when traveling.</li>
            <li> dont waste your money</li>
            <li> After 3 months, it is now completely dead.</li>
            <li> It also broke after a few months.</li>
            <li> After a few uses, I figured it out.</li>
            <li> As to the head moving I don&#x27;t have any trouble.</li>
            <li> The motor is dead.</li>
            <li> The battery is dead.  </li>
            <li> It just stops charging and goes to waste.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have owned it for few months now</li>
            <li> /&gt;*update - died a few weeks after my D cell mod.extra amps and volts probably fried the motor.</li>
            <li> You can safely ignore the poor guy who complained about the tip \\&quot;spinning around\\&quot; because he was too ignorant or stupid to actually insert the tip into the unit</li>
            <li> Using this water flosser was a bit messy, but I haven&#x27;t used one before and expect that it would get easier with time and practice.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time with the \\&quot;sink\\&quot; model.</li>
            <li> observations:&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s going to be a bit messy.</li>
            <li> I purchased one of these about a year ago and within a few months it began to become increasingly sluggish.</li>
            <li> But if you ever need to plug something else in (or move in my case) and keep it unplugged for a few days, and you just have to throw it away.</li>
            <li> What a waste.</li>
            <li> but as a hand held unit, it tends to be somewhat messy.</li>
            <li> Just a dead battery.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Manufacturer, if you read this, please advise if this dead unit can be revived.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> but it is messy to fill and use.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it died at an early age.  </li>
            <li> I thought that when it said \\&quot;portable\\&quot; it meant I could leave it unplugged for a few days before having to recharge.  </li>
            <li> It was a piece of junk and a waste of my money.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product ignoring the comments that it stopped working after a few months, well it did, that is</li>
            <li> I like the process and have checked with a proxy brush to see it there is residue left behind which there was not.</li>
            <li> Bought it and used it periodically for a few months and water started leaking out of the bottom.</li>
            <li> I bought this item a couple of years ago for my disabled son.</li>
            <li> The corded one was a pain and messy.</li>
            <li> Well, there was nothing left behind for the string floss to pick up.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s dead in the beginning</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Battery is dead and canot be changed&lt;br /&gt;Unit</li>
            <li> ends up a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> WASTE YOUR MONEY...</li>
            <li> I tested it and decided I cannot use it for everyday because of the water limit.</li>
            <li> Too much trouble.  </li>
            <li> have trouble with it myself, tend to squirt myself in the face or the wall - and prefer my corded countertop model so i can lean over the sink and</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and it always works well for me.</li>
            <li> It runs completely dead after a number of uses before you need to plug it in again to recharge.</li>
            <li> it is a waste of time to look and a waste of money to buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have trouble taking the time to floss</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, get another brand of water pick.</li>
            <li> (That seems redundant.</li>
            <li> There are two levels: Deadly and Deadlier.  </li>
            <li> At month four I began to have trouble charging.</li>
            <li> so you can use it in the shower if you are really messy.</li>
            <li> Have a stationary model I use everyday.</li>
            <li> I only gave 4 stars because the battery life will not last for few days, I am so afraid that I&#x27;ll use all the power.</li>
            <li> After a few seconds the machine would stop working.</li>
            <li> Others say they had trouble with the connection corroding they should have a door on it or have a plug plugging the area</li>
            <li> It is not that the battery does not hold the charge, but that the cord does not fit snugly into the unit so it does not charge the battery.</li>
            <li> , I may just leave this white elephant behind.</li>
            <li> /&gt;As noted in the title, there are a few cons.</li>
            <li> It conks off after a few months.</li>
            <li> The way I use it, it is quite messy.  </li>
            <li> have a few weeks of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No light to tell you when it is charged.</li>
            <li> I found that on the slow speed, it was just enough to do my mouth all around fairly slow.  </li>
            <li> Even worse, the water reservoir has begun to leak -- so that filling the reservoir and setting it by the sink for even a few minutes creates a giant puddle.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-battery life is total and absolute crap.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not a huge &amp;#</li>
            <li> Just add a little vinegar to the water once a month and run it through the system, then run some plain water through to rinse.  </li>
            <li> In the past their was a button you could press down to turn on and off.</li>
            <li> filling orifice is so small that you will overrun it unless you turn the tap down to a minimum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s taller than the height of my faucet.  </li>
            <li> For now, no more string floss or other floss like contraptions!</li>
            <li> I live in Spain, the electric voltage is wrong and I can&#x27;t buy a transformer, so I am not able to use it.</li>
            <li> Once again the rechargeable battery dies after less then 5 months!</li>
            <li> I bought this unit because it takes less space on my small vanity.  </li>
            <li> After using it for less than 3 weeks!</li>
            <li> Also noticing less plaque and whiter teeth!</li>
            <li> I got the water flosser for my husband, who is one of those lucky people who could use a cleaning every 3 months :(.</li>
            <li> As the pick is not at the end of a small tube, you make a mess of it when you use it.  </li>
            <li> The tube from my countertop model is a minor inconvenience compared to having to tilt my head around to accommodate this dumb vertical thing.  </li>
            <li> My teeth always feel icky 1 month before I&#x27;m due for a cleaning</li>
            <li> plain water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed, it&#x27;s not much smaller than a regular Warepick, the water pressure is also lower and the water container is not large enough</li>
            <li> They told me that it suppose to be pluged-in at all time between usage, cause the battery is not strong.</li>
            <li> Both of them clunked out because, I think, of a design flow--the water tank is positioned so that it collects debris and the motor is not really strong.</li>
            <li> but it has a weak ,weak water pressure, defeats its purpose, too loud.</li>
            <li> Batteries are not easy to find.</li>
            <li> I think you would need to stop and refill this 2-3 times to be of any use and that is not really easy to do.</li>
            <li> The water bowl also seems a little small; you might need to fill it two or three times depend on your needs.  </li>
            <li> what a mess!</li>
            <li> The resevoir capacity is a little small for my liking.</li>
            <li> I have the full sized version of this, and while I like it, it&#x27;s a little annoying for me to have this sitting in my small bathroom.</li>
            <li> It is easier and less expensive than using regular batteries.  </li>
            <li> The tank is impossible to empty completely, and package information states that lithium batteries can&#x27;t be taken on passenger airplanes, so when I travel by air I can&#x27;t take it with me.</li>
            <li> The reservoir was too small, after a few second when there&#x27;s less water, if you hold it at a wrong angle, it will start shooting air.  </li>
            <li> I had a hard time using it without water running down my face, neck and arm and spitting out onto to the mirror.  </li>
            <li> so I picked this up for Christmas and after the first use my bad breath problems were gone.</li>
            <li> Too bad I didn&#x27;t read the instructions first -</li>
            <li> Although I was still pretty shocked even with the warning.</li>
            <li> I;ve been listening to my hygenist complaining about my poor dental habits as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> Poor battery life, long charge time, no charge indicator.</li>
            <li> Poor battery life, long charge time, no charge indicator.</li>
            <li> but I was disappointed since it is not as powerful as WP-100 Ultra Water Flosser, any</li>
            <li> the cordless  is not as powerful as the  plug in one so disappointed.</li>
            <li> Poor battery life, long charge time, no charge indicator.</li>
            <li> Water pressure is too weak to do what its non-portable cousin does, making it very portable but utterly useless for dental hygiene.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sad to know that big corporations like WaterPik are still in business selling their worthless plastic cheap junk.  </li>
            <li> Also a bit messy, water dripples out when in use, and the reservoir is fairly small, so takes a refill or two for a thorough cleansing</li>
            <li> Poor battery life, long charge time, no charge indicator.</li>
            <li> expect to get 1 use with full power, and then it tapers off to worthless in about 5 uses.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is poorly designed, too large, and difficult to hold&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing is that battery capacity is rather low from my point of view.</li>
            <li> and I would typically refill it at least once to thoroughly \\&quot;pik\\&quot; my mouth.  </li>
            <li> As one who has always hated to floss this is an easy alternative (one that my dentist endorses).  </li>
            <li> These idiots are actually shipping a product in 2014 that has a fixed 110volt-only charger.  </li>
            <li> These are very large and very hard to hold onto and awkward  use.</li>
            <li> It is poorly designed, too large, and difficult to hold (Can&#x27;t imagine if you have small hands).&lt;br /</li>
            <li> It is poorly designed, too large, and difficult to hold (Can&#x27;t imagine if you have small hands).   </li>
            <li> It is poorly designed, too large, and difficult to hold (Can&#x27;t imagine if you have small hands).&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li> TAKES UP LITTLE SPACE!  </li>
            <li> Takes a little getting use to...but does job!</li>
            <li> (We thought maybe the first one was a bad apple but both failed after several months).</li>
            <li> But when traveling, always had to try to survive with a little battery operated gadget that hardly did anything at all.  </li>
            <li> I thought this would be more convenient, but now it just collects dust.&lt;br /&gt;The base is too bulky and difficult to get back behind my wisdom teeth.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, water continues to drain down into the jacks even after you thoroughly dry the unit...</li>
            <li> This is my second waterpik, but like the first one, battery can&#x27;t be charged even within 1 year, even I charge for 24 hours, will not operate after one time use, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> If you have small hands you may find it a little hard to manuever.</li>
            <li> The flosser is a little clumsy to use and is a bit bulky sitting on the counter</li>
            <li> It takes up very little room on the counter.</li>
            <li> I asked why, and she said that there was very little plaque</li>
            <li> It takes up very little counter space.</li>
            <li> (actually, that is being unkind to small dogs!!!).</li>
            <li> THIS WAS A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY!!!!</li>
            <li> It was a waste of my hard earned money.</li>
            <li> I suppose, if I were attempting to use this thing for a water gun fight, I might find myself a little disappointed by how much water it holds or, rather</li>
            <li> I have also a conventional waterpik and not too crazy about that big thing on my bathroom counter.  </li>
            <li> I just wanted to say how much I appreciate all of your advice about ways to handle the bad charger.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, she got a gum infection and our dentist said it was because this water pick was actually pushing food under the gums!</li>
            <li> None of the usual stuff one would expect in 2013.  </li>
            <li> It has a small footprint</li>
            <li> So it seems the battery isn&#x27;t to blame but water and dirt getting past the seals onto the contacts.  </li>
            <li> The water canister detaches, although I am not sure why.  </li>
            <li> The reservoir is so small it runs out in 10 seconds.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> The shipment fees make it way expensive to buy it overseas than using other couriers on other websites like ebay</li>
            <li> The reservoir is so small it runs out in 10 seconds.   </li>
            <li> Battery is just now not able to hold a charge.</li>
            <li> The water compartment is small and the unit can&#x27;t be tipped atmall during use or the water stops flowing.</li>
            <li> Before buying this product on Amazon, I read all of the reviews and saw that there were a few negative ones.  </li>
            <li> I usually return items that don&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> FYI, water reservoir is too small for a flossing of all teeth at once have to refill.</li>
            <li> The reservoir is small.</li>
            <li> Not sure what their problem was.</li>
            <li> The water container is too small.</li>
            <li> Get over the small reservoir</li>
            <li> Water reservoir is a bit small.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cumbersome and has a small reservoir...</li>
            <li> but if it were any larger it would be difficult to hold and maneuver.</li>
            <li> For me, low is useless.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the difference between each head inst that big of a deal.  </li>
            <li> I will not flush with clorox as it will compromise the pump and will definitely not be healthy.  </li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve been disappointed in a product purchased on amazon.</li>
            <li> The water reservoir is small</li>
            <li> and I have small hands.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To begin with the reservoir is exceedingly small.</li>
            <li> It simply is not as elegant an operation as the Waterpik Ultra.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was unable to get my money back for this one either.</li>
            <li> the floss or the small brushes make the gums sore sometime the waterpik clams it.</li>
            <li> I usually fill the unit up twice with water for each cleaning.  </li>
            <li> wish didn&#x27;t have use it in shower to excessive w/water and mouth ,does job but don&#x27;t want water all over,so</li>
            <li> Only 2 speeds and the bulky size makes it difficult to use.</li>
            <li> Then recharge as usual.</li>
            <li> The reservoir is so small it runs out in 10 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> Compared the Panasonic and the Waterpik and finally decided to go with the souped up Waterpik.  WRONG.  </li>
            <li> No more floss for me</li>
            <li> owned one before and like the way it removes small food particles that dental floss doesn&#x27;t get.&lt;br /&gt;Makes</li>
            <li> But again the water reservoir is too small...</li>
            <li> It might run longer on the low setting, but, again, that&#x27;d be completely useless.  </li>
            <li> I guess my only silly issue is how they created the hole stopper where you put the liquid into the holder.</li>
            <li> I have had two of these units in the past 2 years.</li>
            <li> However, I called waterpik directly and expressed my disappointment.  </li>
            <li> I  am not sure how much&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was not sure if the unit was defective or not.</li>
            <li> I have gingivitis and have smoked in the past AND still pick up a cig now</li>
            <li> Charger is small.</li>
            <li> Turning the Waterpik past horizontal stops the water from flowing out.  </li>
            <li> Usually needs to be refilled once for each use.</li>
            <li> I picked out this one because his bathroom is on the small side and this model is quite compact, plus he travels a lot so</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;ll wind up doing with this one, since it&#x27;s been eight months since I got it, and I can&#x27;t return it to</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find the noise excessive.     </li>
            <li> The three small items can pack neatly in your luggage.  </li>
            <li> Irrigating with the Ultra and using a small amount of mouthwash (like Listerene) kills plaque forming bacteria.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem obvious how to replace the battery if and when it fails.  </li>
            <li> I was tired of getting the countertops all wet all the time.</li>
            <li> I usually have to refill it 2-3 times.</li>
            <li> There is no better water fight than dueling waterpics.</li>
            <li> Have had waterpik product in the past with the wand attached to tubing.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the item I purchased can be used only in Canada and the USA, even when an adapter is used.  </li>
            <li> - this is the second unit I&#x27;ve owned that failed this way.</li>
            <li> Messy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using mine for the past week</li>
            <li> reservoir is too small.</li>
            <li> No more sensitivity; no bleeding gums and I have avoided a visit to the oral surgeon.  </li>
            <li> Cons:  Small reservoir</li>
            <li> Granted the water reservoir is small</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this one is doing the same thing.  </li>
            <li> Me being the lazy flosser that I am, I thought I&#x27;d give it a go.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a lot of dental problems the past 10 years.  </li>
            <li> It is small and doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of counter space.  </li>
            <li> The Panasonic also collapses the power head into the tank, so it travels small.  </li>
            <li> a visit guy, no more.</li>
            <li> My one gripe is that the  reservoir is a bit too small and sometimes has to be refilled to finish a session.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-I noticed that water directly out of the faucet sometimes bothers my gums because it is too cold, so fill it up as soon as I finish using it</li>
            <li> I received TWO units with pumps that have failed in a short time.</li>
            <li> Small reservoir notwithstanding, 2 design inadequacies:&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a nifty waterflosser with a small footprint.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> If I get lazy and stop using it for a while</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a month now and the charge stays atleast for a week if not more.</li>
            <li> Maybe they all work this way, but I was not pleased with the product.  </li>
            <li> I have had three of the cordless WaterPik rechargeable oral irrigatiors over the past year and a half.&lt;br /&gt;Each</li>
            <li> unit failed after several months of use.</li>
            <li> Yes, the reservoir is small</li>
            <li> The water reservoir is waaaay too small.  </li>
            <li> Too small for home use.</li>
            <li> For the past yr.</li>
            <li> If you do buy a Waterpik, however, I do not recommend some of their attachments (e.g., tongue scrapper, and deep pocket nozzle), as I found them to be useless.</li>
            <li> The reservoir is so small it runs out in 10 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> *is* small.</li>
            <li> I am not pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> We bought everyone in our family one for Christmas this past year.</li>
            <li> I had braces, this product was a life saver because flossing is such a complicated task.</li>
            <li> Pretty inconvenient while travelling!</li>
            <li> i had read the US Amazon reviews which didn&#x27;t give me any warning about this issue, but later when googling the problem I came across a bunch of lousy reviews on the UK Amazon.</li>
            <li> ---I&#x27;m going to replace it with an ordinary plug in water pic.  </li>
            <li> The biggest downside is the small reservoir.  </li>
            <li> Got my braces off a few weeks ago and I will continue to use this!</li>
            <li> The instructions are very vague about how long to charge or how long a charge will last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Little bit of water mess but doing it over the sink takes 20 seconds and after 3 weeks i have no more sensitivity in my teeth because my gums are healthier!!</li>
            <li> Reading other reviews, this seems to be a very common problem.</li>
            <li> This product is very poor for the following reasons.  </li>
            <li> I have very narrow spaces between teeth and flossing is a chore</li>
            <li> Its very messy.</li>
            <li> yes, the on off is a little awkward, but since I use all the water anyway it is not that big a deal versus the convenience.</li>
            <li> But, it is just as poorly engineered as other reviewers have mentioned.  </li>
            <li> Not really that bad of life for such a gadget</li>
            <li> Without the battery indicator, I have had at least one morning where I was unable to finish using the waterpik and would have preferred knowing the night or day before that it should have been plugged in to charge overnight prior to that morning.     </li>
            <li> So even if the Waterpik is messy, and awkward, and I have to constantly refill the reservoir during a session, in my opinion</li>
            <li> so I have to have a case big enough to hold the base that fills the water.</li>
            <li> To suggest this product could take the place of old-fashioned flossing is utterly false and is false advertising for Waterpik to make such a claim.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that water holder doesn&#x27;t hold enough water for one use, but having to refill once midway through isn&#x27;t a terrible thing I suppose just a minor nuisance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Filling the tank is a little awkward because you have to lay the pic flat in the sink.  </li>
            <li> However, after less than two years of use, the battery is so weak that it has to be re-charged after every use.  </li>
            <li> I have used others in the past, but never liked them.  </li>
            <li> I found this hand-held unit awkward to hold and use, as well as messy to fill (at least twice for each use).</li>
            <li> I think this explains the long charge times and the lame battery life.</li>
            <li> I have a Waterpik that sits on the counter and is not suitable for travel.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom thinking it would help with her dental hygiene, but she hasn&#x27;t really figured out how to use it without spraying water all over :-(</li>
            <li> i hate flossing and have all of my teeth, so I needed something to clean behind my wisdom teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> As a lady with small hands, it did take me a few days to get used to holding it due to the large size of the base, but one you use it a few time, it isn&#x27;t awkward at all.  </li>
            <li> This little device is VERY hard to get used to.</li>
            <li> making it impossible to direct</li>
            <li> Poor quality - Stopped holding a charge in less than 3 months.  </li>
            <li> i had gotten this from wal-mart, and it had cost 9.99, i would be much less annoyed by all of its shortcomings.</li>
            <li> He had it less than a week when he dropped it, breaking one tip, (but worse) cracking the bottom of the plastic reservoir.  </li>
            <li> I guess that I should have expected this, but it is impossible for me to use this Waterflosser without getting wet from head to toe.  </li>
            <li> The water pin works fine, the design is terrible, the connector to recharge gets contaminated by the water while in use and it stops charging, I had to start using without removing the cord</li>
            <li> It is hard to fill.  </li>
            <li> I am a bit  hard of hearing)</li>
            <li> I have nerve damage in my hand that makes it hard to hold on to things and get tops off of bottles</li>
            <li> I am a bit hard of hearing)</li>
            <li> I have nerve damage in my hand that makes it hard to hold on to things and get tops off of bottles</li>
            <li> The machine is hard to manipulate around your mouth and you end up drooling water all over it unless you use two hands.  </li>
            <li> Both hard to believe.</li>
            <li> It is really hard to floss</li>
            <li> Gets into those hard places in your mouth</li>
            <li> Hard to hold.  </li>
            <li> So unfriendly that I hardly ever use it.</li>
            <li> The charger stopped accepting a charge after a couple of months and you cannot get at the rechargeable battery because it is hard sealed in the body.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to imagine a competitor hasn&#x27;t emerged and offered a well thought out, quality alternative.</li>
            <li> i had a hard time contacting the teeth and things web site for returns they made it so hard that i had to send the stuff to the waterpik company</li>
            <li> and it makes it hard to contact people in the states</li>
            <li> Some reviews said this was hard to use.</li>
            <li> It is hard to get every bit of water out of the flosser when finished with using it</li>
            <li> I feel this product is too bulky and hard to use.</li>
            <li> , it is hard to imagine why Waterpik has made no effort to come up with a fix.    </li>
            <li> Used the product six times and now there is hardly any pressure.</li>
            <li> and I have some bridges that are hard to keep food out from under it.</li>
            <li> This was hard to use.</li>
            <li> Soooo hard to maneuver....</li>
            <li> It is really hard to fill this one fully.  </li>
            <li> My daughter uses this waterpik flosser for those hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li> But...  1-It&#x27;s hard to fill.  </li>
            <li> That means the product is working hard.</li>
            <li> and it is hard to hold onto while using - even for me.  </li>
            <li> The nozzle swivels and is hard to keep in place.</li>
            <li> bottom too bulky to be portable and hard to hold  to the teeth.</li>
            <li> and I can hardly be bothered to go through the customer service procedures when I do get home</li>
            <li> Sucks.</li>
            <li> I had one once and will never own one again.</li>
            <li> It should be at least 2 1/2 times the size.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> It should be at least 2 1/2 times the size.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Some of the negative reviews do have valid points, but I am not so picky.</li>
            <li> Although, I do have to refill it at least once a session.</li>
            <li> It completely sucks.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It has lasted at least 2 weeks on a charge before I perceived any drop in power.</li>
            <li> Before purchasing this product I had read alot of negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> It should be at least 2 1/2 times the size.</li>
            <li> I will NEVER own another Water Pik product.  </li>
            <li> i spent the money on this silly contraption.the resaon being when u tilt the water pik it doesnt work,hard to get to the bottom of the teeth,and</li>
            <li> After about 5 or 10 months the unit gradually loses the ability to charge up.</li>
            <li> they rotate freely, that is very annoying because I have to hold the nozzle with my finger</li>
            <li> Needs at least one refill.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> At least make a 110-240v charger as an accessory.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m concerned about a build up of stale sitting water because the resevoir won&#x27;t empty.</li>
            <li> I do use it at least once or twice a week at work.</li>
            <li> However, I recently learned that unless you flush it frequently with something like hydrogen peroxide, nasty stuff will grow inside the pump mechanism.  </li>
            <li> Therefore I&#x27;d feel compelled to disinfect it at least once a week to prevent bacteria from growing.  </li>
            <li> The reservoir will need to be refilled at least once if not twice to get through what I would consider a \\&quot;normal\\&quot; cleaning cycle.</li>
            <li> It works but it is a bit clumsy.</li>
            <li> Also, it takes at least to reflls to do the mouth.  </li>
            <li> I find that i have to tell it at least twice while cleaning my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I kept thinking all the negative comments regarding the tank, noise and battery life were off the mark.  </li>
            <li> I had read some negative reviews before and they were way of the mark.</li>
            <li> that is my complaint  </li>
            <li> The big disappointment is that these days you expect a charger to be usable for all voltages as are mobile phones, laptops etc.</li>
            <li> I have to refill it at least once during one use--sometimes more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Battery life is outstanding....stays charged for at least 7 days.  </li>
            <li> This Waterpic Ultra Cordless has improved my dental health at least 50%.</li>
            <li> and I do use it at least once a day every day.</li>
            <li> Battery runs out (OR) the thing just loses strength and you can feel it when it shooting out water into your gums.</li>
            <li> I have never written a negative product review on Amazon - until now.</li>
            <li> They warn you about this in the directions at least -- drain the battery fully once, and it there&#x27;s no repair.</li>
            <li> I have owned this product for 3 years now, and use it at least twice a week.</li>
            <li> The biggest complaint though is the weakness of the jet.  </li>
            <li> For extended battery life, the unit should be charged at least 24 hours after 7-10 uses.</li>
            <li> Battery lasts at least 2 weeks between charges.  </li>
            <li> The unit loses power mid-use</li>
            <li> these negative reviews are spot on.  </li>
            <li> Another reviewer had already complained about the charging system of the unit so thought they have worked on it and improved it so am disapointed that the unit is still having charging problems.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Definitely not as effective as the benchtop, mains power model, but it does the job, and I travel a lot.</li>
            <li> After ordering this from a 3rd party vendor through Amazon.com, I see in the booklet warnings that if a person takes antibiotics before dental procedures (common for those with artificial joints), you should check with your dentist.</li>
            <li> The charge lasted at least 10 loads of water and going.</li>
            <li> A big disappointment.</li>
            <li> Once fully recharged, don&#x27;t charge it until it gets really slow or quits.     </li>
            <li> They saved a few cents and produced a poor product.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s started the chemical process and slowly dissolved the mineral deposits.  </li>
            <li> they just slowly lose their power.</li>
            <li> The item does the job, but the battery life is very bad, it goes out and stops working properly after the 2nd month, would not recomend this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was disappointed when, after just a couple months, the pressure suddenly was half what it was.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s jet rotates in your mouth so it is impossible to aim at a particular spot unless you hold the jet with the other hand which is rather awkward.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unless you plan on buying a new waterflosser every year, don&#x27;t buy this one.  :(</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in this water pic because it makes such a mess while flossing</li>
            <li> Not many manufacturers match that level of service!  </li>
            <li> I mean i&#x27;d pick my teeth</li>
            <li> Another problem is the tips rotate too easily - it is difficult to keep the stream of water aimed where you want it unless you use both hands, one to hold the unit and the other holding the tip.</li>
            <li> This water flosser is too weak to remove small pieces of food stuck in  your teeth.</li>
            <li> SMALL reservoir!  </li>
            <li> Not sure why i hadn&#x27;t bought one years ago!</li>
            <li> I mean this.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mean this.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is designed well, works unbelievably!</li>
            <li> I am disappointed that I got such little use out of mine.</li>
            <li> But seriously, this thing just sucks.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is the water pressure on the Hi setting could be stronger and the fact that it is very difficult to find replacement tips doesn&#x27;t help either.</li>
            <li> NASTY unless you clean your water pik hosing</li>
            <li> but then ignore you when you have a failure.  </li>
            <li> adding teaspoon of bleach reduces/eliminates gum pockets that I had gotten through failure to or inadequate flossing.  </li>
            <li> Will update if I experience any failure.</li>
            <li> Not to be confused with messy cumbersome corded models!  </li>
            <li> The cord/plug is very small</li>
            <li> : The water reservoir is very small.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 2 months, never letting the battery run down, and now it won&#x27;t hold a charge and is for me a useless product.  </li>
            <li> This tool is a little bigger than an electric toothbrush as the water reservoir is in the base of the instrument.</li>
            <li> It was a huge disappointment and I feel totally stupid for wasting my money,</li>
            <li> and I was wary about spending that much with the bad experience I had with the Waterpiks</li>
            <li> The battery failed after less than 6 months.</li>
            <li> The unit is awkward to hold and the nozzle spins making it difficult to direct the water.</li>
            <li> My point in reviewing this is a note to anyone using WaterPik products with serious allergies to MOLD.  </li>
            <li> But seriously:  </li>
            <li> This is ridiculous product design.</li>
            <li> The on-off switch is touchy--and responds in the off position, even at a slight touch--which is unfortunate.</li>
            <li> Using cold tap water may be uncomfortable for someone with sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I have had 2 of the less expensive models.</li>
            <li> The brass contacts appear to be corroded and the power from the unit is weak making the stream of water slow and ineffective.</li>
            <li> It is a very poorly designed, low quality, useless piece of junk.  </li>
            <li> WHAT A MESS!!!</li>
            <li> : It has been a little over a year, and the charging cord has failed.</li>
            <li> It reaches areas that are very hard or simply impossible to reach with regular floss.</li>
            <li> Too bad this portable device comes with a 110v only adapter and WaterPik</li>
            <li> Too bad WP engineers don&#x27;t factor in the constant dampness in the units and mold possibilities and design  for this issue.  </li>
            <li> Gingivitis (which affects almost everyone, eventually) can lead to increasing pocket depths, which contributes to bone loss, which, if bad enough, will lead to tooth loss.</li>
            <li> But - 6 months of battery life - $50 - not a good value.   </li>
            <li> I find it mediocre in quality, somewhat messy until you figure out what angle to hold it while using it.  </li>
            <li> In short, this unit is expensive, poorly designed, clunky, difficult to hold, and gives inefficient cleaning as compared to the WP-100W.</li>
            <li> The Water Flosser worked well for a few weeks, and then the battery began to fail.  </li>
            <li> Even at low pressure, it can hurt your gums, and trust me, it is painful.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a waterflosser I could take on vacation, but this is almost too heavy to use and difficult to maneuver.</li>
            <li> This thing was no good.</li>
            <li> I hate to floss and always have bleeding gums as I approach the next dental cleaning date -- no more.  </li>
            <li> Upon inspection noted corrosion on the terminal you plug into near the base.  </li>
            <li> And that nasty stuff will ride right along with the water flushing your teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> This unit is inconvenient because the clear plastic tip is not stationary after insertion, which is awkward.</li>
            <li> Waterpik should design this product with a protected plug area since it is impossible to keep it dry when in use.</li>
            <li> The worst thing about this is that you have to refill it about 3 times to do your entire mouth, it never really got everything in between</li>
            <li> However, the tip rotator is so loose so that it is practically impossible to keep it in the position intended.  </li>
            <li> Furthermore, the twisting ring around the base of the nozzle which can be manipulated to direct the stream of water is nigh to impossible to operate with  the hand holding the waterpik necessitating the use of the other hand.</li>
            <li> It had a detachable tank, and the tips were connected to the pump via flexible tubing, which was of course the system&#x27;s weak spot (the tubing would eventually crack).</li>
            <li> The battery is the weak link.  </li>
            <li> Weak water stream.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Probably I have never had a product with a weak battery.   </li>
            <li> Weak water stream.   </li>
            <li> Weak pump.  </li>
            <li> This is the second time I am disappointed with Amazon since not all products cn be shipped to Australia&lt;br /&gt;From</li>
            <li> I got braces put on a month ago and trying to floss is a long painful process..</li>
            <li> Those WP-360s suffered from weak batteries and unreliable electronics</li>
            <li> portability, large/inefficient size, ungainly ergonomics  -Weak water stream.    </li>
            <li> at first it tickled my gums terribly until I adjusted to it</li>
            <li> It also has a fairly weak pump - even fully charged it often stops while using.  </li>
            <li> For me, the pressure is too weak.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very difficult to get all the water out of it, so it never really dries.  </li>
            <li> I am disappointed in this product as I bought 3 of them and ALL broke after about a year of daily use.</li>
            <li> Power seems weak.  </li>
            <li> Weak water</li>
            <li> This is a product in desperate, desperate need of a major overhaul.  </li>
            <li> I had had one before, very messy and difficult to use.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t like the water going down my wrist and arm while in use and the awful noise it makes when the tank runs low.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Water from your mouth keeps falling on the unit as you use it thus creating a mess not to mention a dirty enviroment.&lt;br /&gt;Unit</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my Waterpik (which suffered a broken tubing, a weak point of the device).</li>
            <li> reading reviews provided by others, this is a very common occurrence.</li>
            <li> I wasted $50!!!</li>
            <li> WP-360  -Poor Reservoir Capacity -only 120 ml or 20% less than the already-tiny WP-360&#x27;s 150 ml  -Terrible</li>
            <li> it is a broken item.</li>
            <li> The thin gasket around the door broke.</li>
            <li> I figured that I would trade up a bit from the lower priced ones that I had broken and bought this one that I am reviewing.  </li>
            <li> I charge it up, then unplug it and use it for days until it stops or shows signs of needing recharge, then recharge it and have not experienced battery issues yet.  </li>
            <li> This is messy and awkward to hold onto.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not great at flossing</li>
            <li> It appears to be almost identical to my 1270 with a slightly different nozzel at the base.  </li>
            <li> Worse: the jet tends to jump off, spraying your face, the mirror, the bathroom, everything.</li>
            <li> Mine lasted maybe 3 months, getting worse each month, until the battery AND motor/pump were both shot.</li>
            <li> and eventually I got tired of the lecture and decided to try a cordless one.      </li>
            <li> I worry about bacteria (or worse mold) growing in there.   </li>
            <li> After continuous nightly usage, the formation of tartar is significantly decreased.</li>
            <li> I just feel it is poorly designed.</li>
            <li> It annoyed me</li>
            <li> sink-top WaterPik and Sonicare electric toothbrushes approximately 8 years ago.</li>
            <li> However, I have had problems with poor quality.  </li>
            <li> 2013 - I&#x27;m addicted to this thing.  </li>
            <li> and I have used it approximately 3 times per week since owning it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This model is poorly designed.  </li>
            <li> The connection to the charger seemed poor so sometimes it wont charge at all.  </li>
            <li> , now he&#x27;s addicted to it too.</li>
            <li> Not happy with its performance.</li>
            <li> Poorly made product</li>
            <li> and I now have to try and sort this out not happy about this at all.</li>
            <li> The design is poor.  </li>
            <li> This is the worse piece of garbage I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s lready broken.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s poorly designed.</li>
            <li> Only annoying thing is emptying the tank.  </li>
            <li> Its a poor design, being \\&quot;level\\&quot;</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT FROM AMAZON BUY IT FROM WATERPIK, WHERE THEY STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCTS.</li>
            <li> It turned out to be such a piece of worthless junk.  </li>
            <li> I used to have the big mamou sized one and hated how much space it ate up, plus hated those tubes attached.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Shame on Waterpik for poor design principles.</li>
            <li> The only product improvement that I would suggest is a charging base so that you do not have to plug/unplug to use.</li>
            <li> my cousin  also have this problem just not as worse as me</li>
            <li> $54 and broken within one week.</li>
            <li> I bought this product approximately one year ago.  </li>
            <li> What a rip-off.  </li>
            <li> Poor Reservoir Capacity&lt;br</li>
            <li> I became so addicted to my waterpik, that I bought the cordless one for travel since I work out of town during the week.  </li>
            <li> POOR DESIGN AND UNCARING POST PURCHASE CUSTOMER SERVICE.</li>
            <li> The power of the water is not great</li>
            <li> /&gt;Wednesday..It&#x27;s broken.  </li>
            <li> Poor piece of equipment quit working just after the warranty ran out.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be an upgrade after my waterpik cord was broken after 5 years.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion Amazon should stand behind this.</li>
            <li> No more of those awfully expensive and very painful dental deep scalings of the  gums!</li>
            <li> There are areas in the front of the reservoir that are impossible to reach and thus, remain dotted with the black mold.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m quite amazed as it actually took out some of the nasty stuff that I usually have to use a brush, floss and sometimes Q-tips.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sloppy when used.</li>
            <li> All that and the small resevoir make it just too awkward for my taste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed in this product due to it&#x27;s lack of pressure.</li>
            <li> NOT GOOD!</li>
            <li> Not a good product!</li>
            <li> What I hate, as another reviewer mentioned, is that the tip rotates so loosely that you can&#x27;t control the stream.  </li>
            <li> I read some of the bad reviews and was a little concerned, but ordered it anyway.</li>
            <li> I spent $50 to use this stupid thing for 2 months.  </li>
            <li> Expensive, Poor Value:</li>
            <li> Expensive, Poor Value:</li>
            <li> The Waterpik Waterflooser is so useless, so poorly designed, it should not be sold.</li>
            <li> -Expensive, Poor Value:</li>
            <li> It fails miserably at cleaning in and around my bridgework and fails to do much along the gumline.</li>
            <li> Expensive, Poor Value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried three of them and there all the same ( very bad design )</li>
            <li> The water re-fill plug becomes almost impossible to open, and then begins to leak from a bad seal.  </li>
            <li> You have to use two hands, one to hold the jet tip at the base, and the other to hold the unit.  </li>
            <li> When I started to use it I thought that flosser was weak, so I called to customer service for exchange and guess what?!</li>
            <li> The bad thing is the tank is a bit small</li>
            <li> After reading that it is a basically disposable appliance (you cannot replace the battery), I was extremely disappointed with the purchase and the waste of it all.  </li>
            <li> The battery is VERY weak and it sounds like it is giving out now.  </li>
            <li> The water stream is very weak.</li>
            <li> The spray is very weak.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in the power and overall performance.</li>
            <li> I bought a different model waterpik and have been very disappointed with the device&#x27;s tips quality.  </li>
            <li> No more flossing Yeah!!!</li>
            <li> We have little counter space in our bathroom so it&#x27;s difficult to find a place to rest the base.</li>
            <li> I just can not understand all these bad negative reviews.</li>
            <li> I just can not understand all these bad negative reviews.</li>
            <li> Product works, but the premise of high-pressure water for dental hygine is itself questionable.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Sometimes when I read these reviews I think \\&quot;Man, that person sounds angry or disgruntled.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> Sad.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Waterpic engineers failed on this one.</li>
            <li> Insufficient power to get between gums and teeth, and worst is that for a traveler, Water Pic Inc has included the cheapest 110v only transformer.  </li>
            <li> I went to Europe and the transformer failed.</li>
            <li> Silly me, I assumed the transformer would be autosensing 120-240v.  </li>
            <li> Why is this so difficult?</li>
            <li> Sorry, but I refuse to retrofit like another reviewer did with his/hers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Price - considering the expensive battery, I see no problem here.</li>
            <li> I do not fault the product for this issue, needless to say.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a useless brick.</li>
            <li> Since I did not keep the receipt, it is now an expensive piece of garbage.  </li>
            <li> There was nothing wrong with it.</li>
            <li> Item is difficult use.</li>
            <li> - I wonder if people are commenting on the wrong product...    </li>
            <li> So I did and in an age where battery problems like these do not have to be the case Water Pik puts sorry battery technology again in this unit.  </li>
            <li> im sorry</li>
            <li> Flawed Design:    </li>
            <li> and so the device becomes useless.</li>
            <li> The unit failed after three months of twice-a-day use.</li>
            <li> Battery Fails after two months of usage.    </li>
            <li> I do not want another unit so that it fails again</li>
            <li> but well,, all the electronics are made to fail someday...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s does the job but is noisy and cheesy looking, so</li>
            <li> but I have found it frustrating and awkward to use.</li>
            <li> I tried but it was so complicated I never got a penny.</li>
            <li> Bulkyto and uncomfortable hold and use.  </li>
            <li> ; I am addicted to it now, I use it twice a day!</li>
            <li> keeps rotating as you use it making it difficult to hold in place.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, unable to drain all the water from it after use.</li>
            <li> unfortunately it leaks all over the counter.  </li>
            <li> I am unable to rate the performance because she refused to try the WaterFlosser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, there is nothing improved about</li>
            <li> the WP-450 and it is merely an \\&quot;Ultra-disappointment\\&quot;.    </li>
            <li> Braces makes flossing really difficult.</li>
            <li> This waterfloss is useless during travel.</li>
            <li> However, when I asked if the replacement also had a 2 year warranty on it, she sadly said &amp;#34;no&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, when I asked if the replacement also had a 2 year warranty on it, she sadly said &amp;#34;no&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS EXPENSIVE ILL-DESIGNED POWER SOURCE.</li>
            <li> The item worked well, unfortunately it stopped working just after the 30-day return deadline.  </li>
            <li> Really sad that Waterpik can&#x27;t figure out the technology that Braun uses for their toothbrushes--charging without a wired connection.  </li>
            <li> Product is useless without water pics.</li>
            <li> It is virtually useless.</li>
            <li> Battery is useless.</li>
            <li> It fails to serve any purpose.</li>
            <li> And this unfortunately happened when the return deadline expired so now I&#x27;m stuck with a non-working waterpik.</li>
            <li> br /&gt; &amp;#62; size makes it a bit difficult to handle w/o splashing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Either she has never owned a coffee grinder or there was something wrong with her unit.</li>
            <li> and because I&#x27;m over here, it&#x27;s difficult to return it.</li>
            <li> When this thing&#x27;s battery died, i took it apart to figure out what went wrong.</li>
            <li> Sadly the plastic water reservoir cracked at the seam after about 4 1/2 months of use.  </li>
            <li> Those scary pamphlets in your dentist&#x27;s office have a valid point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;But, unfortunately, they didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I bough this after another brand constantly failed.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I ended up returning the product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (maybe im doing it wrong?), and honeslty for the price I don&#x27;t think I would ever purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Then the motor failed.  </li>
            <li> I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> Lousy battery</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> Upon receipt the pump was feeble.  </li>
            <li> I knew from reading reviews before I purchased that there is no light to indicate when the battery is charging and when it is fully charged, but it is annoying.  </li>
            <li> The waterflosser lost power, not charging anymore, and totally useless.</li>
            <li> Customer support is useless.</li>
            <li> you will not be sorry.</li>
            <li> You gotta pull the water like you do with a straw and move it around your teeth blindly.</li>
            <li> Instead I just find it to be terribly mediocre.</li>
            <li> it failed after 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> in conclusion, although I had a difficult time controlling it</li>
            <li> Plus, it anything goes wrong</li>
            <li> Tried cleaning it but still no water pressure, its useless now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just sorry that it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> UNFORTUNATELY, DON&#x27;T HAVE TIME TO CONTACT EITHER THE MANUFACTURER OR AMAZON.</li>
            <li> Feels uncomfortable in the hand while using it.  </li>
            <li> Turning the machine while it&#x27;s operating is difficult.</li>
            <li> It was so lousy</li>
            <li> Switches have failed on both.  </li>
            <li> After a couple of months&#x27; usage, the connection between the unit and the tip began to leak and finally failed.</li>
            <li> My dentist suggested I get one because of some weird spacing in my teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry I bought this</li>
            <li> I charge it overnight once a week, and haven&#x27;t had it fail using it twice a day in between.</li>
            <li> At home I use a Hydrofloss but that is too difficult to take on</li>
            <li> I find it difficult to fill without&lt;br /&gt;running water all over the unit.</li>
            <li> FAIL.</li>
            <li> LAME.</li>
            <li> Flossing and brushing did not get the small particles at the base of my crowns.</li>
            <li> Very difficult to use and poor instructions.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s much,much easier to hold the small wand attached to base than it is to hold the gigantic cordless machine</li>
            <li> The people who said it has a weak stream either have a bad model, or gums of steel.</li>
            <li> this is a piece of crap , after two months it no longer get charged, of course it is too late to return it, so I&#x27;m stuck with it,     </li>
            <li> Needless to say, trying to plug it in to charge it has very bad consequences if you don&#x27;t get all of the water out of that hole, which is hard to do.  </li>
            <li> BLACK MOLD IS VERY BAD FOR YOUR HEALTH AND CAN KILL YOU IF YOU ARE ALLERGIC!!!!    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to treat with kid gloves, which has been very inconvenient and frustrating.  </li>
            <li> That explains both the lack of a charge indicator and the requisite four pages of crazy consumer warnings.</li>
            <li> Also, I didn&#x27;t like the feeling of the waterpik on a tether, attached to the water reservoire, it can feel awkward.  </li>
            <li> Here is where you are going to think that I am crazy</li>
            <li> I am afraid to leave it</li>
            <li> (I was so afraid of purchasing a dust collector).</li>
            <li> The waterpik works well and gets the food particles stuck under my bridges which I was going crazy with.  </li>
            <li> It is somewhat awkward to use, you have to lean over the sink so the water pours out of your mouth while your spraying your teeth.</li>
            <li> NOTE, USING COLD WATER</li>
            <li> BUT WHICH I FIND INCONVENIENT</li>
            <li> I found that it is awkward to use and does not meet my needs.</li>
            <li> switch seems slightly awkward to use while the pick is in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> This is needed because the item is somewhat awkward to maneuver</li>
            <li> noise drove my wife crazy, but did not bother me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awkward to hold.  </li>
            <li> it is awkward to keep it upright so that the water can be pumped into the nozzle.</li>
            <li> This cordless is comparatively awkward to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been unhappy with it from day one.</li>
            <li> so you have to use it while its plugged in which is dangerous because of the product design.</li>
            <li> cordless unit has turned out to be extremely disappointing.</li>
            <li> When I called Waterpik, I asked if i could just order a battery, with a cold reply I was told that there is no battery replacement for this product.</li>
            <li> so you&#x27;re not spraying cold liquid on your teeth.  </li>
            <li> Too bulky and too awkward to use for it&#x27;s intended purpose.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;3) is the design awkward to fill water -</li>
            <li> br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wrote to Waterpik via their web site expressing my disappointment at their product, I received an email from them within hours requesting that I supply the serial number to verify warranty</li>
            <li> I have to tilt it awkwardly just to get the opening under my faucet.  </li>
            <li> I put water from the kettle into the waterpik to mix with cold water as I don&#x27;t like ice cold water against my teeth.  </li>
            <li> (That was awkward.)</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is also awkward to use.</li>
            <li> but I WILL update if disappointment comes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I am not completely happy with the way the instruments swivel on the base.</li>
            <li> A terrible product - waste of money!</li>
            <li> Was I wrong on not having one like this before!</li>
            <li> cannot go wrong with using this in concert with flossing and a spinning toothbrush head!</li>
            <li> Any waterpik, battery or AC, is awkward to use, but it&#x27;s not too bad.</li>
            <li> the brush qualoty is crap and it turned into a useless tuft of bent bristles after one use.</li>
            <li> Very difficult to dump water out of water reservoir.  </li>
            <li> As someone else commented, the head swivels uncontrollably in your mouth, making it impossible to control the angle of the water when it hits your teeth, which is after all the purpose of using the waterpik.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost impossible to use without slobbering all over the device.  </li>
            <li> But I figure it could not be that bad as it was the number one seller of cordless water jets.</li>
            <li> If the unit was so bad why would it be the number one seller when I bought it?</li>
            <li> If the unit was so bad why would it be the number one seller when I bought it?</li>
            <li> but, I didn&#x27;t want the vendor to have to pay for Waterpik making a bad product.</li>
            <li> It is too bad it does not work plugged in.  </li>
            <li> I do not know why the bad reviews.  </li>
            <li> I have not one bad thing to say about this.  </li>
            <li> I saw the bad reviews..</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and thought: How bad can this be?</li>
            <li> bad thing is that Water Pik may never know why it was returned.  </li>
            <li> I have just had bad luck with this item not charging after 2 months use.  </li>
            <li> Feels bad about it.&lt;br /&gt;the</li>
            <li> BAD PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to order this after seeing all the bad reviews.</li>
            <li> tank)&lt;br /&gt;4) how bad is design?</li>
            <li> /&gt;The bad part of this is that I found it kinda &amp;#34;bad</li>
            <li> I thought maybe the charging lead went bad so tested it</li>
            <li> I thought the bad reviews may be a fluke</li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> I will stick with flossing and chalk this up to a bad purchase.</li>
            <li> I have lots of dental issues - implant, bridges, caps, laminates, bad gums.  </li>
            <li> To bad the drain is not on the bottom.</li>
            <li> It made having the braces not so painful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m SHOCKED by this product.  </li>
            <li> I do dread the having ugly thing sitting on my counter, though.</li>
            <li> frustrated because it is 120v and</li>
            <li> In addition, it&#x27;s downright ugly.</li>
            <li> The poor design is awful.  </li>
            <li> After using this my dentist said I still have to floss :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed that WaterPik continues to sell this piece of junk</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the battery life is terrible, it has to be recharged after 2-3 uses.</li>
            <li> Really disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> Utterly disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed in this product.  </li>
            <li> I am disappointed in the amount of pressure the highest setting gives.</li>
            <li> I am very unhappy with it.  </li>
            <li> Very unhappy with quality of unit.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> It was also very awkward to hold and move around my mouth.  </li>
            <li> Also the stupid pik does seem to rotate etc.  </li>
            <li> I was going to be stupid and try this one</li>
            <li> It makes no sense to have the head, handle, and tank in one piece - stupid design.</li>
            <li> This baby blasts the crap out.  </li>
            <li> Waterpik has to know that this product is crap.  </li>
            <li> If you hate wires, this is for you.    </li>
            <li> No cords except the charger base.  </li>
            <li> That being said, I hate shoving a piece of string between my teeth</li>
            <li> I hate flossing.</li>
            <li> You have to hold the base of the tip with your finger to prevent it from rotating inside your mouth.    </li>
            <li> so that my life revolves around working with WaterPik engineering to repeatedly troubleshot their piece of crap.</li>
            <li> I hate flossing and this solves that problem.  </li>
            <li> I HATE flossing-</li>
            <li> I would be embarassed to sell this worthless piece of $#@&amp;.  </li>
            <li> really annoying and</li>
            <li> I said I hate flossing</li>
            <li> I hate floss....</li>
            <li> HATE, HATE</li>
            <li> I hate hate</li>
            <li> hate flossing.</li>
            <li> Cold water is shocking!</li>
            <li> I was concerned that having to refill every 45 seconds would be annoying</li>
            <li> I hate the idea that this will soon end up in the landfill.</li>
            <li> Totally worthless product by Waterpik.</li>
            <li> I hate string flossing, and sort-of tolerate the Reach flosser, so I wondered how I&#x27;d ever use this regularly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cats hate it, birds cheer.</li>
            <li> Be prepared to look like an idiot.</li>
            <li> I hate this thing.</li>
            <li> Annoying.  </li>
            <li> I would suggest the one with the permanent base station.</li>
            <li> I noted in another review that someone said the knob at the base of the tip didn&#x27;t rotate the tip.  </li>
            <li> get the corded one instead, skip on this crap.</li>
            <li> Buy one - either the cordless or the base device.</li>
            <li> I got this because I hate flossing</li>
            <li> I never leave the tank thing on the base</li>
            <li> If you have used the waterpik flosser with cord before then you will hate this one.  </li>
            <li> I returned this crap after one use.  </li>
            <li> ULTRA BAD!</li>
            <li> That is really bad!</li>
            <li> I tried a battery operate corded waterpik with a tank and HATED it.   </li>
            <li> I hated flossing.  </li>
            <li> Very bad.</li>
            <li> Very bad.</li>

            <li> But when I used this product I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very annoying!</li>
            <li> Terrible portability, large/inefficient size, ungainly ergonomics</li>
            <li> I was shocked to get an email today stating that they WERE SENDING ME A KNEW ONE!!!  </li>
            <li> The worst part is trying to get the water where you want it.  </li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> The design is horrible though.  </li>
            <li> Our South Florida water is terrible and clogs my coffee pot.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t get that shock you get from the wench at the dentist who gets a kick out of zapping my gumline with ice cold water!!!!</li>
            <li> This is one of the worst dental products I have tried.</li>
            <li> The battery life is terrible.  </li>
            <li> , HATE it!!!</li>
            <li> The pressure is terrible.</li>
            <li> I have used another cordless before and it was horrible.  </li>
            <li> You have no idea how much disgusting stuff is between your teeth until you buy one of these (even after brushing).</li>
            <li> The jet works well, but the rest of the product is horrible.  </li>
            <li> Stupid me!!!!  </li>

            <li> Terrible product and terrible service.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!!  </li>
            <li> Terrible product</li>
            <li> The worst part is that this wireless waterflosser comes with 110v charger, which no use for me if i travel some countries with 220v charging.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> waste of money, gets everywhere, wish I could return it. it just collects dust in my bathroom after 2 uses</li>
            <li> Finally I have found a way to keep my teeth clean when on the road!  The big Waterpik machine on our sink at home keeps away the plaque - more important than brushing and flossing, although all three are important for healthy teeth and gums.  But when traveling, always had to try to survive with a little battery operated gadget that hardly did anything at all.  This baby blasts the crap out.  Got one for the kid at college that she can keep charged in her room and carry to the bathroom down the hall to keep the mouth in fine order.</li>
            <li> It worked VERY briefly.  Then it just stopped working.  After about 3 mos.  Have replaced it with an oral irrigator by ToiletTREE.  That product works GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Get one of those instead of this mess.</li>
            <li> my second one.  good,.</li>
            <li> It would be better if the tank held more water. I always run out before I&#x27;m finished. Very annoying!</li>
            <li> it is not functioning at all. it is a broken item. Most probably, the battery is dead. Is it possible to replace the battery?</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t remove all material between teeth. After using this my dentist said I still have to floss :(</li>
            <li> My dentist had recommended one and do not live in the USA.  So, my daughter bought one and brought it to me.  Good stuff</li>
            <li> Water feels like a tsunami in your mouth! Too much pressure!</li>
            <li> Water pick developed a flaw and forces the clear plastic tube out of the base.&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t return it because problem started after I had purchased it a year ago.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointing!</li>
            <li> at first thought it was going to be cheap , because of price. After using it for a few weeks,  i love it, use it every night before bed</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  Have to refill it a couple of times to get enough of a workout for my gums.&lt;br /&gt;Wish it had a little higher pressure.  Thought I would try the portable one, but it is not as effective as the non-portable version.</li>
            <li> Quality seems acceptable and it does what is advertizes, but my wife bought this thinking it would make life with braces easier. Unfortunately, she got a gum infection and our dentist said it was because this water pick was actually pushing food under the gums! She stopped use and the infection went away and did not return. Product works, but the premise of high-pressure water for dental hygine is itself questionable.</li>
            <li> Not sure it&#x27;s a complete replacement for regular flossing, but it seems to be beneficial.  Give it a try and see</li>
            <li> Our dentist suggested we get the Waterpik Waterflosser and we&#x27;re glad he did! It works great. The Amazon price was quite competitive. It was easy to order and was shipped right away.</li>
            <li> Replaced totally the good old dental floss by this device.  Works great, takes leftover food debris out well, keeps dental plaque away, my dentist and hygienist noticed the improvement.  Great warranty and support.  Issues is with the bulky size of the device, the charger that needs to be connected and the need to recharge every couple of days as it doesn&#x27;t keep a charge too well, having to plug it with that not too well designed connector.</li>
            <li> Gave it a  4 because it&#x27;s a good product.  Somewhat bulky;  however, I can live with this.</li>
            <li> My second Waterpik...same model lasted about ten years...loved the old one, so why change right!  Excellent for general flossing, especially if you have tight spaces between teeth, irregular spacing, or implants.  They&#x27;ve made a few improvements to this new model, but I never had any problem with the old one. I&#x27;ve seen some comments regarding pressure...never had a problem with this . There are two setting for pressure, low and high.  I&#x27;ve never needed high as it does just fine on the low setting.  There&#x27;s no need for high pressures, just enough to remove the food particles.  The idea isn&#x27;t to drive the food particles into and under the gum tissues, just remove them with REGULAR Waterpik use.  My wife has a plug-in tank model and sets the pressure at about half which she says is plenty.   UPDATE...this unit has a redesigned plug-in for the charger cord end to fit into the unit and a larger water tank...excellent unit.</li>
            <li> Really? Is it 1980?  There is no charge indicator at all.  Nothing to indicate charging is taking place, nothing to indicate a full charge, nothing to indicate a need to charge.  Nothing.  Nothing at all.  While I didn&#x27;t have high expectations of quality with a cordless waterflosser, it never occurred to me there wouldn&#x27;t be a charge indicator.  Really?  What&#x27;s next, GIANT Bell Bottom jeans?  Remember those anyone?  They were popular right before battery charge indicators were invented!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the missing indicator this works about as I expected it would.  It takes up considerably less counter space then traditional waterpiks and even though it doesn&#x27;t hold as much water, I don&#x27;t mind having to fill it twice to keep my smile nice!&lt;br /&gt;Oh one more thing.  There wasn&#x27;t even an owner&#x27;s manual to describe proper usage and the various tips included in the package.  There was only a quick start guide which says to 1) charge for 24 hours, 2) insert tip, 3) fill reservoir, 4) use low pressure setting first time out, 5) how to turn on/off unit and 6) techniques for best results.  No warnings about how high pressure water can cut through tissue, no shock warnings.  None of the usual stuff one would expect in 2013.  OMG, what if someone uncovered this product in the R &amp; D department where it has been hiding for 30 years and said \\&quot;it&#x27;s your time now, go out unto the world\\&quot;. That explains both the lack of a charge indicator and the requisite four pages of crazy consumer warnings.</li>
            <li> This device is very helpful during travel time. With single full charge, you will be able to use it for about 40 tull-tank usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad :  I have to refill water tank 2-3 time per usage. I wish it provides a connector to water tap, so that I will have option to use the tank or connected to water tap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good : Two speed mode Hi-Low are sufficient to provide water floss function during travel time.</li>
            <li> This is the second WP-450 I bought.  The first lasted about 3 years before the battery became weak and would not charge correctly.  The instruction manual gave no information on battery replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Since I was short on time when the first stopped working, I went to Walgreens expecting to find another WP-450, but all they stocked was a WP-360/365 so I bought it.  This waterpik model developed problems after only 6 months of usage -- water leakage and small plastic catches for the water tank fell off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The WP-450 is good quality except for the battery and the WP-360/365 is junk.</li>
            <li> I thought I would use this over and over.  So far, I&#x27;ve only used it once.  The size of it isn&#x27;t necessarily convenient if you have limited bathroom storage space.  The water reservoir seems big enough, but once you turn it on, the water supply is gone before you can get around to all your teeth.  It&#x27;s okay, but I wish I had kept my money in my pocket on this one.</li>
            <li> Number 1 for oral hygiene..  takes out all the left over crums between my teeth..  I use it before and after I brush..  Healthy Teeth are Priceless.</li>
            <li> I cannot understand why I was not informed about this product by my dentist or hygienist all these years. The water flushes out particles even after flossing and brushing!! I love this.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like the water going down my wrist and arm while in use and the awful noise it makes when the tank runs low. Also, I am forever trying to plug it in and hitting the on button by accident with spray shooting everywhere. If there is another item like this without these impediments, I would switch. But overall, my teeth are fantastically cleaner, now. Since they are very close together, this is real progress for me and much appreciated.</li>
            <li> The waterpik waterflosser is exactly what i wanted.  It&#x27;s very convient and works very well.  I&#x27;m very happy and glad I ordered this waterpik.</li>
            <li> The dental hygienist who works for my periodontist suggested I buy one to keep food particles out of the  pockets in my gums.It works</li>
            <li> For travelers, the potable waterpic is great.  The only problem I see with it, it is not powerful enough.&lt;br /&gt;For years I have the big Waterpic and it just had a lot stronger water jet, which did a better job of cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;But being this small, it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> Works fine, but a bit noisy.  Cannot use it if others are sleeping.  Wish it had a low battery indicator as it ran out on me in the middle of use.</li>
            <li> I expected it to clean in between teeth but it has a weak ,weak water pressure, defeats its purpose, too loud. Sucks. waste of money.</li>
            <li> I like that it is portable and don&#x27;t have to have it plugged in.  I ordered the pik pocket tip for it.</li>
            <li> The earlier model was a barely working toy.  This one is powerful and a pleasure to use, especially since I noticed a great improvement in gum &amp;#34;pockets&amp;#34; within a few days.  I hope to get a great report from my hygienist at my next cleaning.</li>
            <li> I used the product for less than one year.  The thin gasket around the door broke. I called Waterpik Customer Service and they told me they did not sell replacement gasket.  I would be required to purchase an entire new tank for $8 plus shipping.  The Customer Service had me remove the tank when I called.  Inside of the tank was covered with slimy black fungus.  I can&#x27;t believe I was using this Waterflosser on my mouth.</li>
            <li> Works well.  Have to fill twice - once for uppers and once for lowers.  Convienent for travel but a bit bulky.</li>
            <li> I bought the portable waterpik so I wouldn&#x27;t have another product sitting on my bathroom counter and yet another thing that needed to be plugged in (after the toothbrush, radio, curling iron, etc.) Also, I didn&#x27;t like the feeling of the waterpik on a tether, attached to the water reservoire, it can feel awkward.  I keep the cordless one stored under the sink.  It keeps a charge for a remarkable length of time -- I only need to charge it every few weeks &amp; do so overnight and then I put the cord away until I need it again.  It holds enough water for a quick once-over but I often fill it a second time to spend more time in certain problem areas I have.  This is not a big deal -- it&#x27;s so easy to refill, takes about 10 seconds.  My gums have improved dramatically.  I add some sensodyne mouthwash to the water and that has helped too.  I much prefer using the cordless waterpik to flossing with floss.  It&#x27;s a really good product.</li>
            <li> I do appreciate that this Waterpik has a smaller footprint so that it takes up less space on the counter.  It is also great that it does not have to remain plugged in.  Much tidier on the bathroom counter.  Unfortunately, as is typical for many rechargeables, it seems to me that it is less powerful than my former plug-in Waterpik.  The smaller capacity means I have to refill it at least once to floss my entire mouth, and the fill door is not in a particularly convenient place...although looking at the design, I don&#x27;t know where it could be more conveniently located.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT it does an okay job; my minor complaints are mere inconveniences.  The only major complaint is the lack of high power, and I guess for now that is compensated for by the lower price and convenient smaller size</li>
            <li> It worked wonderful for 1 year then the battery died! I had to throw it away because I could not change the battery!</li>
            <li> Have used an Interplak corded flosser for about 8 years - then water hose broke. No hose replacement available.&lt;br /&gt;Decided to try this flosser. It has two water pressure settings. The lower one is strong enough.&lt;br /&gt;If you use the higher pressure, you are likely to run out of water before flossing completely.&lt;br /&gt;This flosser has an 8 oz tank - I wouldn&#x27;t get one with less capacity.&lt;br /&gt; It has a small footprint so it fits on a sink and the portability feature is nice for trips.&lt;br /&gt;Have used this flosser for about 3 weeks now and all is fine.&lt;br /&gt;And the price was great. I recommend this flosser.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, works great!  My teeth feel wonderful after I use the waterpik.  I really like the cordless feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DF-Richardson, Texas</li>
            <li> I recently got braces and I have the big waterpik machine at home but needed something&lt;br /&gt;portable for work.  This does a great job and is just as powerful as the big one.  Very&lt;br /&gt;compact and I can also take it on trips.</li>
            <li> Bottom line, I am a guy!!  I do everything in a rush in the mornings and the water pik is an excellent compliment to my procrastination.  Flossing takes forever so often I did not floss as often as I should.  This product makes quick work of what would normally be a 10 minute process. I can feel the clean on my teeth after I use the product and am very satisfied.  It has a ton of power and a long battery life. Just make sure you read the directions and charge for the full 24 hours before using the product.</li>
            <li> For the price I think this item is great! I love the compact size.  I use it at home and hardly ever have to charge it and the size of the water bin is almost perfect.  I never have to refill it during a use.</li>
            <li> Very good water floss machine, it has maintained the role of the gums, between the teeth to remove residue.&lt;br /&gt;convenient and practical.</li>
            <li> This is a teeth saver for my child with new braces.  It is easy to use and light weight.  Battery life is 1 week for daily use.  Really like the charging stand with nothing to remove.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brand on the recommendation of our hygienist for my 89-yr old father. It&#x27;s easy to use, works great in those hard to reach areas, especially in the back &amp; around bridge work. The battery holds charge for a long time. Only draw back is the water tank could be larger.</li>
            <li> The size in the pictures is a bit misleading, if I had known it was going to be as big as it was I would not have ordered a cordless water jet, I would have ordered a stronger non-cordless model. That aside, it works as it should, its just a little cumbersome due to its size.     The design and functionality of the unit satisfactory, on high the water pressure is suitable, its an ok product. I expected this to be smaller so I could travel with it, definitely not traveling with this monster.</li>
            <li> I expected more power. It works ok but my recollection of the waterpik from 20 years ago was much different. The small size is nice and the fact that it is cordless is a big plus. All in all I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful product.  I use it daily and my dentist and hygienist both see an improvement over old-style flossing.</li>
            <li> I purchased this model to replace an older water pik that finally quit.  This unit is not user friendly.  Very bulky. Not comfortable to use.    1. It does not hold enough water. I need to fill it twice to get the job done.  2. Unit does not fit in my sink.  Need to have a pitcher handy to fill it.  3. It is not adjustable, tho they do provide two \\&quot;piks\\&quot; one of which is &#x27;supposed&#x27; to be a lower volume.    Soon this will be replaced with a standard model.  I&#x27;ve had two in the past that worked fine &amp; both lasted many years. (I&#x27;m over 61 with my own teeth).</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for travel.  I have used it and it does not have enough power to do the job.  I have a bulky Interplak that really removes debris.  I will most likely put the waterpik in the Goodwill bin.</li>
            <li> I purchased a waterpikand it gave up, luckily before the guarantee ran out so I received another.This one lasted just a year and stopped working.I decided to try and repair it because other reviews said the battery stops charging, anyway I dismantled it which was pretty easy and found that the problem was water and dirt had got onto the contacts on the power button so cleaned them with a swab and put a little petroleum jelly on the contacts and now it works fine again.So it seems the battery isn&#x27;t to blame but water and dirt getting past the seals onto the contacts.  I think this is a good machine when it is working correctly but better sealing against water and debris would make them more reliable and last a lot longer.  If it does stop working first thing is to make sure the jet isn&#x27;t blocked, any blockage can be removed with a needle or pin.</li>
            <li> I specifically bought this to use for travel. While it is larger than I had hoped, the Waterpik Ultra puts out a powerful stream of water comperable to the full size counter top waterpiks. And that stream is adjustable to suit your comfort level. Mine came with severl tips, but I tend to use only one. It is easily refilled if it runs out of water, so feel free to take as long as you like. I travel with the charger also, so I simply plug it in at night every couple of days and I am good to go the next day. I did not get the travel bag that I have seen on other sites. I believe this would be nice to have, but I just carry it in a zip-lock bag.</li>
            <li> I have an other water pick product that is counter top and  has cord  and t also has a reservoir  for water for more than one minute, it is great for cleaning in those areas that your toothbrush  don&#x60;t reach. But I have decided to buy this cordless product in order to gain comfort when I don&#x60;t like to spend time taking our of the drawer.   This product  cordless product you can put  side to side to your toothbrush over  your bath counter or cabinet. It is good looking so you keep your bathroom counter  tidy.  It is easy to use, you can put the water very easily, and it have the exact water power for a quick cleaning. The water tank has water for 45 seconds.  Of course do not expect to have the same water power that the water pick that you have to plug i.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more happy with this product. I am upset that I didn&#x27;t get it sooner! I have several crowns on my teeth and this was suggested by my dentist because of the gum irritation around the crowns. Floss just can&#x27;t get everywhere. This Waterpik does the job!! The first time I used it, there was a lot of blood because of the plaque being dislodged... after that, just a pristine mouth! LOL</li>
            <li> I was a happy user of WaterPik&#x27;s old travel oral irrigation system, the 350W. It had a detachable tank, and the tips were connected to the pump via flexible tubing, which was of course the system&#x27;s weak spot (the tubing would eventually crack). Aside from that, the system was exceptionally durable and lasted 9 years with only one change of tubing, which unfortunately is no longer available. Because of my good experience with the 350W, and because the WP-450 is rechargeable, I was inclined to prefer it over the Panasonic Oral Irrigator EW-DJ10-A.    I was wrong. The WP-450 is much bigger than the photos suggest, and rather unwieldy. It doesn&#x27;t appear to be particularly well-made. It&#x27;s also not inexpensive. Furthermore, there are inconveniences: for example, since the tank is detachable, one would expect to be able to fill the tank at the sink and then reattach it to the body, but the tank leaks water in this case because WaterPik didn&#x27;t see fit to put a simple valve on the tank&#x27;s water output. Another inconvenience which may only affect a small number of user is that although the WP-450 is described as a travel irrigator, its transformer only works with 120 VAC - the transformer that came with my 350W was dual-voltage.    I ordered the Panasonic Oral Irrigator EW-DJ10-A and found it superior to the WaterPik: a more elegant design, better construction, smaller and easier to handle. Also costs 1/3 less than the WaterPik. It only comes with one nozzle (and of only one type -- the WaterPik comes with 4 different ones), but that seems sufficient to me.</li>
            <li> Was having trouble charging the wp360 and found out it was because of corrosion on charging plug area(hard to see). Finally got it to charge but decided to order the new model wp450 ultra.  I still use the wp360 (I keep it for traveling) and love the ultra.  It has better pressure and seems to hold just as much water.  It is also easier to refill from the side instead of the top as the wp360.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Unit works very well and i am pleased. Will hold a charge for over two weeks and that makes it easy to store for daily use. Very prompt shipping.  Recommend buying unit.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these a few months ago.  There are only 2 adjustments by using the 2 provided tips. It is hard to fill.  I kept it plugged in whenever I was not using it.  Now it stopped working.  Not worth buying.</li>
            <li> we&#x27;ve been using this for 2 months and are very pleased. It&#x27;s very easy to fill and take in the shower to use - you can then refill if you like and use a second time. I&#x27;ll be sending these as Xmas gifts to family this year! Have already bought one for my son that had a poor dental checkup followed by several root canals, etc. One tip for use is to shake water out after use, both upside down and out through fill hole, then leave cap open until next use to help dry out and prevent bacteria from forming. You can also rinse with rubbing alcohol to sanitize water reservoir.</li>
            <li> My husband was told he needed a waterpik by our dentist. We picked the cordless so he wouldn&#x27;t have to hassle with extra items on our bathroom counter (plus it was smaller than the other types). Its very powerful and does exactly what he needed, which is to keep his gums clean and healthy.</li>
            <li> outstanding product at an incredible price. this water pik get things that brushing misses, and i brush really well. wow!!!</li>
            <li> My first one lasted for 3 months, then it wouldn&#x27;t take a charge anymore. I contacted Waterpik &amp; returned it to them; they checked it out &amp; sent me a replacement. The replacement lasted for 3 months, then it wouldn&#x27;t take a charge anymore. I contacted Waterpik again &amp; they offered to \\&quot;upgrade\\&quot; me to their premium corded model. The corded replacement works just fine, &amp; if the hose was just a little longer, I&#x27;d be able to use it in my bathroom.  If you need a cordless model (as I did), I suggest you look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I looked for a portable water flosser (don&#x27;t want to waste space at the sink and want to use it in the shower to avoid water spits all around) and was about to buy a \\&quot;Waterpick\\&quot; product. Why  didn&#x27;t I? Here is a story.  My friend told that two Waterpick cordless flossers he had stopped charging in a short time. Being curios I disassembled both and found a huge -10 to Waterpick engineers. While unit has a good waterproofing gasket where it disassembled in two parts the charging outlet is not waterproof at all, just has nothing to prevent water coming in. In both units I found a lot of rust that destroyed contacts between charging outlet and battery, batteries also were damaged by water.  Well, if one avoid pour the unit it would work fine, but this is not a good idea for anything used in a bathroom.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It is very easy and convenient to use and does a really good job of &#x27;flossing my teeth&#x27;. I would certainly recommend it for anyone that has permanent bridges or capped teeth.</li>
            <li> My mom chose this as her christmas gift from me this year and I bought it for her, it arrived the day before Christmas and she loves it.  Thanks a lot for it being here before Christmas and she loves it, so great job.</li>
            <li> You think that your electric toothbrush really cleans your teeth until you use the Waterpik. Stubborn particles are removed after this use product. Great for bridges and other dental work.</li>
            <li> Love it. I have braces and I am so glad that I bought this product. Makes it so easy to clean my teeth.</li>
            <li> I picked this up because I have limited bathroom counter space for yet another object.  It&#x27;s a little unwieldly to hold, but you get used to it quickly.  The stream lasts for about 45 seconds, which I think is about 15 seconds too short; but it gets the job done.  You can always refill it if you think you need more time.  It&#x27;s good to travel with, if you really feel you can&#x27;t miss a few days, but if you have limited luggage real estate, leave it home.    The water canister detaches, although I am not sure why.  It is easy to fill and, if you leave the stopper open, it dries out quickly.  Using it once a day, it takes about 3 weeks before it needs a recharge (assuming only one person uses it).  Since it uses NiCad batteries, it&#x27;s best to drain the batteries before recharging.</li>
            <li> I bought this model of WaterPik because it appeared to be  a handy, self-contained,  compact unit. I was not eager to have a \\&quot;tub\\&quot; type unit with hose sitting out on our bathroom sink countertop. So far, my husband and I have been very pleased with it, although it does take some time to get use to using it proficiently. I find that I have the best results by starting at the back and working to the front teeth, then turning  it off with the handy on/off switch. Then I twist the jet sprayer and begin again at the back of mouth at the other side and work to the front again. My husband, on the other hand, has mastered doing his flossing non-stop. What ever works...    Overall, we are very pleased with this flosser and would buy another if our current unit ever needed to be replaced.</li>
            <li> The Waterpik Waterflosser performs as advertised.  My model shoots a good stream of water and cleans around my braces.  I refill once during flushing and recharge the unit when it needs it, about every 10 days.  I do wish there was a way to give the components a through airing between uses though.</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointing!!  After 6 months use, it started taking a long time to re-charge.  After 8 months, I couldn&#x27;t recharge it anymore.  The rechargeable battery didn&#x27;t work anymore.  I wrote to the manufacturers, and they directed me to their distributor in Israel.  He said that he had returned all 100 machines he had in stock because of faulty rechargeable batteries!!  DON&#x27;T TOUCH IT!!  [[ASIN:B000UWAWQU Waterpik Waterflosser Cordless PLUS]]</li>
            <li> this product dose not last it stops working after a few uses !!!  I have tried three of them and there all the same ( very bad design )</li>
            <li> I used twice for get away trip, and after four months i tried to use it and i did not work at all. bad quality for a good name.</li>
            <li> This is my second cordless Waterpic.  My first one lasted one year before it stopped charging - I suspect the battery got corroded from water getting into it.  But, I promptly ordered a new one as I really am convinced that using this daily has improved the health of my gums (and my dentist told me my gums looked really good).  I didn&#x27;t give this 5 stars because it is a little messy to use.  You need to know that your fingers holding the waterpic are going to get wet!!  For me, the reservoir holds the perfect amount of water needed for a full mouth cleaning.  Overall, I am pretty happy with this product and feel that it is worth getting a little wet to have good gum health.</li>
            <li> Not as powerful as a plug in model but gets the job done if you&#x27;re on the road. I recommend the Waterflosser for traveling.</li>
            <li> I am owner of waterpik for years. When I went on trips I would use Waterpik Waterflosser Cordless Rechargeable WP-360W, cause of it&#x27;s size. Recently it broke down, so I decided to try new model. And I must say I loooooove it. It has so much more power to it, which can be adjusted, and it cleans even better. Size wise it is not that much of the difference from previous one.  Highly recomend this prodact.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;v had this for over a year, and it works great. I;ve been listening to my hygenist complaining about my poor dental habits as long as I can remember. She always gives me different things, but I can&#x27;t remember to use them. Since I got my wp450, I use it every day, and my visits are much happier. She is really impressed that I am not only maintaing, but my teeth and gums are  better than she&#x27;s ever seen them. No mechanical problems either.</li>
            <li> We have a 10 year old who just got braces, and his dental hygienist recommended buying this for him.  It was an excellent recommendation!  The cordless feature means that he can use the waterpik in the shower (this is key in that the spray won&#x27;t mess up the bathroom, and it keeps him in the shower longer).  The battery lasts a long time between charges, and the water compartment is easy to fill, even by children.  Most importantly, the waterpik cleans the braces well.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> A friend of mine who is a dental hygienist, recommended this to me when I asked her what kind of a waterpik to get. She said this portable unit is good for just taking it in the shower and blast away at your teeth while you shower and that way it doesn&#x27;t make a mess all over the sink! It really gets the crude out from between the teeth and works better than just flossing alone. It makes your mouth feel really good.</li>
            <li> Previously I had a water pik device that connected to the bathroom faucet and I loved it.  However, my new condo has a fancy faucet that doesn&#x27;t fit that device.  So I bought this cordless waterpik to replace the tedium of flossing.  Initially it was pretty good.  The reservoir tank is pretty small and I would typically refill it at least once to thoroughly \\&quot;pik\\&quot; my mouth.  But it&#x27;s so easy to refill that it wasn&#x27;t a problem.  The big problem is that after about 3 weeks of normal use, the unit does not fully charge.  I turn it on and after a few seconds it starts slowing down as the battery is almost discharged.  Even after I plug it in overnight, it&#x27;s about 5 second of gung-ho waterpikking, and then it slows down over the next 20 seconds until its a dribble.  I would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I really like the Waterpik...my only complaints I have about it is it&#x27;s very loud and it leaks.  It tends to run out of water quickly due to the leaking.</li>
            <li> I have used Waterpik&#x27;s cheaper portable models and have broken at least 2 of them by my own hand or my Wife&#x27;s by knocking them over in the dark.  That, of course, was my own fault.  Even when I did not break them they did not hold up long.  The battery is the weak link.  It does not last over the long haul.  I travel from time to time so I didn&#x27;t want the full on reservoir model.  I figured that I would trade up a bit from the lower priced ones that I had broken and bought this one that I am reviewing.  Sometimes when I read these reviews I think \\&quot;Man, that person sounds angry or disgruntled.\\&quot;  \\&quot;They are really hammering derp product.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me tell you:  This thing is a piece of junk!  Again, it is the battery life.  Here is where you are going to think that I am crazy but I know this because, guess what;  I broke one getting it down off of the top of my medicine cabinet.  I was foolish enough to give a new one a chance.  They tell you that it may last up to 2 weeks on a charge depending upon usage; maybe on planet Krypton where batteries self charge off of the corona of the Kryptonian sun.  They say that you can leave it plugged in all the time to prolong the batteries life.  This does not make any difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did charge it for the 24 hours that they tell you to before you use it in case you were wondering.  I&#x27;m not a complete idiot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought, maybe it can&#x27;t charge because the water gets into the little charge port and keeps it from doing its thing.  I proceeded to clean and dry the terminals and plugged it up; no change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that the problem is that these days people do not take the time to complain to the Company because they feel that, even if they do, no one really cares.  They send out form letters and convince themselves that it is a great product because of all of the focus groups or the person sending out the letters just sends out letters and no one listens to them....Sad.</li>
            <li> The product works very well, as advertised by the manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;Try it first in the LOW position to check your sensitivity to it.</li>
            <li> This product is everything the description says it is. After using the Waterpik, my mouth and teeth feel exceptionally clean. The ortho tip does a good job of cleaning my braces, and the tongue cleaner is great too! I highly recommend this product to anyone with braces. Your mouth will love it, and your dental checkups will be a breeze!</li>
            <li> It is inexcusable the this $50 piece of trash is still on the market. Waterpik has to know that this product is crap.  It leaks. The battery drains out every use (keep it plugged in when not in use). The water pressure is inconsistent.  I&#x27;ve had it 4 months and it is now dead.</li>
            <li> My water pic arrived quickly and in good order. It works well. Thank you for asking.</li>
            <li> Bought it for a friend overseas.  She loves it.  I don&#x27;t use this tool.</li>
            <li> The reservoir is much easier to fill than the last one I had.  Even just using water makes your teeth feel great! Must buy!</li>
            <li> This waterpik model was initially fine.  After about 3 months it took longer to charge and the charge lasted for decreasingly shorter times.  As of today, the charge doesn&#x27;t last long enough for one flossing.  I regret spending $46 on this waterpik.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, portable,easy to hold and carry while travelling. I just love it</li>
            <li> better than flossing.  love this device; i use mine in the shower.  holds a charge for months.</li>
            <li> I was ambivalent about buying this based on the reviews that I have read. I will say up front I do not have a Waterpik that sits on my counter top and plugs into the wall socket. I had one once and will never own one again. You pull on the hose and the unit travels across the counter. No I found that I like the cordless ones better. I have own the Waterpik WP-360W. It was OK but the battery pretty much had to be charged every week if used daily. It held just enough water to get the job done, it was hard to fill with water under the bathroom sink and I got about 3 years use from it until the unit stop charging due to corrosion where the charger plugs into the unit(This is because water spills on the connection).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I then bought the Panasonic EW-1270AC. This was fine for travel but it had allot of problems like the water cap always falling off, water leaking out when you needed to store  it in the suitcase(always had to keep it in a zip loc bag to prevent the remaining water that was always there even after emptying in sink), the tip always falling on the floor as the way it was to be stored should have held the tip better. Allot of germs on the floor. Plus the batteries were not  rechargeable. So even after reading the reviews on the new Waterpik Cordless Dental Jet I bought one. For the life of me I could not understand why so many negative and mediocre reviews on this unit. But I figure it could not be that bad as it was the number one seller of cordless water jets. Here is a little contrast and compare on the reviews and my unit the WP-450 Ultra;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It is so loud it will wake anyone sleeping. Coffee grinder loud!&lt;br /&gt;** Yes I guess it is loud as it is near you ear while using! But not that loud to me(i.e. I am a bit  hard of hearing) My woman says it is not that loud and she has great hearing**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The reservoir is so small it runs out in 10 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;** Maybe this user has a leak in his unit. I use mine for about 30 seconds until all food is removed and I still have half of the water left. And yes I am using the High pressure setting. **&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The tip is so mobile (rotates all over the place), you can&#x27;t control it.&lt;br /&gt; ** Mine doesn&#x27;t. Of course I have only had it a month. **&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. It is poorly designed, too large, and difficult to hold (Can&#x27;t imagine if you have small hands).&lt;br /&gt;** I thought it was well ergonomically designed. I have nerve damage in my hand that makes it hard to hold on to things and get tops off of bottles but I had no problem holding the WP-450 Ultra. I think it is most excellent! **&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Poor battery life, long charge time, no charge indicator. After two uses I needed to recharge! (yes I let it charge up initially for 16 hours!).&lt;br /&gt;** I have only charged my unit for 8 hours and have been using once a day for a month. I has not slacked off one bit in pumping the water out. **&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Expensive, Poor Value: Price is ~70% higher than the WP-360&lt;br /&gt;** Yes that is usually the case for older models. They usually do cost less than newer models as the cost of production is higher than years ago. It is actually 61.4 % higher in cost. The old unit uses Ni-Cad batteries as the new one uses more expensive L-Ion or NiMH batteries hence the higher cost and the L-Ion battery can hold a charge longer. **&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. Poor Reservoir Capacity -only 120 ml or 20% less than the already-tiny WP-360&#x27;s 150 ml&lt;br /&gt;** I do not know how you can say that. I fill my units up to max and the new Water Jet holds twice the amount of water then the WP-360. Also I had to use a paper cup the fill up the old WP-360 **&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8. Terrible portability, large/inefficient size, ungainly ergonomics&lt;br /&gt;** Well it is not touted as a travel water jet just a cordless one for home use. The Panasonic however is a true Travel/Portable unit as advertised. **&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9. Weak water stream.&lt;br /&gt;** You&#x27;ve got to be kidding. It has two settings and is way better then the WP-360 and about the same pressure as the Panasonic model. Are you sure you have it charged up? **&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10. Very bad. Main problem is the tip won&#x27;t stay fixed, it keeps rotating, so it sprays water everywhere but your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;** I have not observed this problem. My tips stays right where it should. I will report back if this changes. **&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;11. The reservoir is so small that it empties before you are ready to stop using it. It should be at least 2 1/2 times the size.&lt;br /&gt;** I have to wonder what you are using this for. I use mine to remove the food particles from the gums and between teeth. When things stop coming out of the mouth am done. My dentist says I have the best gums of any patient he has in his practice and I only use this once a day before bed. **&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  It appears that the problem with the old WP-360 was the fact that the charger contacts on the front would get water inside no matter how careful one was and the metal from the charger was different from the metal that took the charger. What I observed on the WP-360 was dissimilar metal corrosion. What I observed on this new water jet was the charger contact is now enclosed in plastic and has been moved to the back of the unit where their is less chance of water getting in to the charger contacts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Allot of people keep going on about the old WP-360 in this post about the batteries not holding a charge. I think most people probably keep the unit charger plug in while not in use. This will lead to what is called a memory problem with Ni-Cad batteries. Ni-Cad batteries should never be keep on a continuous charge as that will  lead to the memory problem mentioned. It is best to have Ni-Cads discharge completely and then recharge them. L-Ion / NiMH batteries do not suffer from this problem that I know of, but it is always better to only charge any battery after it loses its charge. Continuous charging on batteries will lead to shorten battery life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  If I experience any problems with the Waterpic Water Jet WP-450 Ultra I will amend this review. I just can not understand all these bad negative reviews. If the unit was so bad why would it be the number one seller when I bought it? No I do not work for Waterpic but I have used their products for years and have not had that many problems which is why I guess they are still number one in Oral Irragtor sales. I hardily recommend the WP-450 Ultra if you are looking for a cordless (not Travel sized) waterjet. This is hands down better then the old but still selling WP-360.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated 20 June 2016:&lt;br /&gt;Been working great for the last 7 years!!!!!!!!!!e WP-360 and about the same pressure as the Panasonic model.

            <li> Just like the other reviews, this product is a little messy. I&#x27;ve tried many different ways of holding it and I think I&#x27;ve found the one that minimizes the spattering of water. On the more positivie side, I can tell a difference in my gums and teeth. I just need to decide if the mess is worth it. I spoke to someone at work and they use theirs in the shower. Hadn&#x27;t thought about that one, but may give it a try.</li>
            <li> I found this to be really convenient and fun to use.  I ended up giving it my granddaughter (11 years old) that just got braces and she liked using it.  It made having the braces not so painful.</li>
            <li> Received the waterpik in just a few days.. Yay. It is a great little machine and has helped improve my oral hygiene already. The samll footprint on my model wp450 is a big plus in a typical crowded bathroom space. However, the oring which seals the water chamber seems a bit loose and I am thinking I should send it back for replacement. Will you pay for shipping both ways and ensure a quick turnaround so I won&#x27;t have to live too long without it?    Best regards;    Ken</li>
            <li> No good, only 5 months now stop working, but when I bought it posted 2 years warranty but now they did not want to replace</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this thing for a few months and love it! I got it because I had my wisdom teeth removed a few weeks before and the wound was not healing well. I couldn&#x27;t ever keep it clean. I&#x27;d brush and mouthwash several times a day but the infection kept coming back. After two weeks with this they have healed up and my mouth has never felt cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it on a daily basis instead of flossing as well as some spot cleaning after eating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tank last just long enough for me and the battery life is better than I expected, lasting a couple weeks on one charge. The pressure could be a little more now that my gums are used to it but it&#x27;s still getting the job done no problem.</li>
            <li> I love it.  Easy to use and a selection of heads to use.  I add salt to the rinse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed in this product due to it&#x27;s lack of pressure. I have a full size waterpik which I use everyday and wanted this item for travel.  The amount of pressure is very low.  I don&#x27;t even know if it accomplishes anywhere near what my other waterpik does.  I had considered sending it back but decided it was better than nothing!    I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this item.</li>
            <li> If it were not for this product I would be hopeless in cleaning my teeth since I had my new braces put on.  It really does get in between your teeth to keep you clean!!!</li>
            <li> Probably I have never had a product with a weak battery.   You can recharge 24 hours or more, and then you with luck if you can use 3 times.  Oscar Delgado   San Jose, Costa Rica</li>
            <li> I got one of these for Christmas 2008 and agree with the other review that it&#x27;s loud -- although not quite coffee grinder loud.  Also the stupid pik does seem to rotate etc.  That said, it works amazingly well at getting crap out between your teeth.  I first brush and then use the pik and I&#x27;m always amazed at how much extra stuff comes out.  I hate to floss and always have bleeding gums as I approach the next dental cleaning date -- no more.  That makes it worth the price right their.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At one year I&#x27;m now experencing a battery that won&#x27;t keep a full charge.  It has a two year warranty and I went to their online service site yesterday to request info on how to get it fixed as the battery can&#x27;t be user replaced.  I was shocked to get an email today stating that they WERE SENDING ME A KNEW ONE!!!  How is that for service.</li>
            <li> Excellent water pik; recommended by consumer reports. I had had one before, very messy and difficult to use. This one is much, much better; it&#x27;s so easy and fast to use it encourages use every time I brush my teeth. I especially like the flexible gumline tip, and the easy fill.</li>
            <li> It cleans well but this cordless version has its limitations. You need to refill the water tank twice to do your whole mouth. Refilling is easy but when it runs out of water the pitch of the fairly noisy thing gets even higher and more annoying.   Also, because you need to keep it upright, there are parts of your mouth you can&#x27;t get to, notably the inside of your front teeth where plaque accumulates. I&#x27;m going to return this and try the larger counter top size.</li>
            <li> You can easily bye the cheaper item with little bit smaller waterbox. It will cost $15 less.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying my new handheld Waterpik very much.  It is easy to use and very convenient.  It accomplishes what I expected it to do.  It was easy to purchase from Amazon.com since I already have an account with them.  I think you can anything at Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> This has stopped a problem where my gum was growing away from a dental implant due to gingivitis.  The waterpik gets my mouth cleaner than I could flossing and brushing and the gingivitis has calmed down.  Much more effective and pleasant to use than the Sonicare toothbrush.  Very easy to use and doesn&#x27;t take up much space.  Yes it does make a whirring noise but it&#x27;s not excessive.  I wish I&#x27;d started using this years ago, maybe I wouldn&#x27;t have needed the dental implants.</li>
            <li> It took several days for me to develop a technique that allowed me to both clean my teeth comfortably and not squirt the bathroom walls!  I use very warm water and turn on the pik so that the initial cold water (which remains from my previous use)goes into the sink, not my mouth.  I have also learned to turn off the pik when I switch from inside my mouth to the outside, so I don&#x27;t look like I have just had a shower!  I don&#x27;t think this is caused by a design flaw, just my technique or perhaps my choice of tips.  The battery charge has lasted a long time and the pik is small enough to travel with.</li>
            <li> Waterpik Ultra is not the perft whenever you start using it, you will find yourself in need for a higher speed than the highest one on it, it works fine but string flossing is more efficient in the sense of removing food leftovers between your teeth in addition to it is not easy to reach your teeth from backsides   but in general, it is way better than the traditional flossing for your gum but not great for removing 100% of the food leftovers between your molars    The shipment fees make it way expensive to buy it overseas than using other couriers on other websites like ebay</li>
            <li> The cordless Waterpik does a superior job to flossing, and is great for cleaning under bridges.  It can be a bit messy, as water drips down my arm.  However the hygiene is worth the trouble.</li>
            <li> I bought a 450 Ultra about 2 months ago.    Already is will not hold a charge. I followed the directions religiously. I&#x27;m actually going to ask for a refund no matter how long it takes. I took a second chance, but Waterpik will never get my money again.</li>
            <li> It is what Waterpik claims it is.    Does it hold enough water?  First few uses, I wished it held more water, but after using it daily, I manage to waterpik every tooth and completely cover all gum&lt;&gt;tooth areas with one filling.     Will the battery hold up?  I charge it up, then unplug it and use it for days until it stops or shows signs of needing recharge, then recharge it and have not experienced battery issues yet.  All battery operated devices like this have tricky battery usage.  If Waterpik wants to know: please put a small LED-type battery strength indicator on the next model.  Without the battery indicator, I have had at least one morning where I was unable to finish using the waterpik and would have preferred knowing the night or day before that it should have been plugged in to charge overnight prior to that morning.     Does the rotation gizmo attachment work?  By design it seems that a user could easily move his/her thumb slightly to rotate the spout to either left or right and thereby more accurately cover all areas of the inside gums and teeth.  Well, it can work that way.  It is easier for me to simply leave the little spout in one place and hold the waterpik with two hands and very carefully trace the gum/tooth line for the top and bottom front and bottom back.  Then twist the spout 180 degrees when it is not in my mouth to prep it to cover the top inside areas.  It must be very uncomfortable and maybe ineffective for people to try to rotate that thing accurately with one thumb while it is in the mouth and they are moving it from side to side.      Is there enough water pressure generated?  I&#x27;m not a dentist and don&#x27;t know how many pounds per square inch are recommended to chase scum away from teeth and gum, but where I once started out clicking up the water pressure output to high, I now use it on the norm and am very happy with the results.  I cover all areas with one filling of water. The Dentist said my teeth and gum are looking good.    Additional Note:  Consider the physics behind using this thing - if you are in a big hurry and grab it with one hand in the middle section, the weight distribution could cause two things to occur: 1) you bang the spout around in your mouth in a very ineffective manner and believe this tool&#x27;s performance sucks, or 2) you learn to hold the spout away from sensitive areas of your mouth in an ineffective manner and feel disappointed in the tools inability to reach and penetrate those areas adequately. Try to stop viewing this thing as a quick, one-handed, gadget that works on it&#x27;s own.  It is only a battery operated, semi-waterproof, water-resistant, water squirting device. It won&#x27;t do much more of that by itself. If Waterpic told the world that this thing is tricky to use, they would sell very few of them - but in truth all sophisticated gadgets have their idiosyncrasies.  Each user must find a method to hold and operate the tool within its limitations and best capabilities. I use two hands, one near the bottom of the spout to steer it and one near the bottom to carry the weight (it isn&#x27;t really heavy, but the weight distribution(with water) deprives the accuracy of control I want). On low, I get plenty of pressure because I place the tip of the spout right up between teeth and between teeth and gums.       Tips:  Warm water (as when the shower is just about ready to be entered) may work better.   A little bit of Mouthwash mixed in with the water brings forth a refreshing result.   This is a shower gizmo - if you don&#x27;t intend to use this in the shower, you might prefer to get a sink model instead - they lack the weight, hold more water, and are easier to deal with.   As mentioned before, this is not a travel device - you&#x27;ll get water everywhere.   Don&#x27;t overcharge these types of electronics - Waterpik didn&#x27;t put a battery indicator, so now and then, it will quit - if it quits once - don&#x27;t use until it is fully recharged.  Once fully recharged, don&#x27;t charge it until it gets really slow or quits.     I gave it 4 starts because I don&#x27;t \\&quot;love\\&quot; my gadgets, nor did anything about this product \\&quot;blow me away\\&quot;.  But this product, for me, does what it was designed to do and what I expected it to do.  It is well built.  I wish it was designed a little lighter in weight, and had a better battery/charger system.</li>
            <li> This is my first Waterpik so I&#x27;m no expert, but I do really love this thing. It&#x27;s easy to assemble/disassemble and in my opinion the reservoir held an ample amount of water. It looks great, so I can leave it on my bathroom counter if I choose, but I usually store it under the sink.    To be honest, the first-time use  takes some trial and error. My spouse and I practiced over the bathtub after I got soaked, sprayed the bathroom mirror and shot a stream onto our bathroom ceiling...I told you I was a novice.     Anywho, we&#x27;ve only used the low setting. And won&#x27;t be able to use the higher speed until we get use to it. This thing feels like a sand blaster the first time. It removed every particle of food in my mouth and massaged my gums. Our mouths feel fresh and clean and I look forward to using this little appliance each night. This baby earns my 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I find it very easy to use plus stays charged for over a week.  Its fairly portable for traveling, packing.</li>
            <li> The only reason this gets a \\&quot;C\\&quot; is there&#x27;s no better unit on the market.&lt;br /&gt;1- You cannot hold this in one hand. The tip rotates too easily. Use your right hand to hold the unit and turn it off (your right thumb sits over the OFF switch. Use your left hand to turn it ON and rotate the tip.&lt;br /&gt;2- The water reservoir holds enough for 1/4 wash, but only if the unit is held upright (yes, it gets a little messy). You&#x27;ll need to fill it four times to do a good job. The battery weakens after two washes, so do the lower inside first; then the lower outside; then the uppers.&lt;br /&gt;3- The larger tip is useless; it pours out too much water and empties the water reservoir too quickly. Use the smaller tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waterpic engineers failed on this one. A portable sink top unit with a longer cord that plugged in would have been a far better solution. Where&#x27;s the competition?</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews about the bits turning, the unit too loud, water tank to small, blah, blah, blah.    I have 3 WaterPik Flossers now and we use all 3 of them.  I ordered one for Iraq because I missed mine at home!    The unit is a little bukly but is not heavy.  The water chamber takes up most of the side on it.  If the water tank was larger, it would make it even less handy, so the water tank is fine.  If you need to refill it, flip the cap open and put in more hot water. I only refill when I am doing extra cleaning in the backs sometimes depending on what I ate.    The unit is no louder than the standard bathroom models.    Tips will move if you do not guide them properly.  My tips will not turn while waster is spewing out as long as my tooth or tongue doesn&#x27;t hit it.    But hey, all you nay sayers, just go buy that $189.00 job from that other company.  I&#x27;ll save the $140.00 and still have clean teeth.</li>
            <li> Many of the reviews complain of too freely rotating tip problems. My new unit as of now has a ratchet design that makes it hard to rotate without meaning too.  Loud as any waterpik has been for decades.  Still no indicator light.  Water can deplete quickly.  Good selection of tips for an individual.</li>
            <li> This is very easy to use and does the job. I haven&#x27;t tried the high setting yet since the low setting seems to shoot out water at a pretty fast pace.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Waterpik for my son who recently got braces.  We were very excited when it arrived.  Our disappointment was huge when it turned out that it only had a 110V option and from other reviews it seems like this model cannot be charged in countries outside US and Canada!!  Wish Amazon made this clear on the product description.  I wasted $50!!!</li>
            <li> Piece of garbage.  Very low pressure and doesn&#x27;t compare with  the original  Waterpik.  I threw it away and bought a  110 volt model.</li>
            <li> I should have read the reviews first. The battery will not charge or hold the charge after a year. The reservoir is too small, you can not complete a full clean unless you refill the reservoir five to six times*.  Stay away from Waterpik. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.  The sales material (and the warranty include with the product) promised that it could be returned within 30 days to Waterpik. I called them, and they told me to return it to the place where purchased. Here they told me that I could not return it if used.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON WATERPIK. Find a reliable brand.    * On second thought, the small reservoir may be sufficient for some folks. That is if they only have a couple of teeth left.</li>
            <li> I bought this model and the Ultra regular; that was OK but this is rubbish.  Insufficient power to get between gums and teeth, and worst is that for a traveler, Water Pic Inc has included the cheapest 110v only transformer.  I went to Europe and the transformer failed. Silly me, I assumed the transformer would be autosensing 120-240v.  They saved a few cents and produced a poor product.  They wouldn&#x27;t honor their warranty as I had abused it. Unless you are prepared to solder on your own transformer as I had to, don&#x27;t buy this for travel overseas, besides,it is really poor anyway.  Don&#x27;t bother to take the regular mains Ultra overseas either, it&#x27;s only 110v, not 120/240v</li>
            <li> I prefer my older Waterpik WP-70. Much more pressure available. But it&#x27;s not portable, hence my decision to buy this unit (WP-450). Reservoir is adequate, pressure is barely adequate (on high setting). Unit does not lend itself to easy cleaning. Reservoir can be left open, but it&#x27;s a small opening and it takes quite a while to dry. But it&#x27;s still better than conventional floss so rated \\&quot;Ok\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Brush your tooth only is not enough to keep the good, healthy tooth. The waterpik waterflosser cordless helps me to keep a clean, fresh tooth and mouth after each of meal. It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I recently purchased a new portable waterpik that works great, but now the battery has gone down and the recharge coard does not work. There is no power output. CAN YOU TELL ME WHERE I CAN GET A REPLACEMENT.</li>
            <li> I agree with the front page review that this is a great product, however I don&#x27;t agree with everything he said (the arrows indicate my comments):    ----------------------------------------------    1. It is so loud it will wake anyone sleeping. Coffee grinder loud!   ** Yes I guess it is loud as it is near you ear while using! But not that loud to me(i.e. I am a bit hard of hearing) My woman says it is not that loud and she has great hearing**     -----&gt; It&#x27;s definitely not as loud as a standard plugged-in Waterpik. That&#x27;s like a jackhammer. I was pleasantly surprised that this one isn&#x27;t too loud yet still has the same pressure.    2. The reservoir is so small it runs out in 10 seconds.   ** Maybe this user has a leak in his unit. I use mine for about 30 seconds until all food is removed and I still have half of the water left. And yes I am using the High pressure setting. **     -----&gt; Maybe your unit is messed up and its high pressure setting is really a low pressure setting. On the high pressure setting, the water runs out after probably 15 seconds. I fill it up once for each quadrant of my mouth, which means I fill it up a total of 4 times. If you are doing this at the sink, this is no problem at all because filling it up takes about 5 seconds. If you want to use this in the shower, you&#x27;re out of luck. You&#x27;re not going to be able to fill it up with your shower stream. What you&#x27;d have to do is turn the shower knob so the water comes out of the tub faucet and fill it up there. That would be a huge inconvenience.    3. The tip is so mobile (rotates all over the place), you can&#x27;t control it.   ** Mine doesn&#x27;t. Of course I have only had it a month. **     -----&gt; I don&#x27;t have this problem either. It might move slightly, you just have to move with it.    4. It is poorly designed, too large, and difficult to hold (Can&#x27;t imagine if you have small hands).   ** I thought it was well ergonomically designed. I have nerve damage in my hand that makes it hard to hold on to things and get tops off of bottles but I had no problem holding the WP-450 Ultra. I think it is most excellent! **     -----&gt; If you have small hands you could just hold it higher up on the neck where its narrower. You don&#x27;t have to hold it at the basin, although I do. Although it is definitely surprisingly bulky, it has to be (I couldn&#x27;t tolerate it if I had to refill 8 times).    5. Poor battery life, long charge time, no charge indicator. After two uses I needed to recharge! (yes I let it charge up initially for 16 hours!).   ** I have only charged my unit for 8 hours and have been using once a day for a month. I has not slacked off one bit in pumping the water out. **     -----&gt; Your unit must have an insanely good battery. I haven&#x27;t counted but it definitely needs to be recharged after a few days. Also, as he said, there is no indicator or light or anything to tell you whether it is fully charged which is odd.    6. Expensive, Poor Value: Price is ~70% higher than the WP-360   ** Yes that is usually the case for older models. They usually do cost less than newer models as the cost of production is higher than years ago. It is actually 61.4 % higher in cost. The old unit uses Ni-Cad batteries as the new one uses more expensive L-Ion or NiMH batteries hence the higher cost and the L-Ion battery can hold a charge longer. **     -----&gt; This device is extremely powerful at cleaning out the gums and could potentially save you thousands of dollars, or at least some extra pain, at the dentist. I don&#x27;t know how it compares to other handheld waterpiks, but it&#x27;s definitely so much nicer to use than the plug-in waterpiks which sound like jackhammers and take up so much space. If you hate wires, this is for you.    9. Weak water stream.   ** You&#x27;ve got to be kidding. It has two settings and is way better then the WP-360 and about the same pressure as the Panasonic model. Are you sure you have it charged up? **     -----&gt; The water stream is very powerful. A lot of people might find they need to stick to the gentle setting. You couldn&#x27;t possibly need more pressure.      ----------------------------------------------    So again, I highly recommend this product, but it is not as perfect as the front page review might have you believe. Some of the negative reviews do have valid points, but I am not so picky. It works well and is invaluable, as far as I&#x27;m concerned, because healthy gums mean a healthier body, and this certainly makes your gums healthier than flossing alone (I don&#x27;t use this as a floss replacement -- I use this before I floss, and I find that it makes flossing much easier and rarely does anything come out on the floss).</li>
            <li> I have had the other models of WaterPik and this is the best one.  It is shaped well to fit in your hand and I love the fact that it is portable.  No cords except the charger base.  Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I guess that I should have expected this, but it is impossible for me to use this Waterflosser without getting wet from head to toe.  I have stopped using it because of this annoyance.</li>
            <li> I have had this for a little over a year. With waterpiks, you either love em or hate em. i love mine. Can&#x27;t go a day without it.&lt;br /&gt;It is used 2-3 times every day. Battery is just now not able to hold a charge. Although I just read the charger cable is most probably the culprit.&lt;br /&gt;It make my gums feel clean, improves circulation (due to water masaging the gums) and it gets more food particles out that floss or dental picks tend to leave behind..</li>
            <li> I always run out of water just before I complete the circle... The reservoir could be a tiny bit larger.</li>
            <li> The tips on my new 450 Waterpik [[ASIN:B000UWAWQU Waterpik Ultra Cordless Dental Water Jet]]would not \\&quot;lock\\&quot; into place so I could direct the stream.  I called Waterpik customer service and they acknowledged the problem and immediately shipped me a set of redesigned tips to fix the problem.</li>
            <li> There are some pretty major design flaws on the cordless model. The water compartment is small and the unit can&#x27;t be tipped atmall during use or the water stops flowing. The regular model does a much better job.</li>
            <li> I bought this only a couple of months ago, it worked great, but is now completely broken and will not recharge. It was of course only used in an average way, once a day. So I am very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> My only comment is, it certainly cleanses my teeth thoroughly but it runs out of fluid quickly..Fortunately its easy to fill.. All is well..</li>
            <li> This item is great. My 12-year old has braces and he was struggling with the flossers and getting them in between the metal in his mouth. I asked the orthodontist is a water flosser was okay and he said yes. I bought one and paid quite a bit for it. It lasted about a year and then tanked. This model is a step above the one that I bought and it&#x27;s 3/4 of the price I paid at my retail store. This charges nicely and holds a charge well too. It fits well in my 12-year old&#x27;s hand and he can get into all the areas of his mouth with no problem. He likes to use it in the shower so all of the water can just run down his chin instead of dealing with it in the sink. Great product. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The battery failed after less than 6 months. I really liked this Waterpik because I don&#x27;t have a counter to put the other kind on. I was able to complete the flossing with a single filling and found the cleaning to be really effective. But - 6 months of battery life - $50 - not a good value.   I&#x27;ve tossed it and replacing it with the Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item on May 24th, and it died on July 18th. When it was working, it performed fairly well. The issue with having to refill several times while \\&quot;water flossing\\&quot;, gets better as you become more familiar with product. But there is an issue with this product, causing it to die only after a couple of months of usage. I took really good care of my Waterpik, and it still died in two months.</li>
            <li> How did this thing get on the market?!!!  I&#x27;m SHOCKED by this product.  Completely unusable for the reasons already mentioned.  Tip moves around and is uncontrollable, by the time you&#x27;ve grabbed it and water is all over the place, the reservoir is EMPTY, and user is ready to throw it against the wall.    What were these people thinking to design and then actually SELL a product like this?</li>
            <li> I have WP-100 Ultra Water Flosser and I used it for 10 months, it is excellent even my dentist realized the different, so I decided to by the smaller model to used it when I travel, I bought this model when it arrived I tried the product to make sure it is working, it was working but I was disappointed since it is not as powerful as WP-100 Ultra Water Flosser, any why I kept the machine since I need it when I travel so I kept it save in its bag, 2 months later I was travailing so I picked my cordless plus, I was surpassed it is not working ( this product broke after one use)</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and it has been working well. He would have liked the reservior to be bigger so that he doesn&#x27;t have to refil as often, but being that it is cordless and smaller it fits well in our small bathroom vanity. Easy to use. Good product.</li>
            <li> First I must say that the Waterpik Waterflosser Cordless Plus does a great job.  I have dental implants and my dentist recommended the Waterpik.  It really blasts away food debris much better than just brushing or using regular dental floss.  The battery life and reservoir capacity seems fine.  The one really big issue I have with this appliance is that there is no way to clean and totally drain the reservoir after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After each use I run it until its as empty as possible and shake out any remaining water as best I can. When storing it I keep the fill cap lid open to help it dry out.  The inside of the reservoir still stays slightly moist, however, and I just noticed mold building up in the bottom of the reservoir.  The reservoir is one piece molded plastic, and except for the small filler opening, there is no way to clean and dry it - so mold happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t imagine that mold is particularly healthy.  Even if the Waterpik does a great job on teeth, I am reluctant to use it. There doesn&#x27;t seem to be any way to remove the mold because the reservoir doesn&#x27;t open. You can buy a replacement reservoir for about $11  - not very cost effective. Not having any way to fully drain and clean the unit seems like a design flaw to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wish this appliance were designed better, because it does an outstanding job keeping teeth clean.  You do need to beware of the mold buildup, however.  That might be as big a health risk as plaque on teeth.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product about two months ago and, so far, it is working just as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband and I both use the Waterpik Waterflosser twice each day. My husband uses the &#x27;regular&#x27; floss tip and is able to clean his teeth with a single fill of the reservoir. I like the tip that&#x27;s made for people with crowns, implants and braces, and I use two &#x27;tanks&#x27; of water (only takes a few seconds to fill the reservoir). Bottom line is, I LOVE how clean my mouth and teeth feel after I use this Waterpik, and I would recommend it to others without hesitation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very satisfied with the Waterpik and, although it is small enough to easily store in the bathroom cabinet, I believe the reservoir could be a little larger without compromising the portability of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is, after all the comments about the battery charger, the fact that there is no &#x27;low battery&#x27; indicator is a minus for the overall design/functionality of the product.  Having said that, I simply put a &#x27;reminder&#x27; on my computer&#x27;s calendar to recharge the battery overnight once every 4 weeks.  So far, so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll know next month whether or not my dental hygienist can see a difference.  As for the battery issues, I will update this review if I encounter any problems.</li>
            <li> Before buying this product on Amazon, I read all of the reviews and saw that there were a few negative ones.  I also didn&#x27;t see a lot of options to this product so bought it anyway. I am pleased that the product does in fact work very well.  It holds enough water to get a good rinse and I have had no issues with the battery life. Also it does a good job of cleaning my teeth.  The product itself looks a little clunky in a very modern bathroom so my wife makes me store it under the sink rather than leaving it set out on the counter, thus I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars....</li>
            <li> The item works very well.  The only imporovement would be if it held more water.</li>
            <li> On the recommendation of my dental hygenist to use a water pik, I got this one and also the Waterpik Dental Water Jet Replacement High Pressure Jet Tips (My brother recommended this particular model and tip type, and he says his gum pockets were noticeable smaller are using it regularly). My gum health has greatly improved per my hygenist and my teeth are much less temperature sensitive.</li>
            <li> This is the second unit I have owned.  Just like its predecessor this one is starting to die after about 10 months of use.  I&#x27;ve taken extra care with this one to ensure that the connection for the recharger remained free from corrosion or build up of gunk.  Despite my efforts, however, it is starting to require more frequent charging.  I used to be able to go a week between chargings (using it once a day), and now I need to charge it about every 3-4 days.  I think my next one will be the Panasonic one that takes AA batteries.</li>
            <li> The cordless water flosser at first glance is an interesting concept.  In use, it&#x27;s a different story.  I get up early and it wakes up my family.  The machine is hard to manipulate around your mouth and you end up drooling water all over it unless you use two hands.  Getting the front surfaces of your teeth are fairly easy and not real messy but the inside surfaces are another story all together.  The reservoir volume is marginal.  It takes me two to three refills to clean teeth sufficiently.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it...</li>
            <li> I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The purchase was flawless, got it in two days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the water-flosser, excellent for my gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is messy and awkward to hold onto. It doesn&#x27;t hold enough water for thorough  cleaning nor is the pressure adequate. I returned it for the fullsize model and it is excellent.</li>
            <li> I received a WaterPik 450 for Christmas 2009.  In October, 2010 it stopped taking a charge.      So why 5 stars?  I emailed Waterpik and got a response in 3.5 hours with a promise to send a replacement. Two days later the relacement arrived.      Not many manufacturers match that level of service!  Thanks WaterPik!    JTB</li>
            <li> Years ago I used the original Waterpick and it was mighty powerful and effective.  But, I decided to purchase this on a whim for the convenience of having a smaller appliance.  I&#x27;ve never had the problems with the battery that others described but I did discover one day a black colony of mold growing at the seams of the water reservoir.  I found this to be terribly disturbing considering that I use peroxide in the reservoir and kept it clean and in a cabinet at all times. Apparently, the reservoir was leaking and air-borne or water-borne bacteria got into it as well.  NOT GOOD! There isn&#x27;t any way to clean this reservoir either unless you can get a brush into the small hole and even so, you would need to bleach it to kill all the bacteria.  I would not recommend this product for that reason alone.&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, it&#x27;s not nearly as powerful as the original waterpick so there isn&#x27;t any gum massage. The only thing I liked about it was that I could get a more effective between the teeth rinse after brushing and flossing.</li>
            <li> The Waterpik Waterflosser does what it&#x27;s supposed to do really well. I use the flosser on the high setting. I am able to hit my upper and lower teeth front and back before the reservoir runs out and if I do run out the reservoir really easy to refill. I used the flosser just about everyday, once a day for about six months before my regular cleaning, the cleaning was the best cleaning I&#x27;ve ever had. The hygienist said that my gums were in excellent health and there was almost no plaque, so very little scraping!! So why only 3 stars? The unit has two brass posts that accept the recharging cord. These posts are susceptible to corrosion which if and when they corrode will affect the units ability to fully re-charge. I cleaned the posts with WD-40 and the unit is re-charging like new. If you get the unit (which I still recommend) spray the brass posts with WD-40 right away and you shouldn&#x27;t have any future recharging problems!</li>
            <li> Use this twice a day.  Much faster than dental tape.</li>
            <li> Ok maybe after 3 months I don&#x27;t know what I am in for, I only use one tank full most of the time. I use it daily and it works. I only charge once a week if that and when the pressure starts droping I recharge or turn up the pressure.  I would buy another one if it lasts a year, hopefuly I won&#x27;t be back here to update before then.</li>
            <li> I really loved using this Waterpik when I first got it.  One time, 8 or 9 months later, after charging it overnight, it was not charged.  I plugged it in again for another 24 hours, and it was charged.  For the next few months, it took at least 24 hours to charge it enough to work.  It wouldn&#x27;t work at all when it was still plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;Now, a year after buying it, it will not charge at all.  The plug gets really hot, but the flosser won&#x27;t charge even after 2 days of being plugged in.  I am afraid to leave it plugged in longer for fear the plug will explode, since it gets so hot.&lt;br /&gt;I went with the Waterpik brand because I expected such a long-respected brand would be the best.  I bought my Phillips Sonicare toothbrush at the same time, and it&#x27;s still working like new, so maybe that brand is a better choice.  I won&#x27;t buy another Waterpik product.&lt;br /&gt;Unless you plan on buying a new waterflosser every year, don&#x27;t buy this one.  :(</li>
            <li> wanted to use instead of regular flossing, but it didn&#x27;t seem like the water was going under the gums and water got EVERYWHERE!</li>
            <li> Well that and one very detailed review (by The Geekster) that specifically outlines the goods. I bought it as a XMAS gift for my spouse and me and I was the first to use it. I bought extra low pressure replacements as well. In my opinion, it is not loud (it&#x27;s not silent but what do you expect, it has a water pump it&#x27;s going to make some noise); also, my attention was on my teeth and the newbie-user mess I was making. It doesn&#x27;t take long to adjust your mouth/lips so as to hit the target teeth and limit the water splashing. Yes, presently, I have to refill frequently, but in my opinion, it&#x27;s a minor inconvenience compared to a large unit sitting on the counter (I was so afraid of purchasing a dust collector). I&#x27;m sure that with practice you get the job done in less time and with less refills. I like the idea of using it in the shower, as the water is already warm and no worries about the mess (the easy to read instructions suggest keeping the unit upright but it&#x27;s a tad difficult especially as a beginner, although not impossible). The jet wand can be rotated (the wand rotates and clicks in place, holding steady...I had no problem with the wand rotating without my purposely doing it, as some reviewers noted). I am really pleased with this because you don&#x27;t have to move the unit around dramatically (again, recommendation from the manufacturer is to hold it upright as much as possible), you move the wand around to access the tooth or molar your targeting. It fits nicely in the hand, it&#x27;s light and I was quite impressed with the gentle pulsing action (for such a small unit), I felt my gums get a great but gentle massage. I wanted a product that would make it fun (especially for my spouse) to continue good oral hygiene. I don&#x27;t know what else to add that The Geekster hasn&#x27;t already covered (and I agree with every point made) other than; if you want a compact, hand-held, mobile (I don&#x27;t see why you cannot travel with this unit, I would) and sturdy waterpik then try this unit. So far I&#x27;ve enjoyed it (the true results from using it will come in February when I see my dentist for a follow up).</li>
            <li> The product does what it says it does. I&#x27;m suprised to see so many cry babies nit-picking over every little thing. The best way to preserve battery life is to not use it, I have yet to see any product that lasts forever but the fact is the water pik works great. I just had to replace my car battery but I didn&#x27;t trash talk GM over it. Here&#x27;s a little fun fact since a lot people are shocked by this... machines make noise. In my opinion, it&#x27;s not too loud. And did anybody notice that the lady who said \\&quot;who has the time to get thinggs repaired\\&quot; had enough time to get on Amazon and leave the review? Also, to the person who says it lasts 10 seconds, can you imagine how big this thing would be to hold a few minutes worth of water? Take the 2 seconds to fill it back up when you need to or use regular floss and shut up... ok sorry.  That being said, I hate shoving a piece of string between my teeth so I picked this up for Christmas and after the first use my bad breath problems were gone. I mean i&#x27;d pick my teeth but there are just some things you can&#x27;t get out. I found a piece of crushed red pepper that I didn&#x27;t know was there, nor do I remember eatting. The only thing that I don&#x27;t like about water piking my teeth is the taste of blood when I&#x27;m done... not the product&#x27;s fault, my fault for being so lazy for the past 28 years. Anyways, you&#x27;ll love it or  hate it. The only way to know is to try it yourself and ignore the reviews because really the only time people write reviews is when they have something bad to say.</li>
            <li> I bought this even after reading all of the reviews and almost 6 months after giving this as a gift to my husband, it is dead in the water. No pun intended. I will be trying the radio shack parts to see if it is the connectors. If this problem is so well documented why doesn&#x27;t waterpik do something.</li>
            <li> The waterpik works well and gets the food particles stuck under my bridges which I was going crazy with.  My dentist&#x27;s assistant told me to get it after my dentist told me I needed a deep cleaning (for $250) around those bridges.  So I spent $50 for so on the waterpik to avoid the deep cleaning.  So far so good.  The only downside to the waterpik is the amount of water it holds, which is not enough and I have to fill it twice if I have something stubborn stuck under one of my bridges.  Other than that, the waterpik works great and I can recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I love the Waterpik.  After using the Waterpik, followed by brushing my teeth, they feel as clean as when I go to the dentist.</li>
            <li> Not as much power as a regular pik but works good and packs easily.  Can be hidden in a cabinet easier than the plug in models.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive gums, so flossing usually causes them to bleed. The waterpik works far better and takes less time. Although, I do have to refill it at least once a session. Very satisfied overall, and I look forward to having healthier teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used oral water flushing devices for 20 years.  My favorite brand is the InterPlak by Conair.  My wife and I started RVing a couple of years ago and it has always been a hassle packing my Interpak.  So, I decided to purchase a cordless device.  Since Waterpik has been making oral flushing devices for so many years I decided to purchase theirs.  It completely sucks.  It&#x27;s too large, won&#x27;t hold a charge more than 3 days, it won&#x27;t work if it is tilted and it doesn&#x27;t hold enough water.  There isn&#x27;t one thing good about this product.  I usually return items that don&#x27;t work but, I didn&#x27;t want the vendor to have to pay for Waterpik making a bad product.</li>
            <li> 45 seconds of water...if even that, goes trough way too fast. I will be returning it for a larger model</li>
            <li> I have the regular countertop waterpik and have been very happy with it. It&#x27;s too bulky to take it with me when I travel. The cordless works great when you travel. It&#x27;s not as powerful as the countertop version but it works and it cleans well. I need to fill it up twice and still need to hurry. With the countertop one I can fill up once and still have water left. If you floss once a day it can easily last 2 weeks. You can&#x27;t recharge it overseas. The charger is only rated at 120v and it will not work with a simple connector like a laptop or a cell phone charger. I was in Europe for 2 weeks and flossed twice a day most days and the battery still had some power when I got back. I never drained it all the way.</li>
            <li> Good water pressure, reasonable sized reservoir.  With the plastic tab that requires you to detach reservoir when you fill it up, I will be surprised if it lasts 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good battery life, with at least 7 uses per charge.</li>
            <li> way less water pressure than the plug in type. the head is lose and will change angles on you ( but it travels with you is the only redeeming feature)</li>
            <li> This machine is great for cleaning your teeth between brushing.  My husband uses the waterpik after ever meal.  His dentist is very pleased with the look of his teeth.</li>
            <li> Got this on the advice of the dentist and recommendations of the reviews for this product and it works GREAT.  Had to practice NOT squirting myself but it really does the job of cleaning between the teeth before you brush.  I can go about a week before having to charge the battery and doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space on the vanity</li>
            <li> I purchased the cordless Waterpik about 6 months ago and have used it every day.  I really miss my old corded model for the following reasons;  1. The brass contacts appear to be corroded and the power from the unit is weak making the stream of water slow and ineffective. If you over fill the container, the water drips into the hole containing the brass contacts.  When you plug the cord in you cannot help but to plug it in a receptacle fill of water.  2.  The unit is awkward to hold and the nozzle spins making it difficult to direct the water.</li>
            <li> We got this item for traveling &amp; were very pleased with it. Only needed to be charged once in the 8 days of use. We have used waterpik products for more than 20 years &amp; it&#x27;s so nice to have this compact model.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Target.  In less than one year it would not hold a charge.  I called and they sent a replacement.  Again, in less than a year, it would not hold a charge. They refused to replace.  If you save your receipt for two years they will warrant for two years.  No wonder this outfit is taking it on the chin.      FYI, water reservoir is too small for a flossing of all teeth at once have to refill.</li>
            <li> I had owned a cordless waterflosser for years, it finally went kaput.  I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d find another one that I would like, but I did.  This has a bigger tank to hold more water &amp; it is cordless.  It has a high &amp; low switch.  I love this product.  I think this is better than flossing with string.  Plus the fact I bought a cordless flosser which is a pleasure to use.[[ASIN:B000UWAWQU Waterpik Waterflosser Cordless PLUS]] [[ASIN:B0002AHY7A WaterPik FLA-220 Power Flosser, Battery Powered (Colors May Vary)]]</li>
            <li> This is a Santa gift, so have not used yet. Daughter-in-law has one, loves it and suggested to me. Bought 2 so Santa is bringing us both one.</li>
            <li> this is a piece of crap , after two months it no longer get charged, of course it is too late to return it, so I&#x27;m stuck with it,     do not buy it, maybe they wills top putting it on sale.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Cordless 450, plugs in to recharge but removes to use, miminal counter space. I&#x27;m not great at flossing but I use this twice a day, it&#x27;s great. It included 4 tips but I only use the plaque fighting brush. I&#x27;ve checked everywhere and cannot find that replacement tip. The instructions say to change every few months. So far it&#x27;s okay but I tried the jet spray and even on gentle it seemed harsh on my recent implant.     I would give this product 5 stars if I could find the replacement tips. A local store that sells it checked online and on their list of products and is now checking with their buyer. I checked Amazon and the WaterPik site. Why is this so difficult?</li>
            <li> I originally reviewed this item as a 5-star item, but that was back in September 2011 when I first bought it.  A year later, it&#x27;s officially dead.  It was actually quite a slow death as just a few months after getting it, it was already noticeably weaker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the idea of the device, but in the end I&#x27;m not sure it was the best use of $100 (we bought two).  I will get another water flossing system of some sort, but I recommend that you skip this one unless you&#x27;re ok with re-buying it once a year.</li>
            <li> More than I expected. Excellent!  Its features are great. And all, at good price!  Takes care of all possibilities for dental and oral health-</li>
            <li> Not to be confused with messy cumbersome corded models!  This streamline waterpik does the job with good pressure, long lasting charge and it doesn&#x27;t clutter up the counter.</li>
            <li> I just got my third one of these and I can recommend this product as something that will make you happy when you go in for cleanings. Gums will be great and there is rarely any scraping needed. I use this in the morning only and it has been a major benefit.&lt;br /&gt;At 64 my dentist says that I will be buried with my original teeth. That&#x27;s good enough for me. The reason I&#x27;m on my third one is the previous batteries gave out at 15-18 months. The company is very good about honoring the two year warranty although your replacement unit will have no warranty. Three plus years for $40 - I&#x27;m in.</li>
            <li> First off, a great idea, hence my reasons for buying it. Delivery was prompt and efficient, packaging fine etc.. Read the instructions, first thing is to charge it for at least 10 hours, or overnight. Errr...fine, so where is the charging light?? I had no idea if 1, it was charging and 2, when it was fully charged, and 3, when it was getting low on charge. Finally the next day decided to try it out. If you push the tip too close to the tooth gap, it stops pumping. There are 5 different attachments. I liked the look of the one with the brush attached, thinking it would be quite efficient - wrong - the brush qualoty is crap and it turned into a useless tuft of bent bristles after one use. I didn&#x27;t use it on low pressure as the high pressure should have been more useful. Admittedly it flush out some very loose particles of food, but I&#x27;m not sure if they were coming from actually between my teeth. I could not feel the water coming out from the other side and onto my tongue either. Great as a water pistol I guess.</li>
            <li> I love it... but... now it leaks from the bottom of the water compartment... it&#x27;s only one year old</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product.  It has good pressure and once you charge it you can use it for quite sometime before recharging.  Its a bit large to take with you on a trip, but its great form home use.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that really improve mine and my family&#x27;s oral health.  Use it everyday and will avoid dentist visits.</li>
            <li> My dentist had recommended a waterpik.  Dutifully I bought one.  It is okay, but I still find myself using  a dental tool such as a pick to clean between my teeth.  Now I use a toothbrush, the waterpik, and then a pick. It is too time consuming and I don&#x27;t feel my teeth are any cleaner. To add to this review the waterpik  stopped working after 4 months of use once a day.  I expected this to last more than 4 months and would never buy another waterpik.  Do not recommend.</li>
            <li> Good item.  Works as expected.  Note, it is cordless but too bulky to be ultra portable.</li>
            <li> Great product at a good price.</li>
            <li> Like many of the reviewers my water pik&#x27;s battery stopped recharging. Sorry, but I refuse to retrofit like another reviewer did with his/hers. It was still under warranty. Having learned from past purchases of products with questionable reviews, I had purchased it from another source that has a great return policy, so I just returned it to the purchaser rather than wait months for the manufacturere to make good. I will buy a corded one next, becase it is a great product when it was working. I never go on vacation anyway so portability is not an issue. I do dread the having ugly thing sitting on my counter, though.</li>
            <li> The battery is VERY weak and it sounds like it is giving out now.  I am very unhappy with it.  I am looking for something that does the same thing but NOT a Waterpic.  I have owned three and all of them eventually gave out in a short period of time.</li>
            <li> I bought this travel WaterPik Ultra to use when I, well, travel. Most of my travels take me overseas where 110v is not the standard but 220v.  Too bad this portable device comes with a 110v only adapter and WaterPik says they do not sell (or simply will not sell?) a 110-220v adapter.  They also informed me that the device will not work with a transformer.  Both hard to believe. They advised me to return the product and buy one overseas.  Very helpful. Not.</li>
            <li> It has more power than the cheaper units. It also has a high and low setting which gives more options for sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> I hate flossing. So any product that will step in for flossing part of the time is a great thing. I do floss the regular way AND Waterpik sometimes, and that is super clean. On the hurry day and I just feel like doing just one of them, Waterpik is a more pleasant experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a big change because I used to have a Waterpik brand corded large-tank-style unit and it was worse experience than flossing. It was huge, loud, a hassle to fill, had a short tube that could accidentally get yanked, and took one of my few outlets in the bathroom. I am comparing this new Cordless PLUS unit to the old one, not against other cordless units.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noise - This unit is much quieter, but any water pump will make some noise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reservoir - The size of reservoir is perfect for me. Just enough water to do the job. If I need more for a really good job, it takes a couple seconds to refill. The reservoir is SMALL enough to easily be held, emptied back out, and to fit under the faucet in a small sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips - It came with extra tips with different names and shapes, but I just use the classic one. It seems sturdy, but can be rotated one notch at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ergonomics - Perfect. I don&#x27;t know what more to ask for, but it is handheld, light and mobile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery - Lasts longer than other electric toys of that power (like electric razors) and has kept charge so far. The fact that it has a battery at all means I can charge it overnight in another room with an outlet then use it in the bathroom for days. The thing comes with clear instructions to charge it like 24 hours before first use, and to NOT run it all the way down. Follow that and it will work great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price - considering the expensive battery, I see no problem here. Similar price to other electric units.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water power - Ok, so this isn&#x27;t going to take the paint off cars, but it does clean teeth. I use it on high, and if that won&#x27;t clean your teeth I recommend floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My review is based on only 2 weeks of use, and experience with only tank-style units in the past. Having said that, this unit exceeded every expectation, and this style of flosser (cordless) is much better for me. Is it more effective than flossing? No, but it goes well with flossing or is a good stand-in.e units in the past. Having said that, this unit exceeded every expectation, and this style of flosser (cordless) is much better for me.

            <li> Good idea poor follow thru.    There is simply not enough power for this product to be acceptable.  The entire reason for the water pick is to power clean your teeth and without power that goal is not met.    Stick with a traditional plug in model.</li>
            <li> Having used my girlfriend&#x27;s platinum model, and now owning the classic myself, I was not crazy about the cordless model. It works, just not as well.    Here are my issues:    The tip moves all around, and even if you hold the rotating dial with your thumb, the tip still moves in the housing. This was the biggest issue, as it made it difficult to make sure the tip was facing the right direction.    The fact that you have to hold it upright means you make a bigger mess, spilling dirty water all over the entire waterpik (which you can&#x27;t immerse in water, supposedly). It also gives less control over angling the thing in the right way, and combined with the moving tip, it&#x27;s just that much harder.    The water capacity is much less, and filling it is not as simple, especially if you want to use mouthwash in it. I was concerned about leaks developing, as the plug design seemed pretty flimsy.    The power seems to be much lower, and even lower once it encounters resistance such as your tooth or gum. Typical of cordless devices, I guess.     Fewer power settings.    Pros:    It comes with more tips than the classic, and it does save a lot of space.    All in all, it works, but having already used one that works much better I decided to get the cheaper classic model. After a few days, I&#x27;m happy I decided to switch.</li>
            <li> We bought this model and it broke within a couple months of purchase. Waterpik&#x27;s other model also broke within 3 months. I wouldn&#x27;t buy anything from Waterpik.    I didn&#x27;t even want to give it one star.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I like this too much.  It is somewhat awkward to use, you have to lean over the sink so the water pours out of your mouth while your spraying your teeth. I&#x27;m also not sure that it&#x27;s cleaning any better than normal floss.  The machine is a bit bulky, you have to hold it upright or it won&#x27;t spray, so you better have good dexterity, and it runs out of water quickly on the high setting. I kind of wish I hadn&#x27;t bought it, but I&#x27;ll continue using it for now, and see if my next dental check-up is any better.</li>
            <li> The other reviews are right, the water reservoir is too small, but for travel this is great, I don&#x27;t mind refilling a couple of times!  It strong, powerful and the battery lasts!  I love using it in the shower where you dont&#x27; have to worry about the splash!  I just ordered the full size ultra but am happy to have this one for traveling for sure!</li>
            <li> I recently purchase this product on recommendation from my dentist. My first impression is this water flosser was quite big with water reservoir and it requires some pratice to hold the flosser to make it work. But after couple of uses, you will get used to how to handle it, and it does the job quite well, cleaning up the gumlines and flosses out food debris from your teeth very efficiently. I admit that it is quite messy during flossing, but that can be managed once you get used to how to hold and orient the flosser and the tips to align with gumlines prior to deliver turn it on to deliver the pulsating water. The end result is very clean gumlines and teeth. In all, it does the job very well. As far as battery charging, connector and decreasing water pressure problems, I have not experienced any of them, since I have the products a little over 3 weeks. Time will tell, and I will update my review if any problems come up in near future.</li>
            <li> I use my regular waterpik daily but it takes up so much space when traveling. I decided on the cordless and love it. Just returned from a trip and it worked great. Definitely would recommend.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after the first week</li>
            <li> Using good batteries is the key to this working good.  Does exactly what I had hoped for.  Using it strickly for trips.</li>
            <li> I tried this product twice. First one last about 6 months and then stopped charging. Second one stopped working in less than a week! Same problem - it doesn&#x27;t charge enough for a full use. It would drain power within 10-30 seconds of use. There are reviews here that suggest a remedy for this by buying a Radioshack part.&lt;br /&gt;I am just going to try another brand.</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT ALONG WITH A SONIC CARE TOOTH BRUSH AFTER I DECIDED TO SEE A DENTIST AFTER NOT GOING FOR ABOUT 15 YEARS.  AFTER THE DENTIST INFORMED ME THAT I HAD SEVERE PERIODENTAL DISEASE I SAW THE LIGHT.  I AM HAPPY WITH THE WATERPIC CORDLESS WATERFLOSSER.  I DECIDED TO BUY THIS MODEL AS I CAN TAKE IT INTO THE SHOWER EACH MORNING.&lt;br /&gt;AFTER I BRUSH MY TEETH WITH A CONVENTIONAL TOOTH BRUSH; MESSAGE MY GUMS WITH MY SONIC CARE ELECTRIC TOOTH BRUSH, FLOSS, I THEN USE THE WATERPIK.  THE SHOWER IS THE PERFECT PLACE AS YOU DONT HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE WATER THAT SPLATTERS IF YOU USE IT AT A SINK.  THE RESERVOIR HOLDS 20 OUNCES OF WATER. NOTE, USING COLD WATER BOTHERS MY NOW SENSITIVE TEETH, SO I FILL IT WITH LUKE WARM WATER, MUCH BETTER. THE RESERVOIR, LASTS APPROXIMATELY 30 SECONDS WHEN THE SETTING IS ON LOW.  I USUALLLY REFILL IT ONCE OR TWICE WHICH ONLY TAKES 5 OR 10 SECONDS BUT WHICH I FIND INCONVENIENT TO REFILL.&lt;br /&gt;OTHERWISE AFTER A MONTH OF USE I LIKE THE PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Other reviews expressed concerns about the reservoir size and battery life.  I only fill my reservoir 1-2 times per use and my battery lasts for several weeks before needing a recharging.  The Waterpik feels really good, and my gums are healthier, particularly my one problem deep pocket.  I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied.</li>
            <li> I used this for about a year as a travel pick before it stopped charging. This unit is inconvenient because the clear plastic tip is not stationary after insertion, which is awkward. It spins around if it touches any surface inside your mouth. Because of this feature, you need two hands to operate. Next, the pressure is insufficient to really clean your teeth. The pressure is nothing close to the home units.  I really like the clean feeling a water pick product gives me so I will be buying another product. Now that I need to replace this unit (no longer charges), with the two issues identified here, which I seriously consider to be major issues, I&#x27;m going to try someone else&#x27;s product.  Since the TSA regularly searches my luggage and disturbs the contents, I am not unhappy with the life of the unit. This unit was found dead in the &#x27;on&#x27; position when I unpacked after my last trip, which was not how it was wrapped and packed.  TSA inspections is a topic best left alone. I do not fault the product for this issue, needless to say.</li>
            <li> This worked well enough that I have decided to purchase another.  However, I&#x27;m going to try a different brand, because the re-chargeable battery on this unit conked out after less than a year.  There are no serviceable parts, although it would have been easy to engineer the unit so that the owner could easily replace the rechargeable batters.  I would have paid more if the unit used lithium ion rather than metal hydride batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend the concept, but not this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, it IS loud, and the tip does rotate on its own. The reservoir is small. But I could have lived with these short comings if the unit would have lasted.</li>
            <li> It was defective - leaks as came with a crack in it so how do I exchange - but the cordless  is not as powerful as the  plug in one so disappointed.</li>
            <li> I got braces on my teeth two months ago.  It is really hard to floss but with the investment I&#x27;m making, I want to make sure I have beautiful teeth when the braces come off.  The Waterpik makes me feel that much cleaner and refreshed.  And it was $10 less on Amazon (with free shipping) than at the big box stores.  I&#x27;ve got the Cordless Plus.</li>
            <li> I bought this to take on a trip; I have the WP-100 (electric) at home.  It was okay, just not as strong as the electric one.</li>
            <li> This product has a fatal design defect: You can&#x27;t get it wet, but there&#x27;s no way to use it without getting it wet. Think about it. It&#x27;s pumping a jet of water into your mouth. You can&#x27;t swallow that water (and you probably wouldn&#x27;t want to if you could). So the water comes out of your mouth, and flows over the Water Pik. Within a couple months, no matter how careful you are, the water will cause the metal prongs that connect to the charger to corrode. Now your Water Pik won&#x27;t charge. It&#x27;s a useless brick. I was lucky to have purchased from a big box store with a 90 day return policy (yes, this happened to me in less than 90 days). I switched to the Panasonic Oral Irrigator (EW-DJ10-A), a portable water flosser that has a gasket-sealed compartment for its batteries (it&#x27;s not rechargeable, but it&#x27;s about half the cost of this Water Pik).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The water flossing technique itself works great, by the way. It&#x27;s very effective at getting all the gunk out from between my teeth, especially where I have a couple dental crowns.</li>
            <li> It worked great for about six months, then quit.  Since I did not keep the receipt, it is now an expensive piece of garbage.  I would not buy another one.</li>
            <li> This cordless waterpik is more awkward to use than the traditional tank-type waterpik.  It has no battery level indicator, and no LED to indicate when it is successfully being charged (or fully charged), and the battery only lasts for a short, unknown number of uses.  I have to fill the tank twice to clean my whole mouth.  After owning this device for 7 months, the battery has completely given up the ghost, without warning.    I like the concept of a waterpik, but don&#x27;t buy this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still learning how to use this properly buy so far I think it does a great job. A little messy but then that might be on me since I&#x27;m still learning.</li>
            <li> I will never buy another product by Waterpik again. The first version I bought had a larger reservoir and had to replace the unit after 7 months since it no longer accepted a charge. The replacement had a smaller reservoir so I swapped the old one onto the new one. Once again the rechargeable battery dies after less then 5 months! I decided to take it apart and buy a replacement battery; no serial number on the battery. I will buy the shower head water pick  from Amazon and never have to worry about a battery again</li>
            <li> I got one for my 3(adult) children after I got one. Much funner than flossing!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because my old 350 M finally broke down.  This product is very poor for the following reasons.  Tank is impossible to clean and dry and of small capacity. Heavy.  As the pick is not at the end of a small tube, you make a mess of it when you use it.  Weak pump.  Obviously whoever designed this one did not try to use it.  Very much worse than the old 350 M.</li>
            <li> I use this twice a day and the charge last about 2-3 weeks. Haven&#x27;t had any issues with leakage or anything. My periodontist noted that my gums improved after my last checkup. I use this combined with normal floss and an electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This is a complete waste of your money. It doesn&#x27;t get the food properly out of your teeth and anyone who says it does probably has huge gaping spaces between their teeth. I sent it back immediately and spent money on a larger better one.</li>
            <li> Believe this product to be good but had to return it as voltage is not suitable for Australia (240 Volts).</li>
            <li> I was somewhat hesitant about this product but my dentist said it would help my gums.  Well not only has it helped my gums but it feels good and is easy to do.</li>
            <li> Just ok hard not to be sloppy</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with this Waterpik.  My main reason for purchasing the cordless model is the fact that my small, vintage bathroom has a wall mounted sink and NO counter space, thus no place for a traditional water flosser to sit while in use. There is a cabinet on the opposite wall where this one can sit charging.&lt;br /&gt;I actually have a traditional model that sat in storage for years until I dusted it off in an attempt to use it here. I quickly tired of having to drag a stool into the bathroom to place the flosser on while in use, complete with extension cord yada yada. True the regular style has a larger tank and more pressure settings, but this cordless model serves the purpose for me, for now.&lt;br /&gt;It has lasted at least 2 weeks on a charge before I perceived any drop in power. The tank did seem to empty quickly, but now I can complete my mouth on one filling. And if you do need more water, it is VERY easy to fill.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it is annoying that it doesn&#x27;t have an indicator light when it&#x27;s charging. When I first plugged it in, I could only assume and hope that it was charging.&lt;br /&gt;Time will tell how the battery holds up over the coming months. Time will also tell if I experience better dental checkups since using this consistently.</li>
            <li> There was nothing wrong with it. However, I found it to be quite large and cumbersome so I returned it.</li>
            <li> It is a good product. Easy to use and store when not in use. Gets into those hard places in your mouth</li>
            <li> Have had this for a few months and already I&#x27;m having problems with the rechargeable battery.  Will be going back to the unit that just plugs into the wall.</li>
            <li> The unit cleans all the particles away from your teeth and feels good on the gums. My wife purchased the non portable version and if I had to do it over again that is the one I would buy because this unit is too big to take on trips in my view. Her unit is not as noisy and allows you to do the back of the teeth of your lower jaw. The portable one must be keep in a semi-upright position or the water stops flowing. The portable unit requires two fill ups to do a good job but that is not a big deal.</li>
            <li> I like this water pic device a lot, however, I left the last generation model in a hotel room and had to order this one which has a different style plug...why?  And the stream is not quite as strong.  Thank goodness all the older heads work and I tried every single one to see if the attachments were hindering the strength of the water...they are not, this is just not as powerful.  I loved the earlier model.</li>
            <li> Before purchasing this product I had read alot of negative reviews.  Not sure what their problem was. Since I bought the first one and tried it, I have since bought two more. It does exactly what it says it does. I have not had one instance of the attachment being loose or flying around as others complained about. It is easy to fill, easy to use and it holds a charge for a good week. My husband,my daughter, my father all find this product very useful in getting into places the floss couldn&#x27;t get. Personally for my teeth, I still like floss and don&#x27;t find it to be a replacement but an additional way to be sure my teeth are sqeaky clean. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is a good concept as it is coordless and easy to use but it cannot subsitute the need to use dental floss in addition to the waterflosser. The waterpik coordless plus unit is not reliable - after 4 months of usage it no longer would turn on. The battery was recharged but to no avail it did not work and was dead. Thanks to the excellent customer service at Amazon I was able to get a replacement and I hope I have better luck with this one. One big problem is that it does not run on dual voltage 110/220 so I cannot bring it abroad when I travel.  I would recommend it only if you could get it at a price that would make it worth your wild to buy.</li>
            <li> Junk do not buy this item. batttery does not hold a charge.  Pressure does not hold. Hard to hold.  Very Very clunky item.  The Pansonic battery unit is much better</li>
            <li> I purchased this for use as my water flosser during travel periods. I found that it is awkward to use and does not meet my needs.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly as described in the positive reviews.  The battery life is sufficient for a weeks worth of flossing and the unit is easy to handle.  Got feedback from my hygienist at a recent cleaning appointment - \\&quot;you are doing a wonderful job\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Item is difficult use. You must hold the entire large unit when you use it. I returned after 3 uses.</li>
            <li> I never could floss the \\&quot;regular\\&quot; way.  This seems to do exactly what it is supposed to do.  have only had it a few weeks.  I am hoping we don&#x27;t run into durability problems others have reported.  Will report back in a few months.  When first started using it- I was inefficient and it took 3 refills.  Now, I easily do the job w. one refill for the bottom teeth and one refill for the top.  I floss both from the inside out and the outside in.  The instructions seems to say you only need to do outside/in - but it seems to be more thorough doing both.  Use warm water for comfort.  Easy to refill and plug in.       I gave it 4 rather than 5 stars because, while not sure, maybe it could have been designed w. a bigger tank w.o. it being cumbersome.  On/off switch seems slightly awkward to use while the pick is in your mouth.  However, as a flosser, it is 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful!!  First time around I bought a less expensive flosser - which did not last long-this one does even better than I expected!!</li>
            <li> It works great for me.  Avoid the cheaper, inferior cordless Waterpik - I wonder if people are commenting on the wrong product...    A little less powerful than the plug-in variety.  The water resovoir is just about right and won&#x27;t spill if held at angles.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in this travel pik as I have the full size  Waterpik that is over 20 years old and perfect in what it does. This one works well BUT and it is a big BUT-- the reservoir is so small that it empties before you are ready to stop using it. It should be at least 2 1/2 times the size.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000UWAWQU Waterpik Ultra Cordless Dental Water Jet]]  The water container is too small. Buy a bigger model!</li>
            <li> frustrated because it is 120v and where I live the voltage is 240v, so I could not use the product. the product description does not specify this important information and I could not imagine I would have this problem as the majority of the charges are, nowadays 110 - 240 v....</li>
            <li> After reading both the negative and positive reviews for this product I decided to try it b/c it seems to me that this is just a personal preference as to whether you like the product or not.  I like it a lot and am glad I didn&#x27;t listen to the negative reviews.  I do agree with one of the comments about it being loud.  Yes, it is loud but every water pick I have ever tried has been loud and given that you only use it for 30 seconds in my opinion it&#x27;s not a problem.  I have been using it on a daily basis and I am very happy with the results I am getting.  I can see a visible difference after I use it.</li>
            <li> I have had the earlier 360 twice and of course the batteries died on both before the year was out.  I have never made a claim, too much trouble and who has time.  That&#x27;s something Water-Pik is banking (literally) on.  I said in a review on the 360 earlier I was going to be stupid and try this one but it would be the last chance for Water-Pik.  So I did and in an age where battery problems like these do not have to be the case Water Pik puts sorry battery technology again in this unit.  They know it and it is not an accident, but a complete rip off.  The Ultra lasted less than 4 months used twice daily.  Great unit for pressures and portability.  Get over the small reservoir it is a portable and 3 seconds to refill, so get a life.  That is why they are portable.  I will NEVER own another Water Pik product.  There is no excuse to market this junk.  It is not as if they are unaware of the problem and therefore they are DISHONEST to be sure.    My overdue update two and a half years later.  In 2008 I purchased a Panasonic EW1270 without any reviews.  It worked acceptably well but at half life of the alkaline AA batteries the power would began to fall off.  After two years of using it I tried it with Sanyo Eneloop rechargable and would give it 6 Stars if I could.  Almost no loss of power until the batteries are ready to quit.  However the model Amazon is now carrying is the Panasonic Oral Irrigator EW-DJ10-A.  It appears to be almost identical to my 1270 with a slightly different nozzel at the base.  The very good reviews now available lead me to believe this is a newer model and with at least the same great performance of my 1270 unit.</li>
            <li> I have had this product for several weeks and so far it has been performing as expected.  I had previously read reviews by others and was concerned about the constant refilling of water before the entire mouth was completely cleaned.  I only need to refill it once and there is plenty of water leftover. It all depends on how fast or how slow you move the waterpik through your mouth. As for the complaints regarding the length of time it stays charged, mine is keeping the charge for one week (one person usage).  I will ask my dentist at the next checkup if she can tell the difference between my flossing and using this device - any cleaner?</li>
            <li> im sorry i spent the money on this silly contraption.the resaon being when u tilt the water pik it doesnt work,hard to get to the bottom of the teeth,and especially the bottom front.save ur money and go for the electric one.</li>
            <li> This is a little messy, but it cleans your gums really well.  Takes a little practice to do it right without hosing down your bathroom, but your mouth feels really clean after.  I had no trouble directing the stream, but you have to keep your mouth closed and let the liquid drain out the side into the sink.  A little bit of mouthwash, with the water, and you got a super clean moth.  have had it a few months and no operational problems yet.,</li>
            <li> I purchased the unit for travel, specifically for an upcoming European trip. While in Europe the unit did not recharge even with the adaptor and ceased functioning permanently. The representative at Waterpik stated this limitation was enumerated in the handbook that came with the unit although I could not find it. Waterpik was courteous enough to send me a new unit. So don&#x27;t plan on travelling out of the country where there is a different power supply.</li>
            <li> This waterflosser works well and leaves mouth feeling fresh and clean.   For longest battery life, keep unit plugged into wall outlet.   Easy to use and design fits nicely in hand for ease of operation.   A product well worth the price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the standard waterpik for years.  This looked like a step forward - not so:  1.  You have to unplug and plug it back into it&#x27;s electrical connection every time (it&#x27;s wet after use - think about that).  I know it&#x27;s probably low voltage but I don&#x27;t like it  2.  The water reservoir stores a minimal amount of water - I have to refill to get around one time  3.  It has two speeds - dribble and trickle.  Not enough pressure to be useful to me.  4.  The worst part is trying to get the water where you want it.  If you hold it vertical with your left hand, you can twirl the sprayer.  If you try it one handed, won&#x27;t work.  You have to keep it vertical for the water to pump (are you kidding me??)  I&#x27;m buying the old reliable.  Hope WaterPik does a better job next time.....</li>
            <li> I got one from my orthodontist so mine didn&#x27;t come from Amazon, but I still love having it.&lt;br /&gt;I have to say, I love it for getting out all the little bits of food and stuff that get stuck in-between everything.&lt;br /&gt;I use it after brushing and it still amazes me because it finds stuff that brushing alone would not have removed.&lt;br /&gt;It makes a bit of a winey noise but it is not unbearable by any means.&lt;br /&gt;It has a high and a low setting.&lt;br /&gt;Mine stays charged over a good few days.&lt;br /&gt;I can fill up the little water reservoir and it will last for all of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;It is also good for tight spaces and when I get some food stuck that I can&#x27;t get to, because I just pot it in, push it to on, and it gets it right out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great pik tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did have a problem after a long time of using mine, but since it has a warranty, I e-mailed the company, and they sent me a brand new one.&lt;br /&gt;Great customer service.</li>
            <li> I have had two rechargable Waterpiks. Both had the same problem. After about 5 or 10 months the unit gradually loses the ability to charge up. Most users assume that the battery became defective.     I really need this thing so I decided to look into it and found that the battery in each case was fine. What happens is that the connector on the charging cable gradually deteriorates. This might be due to getting wet repeatedly combined with corrosion and deposits. The inside of the female part of the connector gets get eaten away and actually gets larger in diameter. The electrical connection deteriorates and finally becomes unusable. As a result the battery no longer gets recharged.     I found that the \\&quot;AdaptaPlug\\&quot; connector system available at Radio Shack has the same pin diameter and pin spacing. By whittling some plastic away I made a better connector from the Radio Shack parts and now the Waterpiks work like new.     The part numbers of the Radio Shack connectors needed are:   Male: 273-1742   Female: 273-1743</li>
            <li> I love these.  The only reason I give it a 3 instead of 5 is that they wear out eventually and don&#x27;t take a charge.  I have had three of them and I believe they have lasted a little over a year, with twice daily use.</li>
            <li> I have the product for about 1 year now, I use it everyday and works, rechargeable battery has not died yet as I initially expected.   As with many of the other reviews there is a flaw in the way that the nozzles were designed, once put it there they rotate freely, that is very annoying because I have to hold the nozzle with my finger (I got used to do that anyways).   It is perfect for braces now that you dont have to work around with the flossing thread between the wires.   In general terms I like the device but it should definitely be improved.</li>
            <li> My complaint about the cordless dental water jet (Waterpik Ultra) is that the charger loses its charge very quickly.  As long as I keep it plugged in, it seems to work, but only for about three fillings.   I sent an email to the seller, and received this answer:   Dear Customer,      Please get in touch with the manufacturer as we are not the manufacturer.  Your patience is greatly appreciated and we apologize for the inconvenience.    Customer Care,  AmericaRx    AmericaRx.com Online Pharmacy  Health &amp; Beauty Store  e-mail: customerservice@americarx.com  Phone: 800-361-2084    So I get nothing from these guys.  What am I supposed to do Amazon? [[ASIN:B000UWAWQU Waterpik Ultra Cordless Dental Water Jet]]</li>
            <li> The stream is much too weak to be useful to me. I charged it up with more than the time the directions said, just to be sure it was fully charged. There is no indicator light or anything to show when the full charge has been reached. And I saw practically no difference in pressure between the two speeds. I returned it to Amazon. They even gave me a paid return shipping label. So, Amazon gets its usual high mark from me, but Waterpik should be chastized mightily for allowing this product to go out the door as ineffective as it is. It&#x27;s almost like they want to try and go out of business by angering the customer. IMHO.</li>
            <li> I recently needed to start wearing braces.   The waterpik has been a big help.  The cordless feature makes it easy to work with.</li>
            <li> It was working fine until stopped working battery. I don&#x27;t know I have to think about this product because a lot of people was complaining about the battery. I would like to return it.</li>
            <li> Great price for a great product.  Delivery was quick and unit has been utilized daily without any problems.  Use it in conjunction with floss and electric tootbrush and everything seems to come completely clean.  My dental hygienist recommended this product and thus far it has been great.</li>
            <li> I bought this on my dentist&#x27;s recommendation because my teeth are very close together, making efficient flossing difficult. The Waterpick is easy and comfortable to use and it is very obvious every time I use it that it is doing its job. The built-in reservoir seems to be just the right size.</li>
            <li> I have been using it now for two months and I think that the unit is a disaster.   PROS: it&#x27;s cordless, it holds a charge for many hours, it is small enough to take along if traveling.   CONS: it&#x27;s jet rotates in your mouth so it is impossible to aim at a particular spot unless you hold the jet with the other hand which is rather awkward. But even then the jet easily flips and slips around in your mouth such that you need several refills to do a good cleaning.   Worse: the jet tends to jump off, spraying your face, the mirror, the bathroom, everything. It&#x27;s a facial shower unit. Although by now I&#x27;m well rehearsed to use both hands to keep it in place, the jet keeps popping off and I have hardly a cleaning where I don&#x27;t need to clean myself and the room up thereafter.   Also: the jet intermittently starts jerking around, or up and down, like a sledgehammer ... jerking around on your gums, even making them bleed. The solution to that is to turn the unit off and start over.   Then the on / off switch has a problem: the lightest touch turns it on or off, such that if you are cleaning, you might inadvertently turn it off or if you are done and just drying it off you might inadvertenly turn it on and once again spray everything.   I&#x27;m going to order right now a different product.</li>
            <li> It works. It holds enough charge and enough water for two &amp;#34;quick&amp;#34; sessions. I would recommend the plug in version with the water trough over this one. In fact I ordered one of those. No cavities since its use and my bi yearly cleanings have never gone quicker and smoother.</li>
            <li> I had to return the Waterpik Waterflosser because the high-pitched sound was too much for my sensitive ears! I will have to search for a quieter one.</li>
            <li> Review for Waterpik Cordless. Bought this last year and I&#x27;m already on the second one.  I called the manufacturer to replace the first one and customer service was excellent.  Got my replacement unit for free in less than a week.  The replacement unit stopped working as well after six months of usage.  It&#x27;s really a good product to rinse in between your teeth, if it would just last. The item was never dropped and only used it once a day.  Save your time and money and skip this one.</li>
            <li> Well, it lasted 15 months before the battery will no longer hold a charge.  During it&#x27;s life it worked great.  My dental hygiene person said it kept my gums clean and healthy.  It was great for getting between teeth.  I charged the battery regularly and used it every day  A battery charge would last about a week.  It is too bad it does not work plugged in.  I will look for another waterflosser that can stay on electricity.</li>
            <li> Pro:&lt;br /&gt;+ Does what it says in the box. I use this after I floss my teeth to get rid of food particles.&lt;br /&gt;+ Portable&lt;br /&gt;+ Not too pricey&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Might be pretty loud for some (electric toothbrush sound level)&lt;br /&gt;- Needs constant recharging&lt;br /&gt;- Water reservoir is a bit small. Needs at least one refill.&lt;br /&gt;- I just bought this in June and it&#x27;s not working already! The area where you&#x27;re supposed to plug in the charger appears to be corroded. However, there&#x27;s no way that you can dry this area properly after using the unit without the aid of a blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Great price.  I don&#x27;t agree w/ the reviews that said this unit doesn&#x27;t hold enough water.  More than enough to do the job.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> My Dentist sold me on the product and the concept.  I&#x27;ve been using it everyday ever since.  I can honestly say the nylon string dental floss never inspired me.  I always had a challenging time flossing the back teeth with them and as a result I never flossed regularly.  With the cordless Waterpik I had no problem and enjoyed using it everyday to the amazement of my wife. For me it was certainly a significant improvement over the nylon floss, although relatively an expensive solution.    But (there is always one) the product is marred in terms of its expected lifespan and what I consider a flawed design which was a major annoyance to me.    Lifespan:  When it was new, I had to charge the battery once a  week. Over time, the frequency of the battery recharging between uses increased and after six months it stopped working.    Flawed Design:    The product has no battery charge indicator. As a result:   1) Its impossible to tell how much charge is left in the battery    2) When its being charged you don&#x27;t know if it has completed charging.    3) Or, if it is even charging - we have GFI outlets in our bathroom.  Frequently my wife&#x27;s hair dryer, after usage, trips the GFI circuit and as a result no power is supplied to all the circuits unless it is reset.  Therefore even though the Waterpik is plugged in, you don&#x27;t know if it getting charged until you go to use it or have to plug some other electrical product with an indicator to know power is being supplied.         The only other cordless oral hygiene product I can compare it to in terms of its lifespan and design is the Phillips sonic toothbrush,  My original toothbrush lasted 5+ years before dying and had indicator to inform you the level of charge left and/or amount of the battery charged during recharging.  I&#x27;m not sure how long I expected this product to last, but at the minimum at least two years, as this is the time of their limited warranty.  I would have given the product one star, but the ease with which theCustomer Service responded and agreed to send me a replacement (without having to send the broken product back) earns them additional two stars as I usually do not experience or expect this level of quality service in this day and age.    We will see how long the replacement product lasts.  The other interesting thing the Customer service person mentioned, which sounds counter intuitive to me, is that I need to keep the Waterpik plugged in all the time expect when it is in use.  I thought keeping a rechargeable battery plugged in all the time would reduce its lifespan.  The experts will have to chime in.</li>
            <li> ULTRA BAD! I should have read the reviews BEFORE buying (non-Amazon purchase). The idea is great but it doesn&#x27;t come close to meeting expectations. Overall, poorly designed and engineered. Don&#x27;t engineers or sales people EVER use their own products? Mine lasted maybe 3 months, getting worse each month, until the battery AND motor/pump were both shot. ~$50 gone and ended up in the trash (oops, I meant green \\&quot;save the earth\\&quot; recycle bin).          1. Tip is impossible to control and spins around freely, spraying water everywhere but where you intended.  2. Plastic housing and controls are slippery when wet. Only 2 water pressure speeds and high is not powerful enough after using for 1-2 weeks.  3. Reservoir is difficult to fill completely because air has to be displaced at the same time and through the same hole used to add water.   4. Reservoir is not large enough, so you have to fill it 2-3 times per use.  5. It&#x27;s very loud and noisy. Could be banned after-hours in some communities. Takes too long to re-charge.      6. Replacement tips are very brittle, so they break easily, are non-standard, and impossible to find in a store.   7. The water re-fill plug becomes almost impossible to open, and then begins to leak from a bad seal.  8. The 2 happiest moments for me with this product were 1) the day I bought it, and 2) the day I trashed it.</li>
            <li> This is a portable or travel size Waterpik so there should be no comparison of the size or the reservoir or power to the desktop version. It is pretty good for what it is. My only complaint is that there is no international charger. Only accept US voltage. Can&#x27;t believe they would make a travel size Waterpik that does not travel internationally. At least make a 110-240v charger as an accessory.</li>
            <li> I had previously used a battery operated oral irrigator.  It worked well, but the batteries only lasted 2 weeks.  This Water Pik irrigator has a battery that can be recharged and it works much better.  It is easier and less expensive than using regular batteries.  The Water Pik works very well and it is very easy to use.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this product for about 6 months now. First using it in a more standard situation and now with braces. The battery life is great (1-2 weeks per charge using a couple times a day), it&#x27;s fairly easy to use and does a great job at what it&#x27;s supposed to do. The reservoir is far too small though. It was decent pre-braces, I&#x27;d generally make it to the end on one fill but now with braces I have to fill it up 2-3 times at least. For a product pitched as being a great product for someone with orthodontics they didn&#x27;t think that through. Unlike the ones that attach to your faucet you can mix in a little mouthwash, which is nice and I like the varying tip options. Other than the reservoir size my only other big complaint is the amount of water that ends up anywhere but in your mouth, that can take some getting used to. Because it&#x27;s cordless though I can hop in the shower and not worry about accidentally cleaning the bathroom with it.</li>
            <li> This item was a gift. No complaints from recipient and they seem to be enjoying it. Item arrived when stated. What more can you ask for right?</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Thank you!</li>
            <li> The product is a little bulky in your hand (and a bit more messy than I expected).However, it does a good job flossing the teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this waterpik for a year and half now.  I&#x27;ve used numerous waterpiks that were corded, and were much better.  I don&#x27;t like the fact that this waterpik has to be plugged in for 12-16hrs. per week.  I also dislike the design...it&#x27;s cumbersome and has a small reservoir...(I have to fill it twice for it to do the proper job).  I wish the Waterpik company would design a battery operated waterpik with a large reservoir that&#x27;s ergodynamic;  now how hard could that be?</li>
            <li> I think that this waterpik waterflosser is the best I have ever had and I have tried many.    My dentist is very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> This works fabulous!  This makes flossing fun, not a chore anymore.  I would highly recommend this.  My dentist was very pleased;</li>
            <li> How great!  I let it charge a full 24 hours before my first use.  Then, what a treat! I can&#x27;t recall my teeth feeling so clean, especially under bridgework!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few weeks, the high speed is still too powerful for me.  But the low speed is perfect!</li>
            <li> This is the second waterpick of this sort I&#x27;ve purchased from Waterpik. I thought it operated solely by batteries, but it has to be recharged by electricity. I have sore gums and was hoping to use this at work. I use it only sometimes because the lowest selection (it only has two) is too intense for my gums. I would have also appreciated a light on it somewhere to let me know the charging status. It could also use a pause button conveniently placed somewhere on the body. This is needed because the item is somewhat awkward to maneuver and I&#x27;d like to pause it as I move it around my mouth. Because of the design the resevoir doesn&#x27;t empty completely. I&#x27;m concerned about a build up of stale sitting water because the resevoir won&#x27;t empty. I don&#x27;t need any more problems with my gums. I do use it at least once or twice a week at work. I have another Waterpik at home (works completely on electricity) has a very low setting and I enjoy. Both items help to keep those sticky items between the teeth and coffee stains from setting up housekeeping in my mouth. Come on Waterpik. You can do better.</li>
            <li> I was advised by dental hygienist to use a water pik to help with receding gum issues, so I thought I would give it a try.  As a person who flosses every day, I find that the water pik does an even better job.  In addition, it feels sooo good while you&#x27;re doing it.I am hooked and will continue using it.  I also purchased one for a Christmas gift for a family member.</li>
            <li> So I will caveat this with the fact that I have only been using this a few day, but since I hesitated getting it due to some of the reviews I wanted to add my 2 cents.    Pros:  Lots of power - I have only used this on low and it is more than enough for my (currently) tender gums.  I am confident that the High level will be sufficient when I build up some tolerance.  Ergonomics - I am very picky here and this at least meets my expectations. I have big hands, so I would be concerned whether a child or someone with small hands could hold this well especially if trying to reach the back side of the teeth.  Battery life - its been going strong for days without showing any strain.  The cord/plug is very small so I won&#x27;t mind just plugging it in every weekend.    Size - sure I don&#x27;t want to throw this into my purse, but it would fit in a suitcase if I was going on a longer trip.  it is not compact but it is also not so big that I would not consider it.  And like I said the charging cord is not that big - with all the other electronics I bring, this is no big deal.    Cons:  The water reservoir is not big enough.  I think as I get better at moving it around my mouth it will be fine, but I keep on wishing I had about 10 more seconds of spray.   Messy - this is not a criticism of this brand, it is just the nature of the beast.  But clearly it make take some practice to not have 1/2 the water end up on the floor :-)    Will let you know if my opinion works, but so far I can really see that this will make a difference.  I DESPISE flossing and this has a fun novelty effect and is really effective.</li>
            <li> Not as powerful as stationary Waterpik but will do a quick cleaning on the go. It won&#x27;t fit in pocketbook but perhaps in a desk drawer. Reservoir needs to be filled twice for thorough cleaning but if it were any larger it would be difficult to hold and maneuver. Good for travel. I keep a stationery Waterpik upstairs and this one downstairs. Only two speeds. For me, low is useless. Holds a charge well. Easy to fill and empty, I leave mine open to dry completely.</li>
            <li> I never thought that there are still parts of the developed world that still use 110 V electricity&lt;br /&gt;It was disappointing to receive such a good product and being unable to charge it in Australia&lt;br /&gt;I had to chase up a non standard charger with an unusual input voltage and an unusual output voltage&lt;br /&gt;It meant extra cost and time.&lt;br /&gt;There was no way online or by phone to discuss this issue with Amazon. This is the second time I am disappointed with Amazon since not all products cn be shipped to Australia&lt;br /&gt;From now on I will stick to Ebay, more user friendly</li>
            <li> This product worked as advertised. I enjoy using it and the health benefits to my teeth. It removes food stuck between my teeth and soothes my gums.</li>
            <li> The Waterpic Ultra is well made and the size makes it handy for use while travelling.  However, the tip rotator is so loose so that it is practically impossible to keep it in the position intended.  As soon as the tip touches the mouth the tip moves to a different position from the one chosen.</li>
            <li> This new model is not easy to drain after it has been used.  The water container does not hold enough water to completely clean all my teeth.  It does not feel as strong as the older model I had.</li>
            <li> Great item, exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> I needed a waterpik because I have the perfect gap between my back two teeth and food gets stuck in their in one chew.  I constantly keep floss in my pocket because I need to use it after meal due to pain and discomfort from lodged food. Using a waterpik is a great relief to wash away the gunk that is still left behind from floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this unit because it is portable and has a decent battery charge.  If I could change something, I wish the higher strength setting was a little bit stronger, but I guess that is the sacrifice you make with a portable unit.  The water bowl also seems a little small; you might need to fill it two or three times depend on your needs.  But again, this is a sacrifice for being cordless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to use and it comes with 4 different heads.  I tried them all.  Unfortunately, the difference between each head inst that big of a deal.  I will just stick with the basic one because I just want to powerwash that gap between my teeth.  The unit itself is also a smaller size so it doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space.  The power cord is also detachable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For around $40-$50, I guess you really can&#x27;t complain with this unit.</li>
            <li> The product was received in original packaging, but was determined immediately faulty.  The pik would not lock in place, so could not be used.  Product was returned supplier</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000UWAWQU Waterpik Ultra Cordless Dental Water Jet]]  I&#x27;ve been using this model for only a few weeks, so it&#x27;s too early to tell if it fixes the main problem of the cordless Waterpik 360, which is that before the first year is out, the rechargable battery will no longer hold a charge and so the device becomes useless. (This happened with three previous Waterpik 360s).  A Waterpik rep I wrote to about this problem said that the WP-450 has an upgraded battery.  Otherwise, the 450 seems to work adequately.  But I agree with some of the other reviewers who find that the reservoir is too small (it runs out of water in about 30 seconds even at the low pressure setting) and the water tip is harder to control than the one on the WP-360.  You have to hold the base of the tip with your finger to prevent it from rotating inside your mouth.    Update: The unit failed after three months of twice-a-day use. It was taking more and more pushes of the switch to activate the electric motor(even after being fully charged), and the motor itself started sounding like a car running on cheap gas.  I called Waterpik, and they&#x27;re sending a replacement; but given my previous experience with Waterpik portables, I&#x27;m not optimistic.  I&#x27;ve ordered the portable Panasonic model, so we&#x27;ll see how that one works after a few months.</li>
            <li> I chose this model so I could take it with me when I travel.&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit of a hassle to use.</li>
            <li> I have the stationery waterpik and I&#x27;m very happy with it for as long as I have it, about two years.&lt;br /&gt;However, with my frequent traveling I needed something simular and portable. Well, item arrived a while ago and a thought I&#x27;d give it a try on a trip, plans changed and didn&#x27;t open it until yesterday when I discovered that waterpik is not functioning whatsoever. My return window has passed already. I&#x27;m sending it back for a partial refund and move on to something else. Why can&#x27;t you buy something so generic without playing a lottery-will it work or will it not?</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000UWAWQU Waterpik Waterflosser Cordless PLUS]]    Water Pic works well as advertised and cleans the gums as needed.  I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> This thing is addictive.&lt;br /&gt;It takes a bit to get used to handling it.&lt;br /&gt;But i refill the water tank  and just zone out over the sink.&lt;br /&gt;Much less tartar build up so far than with flossing alone.&lt;br /&gt;I like that it does not take up too much space on the counter because i have so many other products.&lt;br /&gt;But if you don&#x27;t use a lot of products, maybe try the bigger tank version.&lt;br /&gt;But this portable one is really easy to use and refill.&lt;br /&gt;hope my dentist will be impressed :)</li>
            <li> Having had some form of waterpik from their beginning many years back, I have watched their models evolve and purchased many over the years.  Some good and some not so good.  It seemed the older more simple units lasted longer.  I purchased my WP-455W, in Orlando, FL @ Wallmart on a vacation trip as I left my counter top unit at home and needed one as a vacation back-up.  I find it mediocre in quality, somewhat messy until you figure out what angle to hold it while using it.  Your opinion of noisy is somewhat subjective as they all vary with use and age.  My point in reviewing this is a note to anyone using WaterPik products with serious allergies to MOLD.  As I noted in an earlier review of my experience with several of my last few counter top models......  BEWARE of MOLD buildup internally.....if you live in Gulf Coast or areas of high MOLD activity.  MOLD will eventually build up in the seams, and behind the tank in this model and you should regularly  remove your tank by the plastic clip on the bottom and pull down to remove the blue tank.  The plastic IS  fragile so be careful.  If you see any darkening on the white surfaces behind the attached tank it IS mold.  My suggestion is use an old toothbrush and spray some Hydrogen Peroxide while scrubbing with the tooth  brush...Hydrogen Peroxide kills mold.  It is less toxic to you than Clorox and less likely to ignite from a  spark from an electric motor than EverClear alcohol which is also good to kill mold.  I buy bulk containers of Hydrogen Peroxide @ Sam&#x27;s and use it in hand sprayers.  I would inspect every 90 days.  Too bad WP engineers don&#x27;t factor in the constant dampness in the units and mold possibilities and design  for this issue.  Update: 6/21/15  After thoroughly cleaning and removing the mold when I posted the original review.  I noticed the mold was in it&#x27;s earlier stage of a mildew appearance and will eventually reappear as black as it is allowed to age.  This is a reoccurring problem. I will post aphoto of the location.  Update: 5/18/16  I have grown weary of this mold issue and constant cleaning.  The unit sat for 4 months unused until I was about to take it on another trip out of town.  The mold has progressed internally.  I will not flush with clorox as it will compromise the pump and will definitely not be healthy.  I noticed that the pump was also getting weaker.  I will trash the WaterPic and use my Panasonic unit. I have posted two more photos.  Note the black mold internally in the mouthpiece.  I have placed a clean pic next to the one with mold, note the darkened clear plastic vs the clear unused pic.</li>
            <li> I used this for a few weeks and found myself rushing around my mouth before the water ran out.&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using it for a couple of months after i used neat Listerine in it at the recommendation of my female dentist.&lt;br /&gt;Lets just say as a guy getting Listerine on your junk stings like hell.&lt;br /&gt;I put it on charge again but it would not charge up. It never held a charge for very long in the first place.</li>
            <li> To compare with the regular waterflosser with cord, it is just OK level. My teeth are not well arranged and retain food after meal. I bought this after the regular one for travel purpose. At home, I definitely prefer the regular one, which I love very much.</li>
            <li> Simple comments:  1)  Product does look good  2)  Usability is ok.    3)  Doctors dont suggest this as alternative to floss.  3)  Battery Fails after two months of usage.    IN short:  throw this dollars for 3-4 mths of use.  Worth it ?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this all of about two weeks and the battery is already shot. Yes, you have to refill it two to three time to thoroughly clean your mouth and yes it makes enough noise to wake Lazarus. But both those conditions only apply to a UNIT THAT WORKS. Why companies can&#x27;t put together an item like this with components that have semblance of a reasonable life-cycle is beyond me. I am going to call WaterPik and see what they are willing to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want my money back. I do not want another unit so that it fails again (as has been mentioned in other posts) so that my life revolves around working with WaterPik engineering to repeatedly troubleshot their piece of crap. I want my money back. That&#x27;s it, I will withhold payment on my credit card if that&#x27;s what it takes. I am NOT going to pay this much money for something built to last two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Congrats, GarbagePik. Your willingness to cut corners and have a quality control team that would make Yugo&#x27;s look like geniuses has just lost a customer for life.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use at work. I was very disappointed the first time I used it. It was a pain to fill, the head kept turning. I ended up with water everywhere. It&#x27;s more trouble than its worth. It doesn&#x27;t come close to the quality of the counter top Waterpik(which I love). It was a waste of my hard earned money.</li>
            <li> After a few months, the battery gradually began to loose charge capacity and finally did not work at all.  The dealer executed a warranty claim and I just got a new one (not the same model), it is not the rechargeable one, but, I am happy with the solution.  I have been using waterpik products for over ten years, great company, most of their products are five stars.</li>
            <li> This item works as advertised. A little messier than I envisioned but I don&#x27;t think that is a product flaw its just a fact in using a water pic. I guess if it were a little more powerful it would be better.</li>
            <li> I got braces a couple weeks ago but before I did I bought this. I LOVE LOVE LOVE IT. I have only had 3 meals where I could not use it (ate out) and I really missed it. It will be traveling in my purse next time.    I was told by someone that had their Waterpik die and replaced by Waterpik that you MUST keep it plugged in ALL the time to keep the charge good.    I don&#x27;t care if this only lasts a year, I will go out and buy again.    I would NEVER go a day without one, it&#x27;s that good for braces.</li>
            <li> This little device is VERY hard to get used to. Plan on spending a week spraying your bathroom until you get the hang of it. The directions even say you should consider using it in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dentist told me that the effort to use it will absolutely pay off by producing exceptionally healthy, bacteria-free gums. Because of that, I&#x27;m making the effort. If, when I go into my next check up, there is no spectacular results, I&#x27;m tossing it.</li>
            <li> It is a good product, this is my second water pick (cordless) the last one last for 2 years, Is not too bad for 42usd, the problem is the battery, doesn&#x27;t charge any more. but well,, all the electronics are made to fail someday...&lt;br /&gt;I like this water pink is very good to clean your teeth I recommended.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000UWAWQU Waterpik Ultra Cordless Dental Water Jet]]    Very happy to travel with this product!  For everyday use, it does not hold enough water.  It surely does the job when travelling.</li>
            <li> The unit is attractive looking and fits nicely in the hand, but that&#x27;s the end of the good news. I agree with others about the difficulty controlling the head. The big problem, however, is the battery. After my frist unit died at 6 weeks, I contacted the company through their web site. They promptly sent a replacement. It lasted 8 weeks. I&#x27;m currently looking for a different  brand.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommends these things. He sells them too, but encouraged me to buy one elsewhere if they were cheaper. I started using it immediately after my February checkup, going &amp;#34;floss free&amp;#34; then and there. It took just a bit of getting used to, but I liked the way it got under my bridgework and around my one implant. Long story short, my July cleaning went just fine, the hygienist was pleased with the results, the dentist noted that my wisdom teeth, which I&#x27;d always had a hard time keeping clean, were much cleaner than previous visits. This is the Water Pike you want. Lighter, more portable, much less trouble than those clunky reservoir units of old.</li>
            <li> I bought this waterpik about 7 or 8 months ago and was actually very pleased with it until recently.  After using it for a while and finding that it would remove food particles even after a thorough brushing and flossing, I was never comfortable unless I used it every time I brushed.  However, I recently learned that unless you flush it frequently with something like hydrogen peroxide, nasty stuff will grow inside the pump mechanism.  And that nasty stuff will ride right along with the water flushing your teeth and gums.  No thank you.  The outside, the pik itself, and the tank are easy enough to keep clean, but the inside of the pumper is not.  Also, the little plastic tab that holds the tank to the handle also broke after repeated disassembly.  I&#x27;m trying a different one.</li>
            <li> I have had two of the 360 and two of the 450.  The 360 reservoir is a little small but works fine. The 450 is great as the reservoir is larger and charge last longer.  They are good and always extract food particles even after a good brushing. I hate flossing and this solves that problem.  The problem with ALL of them is the loss of ability to recharge. Each time I think this is about 12 months, but I cant be sure.  Waterpik know about the problem as I did research on the web a couple of years/Waterpiks ago.  Also, I did contact Waterpik about this problem last time I bought and they told me I shouldnt let it go flat (like a mobile phone) but to keep it on charger between uses. I now think this was a fob off.  Anyway, they are that good that I am looking to buy another after last stopped charging few days ago.  I will keep this unit and try the Radio Shack fix when I have some time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this waterjet for about 3-4 years. For the first 2-3 years it was great. After I would use it after brushing my teeth, I would spit out a bunch of food that it got out. It was very powerful. When it comes to the noise, it sounds like my electric toothbrush or an electric shaver. The tip did rotate and I would always have to hold it, no big deal though.   Then more recently for several months now, its been leaking water and it keeps getting worse. Even putting hot glue or tape to seal the bottom shut didnt work. I really have to get the water out after everyuse. And its really lost a lot of power since when I first got it. I charge it for days now because even on high power it&#x27;s weak. I&#x27;m thinking these two problems will be resolved and it&#x27;ll last longer if I get the corded one. On the other hand, I really did like this one but its the only one I tried.  I&#x27;m not sure which one I&#x27;ll get next but I really would recommend the Waterpik to everyone.</li>
            <li> Much more comfortable to use than floss. Actually, it&#x27;s a pleasure! Just like giving myself a gum massage. And I have noticed an overall increase in my oral health. I like the tongue-cleaner attachment as well. The unit is easy to use and store, and made well. No complaints so far.</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve been disappointed in a product purchased on amazon. Waterpik usually puts out a good product but this one missed the mark. Cheap plastic body. Wish it had a medium setting. Low doesn&#x27;t seem quite strong enough and high is too much pressure. If I had paid $20 or$25 dollars then it would have been a reasonable product for the price, but $45 is too much.</li>
            <li> Well, all I can say is that when I get it into my head that I want something, there&#x27;s not much that can sway me in the other direction.  So, what I&#x27;m going to say to you is this:  Listen to the reviews.  This product is a complete waste of money.  I already own a HydroFloss Irrigator, a high-end machine with a lot of power which cleans under your gums and is excellent for preventing gum disease.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years but I wanted something portable, a \\&quot;no-muss, no-fuss\\&quot; kind of instrument for when I didn&#x27;t have time for the HydroFloss.  I convinced myself that I wanted this WaterPik product, so I bought it.  Not only did it have absolutely NO power (and, believe me, I know that I charged it properly) but it&#x27;s also messy (water dripping everywhere) and it barely holds enough water to be of any use.  It&#x27;s a complete waste.  As someone else mentioned, you can probably swish water around your mouth and it will have more power than this little machine.  It was a huge disappointment and I feel totally stupid for wasting my money, especially when so many people on this review board said that it was not a good machine.  At any rate, I learned my lesson.  If the majority of reviewers say \\&quot;don&#x27;t get it,\\&quot; I&#x27;m not going to get it!  Buy a HydroFloss -- your gums and your dentist will thank you.</li>
            <li> We purchased a Waterpik Waterflosser in Mar. As of now we can not tell difference between high and low water pressure. It will literally stop if any amount of pressure is put on gums. Very unhappy with quality of unit.</li>
            <li> My dental hygenist recommended this product for both my husband and me because we&#x27;re not the most faithful users of dental floss. We love the cordless waterpik waterflosser and highly recommend it. Our 16 year old is still in braces. He used the flosser and will continue to use it to floss around his braces. Amazon had this product cheaper than Walmart and Bed Bath and Beyond. Great buy!</li>
            <li> I purchased this with some terpidation, since it had so many reviews from people with concerns. It is a good portable solution to an otherwise messy job. It&#x27;s grating noise drove my wife crazy, but did not bother me. I liked the pressure etc and it worked fine for 2.5 months after which the battery just gave up. I went out and bought an electric one which is far superior in performance, sounds better, has better pressure and does not make that noise which seems to grate on my wife&#x27;s nerves. But then she can be a bit hyper sensitive at times. Batteries are not easy to find. If you dont need the portability, i would not recommend it</li>
            <li> I tried a battery operate corded waterpik with a tank and HATED it.   The batteries only lasted a week and the cord was so short I kept spilling the water everywhere.   As a result, it sat in my bathroom closet for nearly three years before I finally tossed it in the trash.  My dentist lectured me several times about the need to use a waterpik and eventually I got tired of the lecture and decided to try a cordless one.      HUGE improvement!!! The charge seems to last 7-10 days with daily use.   I&#x27;m not spilling water everywhere and I find that I actually use the waterpik.  Yes, it&#x27;s a little messy to use, but this is a device that shoots water out, so what do you expect?  The tips are long enough that I can put it in my mouth and sort of seal my lips around it.   The attached tank holds enough water for me to do the top of my mouth.   Then I refill and do the bottom.      The only thing I would change about this is to have a better way to allow the tank to dry.  I don&#x27;t love that moisture gets trapped in there.   I worry about bacteria (or worse mold) growing in there.   I run a bit of diluted listerine through (I use it to disinfect my toothbrush too) before each use.</li>
            <li> Does the job it says it will do! The water reservoir is small but I would rather have that then a bigger unit sitting on the counter!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this Waterpik.  I have used others in the past, but never liked them.  Since this is cordless and the water resevoir is in your hand and not on the counter or back of your sink, you can be more mobile in reaching all teeth and angles without spilling water or making a mess in your bathroom.  Four tips to handle all needs included is a nice bonus.  This unit stays charged for weeks of daily use without recharging.  I&#x27;ve had mine for almost 6 months and I am very pleased.  It is the best one I have ever used.  As a lady with small hands, it did take me a few days to get used to holding it due to the large size of the base, but one you use it a few time, it isn&#x27;t awkward at all.  Sometimes I do refill it for a single use, but only when I am enjoying the gum massage and not just cleaning my teeth.  If the resevoir was larger, it would be too large to be a cordless unit.</li>
            <li> Excellent tool to clean gum line! Yes it makes a difference!</li>
            <li> I wish there were a charge light so I  would know when it is charging and how much of a I have left like I have on my electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband, at his request.  According to him it is easy to use and does a fantastic job of cleaning and rinsing his teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> Easy product to use plently of water force. Also  being a self contained unit not needing a seperate resvoir is the best,</li>
            <li> kind of a pain to use.  runs out of water if you tip it too far to the side</li>
            <li> This really cleans the tiny gaps of your tooth and I use it with the plaque seeker tip. The reservoir does not hold enough water to go thru all my tooth, I will usually need 2 water servings to complete a session.    After continuous nightly usage, the formation of tartar is significantly decreased. I would recommend to visit the dentist to removal any tartar form and use this for maintenance.    The charger should be made compatible worldwide so it would be great for frequent travellers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a user of the counter-top Waterpik, which I love, but this travel doesn&#x27;t do the same job. The water fill is very limited and the pressure isn&#x27;t enough. Sorry I bought it because I really would like to use the Waterpik system when I travel.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly.  Gets food particles that flossing doesn&#x27;t get.  Recommended by my oral surgeon.</li>
            <li> The Waterpik Waterflooser is so useless, so poorly designed, it should not be sold. Its water reservoir empties out in a matter of seconds. The water stream is very weak. And if you tip the unit even slightly while using it (which is inevitable unless you&#x27;re a contortionist), the water flow stops and you get blasted with an ear-piercing high pitched whirring sound. To suggest this product could take the place of old-fashioned flossing is utterly false and is false advertising for Waterpik to make such a claim.  The older, original model Waterpik with the motor and water tank that sits on the counter top works fine and is the one you should buy.</li>
            <li> This product is just perfect. I use it in my office and Wow, I love it. The pressure is Great.</li>
            <li> this unit replaced another handheld made by the same manufacturer.  I am glad I dropped and destroyed the first one.  This model is easy to use, has a better hand grip and a longer lasting battery.</li>
            <li> I like it but the table top has more</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t hold enough water. refill is required to clean your whole mouth. plus, the water pressure isn&#x27;t all that great. it does get food out but i would rather stick w/ my non-cordless.</li>
            <li> This is my first Waterpik and I bought due to braces.  I have had this for several months and have only charged twice. This should last as long as you keep the charge port dry to prevent corrosion. A rubber port cover would have been a bonus.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it a few weeks now and am pretty satisfied. I&#x27;ve had a regular water pik (electric) and was a little concerned at first that the water reservoir was small, but I&#x27;ve adjusted my expectations and I&#x27;m ok with it. I&#x27;ve only had to recharge once so far with almost daily use, so that&#x27;s ok too. As with any irrigator, there is some vibration and noise but it&#x27;s acceptable. I have a pocket in my gum and the dentist suggested mixing water and peroxide in equal parts to reduce inflammation, so this device makes it easy with the fluid levels marked on the side. The only drawback I can see is that the head doesn&#x27;t rotate so I wind up turning the entire device while the head is in my mouth. A little clunky, could be designed better somehow.</li>
            <li> I do not know why the bad reviews.  We have plenty of water in the reservoir.  We use in shower and at sink.  It works great..holds a charge..is easy to use.  It is very comfortable to hold.  I find that the reservoir will be enough for my whole mouth.  If I need more..I just fill it up.  It sure beats having the bulky one on my counter. We can take this on trips because it is so portable.  I have not one bad thing to say about this.  If someone wants to try - ignore all the complainers and try this.  My gums are in better shape and my daughter&#x27;s braces are clean.  I saw the bad reviews..when I was coming on to buy a 2nd one for her to take with her.  We love this product.  It works great.  Anyone with a teen and braces who won&#x27;t floss should try and make their own opinion.</li>
            <li> This product was suggested to me by my dentist because I have a few pockets in my gums.  He said flossing alone would not help very much and to start using the Water Pik.  Besides being a little messy to use, it does work very well.  I flossed my teeth, brushed them with my Braun Oral B toothbrush and then used the Water Pik.  I was surprised at what washed from between my teeth that the floss and brushing did not remove.  I highly suggest this product be used for a much better cleaning of the teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> First of all, the Waterpik is a MUST if you have dental braces, as I do.But even when my braces are removed I will continue to use this product, as it really gives your teeth  a powerful and thorough cleaning before brushing.  Flushes away food particles like nothing else.  You can adjust the water stream between high and low pressure.  I prefer the high, but again, I have braces.  Very reliable, holds a charge a long time, overall great product!  Would not be without it.</li>
            <li> I found that it fit in my mouth awkwardly and did not hold enough water.  It also leaked, was difficult use, and overall a big pain in the ass.  I returned mine.</li>
            <li> I am a previous owner of the lower level model with only one power setting.  It was just not sufficent for my needs.  However, I used it because I had it.  When it finally &amp;#34;died&amp;#34;, I bought this model.  Wow, what a difference!  This is what I needed the first time (actually it was not an option at the time).  I get stuff stuck under my gums and it feels like I need the tooth pulled.  I use this portable unit and &amp;#34;flush a whole meal&amp;#34; out from under my gums and the pain is gone.  I could not be happier with this unit.</li>
            <li> I thoroughly followed the instructions and the equipment was working well after initial charge. But in about a week the batteries were flat and I had to recharge it, but with no result. It does not work: it would work for couple of seconds and then stops. Extremely disappointed!!! I have registered my item on waterpik official site, as recommended. While having problems with batteries I tried to get an advice from the producer but nobody even replied to my email. So do not buy this item if you do not want to throw money away!!!</li>
            <li> This is a rechargable water pick. Although it is a little bulky, it is smaller than my sinktop home pick and fits well in my travel kit. You could use it at home, but I bought mine for travel. It is not quite as powerful, but gets the job done nicely. Has a variety of tips for special needs. It seems to hold a charge pretty well, you have to charge it for several hours before the first use, so if you are planning on traveling with it, I recommend you do that a few days in advance. The water reservoir seems large enough as well. No complaints here.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than I expected for a cordless.  The water pressure is good.  I&#x27;ll see what they say on my next visit to the Dentist.  But so far, very happy with it.  I can travel with his easily.</li>
            <li> I used the traditional waterpik but I moved to an older house that didn&#x27;t have outlets in the bathrooms.  After reading the reviews, I decided to try this one.  In my opinion, unless you travel a lot or don&#x27;t  have outlets in your bathroom, Id go with a corded one.  The biggest reason is that the tank hold more water.  When reading the reviews, one guy said he could fill the tank once and use it for days......that&#x27;s just not so.  I fill it 4 times each time I use it.  Once for top outer, another tank for top inner, then the same on the bottom.  After all, if your going to take the time to use a waterpik, may as well do it right.  Both are pretty noisy and your going to get water all over the place.  I&#x27;m not disappointed with the cordless waterpik.</li>
            <li> I bought this after getting a number of dental crowns. The crowns are very close together, meaning it is quite difficult for me to use floss. This unit comes with a special tip for implants and crowns, so I use that one. The battery lasts for a week before needing recharging. It takes up less space on my counter than a traditional unit. I find that the water reservoir is adequate for one usage, and it takes mere seconds to refill it. It is easy to travel with. I have been very satisfied with this product, and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> The WP450 is far better than the earlier WP360.  We have had 2 WP360s and their life was about 1 year with no apparent possibility of repair.      The redesigned WP450 allows you to fill the tank in an ordinary sink which the WP360 would not due to the height of the fill point.  We have not had the WP450 long enough to assess its longevity.  We would not buy the WP360 at any price.    It might be useful for the mfgr to find a clever, compact way of containing the optional 2 or 3 nozzles.  We misplace them and cannot find them.</li>
            <li> Works well no problems. The article arrived on time</li>
            <li> I have been using the cordless waterpik for about two weeks. It works great, has great pressure. I do have to refill the reservoir once during the process, but it is fast and if the reservoir was any larger it would be difficult to hold. The only down fall to this product is that the plug attachment is metal and in the front where it gets wet every time I use it. To combat the problems others have had with the plug attachment connection diminishing after a couple of months I have purchased very small band aids and place one over the plug attachment area while the product is completely dry to prevent water from entering the attachment. Will comment in a couple of months if it works.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even know where to begin.  Some of the problems are just because its made to be portable.  Of course it doesn&#x27;t hold much water - so, you have to refill it about 4 times.  That is understandable.  The design is horrible though.  The head swivels and turns while you&#x27;re using it making it impossible to direct whre you want the water to go.  You have to hold it upright and of course the water runs out of your mouth and all over the device and your hand, down your arm, etc.  They should make a portable device with a seperate tank with a hose - something similar to the regular full size model, but with a smaller tank, shorter hose, and smaller handle.  It makes no sense to have the head, handle, and tank in one piece - stupid design.</li>
            <li> Very bad. Main problem is the tip won&#x27;t stay fixed, it keeps rotating, so it sprays water everywhere but your teeth. Also when you use the more powerful setting, the tip flies off! If you want an irrigator for your bathroom, get a corded model, or better, one of the OralBreeze products. For travel, the Panasonic is good.</li>
            <li> the appliance does exactly what it should do. Easy to use and store. The low speed is gentle on teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> This item was recommended by my Dental Hygentist; said that it works much better than floss. The handle is bulkier than the tabletop model where the reservoir isn&#x27;t in your hand. I&#x27;ve been using it daily for about a month now and fairly satisfied overall. The rechargable battery holds a good charge and has lasted almost a month; they recommend a weekly recharge for max performance. The reservoir is a bit smaller than I would like and on ocassion, I have to refill before finishing. Now, my wife wants one also; I&#x27;ll be buying the combo pack that includes both a tabletop and this one.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended the WaterPik to me whenI had new crowns put in.  I love how my teeth feel after using it, and my dentist has confirmed that my teeth are doing great!</li>
            <li> I bought this with the recommendation of my dentist. I HATE flossing-I only did it once a day &amp; at my last cleaning the hygenist said if its not better the next visit they will have to do a deeper cleaning. That was enough for me, so I did some research &amp; ended up getting the cordless waterpik. It feels &amp; seems weird not to be using string floss, but I love it.&lt;br /&gt;I use it every night and in the morning in the shower. It has plenty of water-I don&#x27;t have to stop &amp; refill, and so far I hardly ever need to charge it. Even though I have only had it about 2 months, I have had no issues with it so at this point would highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;Good product at a good value. My next check up will be the real deciding factor. For now, no more string floss or other floss like contraptions!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for a year and absolutely loved it.  It is very easy to charge the battery. Once fully charged, the battery lasts for two weeks ( I use it every day). It is effective and works well with diluted listerine.  Although it is recommended to rinse out the system if customer adds listerine to the solution to avoid a shorter product life.  I carried it with me on vacations and it helped to relieve my othodontics problem. Strongly recommend this to people who care about their oral and overall health.</li>
            <li> Finally a cordless version of WaterPik that works well and can be tucked away in a cabinet or drawer.  No need for the big, space-eating version with cord and charger.  Leaves a fresh clean feeling, even after electric toothbrush and traditional flossing.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT!  FAST SHIPPING!  TAKES UP LITTLE SPACE!  CORDLESS ELIMINATES WIRES!  A GREAT ALTERNATIVE OR COMPANION TO FLOSSING.  MY TEETH, GUMS, AND MOUTH GET CLEANER FASTER.  THE NEXT VISIT TO MY DENTAL HYGIENEST SHOULD BE A BREEZE!</li>
            <li> This is a product in desperate, desperate need of a major overhaul.  The fundamental flaw with the product is that the charging receptacle is down at the bottom where it gets soaked with water, all the way back into the recesses of the receptacle.  Needless to say, trying to plug it in to charge it has very bad consequences if you don&#x27;t get all of the water out of that hole, which is hard to do.  My first one (the Plus model) basically fried the battery with green foam pouring out of the charging slot.  The second one got so corroded it stopped charging.  The third one (the Professional model) I&#x27;ve had to treat with kid gloves, which has been very inconvenient and frustrating.  Of course, the time you remember that it needs to be recharged is right after you use it, and getting all of the water out of that hole is near impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, Waterpik doesn&#x27;t seem to have any interest in fixing the problem, as they done nothing but a minor redesign over the course of 6+ years.  I&#x27;ve informed them of the problem repeatedly, and even got them to replace that first one under warranty, but they&#x27;ve done nothing to fix this huge issue.  The changed the shape of the receptacle a little bit a couple of years ago, but that&#x27;s all they&#x27;ve done, and it didn&#x27;t help.  I don&#x27;t understand why they refuse to address this issue.  Better yet, it&#x27;s time for them to transition to inductive charging the way the Philips flossers have.</li>
            <li> Had the same problem with this model as with the previous model: after less than a year of moderate use (4-5 times per week) the battery will not recharge. Whether it&#x27;s the battery or the connector, Waterpik needs to figure out how to fix this problem before I will spend money on another short term Waterpik.</li>
            <li> Have never had a similar product but the hygienist insisted.  I got this model because of limited counter space, but think I would like the one with separate tank better-only having to hold the nozzle.  It takes a while to get used to, lots of spraying the room!  But it&#x27;s doing the job!</li>
            <li> Had a cheaper version of this before and the battery stopped charging.  This one is working well so far and will stay charged for a week at a time.  I use 2x daily but for only about a minute each time.</li>
            <li> Waterpik deserves a five-star rating for two reasons. My main source of delight with the company is that it dealt with my issue quickly, efficiently, and appropriately. My secondary reason for giving it a great rating is that the temporary issue notwithstanding, the product works very well. The release mechanism for the tip to my WP-450 Cordless Plus Water Flosser got stuck. A telephone call to Waterpik was answered promptly, and a friendly agent sent me a new unit. Before discarding the defective unit, I examined it more closely. Removing four accessible screws allowed access to the release mechanism, which then was easy to free. I called and offered to return one of the units, but a generous Waterpik representative informed me that I should keep both units. Both units are now functioning well. Thank you Waterpik!</li>
            <li> This product is not what I expected. It really is not very user friendly. So unfriendly that I hardly ever use it.</li>
            <li> The unit is not very powerful, but is convenient and does the job. The problem I had with mine, is that it stopped working entirely when it was four months old. I&#x27;m going back to the plug-into-the-wall type.</li>
            <li> it is a great product and easy to use. it helps me because I like to use it. It is fun to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this 3 stars (being very liberal here), because it is better to travel with than the regular sized Waterpik that I use every day (which I give a perfect &amp;#34;10&amp;#34;). I am really trying hard to like this one...I think I&#x27;m just spoiled by the full sized Waterpik, but I bought this one to travel with because I have been abusing my full sized by towing it in my travels...the portable just doesn&#x27;t compare.</li>
            <li> I replaced my old portable water pik with this new version.  It is much, much better than the old design. I used it for a week in Hawaii and never even came close to needing a charge. If you&#x27;re looking for a truly portable unit, this is the one.</li>
            <li> unit was supposed  to clear food particles and i was using it after PERIDEX ORAL RINSE instead of home Waterpik WP-100W</li>
            <li> I bought my first waterflosser in August this year. It worked fine and then suddenly stopped working at all! I returned it to Bed Bath &amp; Beyond and exchanged it for another one. This one works fine, but now has mold inside the reservoir because it is impossible to completely empty it of water.&lt;br /&gt;Poor design. Will not buy another!</li>
            <li> i hate flossing and have all of my teeth, so I needed something to clean behind my wisdom teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I previously had another model that was the bucket and chord style. I thought this would be more convenient, but now it just collects dust.&lt;br /&gt;The base is too bulky and difficult to get back behind my wisdom teeth. The container runs out of water too quickly and I have to refill once or twice.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this unless you&#x27;re using it on a T-Rex or someone with an exceptionally large mouth.</li>
            <li> Hate traditional flossing -- so this is a SUPER alternative. Recommended by my dentist since he knows I won&#x27;t floss as I should and as my gums are telling me that I must.  I wish the reservoir was a little larger as I generally refill before I am finished. BUT the product does a great job.  Is easy to use and reasonably priced.  I have recommended it to others.</li>
            <li> Unless some misguided portability in a water-flosser is strangely important to you, pass on this.  Go for the table model! I DON&#x27;T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING THRU MY MIND WHEN I BOUGHT THIS !?...werks OK, lotsa fluid on yer hand &amp; the machine.</li>
            <li> I want to get a cordless model for travel. Does it come with a transformer that will work in different countries, e.g. 120V, 220V?</li>
            <li> I like the portability of the unit but the tank is small and requires two refills to complete the flossing. Also the pressure button shows two speeds but only one works. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s high or low speed. Perhaps one of the other users can enlighten me as I am probably \\&quot;gagdet challenged\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> The other reviews have accurated stated that it takes a little effort to get comfortable with using this item.  Once, you catch-on, it works very well.  I am pleased with the purchase and recommend the unit.</li>
            <li> I have use waterpik for years.I really like it a lot! I used to use regular floss all the time, but this product can clean even better. I travel a lot that&#x27;s why i decided to buy it</li>
            <li> I loved the idea about it being cordless but not this one. I&#x27;m here to find another one. It&#x27;s messy. It doesn&#x27;t keep a charge well. The spray is very weak.</li>
            <li> I bought this waterflosser and have been very pleased with it and had a very good dental check up since using it. For a 70 year old to be told her teeth look like a 30 year old&#x27;s is quite a compliment. I would not be without it. Thanks Amazon and Waterpik!</li>
            <li> It works great as advertized and it shipped quick even with free shipping! I got it in time for Christmas too!</li>
            <li> The jet is powerful enough to clean between teeth and massage the gums. I noticed an improvement with my teeth and gums within one week. The only drawback I found is that the setting of the pick turns too easily and away from the direction one intends. If that gets fixed then it&#x27;s five stars.</li>
            <li> For a year now I&#x27;ve been using the [[ASIN:B0019D30M2 Waterpik Personal Dental System]].  It&#x27;s does the job but is noisy and cheesy looking, so I thought I&#x27;d treat myself to a nicer version and picked this one out.    First, let me say that this unit does what a Waterpik should do: clean between the teeth and under the gums, especially with gingivitis.  But here&#x27;s why this unit&#x27;s going back to the local retailer, assuming they&#x27;ll accept the return:    * The small reservoir wouldn&#x27;t be such a pain if I didn&#x27;t have to mix mouthwash with the water, which means handling the thing with wet and slippery hands two or three times a session while blue liquid is dripping down my chin onto my shirt.       * It&#x27;s awkward to hold.  It wouldn&#x27;t be so bad if the ring that turns the jet were easy to get to.  My countertop version has a ring on the top of the small handheld assembly so I can keep a finger on it while holding the assembly.  I&#x27;d need gigantic hands to do that with this one, especially when the reservoir is full.    * There&#x27;s no convenient way to store any of the attachments, even the one you prefer.  The only solution is to leave the attachment plugged in.  If this is really meant to be portable, I&#x27;d expect at least a ventilated travel container for the attachments.    * The reservoir&#x27;s filling hole is too small to do anything more than rinse it out, and even in a dry climate it doesn&#x27;t dry out between uses.  Therefore I&#x27;d feel compelled to disinfect it at least once a week to prevent bacteria from growing.  Who needs that?    Bottom line:  It&#x27;s better than nothing and portable.  If I traveled a lot I&#x27;d consider keeping it.  But I don&#x27;t, so I&#x27;m going to see if I can find a new corded version that&#x27;s maybe a little more sturdy than my old unit.</li>
            <li> I used the Waterpik Ultra Cordless Dental Water Jet for about 5 days. During those 5 days I found this product to be outstanding.  I do not believe that this unit suffers from many of the problems that other reviewers have mentioned, especially if you keep in mind that this is a cordless travel model. At the highest pressure the tip did not move unless I accidentally brushed the tip against my gum or tooth. The water reservoir holds just about the right amount of water for a quick cleaning and refilling it is quite easy if you need a more thorough one. Ergonomically it easily fit into my hand and I have small hands. It never leaked and most importantly my teeth and gums felt really clean afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The big problem - and it&#x27;s a deal breaker - is the battery and the concomitant lack of customer service from Waterpik dealing with this problem. I initially charged this unit for a full 24 hours prior to first use (Waterpik suggests 16 hours). Using it twice a day with one full water reservoir each time it lasted 5 days. After that time the battery would not hold a charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not doubt that this unit is defective and that others may not be experiencing the same problem. However, after reading the reviews, I have come to the conclusion that this product line has a defect with its battery - both in the longevity of the battery and its ability to recharge. Read the reviews and see how many people mention some kind of battery problem.  I have attempted to contact Waterpik on several occassions regarding the battery via email and telephone and still have not received a reply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the potential of this specific unit, especially for travel, but with its likely battery problems and total lack of customer support, I would not recommend buying it.</li>
            <li> It does take some getting used to. I am feeling some improvement in how the gums feel and it becomes easier to use rather quickly.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended I buy a water pik since I have difficulty with dental floss catching and shredding under bridgework. Once I even had to have her remove the tangled floss with dental equipment. So I purchased this model as it said it is best for bridgework and implants. I have 9 implants and nearly all my teeth are bridged  I discovered that this waterpik has 4 piks, one intended just for that purpose. I now use it whenever I feel I have something stuck in my teeth, like berry pits. Takes just a few seconds to wash them out. The included instructions are simple and easy to understand. I travel frequently and take a current converter with me anyway, so re-charging should be no problem.I just wish I had discovered this thing years ago.</li>
            <li> this is not the best thing and not a regular flosser substitute although did more bleeding on fastest setting. I do not exactly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned Waterpiks for many years. With two bridges in my mouth, they are essential to good oral hygiene. Recently my older Waterpik Ultra had its hose break necessitating a replacement. I made the mistake in thinking that this Cordless Plus unit would fit the bill after reading one particularly convincing 5-star review. What I discovered was that the objections many of the one-star reviewers had given the Cordless Plus were in fact legitimate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To begin with the reservoir is exceedingly small. Don&#x27;t let the 5-star reviewer fool you on this very important factor. The reservoir will need to be refilled at least once if not twice to get through what I would consider a \\&quot;normal\\&quot; cleaning cycle. And refilling this thing with its tiny opening is a messy operation so expect water spillage everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, the unit lacks power even on the intense setting. It has two settings: low and intense. The low setting is pretty much worthless and the intense as I&#x27;ve already stated is more a setting of \\&quot;4\\&quot; on my older Waterpik Ultra. If you&#x27;re expecting to dislodge food particles beneath braces and bridges with this unit, you&#x27;re going to be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit \\&quot;is\\&quot; reasonably comfortable to hold albeit it is awkward to keep it upright so that the water can be pumped into the nozzle. Furthermore, the twisting ring around the base of the nozzle which can be manipulated to direct the stream of water is nigh to impossible to operate with  the hand holding the waterpik necessitating the use of the other hand. In short - it&#x27;s awkward at best. In addition as you are irrigating your mouth be prepared for everything to come down over the waterpik and into the sink, leaving the waterpik in need of a wiping down after use. It simply is not as elegant an operation as the Waterpik Ultra.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what \\&quot;does it have\\&quot; to merit two stars? Portability (to an extent... it&#x27;s still big and bulky but not as bulky as the Ultra) and a slightly small footprint on the counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are serious about wanting to remove debris and bacteria from your mouth in as efficient a manner as possible, the only \\&quot;real\\&quot; option is the Waterpik Ultra. I sent the Cordless back today and ordered a new Waterpik Ultra. My gut feeling tells me that most will do the same.n the counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are serious about wanting to remove debris and bacteria from your mouth in as efficient a manner as possible, the only \\&quot;real\\&quot; option is the Waterpik Ultra. I sent the Cordless back today and ordered a new Waterpik Ultra. My gut feeling tells me that most will do the same.</li>
            <li> Great flosser, lots of power but it makes one heck of a mess. I&#x27;m still trying to figure out the optimal angle for the head. It would be nice if it came with either a sample of all the heads available or if you could choose which heads would be included in the package.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long-time user of Waterpik products, and I&#x27;ve always been well-pleased with the quality and functionality of their products. When it was time to purchase a replacement for my Ultra Water Flosser WP-100W, I purchased the Waterflosser Cordless PLUS. Big mistake! I regret not giving enough credence to the other reviews. In short, this unit is expensive, poorly designed, clunky, difficult to hold, and gives inefficient cleaning as compared to the WP-100W. In addition, it&#x27;s downright ugly. I&#x27;ve never before written a review on a product, but this product is so bad that my best recommendation is not to purchase it. The makers of Waterpik products would do well to admit their mistake in introducing this unit and withdraw it from the marketplace. If you want a great Waterpik product that does a great job, try the Ultra Water Flosser model WP-100W (which costs only about $5 more than the PLUS).[[ASIN:B000GLRREU Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser]]</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the reviews that said the reservoir is too small or that complained about it not holding a charge long enough.  I&#x27;ve had this for a few months now.  When I first used it I&#x27;d never really used a water pik &amp; it took a while to figure out the best way to go about it...back then I used about 1 1/4 tanks per session.  Now it takes me 1/2-3/4 of a tank to not be spitting debris any longer... the rest I just use as a gum simulator.  It charges beautifully and I only need to re-charge about once every 4-6 weeks.  I do only use it once a day, but even at 2x a day that&#x27;s not very often to need to charge it</li>
            <li> I found this hand-held unit awkward to hold and use, as well as messy to fill (at least twice for each use). But see my rave review for the Waterpik Ultra corded model. Best thing about the cordless unit, to me, was Amazon&#x27;s excellent return policy.</li>
            <li> I used the ultra corded model for over a year before moving to a college dorm, which didn&#x27;t have outlets in the bathroom. This cordless model is a bit more difficult to control due to the size (as opposed to the small easy to handle corded models), the tip tends to swivel much too easily (easier than the corded models) so it is sometimes hard to keep in position to spray properly, the pressure is okay for somebody who has sensitive gums, which waterpiks are great for, but I doubt the high setting on this are more than a 5 or 6 on the ultra model (which goes up to 10.) Part of this is because of the limited water supply so I understand from a design standpoint.    To put it simply if you have any space and an open outlet, use the waterpik ultra corded model, I&#x27;m going to buy another one of those as soon as I move.</li>
            <li> My teeth have never been cleaner.... My breath never fresher.... My dental hygienist never happier.  I should have bought one long ago.  Great price.  No issues.</li>
            <li> It is a very good product and performs well with a long life after charging, Important for traveling so you can leave the charger home. Drawbacks for me is the limited water volume it holds though I guess that could be explained as keeping the bulk down.&lt;br /&gt;The switches are a minor problem too. The high/low switch is particularly awkward since it doesn&#x27;t have a good &#x27;click&#x27; when it engages.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that this is an excellent product I would highly recommend. It sure does its job well.</li>
            <li> I ordered this waterpik and was not so sure about it since it is cordless.  No worries about that after receiving and using it.  It keeps a charge for several days and is so convenient to use as it is nice enough to leave sitting out on the vanity.  You may have to fill the waterpik twice but that is not an issue as you just lay it sideways and put it under the bathroom faucet.  I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> For several years my dentist has been encouraging me to use a Waterpik since I have a receding gum line and pockets around several crowns. I&#x27;ve tried to use a conventional Waterpik but I have found it frustrating and awkward to use. We have little counter space in our bathroom so it&#x27;s difficult to find a place to rest the base. I just feel it is poorly designed. So I stick with using it for a few weeks then give up. My wife is in the same boat.  I&#x27;ve had this new cordless Waterpik for several weeks and I am extremely happy with it. It takes up very little room on the counter. It is very easy and comfortable to use. I find the water reservoir is the perfect size. It holds just the right amount of water for me to clean all my teeth. It is a significant improvement to have the entire unit built into the handle. It is much easier to control the stream of water and keep it from spraying all over the bathroom. Because this unit is so easy to use, I now use it daily as my dentist recommends. I recently took it with me on a business trip which also went off without a hitch. Whatever other design problems Waterpik has had in the past, I think they have solved them with this model. If your dentist recommends that you use a Waterpik, this is the one to buy. I can&#x27;t say anything about its durability since I&#x27;ve only had it for about a month. But given the value I am getting out of it, I won&#x27;t mind replacing it if and when it breaks. It is an excellent appliance.</li>
            <li> Very nice product. it is recommended by dentists and it also helps a lot with the teeth cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks waterpik</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this Waterpik ultra cordless Dental cleaner.  I charged it for the 16 hours and tested the water pressure.  It started leaking from the bottom of the reservoir bottle.  I made sure that the front of the unit was properly closed.  I made sure that the reservoir was pushed in all the way.  It still leaked.  I was going to call the company and see what they could do, but after reading some of these reviews, I will be returning it to the store I purchased it.  I never actually used it.  I just tested the strenght of the water pressure and noticed the leaking right away.  I am dissapointed, so I will be taking it back.</li>
            <li> Not very effective, by the time you actually start flossing, the water supply is empty and you have to keep refilling every few seconds.</li>
            <li> Great, amazing to see what toothbrush misses</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t recommend this product. In fact, I want to advise potential buyers against it. The Waterpik was recommended to me by my dentist. I bought this model and it broke beyond repair after using it about a month. Supposedly, there&#x27;s a money back guarantee. I tried but it was so complicated I never got a penny. Thinking maybe I got a bum pik I bought a second one. This one broke in even less time. I was unable to get my money back for this one either. Another product was recommended to me, the Hydrofloss. They are available on amazon and that&#x27;s where I got it. This model was over $100 and I was wary about spending that much with the bad experience I had with the Waterpiks but I gave it a gamble. It was worth the considerably larger expenditure. I have had it over a year and it works beautifully. I have never had any trouble with it. The Hydrofloss is much larger than the Pik, so it takes up more room on the vanity, and it has a cord. Nonetheless, I&#x27;m happy with it and can recommend it with confidence. I think the Waterpik is a flimsy device. Pay the extra money and get something that lasts.</li>
            <li> Worked well until it wouldn&#x27;t charge anymore. Since it has a very short warranty, a year I believe, I had to buy a new one. It annoyed me but I feel I need it. Customer service informed me that the WP-100 unit without a battery has a longer warranty specifically for that reason.</li>
            <li> It works like it is suppose to. This product was recommended by my dentist. Easy to use, I like that I can take in the shower and not mess up my bathroom mirror.</li>
            <li> I wish they held the battery longer</li>
            <li> What, exactly, is the purpose of this product? What does it do except flushing water into your mouth? No offense, but I can put some water on my mouth with my hand and then do the rest on my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I like the water flosser I just feel that the water tank should be redesigned in order to have just a little bit more of capacity.</li>
            <li> Works well to clean the gums but it is awkward to change the spray to get the inner side of the teeth and gums.  I previously had an electric model that was a little more powerful but I like this better- easier to store.</li>
            <li> It is a handy device, but lacking pressure. It was delivered with an American Power Supply, which was not possible to use on Australians 240Volts. The Australian Waterpik branch, of course did not want to sell me an Australian Power Supply, so I had to build one.</li>
            <li> I work offshore and needed something that i could throw in my locker after each use. I have the bigger one for my house that stays plugged in. the battery last forever on this one. My only complaint is that it runs out of water quickly. so you either have to fill it back up after you do one side of your mouth or be REALLY fast at getting your whole mouth done. other than that, im satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Not sure what others know about it not having enough water , if you use a smaller tip it seems im never ger rid of all the water  it last and last !</li>
            <li> I like the tool as it does the job.&lt;br /&gt;I found out it is much more comfortable once I use warm water.&lt;br /&gt;I am not sur it can fully exchange the floss but it is a good change.&lt;br /&gt;If the floss or the small brushes make the gums sore sometime the waterpik clams it.</li>
            <li> After using the Waterflosser several times I really am happen with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I reason in a short amount of time</li>
            <li> Too much pressure for me, even in the lowest setting.  I decided to stop using it after a while.</li>
            <li> I have been delighted with this product and it was a real life saver while undergoing a stem cell transplant which forbade electric toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it requires recharging far too often and, if you want full speed operation, even more often.&lt;br /&gt;A YEAR LATER: battery life extremely short, only 4 or 5 sessions per charge and none of them at full speed. Such a shame!</li>
            <li> It works but it is a bit clumsy. I think I would prefer the larger one with a separate reservoir.</li>
            <li> Though the time is given, this waterpik is a short-lived glory; the water runs out quickly, and the pressure isn&#x27;t as hard as I was used to with a plug-in type. Still, it looks cool and is cordless...</li>
            <li> Though this appliance is very good when it works, I am sending this one back because like it&#x27;s predecessor, it quit within a year of buying it.</li>
            <li> Runs out of water too fast.  Battey doesn&#x27;t last long before you have to recharge.  Bulkyto and uncomfortable hold and use.  I replaced it with the Ultrs Water&lt;br /&gt;flosser and was very happy.</li>
            <li> Poor quality - Stopped holding a charge in less than 3 months.  Now won&#x27;t charge at all.  very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> I got braces put on a month ago and trying to floss is a long painful process..&lt;br /&gt;My orthodontist recomended I get the waterpik water flosser.&lt;br /&gt;My teeth were so sore the first few weeks and the water flosser actually made them feel a bit better :-))&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product to anyone with it without braces. I will continue to use one long after my braces are removed!!</li>
            <li> The WaterPik 450 is a great supplement to my home WaterPik.  Ideal for travel use - compact and rechargeable.</li>
            <li> I did not return it.  Though I thought about it.  It only holds a little water BUT I can use it in the shower no problem.  So because of that Im keeping it.  Its pretty powerful.  In most places where my gums a healthy it does not hurt on HI power.  But in places that are sensetive it can hurt a little.  Over all I think my gums have become more healthy which is good.  It comes with a few diffrent heads.  I do not care for any of them expcet the orginal one.</li>
            <li> I had the larger waterpik previously, which lasted me 5 years.  I bought this unit because it takes less space on my small vanity.  It is powerful enough for me, but I never used the larger unit above the third setting anyway.  This unit only has two settings.  It is a little more cumbersome when you are doing the backside of the teeth but I quickly got the hang of it.  This smaller unit will be nice for traveling.  I usually fill the unit up twice with water for each cleaning.  A charge lasts quite awhile, probably about 1 1/2 weeks.</li>
            <li> When I first tried this item, it did not seem that it was working that well since I expected the power of the water stream to be more pronounced.  I would barely feel the water stream hitting my teeth, but then I noticed that several food particles would come out, even after doing a regular floss.  This is very thorough, and painless.  When the unit is fully charged, it will last for at least a week without having to plug it back in.  On the other hand, the water tank only holds enough water for one single use.  If you fill it with warm water rather than cold water, then the streams feel even gentler.  This did come with several types of nozzles (one even had 3 streams which I did not see as being useful), but I only find use for the regular single stream nozzle; all the others can be discarded.  I still keep some floss pics around for quick jobs after certain meals, but at least that string floss can be thrown out (I really hated that stuff).</li>
            <li> I like the manufacturer, but this product was a joke.  Water splashing everywhere, and you have to refill the water about 4-6 times to get your whole mouth clean.  Not a good product!</li>
            <li> I just enjoyed having this tool in the airport and wherever I had to be at. The only inconvenience, is that the tank seems to be a bit smaller for me. But hey - it&#x27;s a traveler toy. I got the other one at home which does the triple work.</li>
            <li> The item does the job, but the battery life is very bad, it goes out and stops working properly after the 2nd month, would not recomend this product.</li>
            <li> For once, flossing is fun.  The first couple of times you may want to use this in the shower until you get used to it.  It&#x27;s like a pressure washer for your gum and it takes a little getting used to.  After a few times you can use it comfortably at the sink.  I use this along with a sonicare toothbrush and it is AMAZING to see the pieces of food that the waterpik removes right after I brush.  The next time you use it, pull the plunger in your sink and look for yourself.  It really is amazing what is left even after you brush with a toothbrush or a sonicare tooth brush.</li>
            <li> Love this.  Had a full size waterpik but this cordless one so convenient.  Much easier to use, which means I use it more often.</li>
            <li> I have never used a Water Pik of any kind before buying this product.  I have crooked teeth and am constantly getting food caught that needs to be flossed out.  I bought this \\&quot;water flosser\\&quot; with some skepticism -- I kind of doubted that it would be able to get the trapped food particles out from between my crooked teeth as well as string floss does.  Immediately after using the Water Pik Waterflosser Cordless Plus for the first time, I used string floss to see if anything had been missed, and surprise -- nothing was missed!  I now use the Water Pik exclusively, and save the string floss for when I&#x27;m going out for lunch or something like that.  It is true that I have to refill the water reservoir once or twice during each use, but it&#x27;s so easy to fill that I don&#x27;t consider that a problem -- takes just a couple seconds.  I am planning to get braces later this month, and I had been concerned about how to floss my teeth through the braces with string floss.  Now, I&#x27;ll just be able to use the Water Pik with its special orthodontic tip (which comes with this model, along with several other tips).  I was also hoping this item would be small enough to take along for travel.  Although it ideally could be a little smaller for that use, I will definitely find room to take it along when I travel -- obviously, if it were smaller, the water reservoir would have to be refilled more often, so there is that trade-off.  One thing to note:  The NiMH batter in this model cannot be replaced, so if it dies after the 2-year warranty expires, you will need to replace the entire unit.  To extend the battery life for as long as possible, the user manual recommends keeping the unit plugged in for charging ALL the time EXCEPT during use.  I will do this to extend the life of my battery, but if it still dies after 2 years, I will gladly buy another unit.  At a price of about $40, it&#x27;s well worth $20 per year.</li>
            <li> I read a few of the negative reviews and wondered if I&#x27;m using the same product.    I bought this about 2 months ago and have used it daily.  It never ceases to amaze me what comes out after brushing thoroughly and I actually make sure my sink is spotless so I can see the results.    I have none of the problems mentioned in other emails.  The charge holds for a long time.  I easily go a week between charges and do it only as a precaution.  The head doesn&#x27;t move at all.  I don&#x27;t need to turn the thing upside down as fully upright and moving my head, I am able to angle it to hit everywhere.  By the time I have gone over my teeth and gums thoroughly the water tank finally dries out so I have more than ample water in the tank. Before I got thisthis, my gums would sometimes bleed when I brushed.  Now it never happens.  Because my bathroom is small and there&#x27;s no storage room on the sink, I love the cordless model.  I love this so much that I am buying one for my daughter with braces.  ~~~ Updated much later.  It quit on me one day, less than a year after purchase.  Just wouldn&#x27;t charge.  Don&#x27;t know what happened but dead.  Replaced it with a corded waterpik and a new shelf next to the sink.  So the ratings were lowered from 5 stars to 3 .</li>
            <li> the product lasted 1 use. looks like the battery was dead and wouldn&#x27;t charge&lt;br /&gt; I would go with a different brand</li>
            <li> Love it, great only for travelling only when used with Hydrogen Peroxide not so good when used with water because I do not get a real clean feeling using water as I do with the larger capcity corded musti-speed Waterflosser.</li>
            <li> Very handy, easy to use.  No excuse why everyone shouldn&#x27;t own one and use it at least once a day.  Amazing what even the sonicare toothbrush can mess.</li>
            <li> The flosser is a little clumsy to use and is a bit bulky sitting on the counter but that said.....it works great and does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I love my waterpik flosser…I have bought one for my 3 daughters and a few friends. My dentist told me last week that my gums look so healthy! I said, &amp;#34;I know why, you encouraged me to buy this waterpik!&amp;#34; I am addicted to it now, I use it twice a day!</li>
            <li> Purchased this item to replace my previous one.  I agree with the other reviewers that this version does not provide the same amount of power as the previous one.  Thus, I am giving it an &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; rating.  In my research I was not able to find another product that seemed any better than this one which is why I ended up purchasing it.  Not sure why they changed what previously was a very good product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product on the advice of a dentist and could really prove that it works. The powerful water jet cleans below the gumline, between teeth where dental floss can not reach. After the cleaning leaves fresh breath. Even without the use of mouthwash. Also recommended for those who have dental prothesis, braces and crowns. Using a tongue cleaner included, oral healht is ensured. Buy it, you&#x27;ll like!!!</li>
            <li> I found this handy portable water pic just great for my needs,  I took it on vacation with me instead of my counter top model-takes up less space and it&#x27;s lighter too.  The water reservoir is smaller but you can just fill it up twice.  The pressure was just fine for me.</li>
            <li> OK, I didn&#x27;t read all the reviews, but here&#x27;s my take on this unit.  The unit works fine for what it was designed to do--no complaints there.  However, the big downside for me on this unit is the lack of a battery charge indicator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why is the battery charge indicator SO IMPORTANT!  Because once you have discharged the batteries all the way down, which at some point everyone is going to do, you have just signed the death warrant of this unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nature of virtually all types of rechargeable batteries (in particular any lithium polymer battery, but also nicad&#x27;s, and nimh&#x27;s) is once you have taken the batteries down past 20% of there capacity you have immediately shortened their lifespan and limited there capacity to hold a full charge.  Every time you do this you degrade the battery that much more.  Once is all it takes and your batteries are on the way to the trash can.  And since you can&#x27;t replace the batteries in the unit, the whole thing is going into the trash.  It&#x27;s not going to happen right away, but the batteries will never be the same afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is critical, if you want this unit to last, to recharge it regularly and attempt to NEVER allow it to discharge all the way to where the unit stops working!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waterpik could solve this issue easily in one of two ways.  1) put a charge indicator on the side of the unit, or better yet, 2) put rechargeable and REPLACEABLE AA-size nihm&#x27;s or nicad&#x27;s in the unit.  That way we all wouldn&#x27;t have to throw the baby out with the bath water when we inadvertently over discharge the batteries.  We could just order new batteries and replace them and not have to buy a new unit, which is what my wife and I have to do about every year or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gee, I wonder why Waterpik didn&#x27;t do this in the first place?  He said sarcastically.</li>
            <li> I love this thing. One of the best things I&#x27;ve ever bought. I&#x27;ve had major problems with gingivitis that developed suddenly. The waterpik cleans my teeth much better than a brush and floss can. Takes care of the problem completely. I find this model has plenty of power and lasts long enough to get a single clean out of the water reservoir. The battery lasts a good week before needing a recharge, which I do overnight, and its ready for action the next day. I can&#x27;t fault this product. I&#x27;ll be buying another one when I wear this one out.</li>
            <li> Great product!  My dentist loves me since I started using this!</li>
            <li> Performs flawlessly. My dentist&#x27;s lab tech said I needed something more than brushing, and she knew I had trouble flossing due to my permanent bridges. This Water Pik is perfect.</li>
            <li> My first unit lasted about a year and a half then it developed the battery issue. I purchased the second unit and only after a few months, the same symptom appeared on the new unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to one of the other reviews, I looked at the connector at the bottom of the unit and sure enough, one of the prong had water corrosion. Soaked it in the vinegar for a few minutes and it&#x27;s started the chemical process and slowly dissolved the mineral deposits.  I saw a shinning connector after a few minutes. I cleaned it well and charged it overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it&#x27;s good again. Now I&#x27;m covering up the hole with tape during normal usage and only charging it when it&#x27;s going low.</li>
            <li> The Water Flosser worked well for a few weeks, and then the battery began to fail.  Now, about 3 months after I bought it, even if I charge it all night, it only runs for about 5 seconds before stopping.  I should have paid more attention to the reviews - some people warned against this.  I gave up and got a Panasonic with AA batteries - so far it is working just as well.&lt;br /&gt;Save your money!  I&#x27;m disappointed that WaterPik continues to sell this piece of junk</li>
            <li> Bad:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not portable.&lt;br /&gt;Has to be connected all the time to the electric.&lt;br /&gt;Bacteria builds up in the water chamber.&lt;br /&gt;Spout keeps rotating as you use it making it difficult to hold in place.&lt;br /&gt;Water chamber is too small.&lt;br /&gt;Water from your mouth keeps falling on the unit as you use it thus creating a mess not to mention a dirty enviroment.&lt;br /&gt;Unit can&#x27;t be submerge in water.&lt;br /&gt;Cumbersome device that should be avoided.&lt;br /&gt;Not user friendly as far as ergonomic design.&lt;br /&gt;The water jet is very week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wonder what sort of 5th rate engineer would design this horrendous product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good:&lt;br /&gt;You will feel relieved when you finally throw it out.&lt;br /&gt;The product looks like it works well.</li>
            <li> This is a piece of junk.  No pressure and no water capacity.  WaterPick should be embarrassed!</li>
            <li> I love the waterpik and use it daily.  It&#x27;s great for my teeth and gums.  Dentist recommended my use of this product.</li>
            <li> This is a portable water pik which sounds like a great idea, the problem is that it does not hold enough water to even begin to be effective. It is also bulky and loud. I think you would need to stop and refill this 2-3 times to be of any use and that is not really easy to do.</li>
            <li> $52 at the local Walgreen&#x27;s. I took it back the very next day. Plenty of other posts detail the device&#x27;s shortcomings. The engineering was abysmal and WaterPik evidently decided it was better to try and unload it in the marketplace and embarrass itself, than to suck it up, work out the bugs, and roll out an adequate model. I first used WaterPik as a teenager when I had braces. But there is a vastly superior system that was designed by a French dentist, Dr. Woog. Don&#x27;t laugh. It has 5 jet streams instead of WaterPik&#x27;s 1. It&#x27;s what WaterPik would evolve into if they really cared about quality. The &#x27;Woog Periosystem&#x27; went out of business 20(?) years ago but somebody purchased the patent and still makes them. On to the internet search engine.</li>
            <li> They never last too long...but this one worked better and longer than the one I had previously.</li>
            <li> As long as this is charged up, it has a good force to clean near implants or spacing between tooth.</li>
            <li> I have used a traditional electric Waterpik for decades.  It is sometimes the only way I can dislodge food stuck between my teeth, and my dental hygienist always comments that my teeth and gums are in great shape.  But they changed the design of the traditional Waterpik and I wasn&#x27;t completely happy with the new design, so when the tube on my (very) old one sprung a leak, I decided to try this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have an electrical outlet inside my medicine cabinet, so I can charge it out of sight.  It is nice that it can be used away from an electrical outlet; once I even used it to clean a spot in my toilet, holding it several feet away, of course (it did exactly what I wanted it to do!).  But it lacks the real power that my old piks had, which made me feel the old pik was really doing the job.  Still, it does seem to clean the debris from between my teeth; we&#x27;ll see what the hygienist&#x27;s verdict is in a couple of months.  One reviewer commented that this pik is too powerful, even on &amp;#34;low&amp;#34;; I can&#x27;t imagine!  Maybe mine or maybe that reviewer&#x27;s pik is defective?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do NOT like the fact that water runs down the pik and into the charging portal; there seems to be no way to hold it to avoid this.  Someone else suggested covering the portal with tape, which I have done, but it&#x27;s something of an inconvenience.  Still, at least the contacts have stayed clean, but it does seem that Waterpik could design a waterproof way to close the portal when it&#x27;s not in use, or even a sealed arrangement with inductive charging.  Whatever, the old electric pik was easier to control, just a tiny attachment on a long tube, easy to aim and didn&#x27;t tend to send water down my arm and onto my pajama&#x27;s arm like this cordless one does.  This cordless is comparatively awkward to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would be a nice travel Waterpik, as it is one piece plus charging cord, but it is somewhat larger than my very old battery-operated Panasonic Travel Oral Irrigator, which is not rechargeable but is similar in effectiveness to this cordless Waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this cordless pik for several months.  I use it every night and charge it about once a week, for about 24 hours, and it has never yet run out of power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I think I&#x27;ll buy a traditional electric Waterpik next time.</li>
            <li> Perfect!&lt;br /&gt;Waterpik si essential, And cordless optimises&lt;br /&gt;Once You try it you realise how much you needed And how all your mouth higene changes for better</li>
            <li> I loved this Waterflosser at first.  It was small and powerful. Left my mouth feeling clean and healthy.  However, after about a months use it started acting like it was dying.  It would rev up then act like it was under a load.  It finally stopped all together.  I tried charging it but it made no difference.  A waste of money.</li>
            <li> wish didn&#x27;t have use it in shower to excessive w/water and mouth ,does job but don&#x27;t want water all over,so use in shower,wish container all bits,&amp; cleanser container,</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my old travel waterpik.  It has more water capacity, but the force is less than my old one, and the battery runs out too quickly to keep from carrying the charger for even a very short trip.  The water container is hard to drain completely.  I don&#x27;t see it as an improvement over the old one.</li>
            <li> Handier than reservoir model makes you use it on a daily basis.  A little messy until you get used to it but worth it.</li>
            <li> I really like the Waterpik Waterflosser.  The cordless option is very handy, and it does hold a charge for a long while.  My only complaint is that the recommended flossing time according to the instructions is two minutes, however the water reservoir only holds enough water for a shorter amount of time. I do feel I get an adequate cleaning with the water/time allotted.  It did take a couple tries to get the right momentum with the water flossing process, but now it is a very important step in my oral hygiene.</li>
            <li> I have to  say that it is extremely messy to use this waterpik.  Very disappointed in the power and overall performance.</li>
            <li> I also have the Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser which I love. I bought this for travel. Only 2 speeds and the bulky size makes it difficult to use. Also, unable to drain all the water from it after use.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace my other Waterpic who&#x27;s battery totally died and wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is the exact same thing as I had. It holds a charge for about a week and a half of using it 1-2 times a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works great!</li>
            <li> Good thing is its much lighter than the non portable version. The bad thing is the tank is a bit small so you may have to fill it twice. I wish they made this in 220V so it can be used in international countries. But im happy overall.</li>
            <li> It actually took out the gunk between my teeth, just like what flossing would do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There seems to be a whole debate about whether this is good enough to replace flossing. Personally, I think it could do just that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It exerts a good deal of pressure so you have to be careful where you aim it as it could potentially damage your gums if improperly used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Settings are set to either high or low. Nothing in between but seems good enough. There&#x27;s 4 nozzles that you can use, each seems to have their own pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m quite amazed as it actually took out some of the nasty stuff that I usually have to use a brush, floss and sometimes Q-tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wish I had this device when I was still wearing braces a few years ago. It would have saved me a lot of headache and frustrations.</li>
            <li> Great product at great price, Fast shipping . Thank you.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he loved how it works.  unfortunately it leaks all over the counter.  Sending back</li>
            <li> well, its the best one of its kind.  i use it with some listerine and its almost like going to the dentist</li>
            <li> A previous dentist informed us that we both required &amp;#34;deep cleaning&amp;#34; every (3) months due to &amp;#34;excessive pockets in our gum lines&amp;#34;.  Coincidentally, the price for &amp;#34;deep cleaning&amp;#34; was identical as the charge for a semi-annual cleaning.  When I checked with our dental insurance provider, they informed me that there &amp;#34;no existing codes for &#x27;deep cleaning&amp;#34;, just for periodic cleaning&amp;#34;. Our (new) dentist recommended that we both start using a WaterPik and Sonicare electric toothbrushes due to &amp;#34;issues&amp;#34; with our gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We started using the &amp;#34;standard&amp;#34; sink-top WaterPik and Sonicare electric toothbrushes approximately 8 years ago. Since then, both of us were told that our 4-6 mm &amp;#34;pockets, are now in the 0-2 mm size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased a WaterFloserCoodless for a gift for my wife because she wanted to take it with when she travelled. My error was not looking at one in a store to verify &amp;#34;compactness&amp;#34; and ease of packing...before actually purchasing the item.  The WaterFlosser is HUGE, and certainly not an option for travelling. My wife opened the box, took a look inside (did not even take it out of the box) and told me to return the item. I am unable to rate the performance because she refused to try the WaterFlosser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the question appears to be... unless you anticipate walking around the house while using this WaterFlosser, why bother with this item, instead of using the &amp;#34;standard&amp;#34; sink-top WaterPik.</li>
            <li> Hydrofloss makes a more powerful, larger resevoir unit but has issues during trips (parts break).  This brand is not as powerful in its flow and has a small resevoir but will do ok and is easy to pack for travel.</li>
            <li> I have used the Waterpik model WP-360 for about 6 months. I have been unhappy with it from day one. The small reservoir needs to be refilled several times to do an adequate job. The spray itself is underpowered and the battery degraded early on not holding a charge. It is sitting in my recycle bin awaiting a new fate. Stick with a full size water pick, not necessarily Waterpik brand.</li>
            <li> I find that I have to refill the tank 2 times for a good cleaning. Takes too much time with all the refilling.</li>
            <li> In the distant past I used a corded waterpik, but eventually gave it up - not finding it useful.  Recently, a dentist told me about this product.  It&#x27;s exceptional - easy to use and does the job.   For those who don&#x27;t or can&#x27;t floss well, this product is great.</li>
            <li> Bought the Water Pik 450 to help in cleaning my braces.  Thought the cordless/battery version would be easier to use.  Worked well for a month or two, and then had continual problems with keeping a charge on it.  I cleaned the contacts on the unit, but nothing worked.  Took back to the store and exchanged for another one, and had the exact same problem with the second one.  Finally had my fill; I threw it out and bought a corded-type waterpik which works fine.    I would be embarassed to sell this worthless piece of $#@&amp;.  If you are Bill Gates and replace every appliance you have every few weeks, go ahead and buy it.  Otherwise, save your money and get a corded type.</li>
            <li> I love my new Waterpik! What a great product. Even after brushing and flossing the waterpik manages to clean more stuff out of my teeth. I use it everyday now.</li>
            <li> Many complaints about the battery not accepting a charge after 3-4 months. Tilt the unit in the sink in a position that you can pour a few drops of white vinegar in the little hole where the two copper contact prongs are. Let soak for about 15 minutes then drain. With your breath, blow out the remaining vinegar and let the unit dry. Then recharge as usual. I learned this trick with my 20-year-old Mr. Coffee coffee pot. Our South Florida water is terrible and clogs my coffee pot. I run white vinegar through and then three more times with clear water and the unit is good as new. I did something similar with the waterpik. I believe the whole point of having a cordless waterpik is to use it in the shower, because using it at the sink is so messy. I don&#x27;t know if waterpik had this in mind when designing the cordless version. So, if others like me use the unit in the shower, the copper points are going to corrode like terminals on a car battery. Vinegar eats away the corrosion. On another note, my dentist suggested running hydrogen-peroxide through the waterpik and after finishing, let the unit run a cycle of clear water through it. I do all this while in the shower. I guess it may eventually clog but after 8 months, it still works fine. I&#x27;ll just run white vinegar through it if it starts to clog. Other than that, I love the product. My dentist is thrilled with my checkups.</li>
            <li> I had the old WP-360 for a few years, and I bought this to replace it. I cleaned up my bathroom, and not knowing what the charger was in my cleaning frenzy (because I really didn&#x27;t use it often) I accidentally threw it out. I realized this a few weeks later the it was completely discharged. So, I bought this model. It has worked great for the few months I&#x27;ve had it so far. It seems a bit more powerful than the previous model, and  I started using it on the low setting. Initially, the high setting on this made my gums bleed quite a bit. I just bumped it back to high setting. A few areas are still bleeding, but this should stop soon.   I also recently returned to the dentist after 7 years of avoiding due to severe  phobia. After the report I got from the dentist, I will have a waterpik for the rest of my life. I was told that my gums looked good, and required no treatment. I went to a dental school, and the supervisor who came to check after the student dentist measured the pockets around my teeth actually asked if this was a 6 month followup. I don&#x27;t floss regularly. Sometimes I do for few weeks, more often I don&#x27;t.   The only issue, and it&#x27;s not that big a deal, is that I do have to refill it once or twice in order to get around all the surfaces... and I only recently learned I was supposed to go around the back.</li>
            <li> Luckily my dentist warned me that these things were messy, otherwise I would have been completely shocked. Although I was still pretty shocked even with the warning. I stood in front of the bathroom mirror while &amp;#34;flossing&amp;#34; and it sprayed water everywhere - all over the mirror, all over the vanity and all over me! And yes, I had the sprayer in my mouth the whole time, but the back-splash made a huge mess! Other than that, I can&#x27;t complain - it seemed to work just fine. It took 2 reservoirs of water to get the job done - used 1 reservoir for the top and 1 for the bottom. Maybe as I get more used to it, it may go a little faster and I might not use as much water though. I don&#x27;t have gum disease or anything like that. I was just looking for an alternative to regular flossing because my mouth is small and it is hard for me to floss. Only time will tell if this actually works as well as regular floss for inbetween the teeth. I have a feeling it will do fine for the gum line, but not sure water pressure alone is good enough for inbetween teeth.</li>
            <li> This item is not as good as the older model that I replaced. It does not seem to have enough power to flush out food from between teeth.</li>
            <li> The product worked great and suddenly stopped after 6-months; the battery no longer holds a charge.&lt;br /&gt;I pulled the unit apart; the battery is buried and the connections are soldered on and not intended to be changed.&lt;br /&gt;The NiMH (Nickel Metal Hydrid Battery) can be overcharged; may be what happened to mine.&lt;br /&gt;This product would have been a home if it contained a lithium battery.</li>
            <li> The Waterpic does fine and lasts about 10 days using it twice a day.  It is more noisy than I expected.  Filling the tank is a little awkward because you have to lay the pic flat in the sink.  It doesn&#x27;t hold quite enough water for me and I have to refill when I am 3/4 done.      Overall it is a good thing though.</li>
            <li> Works great&lt;br /&gt;charge lasts for a month and it is waterproof.&lt;br /&gt;Bring it right in the shower and fill it up every morning.&lt;br /&gt;Use hot water so you don&#x27;t get that shock you get from the wench at the dentist who gets a kick out of zapping my gumline with ice cold water!!!!</li>
            <li> I have the larger waterpik that holds more water and works great at home. But this one is good to take with you for short trips since it is cordless.</li>
            <li> I have bought both Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser (WP-100) and Waterpik Cordless Plus Water Flosser (WP-450). The former is used for the family, the portable one is used in the trip.I have used them for a month.They both work well.It feels so good that my mouth and teeth are cleaned. I will recommend them to my friends.</li>
            <li> I liked this product overall even though it was bulky but it did a good job. I gave it such a poor rate because after only 9 months it no longer keeps a charge. I used it twice a day. The last three months I had to charge it ever other day and now it does not hold a charge for one complete use.</li>
            <li> Works great and helps to get food stuck in between my teeth out. The problems are that the battery only lasts for 1 or 2 cleanings and it can get messy if you don&#x27;t close your mouth enough over the sink. Needs to be charged everyday if you use it daily, I use only a few days a week.</li>
            <li> ... it&#x27;s a little too bulky to fit into a toiletries bag.  Water flow is not as strong as the corded model but probably adequate for most people who travel.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for daily use - corded models are more effective.  .</li>
            <li> Cleans the pieces of chicken and stuff between the teeth much faster than wooden picks, and that&#x27;s what I bought it for. This product DOES NOT replace a floss, make sure you realize that before buying. It&#x27;s a pick only. Unfortunately, the battery life is terrible, it has to be recharged after 2-3 uses. If I had a spare power outlet, I would keep this thing plugged permanently.</li>
            <li> I bought the Waterflosser for my husband. He likes it very much. He is pleased that I bought it for him.</li>
            <li> It provides a strong jet of water even on low pressure setting which I use. Feels good at the gum line. I find it to be far superior to flossing with string... more efficient, comfortable and quicker.  Sometimes I need to fill the water reservoir a second time I am having such a good time.  Versatile with 4 tips supplied, travel ready, and charge lasts a week for me.  Use after brushing and see what you missed with this oral hygiene confidence builder.</li>
            <li> Because of their inherent convenience and ease of use, I am a big fan of battery-powered oral irrigators and have had several of Waterpik&#x27;s older WP-360W model. I also have a Panasonic EW1270AC which I reserve for travel because of it&#x27;s tiny reservoir and compact size. Those WP-360s suffered from weak batteries and unreliable electronics so I went through several of them and was initially happy to see Waterpik introducing a new-improved, and more costly WP-450 \\&quot;Ultra\\&quot;. Unfortunately, there is nothing improved about the WP-450 and it is merely an \\&quot;Ultra-disappointment\\&quot;.    Pros:   -Some reviewers have observed better battery life, I was unable to confirm this.    Cons:   -Expensive, Poor Value: Price is ~70% higher than the WP-360  -Poor Reservoir Capacity -only 120 ml or 20% less than the already-tiny WP-360&#x27;s 150 ml  -Terrible portability, large/inefficient size, ungainly ergonomics  -Weak water stream.    In short, the Waterpik Ultra WP-450 is less (performance) for more (money). Two thumbs waaay down.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!!!  Use it everyday and it has helped my gums so much that my dentist is impressed. Try it . Would love to see a portable one that you could have at work.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and thought: How bad can this be? Well here we go:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It is so loud it will wake anyone sleeping. Coffee grinder loud!&lt;br /&gt;2. The reservoir is so small it runs out in 10 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;3. The tip is so mobile (rotates all over the place), you can&#x27;t control it.&lt;br /&gt;4. It is poorly designed, too large, and difficult to hold (Can&#x27;t imagine if you have small hands).&lt;br /&gt;5. Poor battery life, long charge time, no charge indicator. After two uses I needed to recharge! (yes I let it charge up initially for 16 hours!).&lt;br /&gt;6. Waste of time to purchase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to Amazon for this little doggie...  (actually, that is being unkind to small dogs!!!).</li>
            <li> The water pick worked great for my son with braces.  Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> This thing really works very well.  My teeth and gums feel better already.  Recharging is very quick and the jet power is more than adequate for my needs.</li>
            <li> The rechargability makes this an improvement over its predecessor, and I don&#x27;t even mind that the reservoir is so small, it runs out of water all the time -- if it had higher capacity, it would be too big to hold.  What I hate, as another reviewer mentioned, is that the tip rotates so loosely that you can&#x27;t control the stream.  So the problem areas in the back of my mouth -- for which my dentist recommended a Waterpik -- aren&#x27;t being cleaned.  The result is a big mess, and consequently the applicance sits unused in my medicine cabinet most of the time.</li>
            <li> Heavy and does not clean well at all.</li>
            <li> Great wonderful for travel&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a really good product it&#x27;s amazing how well it removed bits of food&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t be without one</li>
            <li> I love my new Waterpik Waterflosser Cordless PLUS&lt;br /&gt;It goes quickly, cleans thoroughly and easier than flossing.&lt;br /&gt;It does need weekly charging, which I found out when I forgot and it lost charge within 3 days after the necessary weekly charge.</li>
            <li> Cost so much less than getting it through the Brick and mortar store.  I paid about $20 to $30 less on Amazon than I would have paid depending on which store I would have had to go to to purchase (Target, Kohls).</li>
            <li> it holds a charge all week.  is powerful enough to do the job.  easy to take with you on vacation and trips.</li>
            <li> Have been using this daily for almost a year... hasn&#x27;t lost strength, water power, etc. What else can I say?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;v had two of these devices and both reservoirs leak water.  This would be a great product if they didn&#x27;t leak - terrible engineering design.</li>
            <li> I use a Wagterpik at home but will be traveling for several months by RV and decided not to bring the big unit.  Thought I would try a smaller battery powered unit.  Compared the Panasonic and the Waterpik and finally decided to go with the souped up Waterpik.  WRONG.  Really disappointed.  Even with a full charge and on high pressure it won&#x27;t penetrate gums or between teeth.  Any comparison between this and the home unit it limited to the brand name.  Also, it takes at least to reflls to do the mouth.  I don&#x27;t mind the reflls but I do mind it not cleaning my mouth.  I don&#x27;t know if the Panasonic is better but I know now that this is not up to the job.  Will probably order the Panasonic and keep my fingers crossed.</li>
            <li> Braces makes flossing really difficult. This Waterpik eliminated 90% of the buildup around the braces and my son had his best ortho appointment ever after using this product. I highly recommend it for anyone with braces.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product with some apprehension due to other reviews.  Concerns included water capacity, noise, nozzle security.  Went ahead and purchased and have been pleasantly surprised.  The unit works well, nozzle turning can easily be controlled.  Pleased with product for the price. Much more convenient than the old countertop model that took up so much space and made much more noise.</li>
            <li> well i&#x27;ve been using my waterpik for over a month and love it. no complaints on it. the true test will be when i go to my dentist for my quarterly cleaning as I&#x27;ve had lots of gum problems, etc and this was recommended! the charge on my unit lasts for a week and I just plug it in every monday and it last the whole week. hopefully it&#x27;ll last for a year and if so, for less than a dollar a week, i&#x27;m happy with it! saw a few comments on pick turning around too much but I can close my mouth around it for a few seconds and then just spit out the water with no problem and love it vs flossing.</li>
            <li> This water pik flosser works fantastically and cleans my teeth.  I use daily and enjoy the gum massage while cleaning my teeth, at first it tickled my gums terribly until I adjusted to it and then it was great.</li>
            <li> This appliance makes such a big difference in our oral health that I wouldn&#x27;t be without one!  Just wish that it stayed charged longer!</li>
            <li> The product itself works great, but the downside of it is that the water reservoir is to damn small, and has to be refilled several times before it actually gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Performs as advertized.  Does a good job and holds a charge so daily recharging is not necessary.  Easy to fill, holds plenty of water.  The tip has a tendency to move but can be kept in the desired direction with no problem. Excellent for travel although it is of a good size.</li>
            <li> Waterpik Ultra Cordless Dental Water Jet.  I believe that the control mechanism that controls the amount of fluid to the waterpik needs to be to adjusted.  Even on low, the amount of fluid squirting through the jet is to much. The pump needs to be slowed down even at low speed so the pik   tip can be brought closer to the top of the gum line. This rapid action emptys the reservoir to quickly even on low speed.</li>
            <li> This product works great, I just wish I used it more often.  Only complaint I have about it is that it is kind of bulky</li>
            <li> The charger stopped accepting a charge after a couple of months and you cannot get at the rechargeable battery because it is hard sealed in the body.</li>
            <li> No qualms with delivery and receipt of item. However, being waterpik users for many years when ours gave up the ghost finally, thought this would be a great replacement. Cordless (great-no longer knocking over soap canister, toothbrush holder, toothpaste and other sink clutter), easier to fill (no, not really), possibly less messy when you insert or remove from your mouth? (Nope! Still makes a mess of the mirror and/or sink). Easier to put away after use? Split decision because there&#x27;s no storage for extra heads in or near the unit. Invariably somebody else&#x27;s head is in the unit when you want to use it...petty? Maybe, but it was so easy to stick it in the old unit&#x27;s closed storage area when you inverted the top. You will have to figure that out for yourself, whatever works for you. Most importantly for us, it&#x27;s not as soft-to-powerful on the settings, especially if you like the gum stimulating workouts that keep my dentist happy with the condition of our healthy gums. Does not do as good a job and removing debris between teeth either (in our opinion). We will use it, but if it doesn&#x27;t hold up (and I personally hope it does not) will not buy the same model again.</li>
            <li> I recently had a dental bridge and the Waterpik Waterflosser is so qreat to use for flossing. I use it every day before brushing.</li>
            <li> It is easier for me than using dental floss - and much faster to use. It seems to do at least as good of a job as floss - and perhaps better as I just had a dental cleaning and I was told I no longer had to have a cleaning every 4 months - but was moved to a 6 month schedule (So the Waterpik paid for itself with that good news!!!)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(For me - dental floss goes like this - I pull out a long piece and wrap it around my fingers and start flossing - then the string breaks (is cut by my sharp teeth) - then I have to &amp;#34;re-wrap&amp;#34; - now my hands are slippy and the string loosens on my fingers and slips - more string - more breaks - soon the fingers must be dried to keep the string from slipping - then it breaks again and I unwind the whole slippery mess from my fingers and dump it and give - up)! No more floss for me (I also save the cost of floss)!</li>
            <li> I have gone through two of these in the past year, the first had the bettery stop charging.  The company was kind enough to replace it for free, the second time I needed a new cord because the original didnt charge the thing.  really annoying and although the company will replace for free you just go through them too quickly</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really good product. Found it easy to use, and not too clunky. The price was more than fair.</li>
            <li> This pik is a perfect size.  I have found the reservoir quite ample.  I bought this because I was going through chemo and needed to put extra focus on my dental health.  Now I wouldn&#x27;t be without it.  This was my first water pik so I can&#x27;t compare it to the larger varieties - but for me it is perfect.</li>
            <li> Hi&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I too read all the reviews and thought it was interesting that there was such polar disparity in the reviews.  I went ahead,ordered one and gave it a whirl and used it twice today for the first time.  I have also a conventional waterpik and not too crazy about that big thing on my bathroom counter.  I found that on the slow speed, it was just enough to do my mouth all around fairly slow.  I used water with a bit of mouth wash.  My mouth feels refreshed and very clean.  I have had gum grafting and the food tends to get stuck int the gaps and recession areas.  This cleans those areas wonderfully.  I don&#x27;t have problem dealing with the noise and I do like not being attached to that cord.  If someone really wants to use it for a long time though, they should stick with the original model.  I like this one better for my purposes.  yes, the on off is a little awkward, but since I use all the water anyway it is not that big a deal versus the convenience.</li>
            <li> The idea of waterfloss is great and it works!!! The design is ergonomic and it is not as loud as people write here...  I bought WaterPick Ultra and Cordless last october. One is for home use and cordless is for travelling. I really like to travel, but...  1. This waterfloss is useless during travel. Went to Europe - couldn&#x27;t use, went to Australia and NZ couldn&#x27;t use... MOST OF THE WORLD use 220V current(Europe,Africa,Asia,Australia,NZ,Brazil,Chile,Argentina....)! Only USA, Canada and some central america&#x27;s countries use 110V. In my opinion portable items must be capable to work everywhere, like you cellphone, laptop, e-razor else advantages of portability are vanishing.  2. When I started to use it I thought that flosser was weak, so I called to customer service for exchange and guess what?! They told me that it suppose to be pluged-in at all time between usage, cause the battery is not strong. Excuse me?? It is for sure wrong! I recon that is why there is no energy indicator, cause it has to be pluged in all the time.  Recap: Well, Waterpick cordless is quite handy and you do not depend on cord (I have to say that Ultra has very very short cord) and it is good to use at home (if you don&#x27;t mind something pluged-in in your bathroom always), but do NOT buy it for travelling....</li>
            <li> The battery charge doesnt last and the cord is kinda small in length so you have to use it while its plugged in which is dangerous because of the product design. The electrical inlet and the water chamber are very close and water from flossing runs very close to the inlet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The chamber is very small and does not contain enough water for a complete floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine broke down in 3 months but I had moved overseas so could not even get it repaired.</li>
            <li> very good product, price a bit high</li>
            <li> Very happy with this type of unit.  Have had it for a few months and doing well.  Hope it lasts. Just sounds like its working pretty hard to delivery its good pressure.</li>
            <li> Like this product. Holds charge long time. No electrical cord to get in your way! Performs as described. Good product.</li>
            <li> Worked as advertised, easy to use and clean, but does not hold a charge for very long. Needs daily charging</li>
            <li> I just bought this product and love it very much. I am not used to floss my teeth, and this product make flossing much easier and efficient. I love it.</li>
            <li> I have braces and have a very hard time flossing the regular way. This makes flossing so much easier!!! It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for over a year and it has made a significant difference in my oral care.  I was starting to develop &#x27;pockets&#x27; in my gums - which resolved after a couple of months using the Waterflosser.  After a year - the battery doesn&#x27;t charge as well as it did - before I could use it for several days before recharging, but now need to charge nightly. No big deal - but I&#x27;m guessing that means I&#x27;ll be getting a new one soon.</li>
            <li> my husband &amp; I both have one &amp; use it every night before bed. makes your teeth feel so clean. easy to use, its worth the money.</li>
            <li> Loved the product when I got, however it broke within two months of purchase.  Can&#x27;t be returned or be replaced due to over the time of replacement.  Would not recommend unit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d wanted a waterpik for some time, but didn&#x27;t have an electrical outlet close to the sink.  This cordless model works fine.  It doesn&#x27;t have as many settings as the full sized one, but is way better than not having it.  It holds a charge through several uses.  It is functional, not decorative.</li>
            <li> Daughter&#x27;s teeth are finally clean!  After years struggling to get her to floss, there is a solution.  She loves using this, and does so every day.  Dentist will be proud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compact design makes it convenient even in smaller bathrooms.  Price was good.  Quality seems good so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a recommended item.</li>
            <li> owned one before and like the way it removes small food particles that dental floss doesn&#x27;t get.&lt;br /&gt;Makes mouth feel cleaner.</li>
            <li> too low for the pressure for the water jet</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000UWAWQU Waterpik Ultra Cordless Dental Water Jet]]  I have to agree with Burkhard. The tip moves so easily its impossible to keep the deep cleaning \\&quot;Pik Pocket\\&quot; tip pressed against the gumline to get the deep cleaning it was designed to give. Also, the on/off button should be turn off automatically when released. Trying to control the tip position, hold your head over and down in the sink, tilt the body so the fluid is around the intake tube and slide the on/off button to the position desired is fairly challenging. Plus the on button moves so easily I keep accidentally touching it when removing the tip from my mouth or getting ready to use it and spraying mouthwash in my face, on my shirt or across the room! :-) I finally wrapped a rubber band between the tip holder and the body so it wouldn&#x27;t move without some effort and another over the on/off button and around the body pulling it down toward the off position so it shuts off when I stop pushing on it. All that and the small resevoir make it just too awkward for my taste. I&#x27;ll stick with the wand type thank you. They have they&#x27;re problems too but for me a lot less.</li>
            <li> I echo the comments in previous reviews, and add the question:  did anyone in management at Waterpik try this thing before they decided to sell it?  The poor design is awful.  It defeats the user. Waterpik should be embarrassed.    Two problems say it all.  As someone else commented, the head swivels uncontrollably in your mouth, making it impossible to control the angle of the water when it hits your teeth, which is after all the purpose of using the waterpik.    Second, as also noted, the reservoir is small.  After you are done wrestling with the swiveling head, the water runs out -- it&#x27;s like an I Love Lucy comedy.    I actually like the Waterpik concept, and own a larger unit. However, I have had problems with poor quality.  The first one I bought didn&#x27;t work and needed to be returned.  I also bought the earlier travel version, which seems to be no longer made, and it worked well but fell apart after about 3 weeks of use.  Now this.  It&#x27;s hard to imagine a competitor hasn&#x27;t emerged and offered a well thought out, quality alternative.</li>
            <li> I have used it for two weeks. Now I have decided to throw it away. This is one of the worst dental products I have tried. Here are the problems I have.    1. The tip keeps popping out if I set the power to high. I tried both the regular tip and the tip for pockets. Both of them have the same problem. So I don&#x27;t bother to buy a new tip.  2. The tip vibrates a lot that I cannot position it to the gum line. The whole idea is to get the water to the gumline. But it vibrates so much that it won&#x27;t do the job right.  3. Tip rotates on the contact of anything. By design, there is a dial to rotate the tip. But it can be easily rotated by slightly turning it. So once the tip is in your mouth, it changes the direction easily.  4. Smaill reservoir: The water reservoir is very small. It was designed that way to be portable. Unfortunately it is simply too small. I have to fill water four times to cover the whole mouth.  5. There is no charging light. With all the problems above, I actually don&#x27;t care too much on this.    The whole idea of water jet is even doubtable. I used this for two weeks without using proxabrushes for my perio problems. My gum started bleeding again. I would classify this as a piece of junk. I may use it as water gun for my kids. But again the water reservoir is too small...</li>
            <li> The water flossers are getting better with each one coming out....larger water container and the pressure is great...also the charge lasts longer!!!</li>
            <li> I had owned the large tank Waterpik, I loved what it did to my teeth but the machine was an eyesore, and a pain to clean out.  This one is really easy to use, easy to rinse out. You can use medication for your Gums to the tank. It is rechargeable, and fits into a travel bag.</li>
            <li> I bought this by recommendation from my dentist but i moved too quickly and got the wrong one.  This is s portable one and the reservoir drains of water too quickly.  I find that i have to tell it at least twice while cleaning my teeth.  There is a different one with a larger reservoir and it has more speed options available.  Definitely look into that one before making a purchase</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used both a Water Pik brand \\&quot;oral irrigator\\&quot; and then, after that died, an Interplak unit.  Both of these were the standard counter-top type with a reservoir on top and the nozzle/handle connected by a small hose.  They both worked great, but died after a few years of steady use.  Not really that bad of life for such a gadget, I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to replace the last one to die, so I visited a couple of well-known department stores in my town.  The first one didn&#x27;t have what I was looking for, so I tried the other one, and it didn&#x27;t have what I really wanted either.  So, thinking it might work OK anyhow, I settled for one of these Water Pik Watterflosser cordless plus hand-held rechargeable units.  It seems kind of odd that nobody around here carries any of the standard countertop units right now. (Of course, Amazon does, and I now have one of the standard countertop units on order).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cordless unit has turned out to be extremely disappointing. I charged it for 24 hours prior to the first use, just as instructed. I then filled it and gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed was that it really was very loud.  My wife commented on it immediately.  So you&#x27;d never be able to get away with using it while someone else in the house was trying to sleep.  It did a good job of terrifying the cats, too.  ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next thing I noticed was that, try as I might, there was no way to get all of the desired angles without causing the unit to suck air because the reservoir, naturally, must move with the handle.  Since the unit can only suck up water when it&#x27;s being held more or less vertically, that seriously restricts the possible aim angles of the nozzle.  Unless you can stand on your head in the sink, it&#x27;s quite a drawback.  Just try getting the backs of your lower teeth with it.  Not very easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, I should have realized this obvious drawback before buying such a design, but for whatever reason, I figured that theymight have worked things out to let it pull water out of the reservoir with it in a number of different orientations.  But I freely admit that I can&#x27;t think of how such a system could be worked out without some complex system of automatically-operated valves or the like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The third drawback was the extremely short time that it runs before needing to be refilled.  I was using it on high (because the low setting was so \\&quot;limp\\&quot; as to be useless) and the reservoir proved to yield only enough run-time to get me about 1/4 of the way finished with the job.  It might run longer on the low setting, but, again, that&#x27;d be completely useless.  I can swish water around my mouth with more force than the low setting generates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I&#x27;ve just been spoiled by the way the two \\&quot;countertop\\&quot; style units I&#x27;ve had before operated.  Both had FAR more power (needing to be set well below their highest settings for my use), ran for about five to ten times as long on a filling, and allowed me to easily and successfully direct the stream at every point where gums meet tooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, I should have realized that an \\&quot;all in one\\&quot; style unit simply could not work the way I wanted it to, but I guess I simply didn&#x27;t think it through and imagined that it&#x27;d work well since it was being sold as a viable product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took it back to the retailer where I got it, and they gave me my money back, no questions asked, even though I told them that there was no \\&quot;defect\\&quot; in the unit, only that it simply did not do what I needed it to do.  So Kudos to that national chain for their returns policy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad thing is that Water Pik may never know why it was returned.  They&#x27;ll probably figure some bonehead didn&#x27;t know how to charge it or fill it or something like that.  But seriously:  They really ought to try using this thing before even going into production.  If all I wanted to do was spray the fronts of my teeth with it very briefly, I can see how it&#x27;d accomplishthat.  But if someone wants to get the backs of their bottom teeth, I&#x27;d love to see how that works.  I guess you could tip your head to the side one way for one half, then to the other for the other half, but it&#x27;s really a pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nope.  My assessment is that it&#x27;s too loud, too weak, runs out of water way too fast, and is difficult to manipulate to get all of the \\&quot;targets\\&quot; without it sucking air.  As attractive as the whole cordless concept may be, the fact is that a standard base unit with a generous reservoir and a small, easy-to-aim handpiece connected by a small hose turns out to be the best design in my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who like this unit.  That&#x27;s great.  I hope it works well for you for many years.  But if you&#x27;re considering it, and are either used to the table-top version or have never tried any of these units, my advice is to stay (or start) with the countertop style that&#x27;s been tried and proven for years.</li>
            <li> When I say it really works, I have proof.  I used it for about two weeks and could tell a difference in how my teeth felt.  My teeth are generally very close together so I can only use Glide floss, but I also have pockets that collect food in the back plus my gums usually would bleed every time I flossed regardless of how gentle I was.  What I wanted to find out was if my dental hygienist could see a difference.  I have had the same person for over 20 years, so she knows my teeth and would be a good judge.  After the two weeks of using it, I went to my 6-month checkup and didn&#x27;t say anything at first.  I could tell in the first few seconds that her scraping was minimal.  She paused after about 15 seconds, looked at the chart, started scraping for about 10 more seconds, stopped and asked if I was using a different tooth brush or flossed more often.  I asked why, and she said that there was very little plaque and my gums looked much healthier.  I told her about this device, and she was amazed.  I also just got back from vacation for a week and did not bring it with me, and I could tell that my teeth were not as clean.  I&#x27;m a believer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had no problems with it holding a charge.  I charge it once a month and it really doesn&#x27;t need it even then.  The one tip I can give is to use it in the shower since water does go everywhere.  I simply fill it up when I am running the water before my shower and use it at the end after I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> I have had this for a year now.&lt;br /&gt;Pros-&lt;br /&gt;Can go anywhere, small, good power.&lt;br /&gt;Swivel head is useful&lt;br /&gt;Compartment detaches for cleaning if needed.&lt;br /&gt;Cons-&lt;br /&gt;The battery barely makes 2 weeks, not that impressive.&lt;br /&gt;The water fill hatch sometimes pops open in mid use.  You have to really make sure the o-ring catches well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is just a design flaw but the high and low sometimes work. But other than that. I like it.</li>
            <li> It is easy to manage and does not take up too much space. It lasts for 1 week before it needs to be recharged.</li>
            <li> I had this flosser for a year before I dropped it.  I went to Target and bought the slightly cheaper version (only one speed, smaller reservoir, doesn&#x27;t hold a charge more than 2 days) and realized how great this version is.  I am now ordering two!  One for travel and one to always stay at home.  I have extensive dental work (all my life) and this is the only flosser that helps me keep my over $100K of investment viable.  love love love this thing.</li>
            <li> Never used a waterpik before and thought it would be a little smaller.  Works good though and price was good.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful flosser for those who just can&#x27;t deal with the string type floss. It&#x27;s powerful and really gets everything out from between your teeth. I have terrible arthritis in my fingers and hands and this makes it so much easier to get your teeth clean. I just can&#x27;t hold the floss string or even those holders with a piece of floss on a plastic end. I used to have the old type waterpik that had the tank of water you had to fill. This is SO much easier. It takes a little practice. The first time I used it I gave myself a facial and washed the mirror down. Then I got the hang of it. I highly recommend it to anyone because flossing really is important and this makes it not so much of a chore. The tank for the water is right there on the flosser. It feels great after using it too because you can really notice the difference of how clean your teeth are compared to just brushing. I highly recommend this item. A+++++ all the way!</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my mother she has a full size one by this company and swears by it so she had asked for a travel size one. She says it doesn&#x27;t have as much power as the full size but is perfect for what she needs.</li>
            <li> after many years of the other model and use i recently upgraded to this one and really like it so far! its a TAD bigger and i liked the slim design of theone i had previously, im sure ill get over it (O:&lt;br /&gt;also its alot more powerful than the 360 and holds just enough more water to make it a one-run through for me. ilove that i can put peroxide in the mix and use to clean below the gumline. these products are wonderful! its so enjoyable to be alive and get to use all this great stuff!</li>
            <li> I needed something for travel and this unit does a nice job.  I prefer the 110V counter unit over this because it holds more water and has more settings but, this does a very nice job and doesn&#x27;t take up much space.</li>
            <li> This Waterpik removes &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; that gets in between your teeth w/ ease. Recommended by dentists.  Highly recommend w/ flossing for your daily routine ...</li>
            <li> I have been using these cordless waterpiks for years. Always had problems keeping them charged. So far this one seems to hold a charge for longer than my older ones.  It is really too soon to tell if it will continue to chatrge, but the charger is configured differently so I hold out hope. I do not like the shape of the new one, it is much harder to pack it to use on trips. I have started just leaving it home when I am on overnight stays. Will still take it for longer trips.</li>
            <li> muy buen produto excelente forma de empaque y sin ningun tipo de problemas con el envio hasta la fecha no he tenido problemas con el producto</li>
            <li> For the 5 days that I used this product, it was great, I can feel that the tartar is being flushed away from my teeth. The bummer was that it stopped charging after 3 charges. I&#x27;m repurchasing because of how clean it got my teeth but if the same thing happens then I&#x27;m giving up.</li>
            <li> This is the best Water Pik cordless and eay to use, light to handle. I&#x27;m enjoying the new tips that come with it.</li>
            <li> I really like it!  It works well, it&#x27;s easy to use, and it does the job.  Glad I found it.</li>
            <li> This thing lasted 2 months and stopped working. This is the 2nd one that stopped running after only several months use. Pump motor is not able to spray the water - but runs fine when empty! Not very useful.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, gets teetch flossed, easy to disassemble and to charge. Highly recommend&lt;br /&gt;using this product for good hygiene.</li>
            <li> This product is bulls***.  I used it for two months.  It worked great, but it will no longer re-charge.  The place where you plug the cord to recharge it is exposed and I&#x27;m assuming water got into the area and corroded it.  I spent $50 to use this stupid thing for 2 months.  What a waste. Waterpik should design this product with a protected plug area since it is impossible to keep it dry when in use.</li>
            <li> After 2 .5 years the  battery gave out. Because how itwas listed when you put Waterpik into the search boox, a different irrigator is snuggled in below the waterpiks and says its the NEW AND IMPROVED version MISLEADING one to believe it is also by waterpik. I fell for it and after ordering it was dissatisfied. I chatted with Amazon and they said they would send me a new waterpk on SAME DAY SERVICE at their expense for the confusion. I am so pleased with my ointeractions with AMAZON on EVERY LEVEL (been with them for 3 years now) that I  can not recommend the company more highly!. The new waterpik arrived 17 hours after talking to them (Amazon) and I now have the product that far outdoes the &amp;#34;new improved&amp;#34; model by another company. See my review of their item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great. I now mix the mouthwash I use in it with water (seems a 50/50 blend works fine) and it delivers as advertised. It runs long enough (ample amount in fact since I often have contents left over) Is light and maneuverable has 2 power ratings although I only need the hi setting. When I take it off the charger it seems to run forever! I left it off for over 3 weeks and it never stopped working. I put it back on the charger since my other items  on my 2 outlets thinned out so I never did find it&#x27;s maximum battery (non ac connect) point. I think I will recommend this battery to TESLA. I guess my only silly issue is how they created the hole stopper where you put the liquid into the holder. It works fine, don&#x27;t get me wrong. But once you buy it, it LOOKS as though it will come open. (IT NEVER HAS) which is somewhat of a miracle of design  Perhaps I should simply change my rating to 5 stars....lol&lt;br /&gt;Well the replacement came through and it does not leak. I am very happy they did replace it because when it coincidentally started dripping two years to the DAY (on a Sunday) that it was covered for on a 2 year warranty that I had no idea was in force, the kind lady at Waterpik realized how close I was to the deadline that she simply replaced it. I didn&#x27;t even have to tell her that I tried first Amazon on Sunday who advised me to call Waterpik first in order to get this resolved. So as far as Waterpik knew, I was one day out of warranty and I didn&#x27;t bother to tell her that I DID try on Sunday but they were closed.  I feel good about them backing their product  like this. However, when I asked if the replacement also had a 2 year warranty on it, she sadly said &amp;#34;no&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;++++++++++++++++++++++++&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evidently I have had this 2013. As of today  FEB 2016, THE BATTERY FINALLY STOPPED.I SEE ANOTHER PERSON RAN HIS FOR 8 YEARS. THIS IS ONLY  3 PLUS YEARS.

            <li> I have braces, but even if I didn&#x27;t this is the best thing for your oral health. Even after brushing, you cannot believe what comes out from between your teeth! Do yourself a favor and get one for you and one for everybody on your Xmas wish list!</li>
            <li> Works perfectly and does the job Had many negative reviews but I went ahead and bought it anyway because of the company&#x27;s reputation.Simple to use and does a great job on my teeth</li>
            <li> On the recommendation of my dentist I picked one of these up. Its amazing on what it is able to clear and my mouth feels really clean after use,</li>
            <li> I love this Waterflosser! It is my first ever waterflosser and have loved it since i got it. It removes all the food from your teeth. So easy to use! A little bulky but could get used to it.</li>
            <li> It does make your teeth feel like you just came from a cleaning appointment with your dentist! However, our first one lasted a little over a year then quit. Since I had long since thrown out the box and paperwork I had forgotten that there was a two-year warranty on it and went ahead a bought a new one. According to my dentist Waterpik does a good job of honoring their warranty if I had known enough to call them. There were suggestions given in other reviews how to make the first one work again but I&#x27;m not that technically or electronically savvy enough to have wanted to mess with them. I would say don&#x27;t bother to order the extra &amp;#34;brushes&amp;#34; unless you need them for a large family.</li>
            <li> I found this item very inadequate.  It holds a charge for only a couple of days  and has a weak spray when fully charged.</li>
            <li> Several years after I bought it, the product is still usable. I&#x27;ve had the often reported charger contacts corrosion problem just over a year after I bought the item. Repaired it myself. Two years later, the stock battery became weak, wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge for a while. The charging circuit in this device is way too primitive. There is a schottky diode between the battery and the charging contacts, which drops voltage from the charger (3V) down to 2.45V, that&#x27;s all. This prevents overcharging the battery, however the battery is never charged to full capacity. I&#x27;ve replaced the ni-mh battery in mine with a cheap new ni-mh battery from China, removed the diode from the circuit, and replaced the charger with a cheap universal ni-mh charger from China. Used an automotive miniature waterproof connector (AMP SuperSeal 2-position) as a connector, to prevent corrosion of the charger terminals. By the way, every time I had to service the electrics in this device, I had to disassemble everything, since the electrics are the deepest hidden part in the case.&lt;br /&gt;If I had to choose again, I would probably buy a corded version...</li>
            <li> I have had two of these units in the past 2 years. It works very well, and my dental checks have improved since using them. The biggest problem is each have stopped working in less than a year. The longest I have had a functioning one was 9 months. It doesn&#x27;t seem a good cost to use ratio.  I have also tried the sonic care flosser, with the same results. Both of those only lasted for a similar amount of time. I did prefer the water pic as I felt I had more flexibility of working specific areas. Now that I am without a water flosser, I must decide what to try next- maybe go with a plug in model.</li>
            <li> Buy it!&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s all</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned my unit since February 2011, and have been having charging issues since February 2012.  I suppose I&#x27;m lucky, mine lasted longer than others.  I&#x27;ve babied it along for a couple of months now, but at this point the water pressure is too low to do anything, even fresh off the charger. It did do a good job for the year it worked correctly.  I&#x27;ve contacted the company about the 2 year warranty, but I&#x27;m not hopeful on getting it repaired.  In the meantime, I&#x27;ve ordered the battery operated Panasonic - so if it gets fixed - great, I&#x27;ll have a backup for when it happens again.  If it doesn&#x27;t get fixed, I won&#x27;t be giving Waterpik my money again, since this is obviously a design flaw, and they should own up to the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 6/14/13: Waterpik has responded to my warranty inquiry and is sending a replacement unit that should be here in 7 - 10 days.  No invoice was requested, so obviously they are aware of this design flaw.  Why the product is still being sold is something I don&#x27;t understand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2/5/14: The new unit is having the same problem.  I really wish I had counters in either bathroom to just get a standard countertop tank Waterpik, but we&#x27;re stuck with standalone sinks. Rental, so even if I wanted to remodel it&#x27;s a moot point.  We&#x27;re having problems with the Panasonic version we purchased as well - it no longer wants to stay in the open position, requiring two hands to use, which makes it very difficult for our child to use.  I&#x27;m about to give up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Changing the review from two stars to one star... I&#x27;d hoped the replacement model would have been updated to try to fix the known problem, but it wasn&#x27;t.  I&#x27;m not going to bother sending this one back at this point.</li>
            <li> I thought the information given me  (comparison between different models) was misleading and the Waterpik  I bought  would have been more powerful  (TIPS ALSO MORE POWERFUL) in which case I would have gotten a different model.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my Waterpik (which suffered a broken tubing, a weak point of the device). As for the Waterflosser, the reservoir is much too small. You have to stop and refill it several times in an average use. The biggest problem is that the pressure it creates is much too low. It fails miserably at cleaning in and around my bridgework and fails to do much along the gumline. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help with my new braces and it does the job. Portability allows me to take it with me if needed. It&#x27;s not as powerful as stationary models but that&#x27;s what you get with cordless. However it gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water reservoir is a good size. I only have to refill once but with braces I use it more than if I didn&#x27;t have so much extra to clean around. :-b</li>
            <li> I had the smaller model, which now I wonder how I used a smaller reservior cordless-waterflosser before (such as the non-Plus model and the $20 knockoffs.) The high/low switch replaces the need for different pressure nozzles. It comes with a bunch of fancy-smancy other tips (which I think are funny imo) but all that matters to me is the standard nozzle is good and the pressure on high meets my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend water-flossing to remove junk you&#x27;d never know was back there, thus improving your breath for hours. This product certainly does the trick. ;)</li>
            <li> A great traveling partner, simple to use and highly effective. The internal battery hold a long charge. For example, during a recent two week trip, the water pik was charged only one time.</li>
            <li> like it better  than the other one I had. much more powerful. hope it will last longer than the last one</li>
            <li> The product works great -while it does - the battery died way too soon. I&#x27;ve done everything possible to try and bring it back, but it is DEAD unfortunately</li>
            <li> Like others have stated, the battery charging issue needs to be resolved. At first this unit would stay charged for about a week. I was using it 1-2 times/day on the high setting. I don&#x27;t mind the smaller water reservoir since that can be refilled easily enough. I only had the waterpik for about six months and it no longer holds a charge like it did. If I make sure to dry out the connection site with compressed air and really push the charger in I get somewhat of a charge but it only lasts for a couple of days or so and then I have to charge it again. I&#x27;m going to try another brand of rechargeable water flosser and see if that&#x27;s any better. I have a small bathroom and no counter space for the full size waterpik.</li>
            <li> My husband is very happy with this water flosser.  It replaced an older model.  It seems to hold more water than his last one.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister as a gift. She loves it. She is always raving about it. How amazing it makes her mouth feel. Now I want one for myself. I have a hard time flossing regularly.</li>
            <li> This unit worked well for 4 months.  I kept thinking all the negative comments regarding the tank, noise and battery life were off the mark.  The unit actually does the job of a 4 star rating but the battery is really poor and the deal-killer.  The noise and tank complaints are without merit but I am not going to Radio Shack and customizing the recharging unit as that is Waterpik&#x27;s job.  Whether the battery or the charging connection is the actual weakness is not my problem but Waterpik&#x27;s.  I am long experienced in rechargeable battery maintenance and usually amaze people with how long my cordless items last.  Not so with this unit.  Something is definitely wrong and while I rarely make comments one way or another, here it is.  DO NOT BUY THIS EXPENSIVE ILL-DESIGNED POWER SOURCE.</li>
            <li> These clean your teeth and gums very well. My check-ups have been much improved.  I love the compact design.  I have now owned three of them, but never for more than a year.  The battery life is terrible.  None have lasted a year, even though I have followed the charging directions exactly.  I&#x27;m going to switch to a Philips Sonicare - Airfloss.  The battery charging system on the Sonicar products uses induction charging and has always lasted for many years. I&#x27;ll let you know more when I buy the Sonicare - Airfloss.</li>
            <li> VERY GOOD PRODUCT I RECOMENDED THIS FOR MY KIDS, ACTUALLY I GOT MINE BACK IN MARCH, THIS ONE IS RUNNING OUT OF BATTERIES, THEY ARE RECHARGABLE BUT MAY NEED TO REPLACE FOR NEW ONES; TOO SOON? THEY SOULD HAVE BOTH THE WIREABLE OPERATION AND THE WIRELESS OPERATION OPTION.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LUIS</li>
            <li> I love my regular waterflosser so I bought the Cordless for travel.  It works quite well, but does have only two positions, the \\&quot;low\\&quot; being too weak and the \\&quot;high\\&quot; being kind of \\&quot;low\\&quot;.  The reservoir is quite small so a regular flossing will take about 3 refills.  The battery lasts several days which is good.  It is good for travel although a bit bulky, but it is not a replacement for your plug in sink-top Water Pik.</li>
            <li> The waterpik waterflooser I received stopped working after just two weeks.  I was livid that amazon sent me a defective product.  However, I called waterpik directly and expressed my disappointment.  After providing proof of purchase etc. I was sent a new waterpik waterflosser within two weeks.  I love the waterpik waterflosser and I would recommend it to anyone that cares about oral hygiene.  Moreover the waterpik customer service is simply outstanding.  I never thought they would act promptly and send me a replacement.  Keep up the good work Waterpik.</li>
            <li> Update Jan 2014&lt;br /&gt;I still love this thing and use it at least once a day.  Some comments:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It DOES get a little funky smelling inside the water compartment. Just add a little vinegar to the water once a month and run it through the system, then run some plain water through to rinse.  Same thing people do with their coffee maker.  Problem solved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) I don&#x27;t leave it plugged in all the time so that it doesn&#x27;t overcharge and wear out the battery.  I also don&#x27;t plug it back in right after using it so that the socket can dry, someone commented that the nodes can get corroded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Best when used in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) I still find the need to floss but not as often.  If you continue to floss AND use this once a day, you&#x27;ll have the healthiest gums you have ever had in your life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nov 2013 - I&#x27;m addicted to this thing.  Yes, I have to fill it up 3-4 times, but the balance of size and speed is perfect.  If the tank was larger, it would be too bulky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it in the shower every morning.  Two to three extra minutes for REALLY clean teeth and gums.  Much more effective than flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on other reviews, I am fully expecting it to lose it&#x27;s charging ability in a year.  And I&#x27;ll happily buy another one.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that the charger operates on 120V only, regardless that device is perfect for traveling.</li>
            <li> great product, like being able to get teeth really clean using it&lt;br /&gt;would recommend this product to others for that reason</li>
            <li> I own this model and I like how it cleans. However,after about 1 year of&lt;br /&gt;use it quit accepting a charge. After reading the lead review (and&lt;br /&gt; another review saying the parts were no longer available at Radio Shack)&lt;br /&gt; I searched for and found an electronic cleaner: DeoxIT  which I have now&lt;br /&gt; used. I was once again able to charge the Waterpik after cleaning&lt;br /&gt;out some black gunk that was freed up. I  am not sure how much&lt;br /&gt; longer I will get to use this model-but I hope it lasts some time.&lt;br /&gt; I have a cheaper model and I don&#x27;t like it. It is too harsh on my&lt;br /&gt; gums. Waterpik will be well advised to improve their product&lt;br /&gt;so this problem doesn&#x27;t arise again.</li>
            <li> Received it fast, great thing, very comfortable and beautiful! I highly recommend using it because, as for me, it is very essential!</li>
            <li> I had this product before i purchased this one from Amazon. It worked great for me when I travel. The water container is bigger that the another model of this kind. The con about it is that if the battery dies, you have to get a new product. When I called Waterpik, I asked if i could just order a battery, with a cold reply I was told that there is no battery replacement for this product. No explanation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I checked out Amazon.com and found this product online. It was  cheaper than getting it from Waterpik itself. Plus they have an amazing customer service to boot. My first order did not arrive after 3 weeks of waiting. I called Amazon.com and without a fuss I was told that my product will be replaced and will be sent ASAP. True enough, I got it in a few days with no extra charge.</li>
            <li> messy, must use in shower, tip broke off with piece stuck in channel. threw AWAY  the Waterflosser, money wasted</li>
            <li> This portable unit has pressure to clean, but it is so messy to use.  I decided to use this devise in the shower......</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been to my dentist since I bought this product.  I can let you know after my dentist visit in two months.</li>
            <li> Got this for my 10 year son who just got his braces on.  It does a great job of getting all the food he miss from just brushing.</li>
            <li> I would like to commend the seller for excellent customer service. I contacted them because the Waterpik did not seem to have adequate water pressure. I was not sure if the unit was defective or not. They immediately sent me out a second one  with no questions asked. They said the most important thing was to please the customer.  There was some confusion about delivery of the second one which appeared to be late. Again they immediately sent me out another one with no questions asked and it came on time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the Waterpik - this model is cordless. It seems to not have as much water pressure as the other models that have a separate water reservoir and a long cord attached. It&#x27;s a trade-off of cordless and less pressure vs. corded and more pressure. The cordless one has a 450 ml reservoir which is not enough water to do the job sufficiently for me. You be the judge..</li>
            <li> Does the job.  Can use 3 or 4 times before refilling water supply.  Would be helpful if there was an indicator when the battery is running low but I have only had to charge it once since the initial charge.  Can be messy if I forget to close mouth while using.</li>
            <li> I had never thought that waterpiks were what good but this one works well. Have used it for two moths now and have noticed a deference in my gum line.</li>
            <li> I could&#x27;ve saved my money.</li>
            <li> You can cut your dental bills in half if you use a Waterpik Waterflosser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this version--Cordless Plus. It is ergonomically designed for better functionality compared to the previous editions of the Cordless Waterpik. Also, this one holds a  charge longer and is guaranteed for 2 years. So spend the extra  10 or 15 dollars to get this version&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Waterpik gets stuff out that you cannot get by regular flossing. I simply shoot it across the gaps between my teeth, never directly straight down into the bottom of the cleavage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my last visit to the dentist, I had a deep cleaning. First cleaning of the lower jaw in 2 years. The dental technician said there was surprisingly little plaque buildup.</li>
            <li> This is so convenient to take traveling anywhere.  You have to fill the reservoir twice in order to clean both upper teeth and lower teeth but I do not feel that this is any kind of an inconvenience.  This works really well and works with my other cleaning tips on my larger waterpik. I love this handy appliance.</li>
            <li> The item worked well, unfortunately it stopped working just after the 30-day return deadline.  I just ordered a different (and more expensive) model of Waterpik that will be delivered in a couple of days.</li>
            <li> Despite some other reviews, I have had no problems with this product.  Nothing has rusted out or stopped working.  The water also feels good on my teeth and gums.  The water can get a bit messy but you learn to wrangle the beast pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> I was replacing an old one,new one much improved,shaped grip easier to hold...MAJOR improvement two settings low and high both not as strong as the one on my other which was way too much.</li>
            <li> Got a year out of mine.  Now dead.  Tried cleaning the pins on the charger connector, hasn&#x27;t helped so far.  I&#x27;m debating whether to go through the dance to get it warrantied or just junk it and get a new one (possibly not Waterpik brand).  Really sad that Waterpik can&#x27;t figure out the technology that Braun uses for their toothbrushes--charging without a wired connection.  The cordless unit worked fine when it worked.</li>
            <li> Not the highest water pressure, but it does work well as an everyday flosser.  I have a tight jaw, so I can&#x27;t really get to my back teeth with regular floss.  This does the trick.</li>
            <li> BATTERY DRAINS QUICKLY</li>
            <li> The cordless unit doesn&#x27;t have as much power as my old plug-in model, but the convenience of storing it out of sight and being able to easily travel with it warrants 4 stars.  As an adult with braces (again) it&#x27;s doing the job of removing all the food stuck in them, so I&#x27;m not sure I needed the additional power anyway.  It doesn&#x27;t have any kind of battery indicator, so you have to guess at that, but it is pretty obvious when it needs to be charged.  Overall, I&#x27;m happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Not very powerful, very messy and small water tank makes it a pain to do an proper job. But it is portable!</li>
            <li> not matching USE frequency</li>
            <li> My husband suggested I get this for my bridge - it&#x27;s hard to get between the bridge to clean.  I was hesitant but I ordered it.  It works great!  I wouldn&#x27;t go without it.  It stays charged for a very long time.  I have only had it for a couple months but so far so good.  The price was very good - saved about $15 over Walmart.</li>
            <li> I thought the water pics were included. None in my box. Went to Target to purchase but pics come only with complete box. What to do?Where to buy them?  Product is useless without water pics.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product.  Combined with my cordless toothbrush my mouth feels cleaner than ever.  Can&#x27;t wait till my next dental appointment to see how much improvement I&#x27;ve made</li>
            <li> I have just had bad luck with this item not charging after 2 months use.  The first one lasted about 5 months then it stopped charging too.  When they work they seem to work well.  I may try one more time with a new one but that&#x27;s it if it breaks down too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many reviewers have reported this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just keep the above in mind when purchasing.  Also, remember(!) after 30 days the return policy won&#x27;t help you. Best of luck to all reading this.</li>
            <li> Ok, I have had this Waterpik just about a year and I LOVE IT!!! The water pressure is an even flow that does not harm you gums. There are two settings, LOW AND HIGH, I just start using HIGH setting and it is tolerable. I HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I thought I was looking for the old timey water pik and saw this and thought I would give it a try. It is wonderful. So easy to use and works great. I am so glad I bought this.</li>
            <li> I wish I had selected a more evenly balanced and easily maneuverable wired option. This was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> With high hopes I got this.  it has some serious flaws: the reservoir tank is good for 1/3 of the mouth and the tip keeps jumping out of the holder and rotates.  WaterPik can and should do better.</li>
            <li> Many people may have complained about the corrosion of charging spots: both body and charger. I think it is not well designed. Oral B uses no copper electrode to charge it. With water the electrode can be easily oxidated to become green and no protection had been considered. I&#x27;m a chemistry professor and I put it in my office and get some HCl solution to clean up the stain. Even if I put scotch tape over the electrode of the body it is still rotten so I have to clean it every week. This is ridiculous product design.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Waterpik several weeks ago and could not be more pleased. I had read some negative reviews before and they were way of the mark. The tip does not turn when it is in your mouth unless maybe you mashed it against your tooth or something. It stays charged for a long time, easy to handle, the two setting are perfect as I prefer the lighter setting and it is just right. I had the prior model and this is a big improvement in handling it as it has a curved body now instead of straight. Also the tip release is farther away so you cannot accidently push it when using it like I did a few times with the old one. Also the on off switch is easier to use than before. Can&#x27;t think of anything that can be improved!</li>
            <li> the product did not funtion when used it the first time it was used for 2 to 3 mintutes  i charged it all day and the next day in trying to use it i would use the on and off switch and it would not turn on that is my complaint  i had a hard time contacting the teeth and things web site for returns they made it so hard that i had to send the stuff to the waterpik company im overseas and it makes it hard to contact people in the states</li>
            <li> I have gingivitis and have smoked in the past AND still pick up a cig now and then (I know..I know...do NOT judge me!!!) and I got this water pik bc it was cheap and my dentist said water piks are better than flossing.  I should use it every day but I don&#x27;t ;-( but when I do use it it&#x27;s fun ;-) I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s working (next appointment with my dentist is in April or May I think - it&#x27;s still end of January here) but I do know it&#x27;s easy to use, takes up LITTLE counter space and is rechargeable.  I like it so far and for the price? Can&#x27;t beat it ;-)</li>
            <li> I purchased the Water Pic cordless to use when I am not using my Shower Flosser. The Water Pic&#x27;s pressure is much less than I am used to with the Shower Flosser but it&#x27;s handy when I want to use a water pic and not shower. Check out the Shower Flosser online if you want a more powerful water flosser for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> The Waterpik works well, but has limited features, such as pressure settings. You only have two choices, low and high.  The tank is impossible to empty completely, and package information states that lithium batteries can&#x27;t be taken on passenger airplanes, so when I travel by air I can&#x27;t take it with me.</li>
            <li> Protips for a first timer: fill it before every use, or you will run out. Also, you will squirt your wall multiple times, but all in all this thing is AWESOME!</li>
            <li> I have the full sized version of this, and while I like it, it&#x27;s a little annoying for me to have this sitting in my small bathroom. This handheld, cordless version is light, easy to use and charges pretty quickly. The battery lasts about a week, using it once a day. The only downside is it doesn&#x27;t have the perio head that the larger version has.</li>
            <li> We love the Waterpik Waterflosser Cordless PLUS.  It cleans our teeth so well.</li>
            <li> I was looking for waterflosser and I found the right product, I recommend waterpik :-)</li>
            <li> I really like it.  Because it has to cord I can use it in the shower and not have to hassle with leaning over the bathroom sink.</li>
            <li> it works so well i love it since we have two kids with braces. it helps a lot more as well</li>
            <li> I have owned the portable Water Pic water flosser 8 months.  I love it!  However, it now only has one flow speed, the slow one, and the button does not change the speed.  I went to the Water Pic web sight to find out how to get a warranty (two years) repair, but there is no answer there and I used their email to get the answer, but they have not answered me.  I guess they give a good warranty but then ignore you when you have a failure.  Now I guess I have to call, probably wait forever, just to find out how to have them honor their warranty.  I bought one of these for my grandson, but now which I had found something else.  Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> The pressure on this isn&#x27;t great, so it isn&#x27;t my daily at-home flosser. I use it only for travel, and for this it&#x27;s very convenient. The last time I traveled with it I forgot the charging cord, which turned out not be a problem: the charge lasted the full week!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping... Good Product..&lt;br /&gt;It seems better than dental floss.&lt;br /&gt;I did use waterpik WP-360.&lt;br /&gt;I think WP-450 better than WP-360.&lt;br /&gt;WP-450 can select water pressure (strong, weak). It was good.</li>
            <li> It is a cheap piece of cr*p that has controls that don&#x27;t make sense and squirt water everywhere.  No way am I keeping it.</li>
            <li> This is awesome!  Battery lasts several days before needing to be recharged.  2 speeds and it came with multiple heads.  I use mine religiously every single day because I was often lazy and would sometimes skip flossing.  My dentist recommended at a minimum I use a waterpik.  He noticed the next time I had my teeth cleaned because my gums did not bleed like they did prior.</li>
            <li> Does what is expected.  Don&#x27;t have any issues.  Keep it is my suit case.</li>
            <li> there is a known issue with the charging contacts that really makes charging fail.&lt;br /&gt;Why don&#x27;t they fix it?</li>
            <li> The water chamber is too small and empties almost instantly so you are constantly refilling it.  Get the one with a larger water chamber.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this, and I am thoroughly impressed while using this.&lt;br /&gt;Easy... effortless... great for when I am too tired to manually floss my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;My suggestion is to use the lower flow rate setting on this item. It makes the use&lt;br /&gt;painless. Kinda tickles!!!!</li>
            <li> The water capacity is inadequate and is empty before you complete inside and outside of all teeth. Power and battery are good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I don&#x27;t have another cord to contend with. Seems to do the job well. Holds charge for quite awhile.</li>
            <li> This product replaces the need for flossing (a function that never held much charm for me!).  Just fill the reservoir with water, select the most appropriate pick, and teeth and gums are cleared of &amp;#34;gunk&amp;#34; and plaque. So easy and thorough.  This is especially important for me, because as a senior on Medicare, dental insurance is not provided.  I would rather spend a $40 dollars for a preventative device than ten times that amount for dental corrections--plus there&#x27;s no pain! This is a great product that I heartily recommend.</li>
            <li> I thought a waterpik would be a hassle, but this product is so easy to use and you can notice the difference by using it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product but it breaks down after 7 months and you only have one month to return it.  This is the second one that this happened to.  I must have been crazy purchasing a second one when the first one lasted about the same time.  It&#x27;s really a shame because this is a great product but doesn&#x27;t last.  For this amount of money this should last much longer.  I remember having a waterpik years ago that lasted for years.  They are more expensive now and not very well made to last.  I am extremely disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> The flosser appears to work although it&#x27;s a little soon to tell for sure. The big disappointment is that these days you expect a charger to be usable for all voltages as are mobile phones, laptops etc. Most people travel overseas now and this charge can be used only in countries with 110v and not in countries with 220v (ie most countries). So if you want to take it with you then another gadget is needed adding to the price the bulk and the weight, all unnecessary if a proper charger had been supplied.</li>
            <li> Just like the previous reviews - the only thing I do not like is the plug in area exposed.&lt;br /&gt;I used wax to plug immediately and no issues.</li>
            <li> Produce arrived on time and in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plaque seeker tip and the orthodontic tip are a real strong improvement to getting gunk off your gums and teeth.  Adjustible water pressure settings are also good for people with sensative gums.  This is my third Waterpik and they just keep getting better and better.</li>
            <li> Works well when charged up, the battery used to last about 5 days but after a year it is down to about 2 days. I just keep it plugged in all the time when not in use.  Reservoir is sufficient volume.</li>
            <li> Some reviews said this was hard to use. I did not think so, I just wish it was more powerful.</li>
            <li> No pressure after 1 month of use&lt;br /&gt;not fall, used carefully, very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;No pressure after 1 month of use&lt;br /&gt;not fall, used carefully, very disappointed</li>
            <li> Battery life is good.  Works well.</li>
            <li> I was initially really happy with the product, as I am sure most people would be.  It is certainly a convenient waterpick design.  But I purchased the item at the start of 2014 and it is now August 2015 and the batter has died.  This means I would have to buy a new waterpick every 1.5 years at this rate. My electric razor, by contrast, has a rechargeable battery that lasted many years already, so this seems to not have quite as good a battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second problem I have is switched over to only using waterpick instead of flossing, because on the package it claims to be more effective than flossing.  But I ended up getting lots and lots of cavities, more than I have ever had in my life, during the period I used this waterpick.  I have since switched back to regular flossing.  My dentist told me (after taking all of my money) that one should never just use a waterpick, but also use dental floss, because only dental floss can get under the gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the company would be willing to refund or issue a warranty that might improve my review, but I could not figure out how to contact the seller.</li>
            <li> I am a HUGE fan of the large countertop Waterpik models, but this one is terrible! It claims it gives &amp;#34;a full 45 seconds&amp;#34; of sonic floss before the container drains. The last time I checked, 20 seconds did not equal 45 before I had to refill it. Don&#x27;t buy this!</li>
            <li> Waterpik is a good product i am happy with it. definitely recommend it to others who want great flossing experience.</li>
            <li> Item too big to hold and takes up more space than necessary.  Will be donating this item to the goodwill.</li>
            <li> Like some of other users, mine was died after about 2 months. Very inefficient battary life. I ended up going to the shops and purhcased another one..</li>
            <li> When my original WaterPik died I decided I wanted something that wouldn&#x27;t take up so much space on my counter that the full sized unit did.  After reviewing options I decided to get this WaterPik cordless model which has a much smaller footprint.  After charging the unit for 24 hours, I filled up the water vessel and started flossing.  It does take some getting used to because if you aren&#x27;t holding it correctly the water runs down your arm along with coming out your mouth.  I felt it did a good job, I refilled it once to complete the flossing which took about 5 seconds so no complaints there.  If you are looking for a unit that doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of real estate on your counter this would be it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;August 2014: This flosser no longer holds a charge, when first purchased I would charge it maybe every two weeks but now I am always charging it.  Will probably resort to just keeping it plugged in.  I like the unit but it cannot take the place of flossing (as the advertising wants you to believe) ... not at all per my dental hygenist.  It works to get into all the spaces between teeth or if you&#x27;ve have some oral surgery and have \\&quot;pockets\\&quot; between your teeth this works well.</li>
            <li> This cordless model replaces an ancient waterpik (must be at least 15 years old?) that I&#x27;ve occasionally used.  That old unit with its separate water tank had always been semi-inconvenient and noisy to use... and my irregular use of it was the result.  This cordless one resolves that inconvenience issue... but does exchange it for a new one which is a somewhat overly small water tank.  The water pressure isn&#x27;t as high as the old unit... but it&#x27;s good enough to blast the debris from geriatric gums....  The only thing I am not sure about is how well this thing is going to survive getting wet every day (the power switch does get wet).... but so far it&#x27;s been OK (almost a month of use).  Each full charge is good for at least a week of once-a-day use... just take the precaution to dry out the contacts (they can get wet) before plugging it in.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this purchase.  I have stopped using dental floss &amp; use the waterpik exclusively.  It does a better job &amp; is easier on my gums.  The only negative about this product is that there is no indicator of when the battery is fully charged.</li>
            <li> Nice, compact device that&#x27;s fairly simple to use and takes up minimal space on your bathroom sink or shelf. Your teeth will feel cleaner, and you will even notice a few undetected food particles in your sink too. However, the technique for containing that nice forceful water jet over your sink will require a little practice.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how well this works.  It&#x27;s powerful and holds a charge for a long time.  I fill the reservoir twice for one use, which isn&#x27;t a problem.  Great for travel.</li>
            <li> my brother uses these daily</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe this!  These idiots are actually shipping a product in 2014 that has a fixed 110volt-only charger.  I haven&#x27;t seen one of these since 1999.  Everything electronic that I&#x27;ve bought since then (mobile phones, laptops, camera-battery chargers, shavers) has come with a dual-voltage auto-sensing charger/power supply.  WaterPik should be shot for this.</li>
            <li> I bought this model because we don&#x27;t have much counter space in our bathroom. I think it would be good for traveling, and it does what it said it does, however, it is very bulking in the hand and doesn&#x27;t hold much water. I have to refill it at least once during one use--sometimes more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the challenges is that the water intake is at the bottom, and because the device is always at an angle when you use it, it runs out before the reservoir is empty--making its use even shorter between refills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think if you have the room, you should get the regular one with the large reservoir.</li>
            <li> This works well for cleaning between the teeth. I actually look forward to using it at the end of each day. I have two complaints, but it is such a useful piece of equipment that I still give it five stars. My two complaints:  1. It is hard to get every bit of water out of the flosser when finished with using it (there is a ridge inside around the opening). 2. This is the second one I&#x27;ve bought. The first one lasted over three years, and then the battery just stopped fully recharging. So, I bought this second one. I know that others have had the same problem. The solutions I&#x27;ve read about didn&#x27;t seem to work for me. Nevertheless, this is a good flosser: good for the teeth, good for the gums, quick to use, not too heavy and not awkward to hold. Five stars.</li>
            <li> This is my first Waterpik, and I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.  Better than floss; makes my teeth and gums feel squeaky clean, and the smaller one I have packs up easily for travelling.</li>
            <li> The battery life isn&#x27;t long but it does do a pretty good job.</li>
            <li> This product takes some getting used to.  First time the water went all over the bathroom, including in my ear.  I&#x27;ve never used one of these things before and apparently it takes practice.  The force of the water doesn&#x27;t seem that strong; I&#x27;m not sure it would actually dislodge plaque or small food particles that an ordinary flossing wouldn&#x27;t.  They need to make one of these things that will heat up the water so you&#x27;re not spraying cold liquid on your teeth.  Some of us have sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> Works great - the best one I&#x27;ve purchased so far!  Good power and holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> Picked this up for an extended trip. It is ok but will not ever replace my counter top waterpik. The high power mode on this hand held puts out less pressure than my counter top waterpik on low pressure. But when traveling it is better than not having one at all.</li>
            <li> It does the job of cleaning very well.  It&#x27;s faster and less work than flossing.  To get around the splashing water issue I just lean over the tub.</li>
            <li> Works great - the best one I&#x27;ve purchased so far! Good power and holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> This waterflosser gets the job done.  Battery life is outstanding....stays charged for at least 7 days.  Water pressure is excellent.  Great value!</li>
            <li> Can see stuff flushed out after hand flossing and using a floss pick before using the Water Pic unit nightly</li>
            <li> Not made like the home model, portable could be better designed, better than previous models.  Problem is that charging is hit or miss, as was with another cordless Waterpik of the same model which led to buy this and replace the other.  Don&#x27;t think it will last more than one year, time will tell.</li>
            <li> When the product works, it&#x27;s great, though I&#x27;ve only had this unit for less than four weeks and the motor makes a lot of noise, though isn&#x27;t pushing out water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Called Waterpik and they said it&#x27;s defective (again, my second model) and we need to ship back for &amp;#34;engineering&amp;#34; to look at it...again. Ergonomically this isn&#x27;t necessarily an upgrade from previous models despite their advertised claims, rather it&#x27;s a clunky more difficult design. In the past their was a button you could press down to turn on and off. Now, there&#x27;s a slide lever (not really a button) that needs to slide up and down, all the while holding vertical. Not a smart design at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No matter, had this product worked for at least a couple years, rather than a few weeks, I was willing to tolerate the design flaws for the price.</li>
            <li> This hand-held rechargeable is not worth the money.  It does not have the power of the countertop model and the battery ceased recharging after several months.  Plus, it does not accommodate the pocket pick tip.  The countertop model worked great, my hygienist is very happy with the results....pockets shrinking, but even that model gave out 3 months short of the 2 yr warranty.  I am hoping they will replace it.</li>
            <li> ...and of course cordless. You fill it by opening a cap on the side and filling it. It has plenty of battery to get you through a cleaning. The finger controls are no better or worse than the original. Aim it at the sink when you try them cause it ll squirt a mile. I put mouth wash in mine and tried it and found it wasteful. Works just as well with water. Mouth wash after.</li>
            <li> best thing i ordered on line this year yet.&lt;br /&gt;Made me obsess now with oral cleaning ...and takes no time at all for 100% better results than the regular floss. Little bit of water mess but doing it over the sink takes 20 seconds and after 3 weeks i have no more sensitivity in my teeth because my gums are healthier!! i love it !!!</li>
            <li> I feel this product is too bulky and hard to use. I liked my original Waterpik much better - the one with the long cord.</li>
            <li> This product needs a battery charge indicator light. so that you can tell when it needs to be charged and when it is fully charged.</li>
            <li> It does its function well, and I like the cordless freedom.  I also like the ability to take it with me when traveling.&lt;br /&gt;With that, the AC charger is 110v only... I wish they&#x27;ve made it 110-240v so it can be used in Europe....</li>
            <li> Not very powerful.&lt;br /&gt;I expected it to be much stronger, very hard to get at the back of teeth in the back.</li>
            <li> This would be a good product if it lasted more than 6 months. I have purchased 3 of them. The most recent flosser gave out after a month. The corded model works well, but this is quite junky. I wish Waterpik would do this right.</li>
            <li> Everything was what I expected</li>
            <li> I thought this might be heavy or a little weird since it is larger than the counter top type.  Not the case easy to use and gets to those hard to reach places.  Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I did not buy this from Amazon however I have used it for about six months. My biggest problems with the portable waterpik involved the battery. There is no specific instructions on how long to charge the battery for aside from the initial charge. I didn&#x27;t know how long to charge it so I was overcharging it or under charging it. The prongs on the actual unit became corroded and also accumulated a lot of mold. Both of those things kept it from charging properly or kept it from charging at all.  I can&#x27;t say how many times I left it to charge for 24 hours and came back to use it, only to find out it was still dead. I can&#x27;t get it to charge at all anymore, so I am buying the countertop model now. I don&#x27;t need the portability of the rechargeable cordless model. The other flaw I found was the toggle between the Hi and Low pressure settings broke a week after I bought it, so it was stuck on hi. I did find the stream more than adequate when it was fully charged.</li>
            <li> I love my Waterflosser. It works so much better than I expected. When I first got it, I brushed my teeth and flossed, then used the Waterflosser and I was amazed at how much I missed with the toothbrush and floss. It also makes my gums feel so good. When we traveled out of town for a week, I really missed it.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed, easy to handle and works great I would definitely recommend this product to anyone. love it.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what I expected and would recommend highly. Easy to use, more difficult to clean since the reservoir has only a small round egress that does not allow all the water to be emptied.</li>
            <li> This purchase was my second one in one year. It&#x27;s not that they completely die.. they just slowly lose their power. They do not last long for the money. I am on my third one, different brand, which is only a few months old, so we shall see how this one will be....</li>
            <li> Too bulky and too awkward to use for it&#x27;s intended purpose. Worse, doesn&#x27;t hold enough water to get the job done.avoid the cordless model.</li>
            <li> This seemed like a handy way of water-flossing, and it was for the first 18 months.  However, after less than two years of use, the battery is so weak that it has to be re-charged after every use.  (The battery is sealed in, and cannot be replaced.)  Even worse, the water reservoir has begun to leak -- so that filling the reservoir and setting it by the sink for even a few minutes creates a giant puddle.  Actually, I think a two-star rating is probably too generous.  A nice gizmo while it lasted, but it is a huge waste of money and resources if it has to be replaced every year.</li>
            <li> 1.I expected the stream be stronger.  2. I would like to have the possibility to choose the heads I like or need. For instance, I got one for cleaning braces when I&#x27;m long past my teens.</li>
            <li> My husband has a corded waterpik and it was always a pain for me to use because I would have to move it to the left side of the sink to use it (I&#x27;m left-handed). So I thought the cordless model would be better for me. It&#x27;s ok, but I found it didn&#x27;t have nearly the pressure as the corded model, and did not hold enough water to go long enough for me.</li>
            <li> Great pick with a large reservoir that lasts long enough to clean all my teeth and still fits under the sink!</li>
            <li> The waterpic works fine.  I wish it held more water but then it would get bigger and perhaps more awkward.  It will be fine for travel which is why we purchased it.</li>
            <li> Cordless design removes the drips coming down the cord - convenient and less messy.&lt;br /&gt;Operation of the tip release button often causes accidental &amp;#34;power on&amp;#34;. Switching the position of the on/off switch with the hi/low switch should solve the problem. Would be even better if the on/off switch is a momentary switch (power on when pressed, power off when released). With the current design, the users need to slide the switch to &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; position when relocating the tip to a different quarter of the mouth.</li>
            <li> Very good product. Arrived exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great idea... they just need to work out the kinks.  Pros:  Easy to hold.  Can be put in a drawer if you want. Charger is small. Good for car travel - too large for air.   Cons:  Doesn&#x27;t hold enough water.  Can&#x27;t wash out reservoir - it must air dry.  Doesn&#x27;t come with the toothbrush attachment.</li>
            <li> The two speed makes this versatile. I found the non-PLUS model was a bit too strong with the one speed setting.  It is chunky but manageable.  You need to rock the unit back and forth a couple of times to drain all the left-over water from the large reservoir.  The reservoir fills thru a hole on the side (actually in the front of the reservoir about mid-way down).  Turning the Waterpik past horizontal stops the water from flowing out.  I either do that to control as a \\&quot;pause\\&quot; button or just turn it off with a quick flip of the on/off switch and then flip it back on when I want the water flow to resume.    I am with-holding a 5 star rating because I wish they had included a pause button like on the full-sized Waterpik model.  That pause button is very useful and shouldn&#x27;t be that hard to implement on the Waterpik Ultra.</li>
            <li> I have been a satisfied user of the regular Waterpik for years, so decided to get the cordless for \\&quot;travel\\&quot;.  It traveled directly into the trash.  It is virtually useless. I thought the horrendous reviews could not be true, but they were not exaggerations! Unless you only have 2 or 3 teeth, it doesn&#x27;t hold enough water.  It&#x27;s also almost virtually impossible to use adequately because of its design. Why in the world Waterpik would be willing to damage its reputation by keeping this albatross on the market is the big mystery.</li>
            <li> 1) The reservoir is too small, it will empty in under 20 seconds. You will need to stop and refill at least 5 times to clean your mouth once.   2) Battery is useless. It drains incredibly fast even charging whenever not in use. You can&#x27;t just plug it in either since you&#x27;d electrocute yourself on the open circuit.   3) The tip must be held in place manually. It swivels constantly unless you hold it in place yourself.  4) The water only pumps if the waterpik is held perfectly vertical and stationary.   5) Problem 3&amp;4 are such that you don&#x27;t move the waterpik around in your mouth, you /move your head/ around the waterpik!  6) Good luck trying to actually clean anything this way, did I mention you have less than 20 seconds before you need to refill again?    Do NOT buy this. It fails to serve any purpose.</li>
            <li> We have two at our house, and they are used every day.  The tips are a little pricey, but oh how it helps with braces.  And nothing big and clunky to find a place for in the bathrooms; it just goes in the closet.  A lot of uses possible between charges.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a great product and was so happy to find a battery operated water-pik due to the limited counterspace I have inmy bathroom.  Wow was I wrong...the first one I ordered worked great for about 2 weeks then the battery wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge for more than one use.  I contacted Waterpic and the shipped me another one, this one also now won&#x27;t hold a charge for more than one use.  I don&#x27;t want tohave to keep this item plugged in all the time just to use it, it defeats the purpose of a \\&quot;battery powered water pic\\&quot;!!!!    Guess I&#x27;ll look for something else!</li>
            <li> I have owned a Ultra Cordless Waterpik now since December 2009.  It started to act funky about two weeks ago when it began to make a loud chirping noise (which it did not do when I first bought it).  So, I called the customer service line to see what I should do/what they could do for me- and I was prepared to have to argue- like you normally would- just to get the minimal amount of respect and for them to believe that their product is actually malfunctioning. (Don&#x27;t we all know companies like that!) Anyway, it was a snap! I actually got a customer service rep in less than 5 minutes, to whom I explained my problem to, and then I provided her with the serial number and the model number of the machine, and she assured  me that it would be no problem, and they would send another one out as a replacement right away! Talk about wonderful customer service---and that also makes me feel really good about spending $50.00 for a dental \\&quot;gadget\\&quot; which, although it works really great, if it hadn&#x27;t been so easy to fix this problem, I might have had mixed feelings about purchasing it in the first place.</li>
            <li> I brought this item only a couple of weeks ago and have only used it a few times (maybe 10 times) and it has already started to malfunction. At first I thought it needed to be recharged but after charging it overnight I had the same problem. Now it operates fine for ONLY 3 seconds then quickly loses all its power. And this unfortunately happened when the return deadline expired so now I&#x27;m stuck with a non-working waterpik. I will never buy this brand again.</li>
            <li> The cordless unit works great in the shower. A full charge will operate the unit for 20 to 30 uses before needing to recharge. It has very ample jet action and will clean a mouthful of teeth before running out of water with a little practice. Until you can get proficient you may want to refill the the unit twice, once for the top set of teeth and once for the bottom. I like it and use it routinely.</li>
            <li> This item does not stand any critics. The battery starts fading out by loosing the charge after about 6 weeks of use. It was not good in the first place, charge was not enough to use by just two people twice a day. If you keep it charging for two days you can do 6 washes, then you need to keep it charging for another 48 hours. The charger plug melts and looses connection after two months of use (I just wonder what \\&quot;genius\\&quot; put contact charger which gets wet all the time and why they did not put contactless charger as they do on power brush). I had the item for 17 months now and finally it does not charge anymore because contacts are all rusted. If you don&#x27;t want trouble don&#x27;t buy it. Look for corded models or different make with contactless charger.</li>
            <li> At the time of this review I&#x27;ve used this waterpik for about a month. So far, it works just fine. Because it&#x27;s self-contained, it&#x27;s more flexible than the waterpiks that use a tank with a hose running to the device. Usually needs to be refilled once for each use. The only drawback is that the water pressure isn&#x27;t as high as I would like, but that is a personal preference, and one that should not be an issue for the average user.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not been a faithful flosser but find that using this Waterpik daily is easy and I hope it will be notice by the dentist on my next visit.</li>
            <li> I really like this item.  I like the fact that it&#x27;s cordless and it came with several tips including one for your tongue.  The only thing that I didn&#x27;t like and the reason it didn&#x27;t get five stars is because it&#x27;s cordless, the water reservoir only lasts for 45 seconds.  Other than that, great product.</li>
            <li> I have owned two (three, if you count the first one which never worked due to an initial battery problem) lesser WaterPik flossers.  Each time they stopped working, it was the battery&#x27;s fault.    I have waited a while to review this product and feel confident that this unit is more DURABLE than the others I have purchased.  Maybe the two-year warrantee forces Waterpik to use better batteries.    Sure, it&#x27;s a bit bulkier than I would prefer, but I&#x27;ll take a useful product over a broken one any day.</li>
            <li> I use it every night. Recommended by my dentist and does the trick. Even after brushing and flossing it still flushes out trapped particles.</li>
            <li> I had my first root canal and cap down and the dentist suggested that I get a water flosser to make sure I kept the area clean...especially since my teeth are really close together and I even have trouble getting floss between them sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were a lot of reviews all over the place for this item, cut it was just what I wanted and works great.  I wanted a portable, cordless water flosser that I could always have with me since we travel a lot.  I also wanted something that was easy to use and was lightweight.  This fit the bill on all accounts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tradeoff is that the water reservoir is small and to do a really good job, you&#x27;ll have to refill it once or twice depending upon how thorough you are.  Also, there is some spray back when you move it around to reach all the areas of your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The higher settings can almost be painful, so be sure to start it on the lower settings until you find what suits you best.</li>
            <li> Bought in September 2013 and by May 2014 the high/low speed selector stopped working. Contacting customer service to try and get a new one.</li>
            <li> the package mailed to me like a second-hand product. Feels bad about it.&lt;br /&gt;the actual product is pretty good, pretty useful</li>
            <li> does not contain a lot of water, but is a good waterpik.</li>
            <li> stopped working after couple of weeks...Initially was good but after using for 10 times it stopped working and need to return it now..</li>
            <li> Great product my husband loved it uses it all the time Easy to clean n store would recommend to everyone</li>
            <li> I bought it for travel. In the last 6 months I had 2 times travel. The first was 10 days trip. The second was about 1 month. In the middle of my second trip, the product stopped working. I totally used it for less than 30 times.</li>
            <li> Great buy! Reasonably priced and works well. The device is cordless and can be used anywhere once it is removed from the docking station.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended I purchase a Waterflosser to avoid erosion and I&#x27;m glad I did - after just a few weeks use, I couldn&#x27;t do without it. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist recommended this to me to help my gums from bleeding less. I said I hate flossing and she said many people like this machine and it is helpful.</li>
            <li> After years of dental floss use, my wife said that she wanted to give a water flosser a try.  I was torn between the cordless Waterpik and another brand, but decided to go with this.  After a month of use, we have both been very pleased.  It comes with multiple tips, which is nice.  I saw some reviews that talked about it being bulky to hold, but this has not been an issue at all for the two of us.  I definitely prefer cordless over corded.  I can use it at my sink instead of my wife&#x27;s.  I think this takes up a reasonable amount of room on the counter, too.  As far as water capacity goes, I usually am done flossing right about the time I&#x27;m about out of water.  As a test, I&#x27;ve used dental floss after the Waterpik to see how good it does, and I&#x27;ve been impressed.  I still think I will use regular floss periodically to keep my gums tough, though.</li>
            <li> My first waterpik cordless lost its power strength after about 6 months. Waterpik sent me a new one and now 6 months in I am having the same problem. They say it is because of hard water and to clean it with vinegar and change the tip. It still doesn&#x27;t work properly. I will be looking elsewhere for a water flosser!</li>
            <li> Pros:  As advertised. this waterflosser works pretty well. at the price point i think this is really a good product. my gum condition shows significant improvement in couple weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: the battery seems to have some minor problem. after one night charge the pressure drops after a minute. Also, the handle is kind off bulky. My hand is pretty big but sometime i still have problem holding while flossing my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other Thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;for people who never used water floss before, i think this would be a good start to try out. It does help to keep my gum more healthier, I am happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> it works, but no where close to plug in model.</li>
            <li> Love 99% of it,,,,wish it held just a little more water.  Thanks!  The portability is important as I travel alot.</li>
            <li> This is my second waterpik which has greatly helped toughen my gums which were always tender and would bleed from time to time.  Has also reduced cleaning time on my teeth.</li>
            <li> MY mouth feels so fresh after I use my Waterpik.  Even after brushing, some &amp;#34;residue&amp;#34; remains and the flosser eliminates this.  I&#x27;d be lost without it.</li>
            <li> My adult son got braces, so I bought this Waterpik for him, as his orthodontist recommended it. He loves it.</li>
            <li> I bought this to lace a corded Mel that had dropped. This works great, but the reservoir needs to be refilled part way through a cleaning. The charge lasts 1-2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I have owned this waterpik since 2/13 and I have used it approximately 3 times per week since owning it.  Intially I loved it.  The water pressure was good and I loved the additional attachments.  Now after just 6 months the charger is not fully charging the battery and I&#x27;m getting little to no water pressure.  This could be from corrosion (I haven&#x27;t checked into this yet) however, I expected better performance from this product.  I will not recommend or order this product again.  A better design is needed to keep water away from the charging area.</li>
            <li> After using the larger Waterpik Ultra (Model WP-100) for a couple of years, and getting great results from using it, I decided to buy one for my husband.  I picked out this one because his bathroom is on the small side and this model is quite compact, plus he travels a lot so also liked the idea of it being cordless and portable.  I bought it last December (2012) for a Christmas present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first problem with this model is the capacity, which is about half the size of the regular model.  It&#x27;s good for a quick go-around but not for thorough cleaning.  You need to refill it for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the real problem with this model is that you cannot clean the reservoir.  After you finish using it, you can shake out the excess water but you cannot shake it all out and water drops remain inside the tank.  Over time black mold starts to form along the bottom and sides of the reservoir.  When we first discovered that, I tried pushing all sorts of skinny things through the little hole to get to the mold to wipe it off, but nothing was able to reach all the areas of the tank&#x27;s interior.  I finally wound up soaking it with white vinegar, full strength, overnight.  I then used rolled up paper towel and stuff it down into the reservoir, took a chopstick and tried to swish the crumpled paper towel around to clean the interior.  There are areas in the front of the reservoir that are impossible to reach and thus, remain dotted with the black mold.  Very time consuming and frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model is poorly designed.  You should be able to snap out the bottom of the reservoir in order to thoroughly dry it after each use, or else Waterpik should provide a flexible brush that can be pushed into the reservoir to clean it thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give up!  I just ordered another Model WP-100 for my husband.  I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;ll wind up doing with this one, since it&#x27;s been eight months since I got it, and I can&#x27;t return it to Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this model, but I do recommend the larger models.nd this model, but I do recommend the larger models.</li>
            <li> It works great for my needs. I love that its portable &amp; easy to use. I hope it has a long life.</li>
            <li> Best thing you could do for dental care besides the electric tooth brush...the liquid reservoir (about 7 oz), could be larger (the 450 model) but I still recommend it.</li>
            <li> I went through 3 of these handheld waterpiks in about 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mostly I was buying the handheld because my bathroom sink is a pedestal-type with only a tiny ledge, not big enough to handle the full size, boxy, corded waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I was using the waterpik religiously, I was still only getting so-so reviews from the dentist on the state of my gums and pockets, and had to have deep scaling done twice in 3 years, ON TOP OF getting cleanings every 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THEN I finally got a full size corded waterpik because they came out with a newer version that has a smaller footprint that just barely did fit on my sink.  VOILA!  Suddenly I&#x27;m getting A+ grades from the dentist on my gum health!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had 3 of these handhelds and they just aren&#x27;t powerful enough.  The corded version is way, way, way better and the newest one is about the same price as the handheld. If only I had gotten one earlier I could have literally saved myself thousands in \\&quot;scaling and root planing\\&quot; fees.  GET THE CORDED ONE!!!  Don&#x27;t bother with this piece of junk!</li>
            <li> The water flosser Plus does seem to have stronger pressure than the one that I had before. I bought this one after my old one pooped out after only a year of use. I like that this has a two year warranty. I also like that it is cordless.</li>
            <li> Great cleaning power, long charge time, Fits nicely on my bathroom countertop, Holds just the right amount of water/wash for perfect cleaning performance.</li>
            <li> It is kind of bulky, but works ok.</li>
            <li> I love the cordless feature. This way my whole family can use it in different places. The reservoir is big enough to do what I need it to. No problems.</li>
            <li> I hate floss....HATE, HATE, HATE it!!! I truly do love this little bugger!!!  It works great, charge lasts a good while (I am at least on week 3 of the initial charge; it is still going strong).  I use this twice a day every day and that is way more than I can say for flossing.  I hated flossing.  I maybe flossed 4 times a week, TOPS...this has finally got me on the &amp;#34;flossing boat&amp;#34;  that I need to be on.  I have lucked out and only have 2 cavities in my mouth as we speak, but I have extremely tight contacts between my teeth and my dentist is always yelling at me (okay not really yelling, but at least scolding me) that I need to floss more.  This has done it for me and I will not be turning back to that string stuff ever again!!!!!!</li>
            <li> The battery lifetime is very short. This waterpik lasted for 1 month after which the battery wont charge - sent it for repair but again , the battery wont charge...A terrible product - waste of money!</li>
            <li> I like this product, and I can bring everywhere I need to travel,my mouth fill and really good, good product,</li>
            <li> I been using this waterpik twice daily for about 2 years. I love being able to use right in the shower and not having to worry about a mess.  I am always surprised by what is washed out of my gums, especially if I had brushed first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I did have a problem after over a year with diminishing performance due to battery charging.  Having to charge daily. Upon inspection noted corrosion on the terminal you plug into near the base.  Poured vinegar on the corroded probes and left to soak overnight. When I plugged it in, you could feel it plugged in smoother and more firmly. After a 24 hour charge it was like a new unit, providing a weeks worth of use I n a single charge.  Between this waterpik and my  sonicare toothbrush I would not skip either from my daily regime.</li>
            <li> It is just what we needed to care for our teeth which we just finished improving with braces. We use it everyday in order to keep our teeth forever.</li>
            <li> very loud and you have to fill it several times, should have done more research regarding this product.&lt;br /&gt;already used can not return</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a dental irrigator before so this was an unusual experience, but here goes....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It removes those stubborn little bastards between teeth well.&lt;br /&gt;2. Its relatively easy to handle (once you get used to it).&lt;br /&gt;3. Its value is well worth the cost.&lt;br /&gt;4. It comes with a variety of &amp;#34;jet extensions&amp;#34; to fit various needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The water tank could be bigger. After you get used to it, you&#x27;ll probably have to fill the tank less times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product saves a lot of time and works very well. I am happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> Nothing cleans teeth like anything from this line. My first hand held lasted one year. I also have a larger stand alone model which has more power, it really jets the water out with more pressure than this hand held and I&#x27;ve had it for several years.    The great thing about any Waterpik product is they work and you can fill the resevoir with germ killing mouthwash or a prescribed peridontal rinse to really push it into any problem spot.    This may be your answer to healthy gums, it is in my home.</li>
            <li> We had an older version. The new version is much better but a little larger. If you have small hands you may find it a little hard to manuever.</li>
            <li> This is a god send for people with braces.  While it&#x27;s true that this is NOT a total replacement for flossing (braces or not) it does help a lot in getting rid of  all kinds of things that get stuck to teeth and in between teeth.  I chose this particular unit because it said it came with a nozzle designed for braces but personally I didn&#x27;t find that part significantly useful compared to the regular attachment that comes with it other than the fact the water pressure was lower in the orthodontic attachment which made it easier to get used to the whole concept of blasting water on to sensitive gums.      I was very happy with the results I got from it while it was working, yet, this device came with a whole bunch of problems.    First, there was an issue with charging.  The connection to the charger seemed poor so sometimes it wont charge at all.  I literally had to plug it in over night and bet on the 50/50 chance of it actually charging or not depending on pure luck!    Secondly, for a device that is meant to be used in an environment full of water for an activity that involves a lot of water flowing and splashing around, it is not exactly water proof.  It gets wet inside and causes all kinds of problems including biological things that grow inside (eeew)    The electric motor just rusted and got stuck after a few months so I had to take it apart and service it like a car - which is not something an average user would be able to do.    The nozzle sometime pops out of the main unit especially at the high pressure setting.    It is pretty noisy to begin with and gets worse as it ages. But if you close the door of your bathroom you might be able to get away with it.    The water tank is very small and I usually took about 3 refills on a normal cleanup.    Finally after about one year, the gears that make contact between the motor and the pump simply kept skipping and it got to a point beyond repair even for somebody like me who really kept trying hard to make it work.I&#x27;m planning not to replace this with the same unit and try one of those simpler attach to the tap type ones instead next time.  One major disadvantage is I won&#x27;t have the option of using mouthwash (e.g. Listerine) instead of water alone in the spray with it.    But don&#x27;t get me wrong, despite wearing braces, my hygienist complimented about how clean I maintained my teeth and good part of the credit should go to this device.  If only it was a bit more reliable and user friendly.  So do try it but don&#x27;t expect it to be perfect.</li>
            <li> My last Waterpik was the standard countertop version with a hose.  I thought this would take up less counterspace, and it does, but it is not much fun to use.  The cordless version is just too bulky to be comfortable in use.  Another problem is the tips rotate too easily - it is difficult to keep the stream of water aimed where you want it unless you use both hands, one to hold the unit and the other holding the tip. It also has a fairly weak pump - even fully charged it often stops while using.  Finally, the tank does not hold enough water.  Even on low power setting it is empty before you hit all your teeth. As it empties you need to juggle the unit to keep the pump intake underwater.    All in all, even though the countertop version takes up more space, it is the way to go.</li>
            <li> what a mess! water everywhere, can&#x27;t open your lips to even see what you&#x27;re doing due to all the splashing.  am returning this and buying a sonicare.  hope it works better.</li>
            <li> I have used A Waterpick  device for years, but this model is very easy to use and easy to keep clean!  It takes up less room on the counter, too</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned my Ultra Cordless for about 6 months now, and feel that enough time has gone by to write a review.  Some of categories I have been keeping an eye on are:  1) Battery Charge Intervals 2) Reservoir Size 3) Jet Power  4) Ergonomics  5) Construction Quality  6) Corrosion at recharge terminal  7) Power Switch reliability  8) Noise  9) Transportability  10) Effectiveness of oral irrigation.    1) The battery charge interval is outstanding. I use the unit twice a day on average, and I can go more than three weeks between charges.  Each use of the unit drains the fully filled reservoir.  I let the battery completely discharge through use, then fully recharge on the charger overnight for more than 12 hours.    2) Rerservoir size, on full power setting, is more than adequate to fully irrigate for me.  I find no issues with the size.    3) Jet Power, has two settings.  I use the full power setting, and it seems to have enough power with a fairly strong jet.  When I first started using the Ultra, I had to start on the low setting due to gum sensitivity.    4) The unit has a tapered area that makes it easy to hold.  Also, the tank design weighs the unit such that it is comfortable to the hand.      5) Construction quality seems good, with quality plastics.  It is made in China.    6) Corrosion at recharge terminal.  The terminal socket has pins that are gold plated.  Even though it gets wet during use, there is no corrosion in the terminal socket, as would be expected from gold plated pins.    7) Power on/off switch reliability.  This is a slider switch, and it gets wet during use.  It does not appear to be water proof by way of external examination.  However, it is working fine after 6 months, and doesn&#x27;t appear to be suffering any degradation.  It is something I will continue to keep an eye on.    8) Noise.  The pump makes noise, and any insulation would add weight.  The pump is fairly powerful for a battery powered unit, so some noise is a good engineering compromise. I don&#x27;t find the noise excessive.     9) Transportability.  I take my Ultra on trips and use it at home.  I take off the reservoir tank and pull off the jet tip for transport.  The three small items can pack neatly in your luggage.  I&#x27;m pleased that the unit is easily transportable.    10) Effectiveness.  My gums are much healthier and exhibit a pink color.  If you have red gums, then that means you have some infection setting in.  Irrigating with the Ultra and using a small amount of mouthwash (like Listerene) kills plaque forming bacteria.  The jet removes food particles and some of the mouthwash \\&quot;chemistry\\&quot; gets under the gumline to help preserve gum health.     The niggles are that the jet tip rotates in its socket.  You have to use two hands, one to hold the jet tip at the base, and the other to hold the unit.  The jet tip should be keyed to the knurled collar.  The power switch is a concern for longevity, but this worry could be unwarranted.  It doesn&#x27;t seem obvious how to replace the battery if and when it fails.  Without the niggles, this could be a five star product, but I give four stars for a pretty solid showing.</li>
            <li> Since my sister had experienced far less gum inflammation using a water pik, I purchased one.  I find it much more pleasant to use than dental floss, but since I just got it, will have to wait until next visit to the dentist to see how it&#x27;s working.  However, I enjoy using it, which it motivating.</li>
            <li> This Waterpic Ultra Cordless has improved my dental health at least 50%. I can now clean all the spaces between all my bridework. If you want a clean dental checkup this is a must have.</li>
            <li> I bought my Waterpik Ultra last night and was sad that I was asked to charge it 24 hours prior to first use. But I followed orders and waited patiently until this evening. I just used it for the first time and it was a total mess. I sprayed the walls, the mirror, my face. I forgot to keep my lips parted and ended up spitting water everywhere. I don&#x27;t think I was holding it at the right angle so water poured down my arm and the sleeve of my sweatshirt is soaked. Since it was my first time, I have no idea if I was doing it wrong, or if it&#x27;s just difficult to manage, but even after all that I still LOVE IT.     Since I&#x27;ve only used it once, I&#x27;m not going to comment on the mechanics of it just yet. After a few more uses to see if it gets easier to use, I will review it again. One thing I will comment on right now though, is the water pressure. The people who said it has a weak stream either have a bad model, or gums of steel. On low pressure, it was strong and even stung my gums a couple times. I&#x27;m scared to see what high feels like!    I hate hate hate flossing. My teeth are very close together and I have to wrap floss so tightly around my fingers, they turn purple and bruise. I have to use strand after strand because my teeth shred the floss. I also have TMJ and have a hard time getting my back teeth without my jaw cramping. So even if the Waterpik is messy, and awkward, and I have to constantly refill the reservoir during a session, in my opinion it&#x27;s 110% better than flossing and the fact that it&#x27;s more effective is just a bonus :) I will never use standard floss again. Waterpik is my new best friend &lt;3</li>
            <li> Good convenient product. I wish the water jet could be adjusted to be more forceful</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended the waterpik for my daily dental care, so I bought one for myself and I liked it so much I bought one for my husband, now he&#x27;s addicted to it too. Since our master bathroom is upstairs, I bought a third one to keep it in the powder room downstairs.    By the way, I&#x27;d checked prices prior to puschase and found Amazon not only got the lowest price but also provided free shipping.</li>
            <li> I was really excited about getting this product. I&#x27;ve been using the old \\&quot;travel size\\&quot; water pik for years and thought this would be a great improvement. I was tired of getting the countertops all wet all the time. I read several reviews here of the product. Some of them weren&#x27;t very good at all. However, a few were really good so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.........  The one thing I do like is the portability. I like that it&#x27;s all in one piece. But that&#x27;s all I can say good about it. The pressure is terrible. Worse than my travel pik which is not as strong as a full size pik but I got used to it. It&#x27;s very hard to get the back of your gums. The water tends to get all over the place even though you try to get it to spray in the sink. So that&#x27;s that. I have returned it for a refund and I&#x27;m sticking with my older version.</li>
            <li> We bought this Waterpik Waterflosser Cordless PLUS to take on vacations.  We are on vacation with our new Waterpik and want our money back.  We can swish warm water in our mouths with much more force than this Waterpik can muster.  Waste of money and travel bulk.  Don&#x27;t bother.  (My husband wants me to add it is a piece of expletive.)</li>
            <li> This is the second one of this model we have owned, and we bought it only because we need an oral irrigator to take on trips (we bought the Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser for use at home, and we are pleased with it). The Cordless PLUS has adequate power and enough capacity to do the job, but the inexcusable problem with it is that the connector for the charging cord is totally unprotected from the water that necessarily runs all over the machine while it is in use. The first one we had corroded fairly quickly and became unusable because it stopped charging. Given that this is such an obvious flaw (and I have read it in a number of other reviews), it is hard to imagine why Waterpik has made no effort to come up with a fix.    So why did we buy another one? As I said, we need a portable model and we figure with the relatively little use it will get, it will last long enough before going bad to justify the cost. I also have taken to blowing the water out of the connector after using it, though I doubt that really makes much of a difference (maybe I should take a hairdryer to it!).</li>
            <li> I have used another cordless before and it was horrible.  This is a well balanced pic and works great.  I was very impressed</li>
            <li> Flossing with water does give a more thorough, cleaner feel. However, the pressure of the waterpik (on high setting) feels just enough when the battery if fully charged, and quickly decreases into less than satisfactory. I wish there were more pressure settings or a more stable water pressure throughout the battery life.</li>
            <li> Good product but battery could last langer. I have to recharge it after every 2 or 3 uses (one full reservatory).</li>
            <li> Love it! I have very narrow spaces between teeth and flossing is a chore so I really don&#x27;t do on a daily bases. Since I got the waterpik I do water flossing 2x a day, it is really easy, painless and very efficient.</li>
            <li> After only two months of use the settings were no longer functioning properly, low is the only option at this point.  Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> works great as suggested, not as strong as the large desk unit but good fror trips</li>
            <li> Water pressure is too weak to do what its non-portable cousin does, making it very portable but utterly useless for dental hygiene. Would sooner find ways to make room for AC-only version than even bother with even touching this model. Utterly disappointed.</li>
            <li> Have no idea, I bought this for a friend and she never told me how she liked it, go figure!</li>
            <li> After using another brand for quite some time my wife got this one and likes it a lot more than others she has had.</li>
            <li> Not as powerful as the electric water pick.  However, when traveling this works fine.  More portable - would recommend this unit</li>
            <li> I was told by my dentist to get a water pick to assist with my dental hygiene following cancer treatment.  This seems to be doing the trick never realized how much food residual could be stuck.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt; &amp;#62; portable can easily travel with it&lt;br /&gt; &amp;#62; charge lasts a week using it 2 times a day&lt;br /&gt; &amp;#62; value good price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt; &amp;#62; size makes it a bit difficult to handle w/o splashing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again hope it lasts the long haul</li>
            <li> It took some getting used to when I first started with this device.  More than once I had to change to dry clothes as I sprayed myself good.  I had to send away for the cleaning head I specifically wanted as the ones that came with the pik did not include it.  I am amazed at what washes out of my mouth after a thorough brushing.  I learned a few thing on my own that were not mentioned in the instructions.  First, I do not tolerate cold water so I fill it with a warmer temp that is comfortable to me.  Second, device works best in position that allows the water to feed into the uptake tube in the holding tank.  I developed a technique that allows for this and the pattern lets me keep going without having to stop and start.  Initially, the tank seemed to empty before I was done but now that I have mastered the learning curve I can get the job done without having to refill.  This unit feels a little bulky but once I got used to it , it seems okay.  I&#x27;m not sure this is the best device for kids but works well for adults if you take the time to use it as designed.  I don&#x27;t imagine any of the other brands are any easier to use except for the counter top models where one just has to manage the tube and not a bulky device with a built in tank</li>
            <li> This item does a very good job, is very easy to use, and the charge last a long time.  I only have to recharge it once every ten days or so and I do use it at least once a day every day.</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist told me to start waterpiking because my gums were showing signs of irritation and receding a little. So I bought this and love how convenient it is. It takes up very little counter space. One full charge lasts over a week with daily use. I warm the water prior to putting it in the unit and add a little antiseptic mouth rinse and my mouth feels very clean. My hygienist said it&#x27;s making a difference to my gums too.</li>
            <li> The pik works very good  for me I would  buy this product again. It does a very good job of cleaning the teeth.</li>
            <li> Works great. Get out a lot of plaque. However the tank is not big enough to do the whole mouth. You have to fill it a couple of times.</li>
            <li> When working its great, however I&#x27;m on my 3rd(last) one due to the recharging contacts corroding on it. That happens after 3-6mos of use. They need a flap on the contacts, I use in shower so it gets wet.</li>
            <li> Two years ago I bought this product and it finally stop charging. I ordered a new one and the problems began. First let me say I can&#x27;t live without a waterflosser. They are GREAT... as long as it works. Let me explain my issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Plus two years ago had a triangle shaped power charger plug in. The Plus I purchased this time has a kind of figure eight looking power plug in[ 00 ].. I am guessing the unit is being made by a different company than the one two years ago. The pump on my newest Plus went out in just 7 days. Okay, I sent it back and had another one sent. Well, around 7 days the pump goes out. I have to say the pump pressure on this newer Plus was better than I remembered when I first used the Plus 2 years ago. I really liked it until it blew something inside the pump and the water pressure was so light it was not useable. The second one was just as strong when it went out. I am now trying the third one to see what happens. I will have to update once I give it some time. I am hoping it is all good.  I did not search the reviews here to see if anyone else has had this same issue yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update.... after 3 months use. It looked like my third attempt with this 2nd generation WP 450 would be a success. Not so! While cleaning the pressure was super and then an audible change in the pump and the water pressure dropped dramatically. The pump lasted less than 3 months. It still pumps but not enough to force food from between teeth. The time it takes to run down to zero charge has gone from 10 days to about 7 days or less. Looks like it is time to look for another alternative</li>
            <li> I was so happy when I received the water pik. I shopped around and this was the best price. I received it fast and just love it. If you don&#x27;t have one, you should get one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a waterpik for over 20 years. I purchased the cordless for vacation because it is smaller to pack than the Waterpik Ultra I already have.  It is not as powerful and holds much less water.  It&#x27;s good enough for vacations but I wouldn&#x27;t want to use it every day.</li>
            <li> it takes some getting used to but makes your teeth feel great. add your favorite mouthwash for an additional level of cleanliness!!!</li>
            <li> You have no idea how much disgusting stuff is between your teeth until you buy one of these (even after brushing). I was amazed! My gum health has improved dramatically. My dentist is super impressed since I&#x27;ve been a lifelong &amp;#34;no flosser.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I am happy Waterpik exists! Perfect for cleaning between teeth, especially for cleaning around bridgework. Works fine. Tabletop version holds more water and would run longer. But this handheld one works fine too. You can just add more water if it didn&#x27;t run long enough. Be sure to add warm water. Cold water is shocking!</li>
            <li> Received super quick and works very, very well!</li>
            <li> It is awesome to have something like this on you when you travel. Flossing is great, but it cannot really do as good of a job as an old fashion water stream can.. I usually add some Listerine in my warm water and after that my mouth feels so clean!</li>
            <li> My wife loves it. It works really well.</li>
            <li> I like this product for travel. The resevoir capacity is a little small for my liking. Overall I like the product.</li>
            <li> I have been happy with the Waterpik Cordless Flosser, however the AC/AC Adaptor died in 4 months. I have taken it to a local battery store to be tested as well as an electrical supply vendor. It is fried and drains the flosser within less than 8 seconds. I need a new 3-volt output AC/AC Adaptor. Please help me to locate one if you could. I paid almost $50.00 for this 4 months ago at Target and certainly do not want to purchase another entire unit. Thank you, Violet</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product, until it dies.  I&#x27;m now joining the numerous negative reviewers who have complained, explained and offered solutions to the one glaring problem:  the product becomes unrechargeable  after only a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waterpik&#x27;s engineers may be out to lunch but their Customer Service staff is not.  They ask for your name, address and date of purchase.  A replacement is on your doorstep within a week.  If I have to call Waterpik&#x27;s 800 number every 7 months or so, so be it.  I&#x27;m willing to do that until Waterpik fixes the problem or another excellent, reasonably priced water flosser comes along....</li>
            <li> This gets out particles that flossing just cant reach. Feels great on gums and refreshes. Would recommend for others who have problems with flossing.</li>
            <li> I love the waterpik and it is a complete must have item if you have braces. I use it everyday at work and when traveling.</li>
            <li> works well need to get used to using it however the product works as described and would recommend this to anyone looking for a better way to help clean between teeth</li>
            <li> Just doesn&#x27;t have enough power to really flush out between the teeth.  I suppose it would do in a pinch if you travel a lot, but for everyday use, much better to purchase the standard countertop unit.</li>
            <li> It is acceptable.  I have used another model which I liked better, but this one is OK.  I will keep it.</li>
            <li> This is a decent product.  I&#x27;ve never used a water pick before, so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare to.  It feels a little strange using it instead of floss, but I&#x27;m getting use to the idea.  The battery life lasts about a week which is great, but the water runs out very quickly.  I usually have to refill it 2-3 times.</li>
            <li> I have the original electric Waterpik and love it, but wanted a cordless for mobility.  However, this waterflosser is just too weak to do a decent job.  Not nearly as powerful as my countertop pik.</li>
            <li> Much bigger and bulkier than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> I just returned this item to the store where purchased.  Only when I had opened it did I learn that the BATTERIES ARE NOT REPLACEABLE!&lt;br /&gt;For an item that costs over $50, that is totally unacceptable.  I called customer service to see if my understanding was correct...it was!  Although I was told that the batteries generally last anywhere from 3 to 5 years, the guarantee is for only 2 years, making me doubt that battery claim.  So when the battery goes, you just toss it and get a new one?  A nice arrangement for a profit-hungry corporation, but not so great for the consumer.  People should just stop purchasing these until they come up with a replaceable battery!</li>
            <li> Sloppy when used. Doesn&#x27;t hold enough wate. Would like to return but can&#x27;t find original packing slip!!</li>
            <li> JUST DID NOT LAST.  SOON REPLACED</li>
            <li> very convenient and works well!</li>
            <li> Well, the product is as expected.</li>
            <li> I owned this for probably two years. It&#x27;s handy enough, but often lackluster in power, especially as it aged. The reservoir is small, so initially I felt like I should be reloading it multiple times. Eventually, it just died on me and I&#x27;m trying another manufacturer&#x27;s product as an alternative.</li>
            <li> This unit is pretty bulky, and the water pressure isn&#x27;t as good as the countertop plug in Waterpik, but it does suffice for travel.</li>
            <li> I bought a different model waterpik and have been very disappointed with the device&#x27;s tips quality.  The tips are extremely fragile. if the device tips over, they WILL break.  Mine broke within 2 days.  I contacted Customer Service and was told they would ship me a new set of tips, that was in December 2010, and as of today, Feb 13, 2011, I have not received the replacement tips. I will never buy another waterpik product.</li>
            <li> cordless is nice but: it stopped working after a year. called waterpik and they pretty much told me they dont last long and id just have to toss it and buy a new one.  dont waste your money</li>
            <li> This cordless unit holds too little water and the pressure was simply not strong enough.  The handle feels bulky. I returned it and get another corded one instead.</li>
            <li> this is the \\&quot; new improved \\&quot;portable water pik.It is far inferior to the regular plug in version.Not happy with its performance.</li>
            <li> This is an improved model, last model only lasted 7 months. Only conplant is water tank could be larger, you have to be quick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about the experience of other reviewers but I&#x27;ve had this product for over two years and it is fantastic. My teeth and gums have never felt cleaner. Much better than traditional floss.  My dentist gives me kudos on my at-home maintenance, which I attribute entirely to the Waterpic.  I have a couple of crowns and an implant and this is essential to keep those in good condition.    Here&#x27;s some responses to other concerns:    Sound level:  It is not silent but the sound isn&#x27;t particularly loud. About the same as an electric tooth brush.    Portability: It says its a travel waterpic and I guess technically it is.  It comes with a carrying case and I took it on a recent cruise.  However, its not really good for short trips or on airlines because its fairly large.  If you are comfortable carrying a travel hair dryer this will work for you but if you are a \\&quot;don&#x27;t check my baggage\\&quot; type, use traditional floss when you travel.    Battery Power:  A charged battery lasts about a week to 10 days. It charges fully overnight.  In my mind this is pretty good.  As I said I&#x27;ve had it for 2 years and not had to replace the battery yet.  That&#x27;s also good in my book.    Water capacity:  It holds enough water to clean your mouth.  It isn&#x27;t like the larger waterpics where you fill it once and use it multiple times. To my mind this is better. I want to use fresh water every time. There&#x27;s plenty to clean your mouth, front and back, all the way around, a few times on a fill. I spend extra time around my dental work and always have plenty of water. Not sure what other people are using it for that they need more than that. If you do, buy the countertop unit with the large water container.    Fair warning:  Don&#x27;t start the unit until it is in your mouth. Otherwise water will spray everywhere. Also be standing over your sink so that you can let the water flush out and down the drain.  I don&#x27;t recommend doing this after you&#x27;ve dressed for work.  Once you get the hang of it there&#x27;s no issues at all but the first time....  Also, if you have kids hide the unit.   There is no better water fight than dueling waterpics.</li>
            <li> This is a nice little product, and it works very well.  I bought it for my daughter who is now wearing braces, and it is the BEST way to get them to floss daily.  Yes, it does run out of water quickly (as stated in one review), but simply fill it up while you are showering and press on. It does exactly what it says it does and you &amp; your dentist can definately see the difference!!  Happy flossing :)</li>
            <li> This is the second Waterpik that I have purchased and the last. I love the way it works, but there is a fatal design flaw- water always gets into the battery contacts and rusts them out. They don&#x27;t seem to be reparable and I sure can&#x27;t figure out a way to keep them dry. I&#x27;m switching to one with batteries that are replaceable.</li>
            <li> When I purchased the waterpik I assumed that the rechargeable battery will last for a couple of years. But it died just after 13 months! That is really bad!</li>
            <li> Kinda bulky to use, but it works better than string flossing (or those silly picks with the tiny bit of floss on the u-shaped end)&lt;br /&gt;I have my wisdom teeth, didn&#x27;t need them taken out, &amp; this really is the only way I can really get back there to clean the area.&lt;br /&gt;If you have a sensitivity to string floss, use the low setting. I have made my self bleed a bit once, but it was most likely a bit of plaque build up &amp; infection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit pricey, but if you can seem to reach a spot in your mouth, this will most likely do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons: no case or storage help&lt;br /&gt;  A bit bulky&lt;br /&gt;  Don&#x27;t know how long it will last (3 months &amp; counting at the moment)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Great clean for hard spots</li>
            <li> Works as well as the big one but its is easily stored without cleaning and drying so you simply do use it more. Rechargeable. Just great.</li>
            <li> this is exactly what I wanted in a product.  I will give more information once the gift has been given and the recipient responds.</li>
            <li> Have had waterpik product in the past with the wand attached to tubing. The tube-free cordless model is easier to manipulate around the mouth. he only drawback is the limited capacity of the reservoir, but refilling it is quick and easy.</li>
            <li> I had this model for the previous 3 years with no issues other than it wore out. I think this newer version does not have as much pressure as my older model.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews of others here before buying this model and am happy with it.  Powerful: I like it.</li>
            <li> Had it for about two years now and the battery will not recharge. Called the Waterik Manufactuer about it and they tried to say it was something I did, like leave it on the sink counter while taking hot showers the steam may have gotten to it HA,HA. worked real good when it Worked. BAD PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I loved the Waterpik Waterflosser and bought the Cordless PLUS to take on my frequent travel. At first the battery would last for a 2-3 day trip - then it would not hold any charge so I had to take the charger with me and use the device plugged in. Now it has stopped working completely - all of this in less than 12 months.</li>
            <li> Pretty cheap, pretty loud, doesn&#x27;t hold much water, leaks, charge lasts for very little time so has to be plugged in all the time anyway.  We ordered this as we have an antique sink/no countertop space, and thought this could tuck away conveniently in a little cabinet.  But not worth it, just get the bulkier plug-in version.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended it because of the position of my gums. It does the job as described. I&#x27;d recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;</li>
            <li> the device does not hold a charge. It was fine for the first couple of weeks, then I found myself charging it more often. After 3 months, it is now completely dead. I do not recommend this item</li>
            <li> This product is inadequate and unsatisfactory.  It&#x27;s messy, leaks water everywhere; the jet power is extremely low and inadequately cleans.  Not recommended!</li>
            <li> Easy to take along travelling.  Not as forceful as the original waterpik model.  Just use it a little longer for the same results.  Use it every night and it is doing the job.</li>
            <li> Great Product!! Thank you.</li>
            <li> Good idea in theory but not good in practice. Battery runs out (OR) the thing just loses strength and you can feel it when it shooting out water into your gums. I&#x27;m just going to get me the wired one. I rather my have healthy strong guns and not lose teeth than to have a minor convenience. My teeth, gums and smile are WAY more important.</li>
            <li> Water runs out of the tank quite fast but the rest is so far so good. Lets wait and see how long will it last</li>
            <li> I personally needed a cordless even though I knew it wouldn&#x27;t hold as much water in one use &amp; it&#x27;s been fine. I think once you get the hang of using it the amount of water it holds is enough to get the job done. I charged it for 24 hours initially &amp; two weeks later it&#x27;s still charged. I wish there was a battery indicator on it to let you know how much charge is left though. Depending on your needs &amp; wants I&#x27;d would probably recommend it.</li>
            <li> looks like and performs like new.</li>
            <li> Poorly made product and it uses water quickly even when filled to fill capacity. You need to use it fast before the water runs out.  It also broke after a few months. I replaced it with the larger non-portable waterpik which I&#x27;ve had for a couple years and is so much more convenient. Skip this one and go for the original waterpik.</li>
            <li> This product does everything needed to keep your gums in excellent shape. I would highly recommend this product to any of my friends or family.</li>
            <li> This is my second one.  It really seems to make a difference when I go to the dentist.  Less pockets and peridontal disease has been eliminate.</li>
            <li> Have not been able to use it because it will not charge up.Only just emigrated to Australia and I now have to try and sort this out not happy about this at all.</li>
            <li> I thought this product would be good for cleaning my teeth BUT I used it (only twice) and the water was every where, had to clean my mirror adn my coun ter top both times I used it. Also, I had to floss my teeth afterwards because I still had stuff in my teeth!!</li>
            <li> It looks and works exactly like the write up said!  Very happy!  Arrived very quickly and I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The initial learning curve using this almost had me returning it. After a few uses, I figured it out. Not only does it clean debris between teeth and gums, it has removed a lot of a patch of tarter in just a few days with twice a day use. My electric toothbrush and floss, just do not clean the lower gun line as this does. Really amazing.</li>
            <li> Works good, very effective and conveniently portable. Very easy to use and great product for the price.  I would recommend it to anyone who is very mobile.</li>
            <li> I have a WaterPik at home and I bought this for the office. I was concerned that having to refill every 45 seconds would be annoying but it&#x27;s definitely not. I think this might be bulky to carry around everyday, but if you leave this in the office it enables you to floss easily even when away from home.</li>
            <li> For people who have debris that gets caught in the very back and also this does a better job of removing plaque below the gum line than flossing.  This second generation model is much better than the first. Larger reservoir. Excellent cordless battery. Last 1 week using every morning and night.</li>
            <li> Used the product six times and now there is hardly any pressure. I am going to be returning it and going with one that actually will continue working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked well while it was still functioning.</li>
            <li> This newer version holds the battery charge much longer. It sits on the shelf in the shower ready to use every morning!</li>
            <li> This is my third Waterpik Waterflosser. When the battery dies, I get a new one because I like it. The expiring battery is one thing people complain about, but I don&#x27;t feel that way. I know from other products that rechargeable batteries don&#x27;t last forever. I think my last one survived about 3 years, so thats about 3 cents a day. If it lasts less than 2 years, Waterpik will replace it, so keep your proof of purchase.Using this product once at night has greatly improved my gum health.</li>
            <li> I have used waterpik for a long time they are great for keeping the &amp;#34; pockets &amp;#34; below the gums clean i uses mine with some peroxide.  to take a traditional product with you was totally impractical because of size.  This one has good features size, variability strength of jet, Filling is easy, charging is easy.  Cons have to charge every day, taking the tank off be gentle, cleaning is kind of hard because of shape of tank but you could not do better.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for our old one.  This time I&#x27;ll leave it plugged in when not in use.  The battery is not replaceable.  We&#x27;ve become quite attached to our WaterPiks.</li>
            <li> For those who are thinking of buying this product to replace flossing, don&#x27;t! This water flosser is too weak to remove small pieces of food stuck in  your teeth.</li>
            <li> This is a piece of junk.  It stopped working after the first couple uses.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT PRICE &amp; MY DENTIST SAYS MY GUMS LOOK LIKE A TEENAGERS!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing product, personal dentist at home</li>
            <li> Works great.  I use it every day as an alternate to flossing.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this daily.  She is very happy with how it works, but after 1-2 years enough water leaks inside to corrode the battery/motor.  First time it happened I got a warranty replacement, which was nice.  Still would prefer they sealed the unit better.  Other users commented on problem with charger connection; I have not seen that.</li>
            <li> So far good, will see how well it is working when I go back for a check up.  My friend swears that this has improved her gums.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so handy.  I don&#x27;t have to keep it on the counter and it rarely needs charging..  It hold just enough water for one use.</li>
            <li> Replaced an earlier model that had a larger water tank, but this version is compact and cordless.  Reservoir could be larger, but satisfied.</li>
            <li> I had the big bulky waterpik and got aggravated with the tubing, so I donated that one and bought this…. I use it more often - although not often enough - than I did the other one.  Yes, its bulky and it would be nice if there was more water in the tank, but if there was, you wouldn&#x27;t be able to manipulate it very well.  Love the fact that its so portable.</li>
            <li> When I first got it I thought it was a bit bulky and didn&#x27;t hold much water. After using the flossed for a few weeks I find it does a nice job. It&#x27;s nice not to be tethered to a tank. And it holds a charge for over a week.the tank seems to hold just enough to do the job.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed, no power, works poorly.&lt;br /&gt;I lost my money and my time buying this product&lt;br /&gt;Advice, save your money!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only weakness is his 120V only adapter. It would be 120-240V to work everywhere.</li>
            <li> This handheld model is necessarily bulky since it houses the water tray, so it is a bit clumsy to hold.  Also, it ususally requires 2 fillings to finish the job.  However, it works very well and recovers hidden food particles all of the time.</li>
            <li> very very convenient. while the water tank is not as big as the table model, it refills in a snap. would be better if it came with a travel bag for the different heads. very pleased.</li>
            <li> I am giving the item 3 stars because there was a charging issue with the models of WP 450 that had the two prongs together.  I used my original unit for about 18 months before it became impossible to charge.  After searching on Amazon I discovered the reviews from numerous user that had the same problem.  Indeed, the male prongs on my unit showed some corrosion and the female plug did not seem to be a tight fit any more....just as noted  in a number of AMAZON reviews.  I really liked the unit (4 stars at least) and in considering alternatives I looked on Waterpik&#x27;s site and noted that a replacement part was sold for the female charger unit that did not look like the two prongs of the older unit that I had.  Replacement parts were not being sold for the original unit nor was anything noted on the site about the original model.  I called and spoke with a company rep and they claimed there were no problems with the unit&#x27;s design and could not or would not tell me if the replacement part reflected a change in design aimed at correcting the issue that so many reviewers have discussed.  So I looked in my local stores at the Sonicare unit but rejected it because I like the fact that the Waterpik also stimulates the gums not just removes debris between the teeth.  So I finally looked at the WP 450.  The photo on the box looks exactly like the original unit so I had the store open the box so I could see if changes had been made.  I am happy to report that Waterpik has changed the design to two separate prongs and the female charging unit has likewise been changed.  Now there is a nice tight fit with the charging unit.  I admit that I purchased the unit locally rather than on Amazon because I was not sure that the unit on Amazon would be the re-designed unit or the old original.  Note picture on the box.  By the way, the AMAZON price is the best around.  I am hopeful that the charging issue has been helped by this design change but it is too soon to tell.  I do plan on usingadhesive tape to cover the area where the prongs are when I use it.  Not not cellophane tape, more like that on a band aide.  Cheap and available.</li>
            <li> I bought this one because of the cordless aspect... makes it very convenient to use. I take it into the shower with me so there is no mess. I  like it  so far. It works better than flossing. The only drawback is that I wish the resevoir had about 30% more capacity. I just about get around all of the teeth once when the resevoir empties.</li>
            <li> Great product ,very convienent .Compact so its very easy to carry on the road with you and maintain your dental health !</li>
            <li> I feel that it was worth buying . It exceeded my expectations . I highly recommend this product to anybody that wants the best !</li>
            <li> It does a good job cleaning between teeth at the gum line.  It does just what the dentist told me it would do.</li>
            <li> Liked cordless feature for ease of use and smaller profile for counter space, however jet stream was simply too weak compared to old corded model I was replacing. Exhanged it for new  corded model whose performance is far superior.</li>
            <li> Second unit purchased. Personally find cordless units very easy to use Wish the 4 tips were all the same rather than 4 different styles as only use standard type and spare tips are good to have (replacements at $10 each justify just buying a new unit)</li>
            <li> I suppose, if I were attempting to use this thing for a water gun fight, I might find myself a little disappointed by how much water it holds or, rather, how quickly it cycles through the water. As that isn&#x27;t the case, this does a good job at exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> The product was great at first, but if you have weak gums, this should not be your first answer to healing your gums. There are only two pressure settings on this waterflosser, so I would advise getting the original one that has 10 settings (or however many settings it has). Even at low pressure, it can hurt your gums, and trust me, it is painful. If you have strong gums, however, then yes, I would believe this flosser works quite well without much pain. Like what some reviewers said, this is not entirely replacement for regular flossing. Be gentle when you floss manually. You have no control over how gentle the pressure is on this flosser.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as an alternative to a full sized model, mostly due to space requirements on my sink/vanity. I was concerned about the performance as compared to a unit that has AC power and a bigger tank but I have to say it performs well and after using it for the allotted time you get with each fill, about 45 seconds, I realized there really is no need for more time/bigger tank. I can more than adequately clean my entire mouth in the time it takes for the tank to empty. If you are looking for or need more time then this unit may not be for you.Cleaning the unit itself is simple and charging is as easy as plugging it in overnight.     Great product, works well, worth the money.</li>
            <li> If you want to use a Waterpik this is the one to buy.   I was hesitant to order this after seeing all the bad reviews. I have to say I love it. I have had one of the old style, sit on the counter units. They were always a pain because they were in the way and would slide all over. This is the only way to go. Some of the problems make  me wonder. The one said it was loud, coffee grinder loud. Either she has never owned a coffee grinder or there was something wrong with her unit. It&#x27;s not loud at all. It makes less noise than any electric razor I have ever had.   As to the head moving I don&#x27;t have any trouble. If you want to push it against the teeth, then you can easily use one finger to steady it but I don&#x27;t need too.  As to it not running long enough, this one really leaves me wondering. It is so easy to fill who cares? If you want to use it longer than one tank lasts, it takes seconds to refill again.   Bottom line is this is a huge improvement over the counter top models of old.</li>
            <li> I Love that I found this so I can take it along with me when I travel, this does a great job!</li>
            <li> It works very well and does what it is supposed to, the only problem I have with it is it runs out of water rather quickly when you run it on the high setting.</li>
            <li> My intent was to purchase a Waterpik which was compatible with European voltage.  Unfortunately, the item I purchased can be used only in Canada and the USA, even when an adapter is used.  Waterpik does carry a model which is suitable for my travel needs, but that model was not available at Amazon.com.  The Waterpik model which explicitly states 100- 240 VAC is required for my travel destination.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t actually used this product yet, but I felt compelled to leave a high rating for this just because of all the low ratings I&#x27;m reading from people who are not reviewing how the product actually performs but on how it doesn&#x27;t work in different countries or how bad the seller was or how they got a defective product, which will happen with every product. It really makes me mad when I read reviews that have nothing at all to do with the product itself but other problems people have with their purchase. I love this site because I can come on here and read reviews and inform myself before making a purchase. Don&#x27;t worry, I will come back and adjust my review after I have tried this product and give an honest review on how well this product performs.</li>
            <li> It works really well.  I have caps, crowns and implants and the water pick is efficient and gentle on my gums.</li>
            <li> Battery dies quickly. Doesn&#x27;t do as good as a job as flossing.</li>
            <li> 6 months after purchase it won&#x27;t hold a full charge or operate at full power any more. Won&#x27;t buy another.</li>
            <li> Having braces sucks period especially when you want to floss but using a waterpik makes flossing a breeze.  At first it&#x27;s a little weird having this thing squirt water in your mouth and drip out but you get used to it.  My dentist gave me one of these and when my girlfriend got her braces I bought her one for Christmas. I will continue to use this after my braces come off.  Definitely recommend!!</li>
            <li> I had to change the battery, but is working as spected</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dental hygienist, who has one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this instrument to anyone who wants to ensure effective plaque removal, healthier gums therefore the need for less dental work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A charge should last about a week. This tool is a little bigger than an electric toothbrush as the water reservoir is in the base of the instrument.The whole thing is very convenient to use.</li>
            <li> great for traveling.... Use the bigger one for home.</li>
            <li> I loved the flosser, but have not been able to get it to charge. I live overseas, so I&#x27;m charging it on a converter. Maybe that&#x27;s the problem, but it will just not charge whatever the reason....and because I&#x27;m over here, it&#x27;s difficult to return it.</li>
            <li> I had a large Waterpik flosser before but did not like the coiled water tube.  I like this one better.</li>
            <li> Works perfeclly per the instructions!  Better for the gums than standard flissing.  Faster as well.  I would reccoment it to anyone!</li>
            <li> My husband loved it. I purchased mine in a local store it was ok. This one for Hubble was much better than mine. I&#x27;ll check amazon next time first</li>
            <li> When it is working properly it is great.  I find that the unit lasts about one year before it starts to lose power and becomes less effective.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted....sits unobtrusively on my counter..ready to use several times a day without having to haul out from under my sink, my old reservoir model..which is too large for the counter.  Easy to charge and then put cord away for 7 to 12 uses before charging again.  I had to download the instruction manual because it didn&#x27;t come with all the info on removing the reservoir, rotating tip while in use, etc. but I&#x27;ve been using it for a week and only just read the complete info and its even better now!  You get used to the clunkyness..which it is, at first.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with my item.   CONS: The only hitch, which I blame the manufacturer, is there are only 2 settings for the water flow, high or low. 7 oz is a lot of fluid but it goes fast because of the flow settings even with the narrowest attachment being used. The item is not ergonomic for your hands so keep that in mind when choosing between portability or the counter top type. I opted for cordless portability. Filling up the item can be tricky since you have to hold it horizontal then stop filling just before the opening. The average is 7oz but may be a tad less.  PROS: The water flow is strong, particularly from the narrowest tip but it does get the water flushing around the teeth and gums and you will have to be careful not to end up spraying all over the counter. You MUST lean over the sink so the water will jet out correctly from the item and let the sink catch the overflow from the process.   The stopper, such as it is, works well as it has an o-ring to help prevent leaking.  Overall, I am pleased with the purchase although I have yet to see if the container is removable for cleaning.</li>
            <li> After about 14 months the battery will not hold a charge for more than a couple uses, then has to be recharged for a day. Otherwise I liked it. I think I will have to try the power-cord model next.</li>
            <li> neat oral hygiene tool</li>
            <li> This product works great - when it works - which isn&#x27;t very often.  When it runs down it will not recharge - takes me a minimum of 3 tries to get it to really charge.  Should have been recalled! I finally just quit using.  Back to manual until someone has a better product! The lowest they would let me give is one star!</li>
            <li> I bought this article on December 2010. I used it regularly and it is actually a great device. Mouth gets clean, the water speed is very good. However, some 2 weeks ago, when the warranty year expired, it works for not more than 10 seconds after a recharge of more than 5 hours. The battery spoilled... and my money too...</li>
            <li> Works well but there is no good way to clean the tank.</li>
            <li> I have had mine for almost a year and it will not hold a charge. At most, I get one good use out of it before I have to plug it in again. I do not over-charge it because I know that decreases the life of the battery. I should be able to use it at least 2-3 times before having to charge it again instead of the one time that I&#x27;m currently getting. When it&#x27;s working, it works great.</li>
            <li> I have orthodontic braces and this works great.  I took it to my office and now I don&#x27;t have to worry about a &#x27;clean&#x27; mouth when I go to meetings...</li>
            <li> Easy to use, effective and reliable!  I bought one for everyone in my family.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe this is being sold.  It&#x27;s sad to know that big corporations like WaterPik are still in business selling their worthless plastic cheap junk.  CEO should be locked away for this crime against humanitiy.</li>
            <li> This is the second item in 6 weeks that has lost &amp;#34;High&amp;#34; pressure in just a few weeks of use.  I will now try the non-cordless version.</li>
            <li> It is okay, but toilete tree is much better. It is on 110-220 Volts, which is much better for me.</li>
            <li> Best product ever I bought for my health. In one week my bleeding stoped. After one month of daily use it works fine. I bought this portable version because I do the charge with a voltage converter and use the big unit with the converter close to the lavatory was not an option.</li>
            <li> I purchased this flosser in July, 2013.  I have taken excellent care of it, use it according to directions, and it has now stopped working. I am extremely disappointed in this product.  The design is poor.  It works beautifully in the beginning and then the charge doesn&#x27;t last as long as it should, and then it dies.  I would not recommend this product unless you can buy a new one every few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to inform the manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I have now informed the manufacturer.  They were not helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have photographed the inside of this unit and will be contacting Waterpik again and again until they pay attention to my complaints.  There is rust.  The motor is dead. The battery is dead.  As I said above, I have owned this since July of 2013.  I have never written a negative product review on Amazon - until now. This is the worse piece of garbage I have ever owned.  It is unsafe.  If you are fortunate enough to have a unit that works, good for you.  But beware - look at what lurks next to your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Study the other reviews before you purchase this.</li>
            <li> It works fine.  I am just now starting to use it we have experienced some plumbing problems and our water supply has been effected..</li>
            <li> Six months after purchase, the unit died (the battery won&#x27;t charge) - this is the second unit I&#x27;ve owned that failed this way. One Amazon reviewer offers advice about replacing the power cord with a comparable model from Radio Shack...but for me, that&#x27;s too much trouble - I expect products at this price point to last for at least a couple of years. My advice is to stay away - mine is going into the trash and I will be investigating other brands.</li>
            <li> They still haven&#x27;t fixed the design flaw that diminishes battery life much too quickly. I barely get one use out of it after charging for several hours.</li>
            <li> Messy! Gets all over the sink area. You have to be careful though, because after one dentist told me it&#x27;s great to use to prevent gum disease, another dentist told me it could cause problems by allowing food stuck between teeth to get moved to other pockets between gums. He made me scared after telling me that. So now I rarely use it.</li>
            <li> Works great best price very happy</li>
            <li> Still going strong after a year. I keep in my shower and use in the evening and charge lasts about a week.</li>
            <li> I really like my waterpik.  My mouth and teeth feel much cleaner and I am very satisfied with it.  I use it twice a day.</li>
            <li> Not enough pressure to actually do anything, the regular ones by waterpik are far more effective. I wish i didn&#x27;t throw out the box so i could have returned it</li>
            <li> as advertised. arrived promptly</li>
            <li> Years ago we had an AC powered Waterpik.  Waterpiks are great for cleaning braces.  The also are great for flushing pockets in the gums which develop as we grow older.  The AC powered unit had a large removable water tank and a spring loaded coiled semi-flexible hose connecting to the hand wand.  The hose never recoiled properly, was stiff, broke, and sometime the unit sprayed water all over the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first experience with the hand held battery powered unit.  It does not hold as much water and the water pressure is not quite as high as the AC units, but all is more than adequate.  I really prefer the battery unit.  There is a switch right on the wand where you need it most. Almost every night I can see it flush pieces of lettuce, nuts, meat, etc from between my teeth.  The stuff may be wedged so I can&#x27;t see it in the mirror, but this unit flushes it out.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I have the water pik in my house so i decide to buy this for travelling. but it didnt was a good idea. I carry it and couldnt use it at all!</li>
            <li> I really like the way it works. Living off the grid, I&#x27;m picky about electrical appliances. This fits in well with the other battery powered tools that I charge with my pv panels through the small inverter.</li>
            <li> Was I wrong on not having one like this before! The level of cleaning this kind of thing does is simply amazing; use it twice a day, never had such a great cleaning experience. Is so much that goes away when you use it, and I&#x27;ve already improved my dental care, so much that my dentist is also amazed. I bought it on my dentist&#x27;s recommendation, and I&#x27;m getting another one for travel. Highly advisable to use this! (especially if you don&#x27;t flush or have sensitive gums).</li>
            <li> Bought this for our young son with braces.  The water level lasts the whole cycle and he likes the different spray patterns.  We like this much better than the old waterpik with the wand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using mine for the past week and I love it!!  Soooo easy to use and feels so good.  Really gets between the teeth and into the gum line!!!  It holds a lot of water, is great even on the low setting and my dentist told me that using this will do my gums a world of good.  I have a problem with my gums getting inflammed where there are crowns and I can&#x27;t always get between the teeth to clean.  My gums get inflammed and sore and this absolutely solved the problem.  It&#x27;s the first time in 6 months (when I got my last root canal) that I have not been in pain from the inflammation.  I would recommend this product to everybody!!! And the price for all this goodness...amazing!  And as for good dental health...PRICELESS!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this Waterpik for a couple of weeks now and I have to say I love it!  Some reviews I read questioned water pressure adequacy, but I think it&#x27;s just right.  Teeth and gums are clean with no pain.  What more can you ask?</li>
            <li> Very powerful and substatial.  I like the variety of tips that come with the product.  I refill the water chamber twice, sometimes three times, but this is no big deal; I just love the clean feeling, plus I eat a lot of fibrous veggies and fruits.  I previously had a portable Panasonic, which I loved, but after a year the plastic started creating an odor.  So this WATERPIK is my new love.  I keep it charging in between uses (daily) and the power is. mighty. Easy to grip, though it is larg-ish.  Would be somewhat cumbersome to travel with(its not exactly portable), but I&#x27;ll find a way.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this Waterpik for about 10 months now, and it no longer holds a charge. Rather than throw it out, I decided to pull it apart to see if it could be repaired. It seems the charging function is \\&quot;stupid,\\&quot; in that there appears to be no means by which the Waterpik can know when it is fully charged, and thus stop sending current to the batteries. I cannot know if this is the cause of the inability to charge, but I do know that overcharging can degrade batteries.</li>
            <li> It was recommended by my dentist.  Am glad she did.  It does as advertised</li>
            <li> I am 74 and it is too bulky for me to handle. It is not what i expected and i have only tried it once. I am sending it back and going to get another style.</li>
            <li> This is the second WaterPik that I purchases and I love them and I have noticed that my teeth feel real good when I use them! I  also love the low price on the attachments. They even now have a cover which is cool!</li>
            <li> 3rd one and it&#x27;s lready broken.</li>
            <li> I purchased one and my daughter purchased one. She enjoys it. Me ... not so much, because I had used a previous model (same company) that had more pressure for cleaning. I ended up giving this away and purchasing another model because it did have more &amp;#34;oomph&amp;#34;. For me ... I would give 3 stars because it was not as powerful as I wanted. BUT, my daughter never used a previous model so this feels right to her. Maybe her rating would be a 5 star, so I compromised with the 4 stars</li>
            <li> excellent product. I like it.</li>
            <li> Over a year and the product just won&#x27;t charge anymore. 2 times this has happened.</li>
            <li> very loud, and water leaks out</li>
            <li> The water pin works fine, the design is terrible, the connector to recharge gets contaminated by the water while in use and it stops charging, I had to start using without removing the cord but it is a nuisance.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended to use a waterflosser instead of a regular floss. He said that regular did not reach all the places between teeth and gingival pockets. I&#x27;ve made a long research on different brands and types of waterflosses. I chose that product because of its size and price. But now I can say that it perfectly does its job. Much, much better than regular floss. It is cordless and not big, I can travel with it. The battery life is very good. Also it looks smart :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I surely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The first one we bought had the motor seize up so we bought a replacement.  Works better than the original even when the original was new.</li>
            <li> It works great while it works.. My first one died in 2 months and the second one in 6 months. It just stops charging and goes to waste. Trying ToiletTree now, will let you know how it goes.</li>
            <li> Very difficult to dump water out of water reservoir.  Water will eventually mildew in the bottom.  Would not recommend purchasing and I am a dental hygienist!</li>
            <li> Very happy; can&#x27;t wait to use it!</li>
            <li> I bought the newer version and just love it. It really helps keep my teeth clean since I am wearing braces now and I have some bridges that are hard to keep food out from under it. I read the reviews on it and found that the complaints of water every where was true but only if you don&#x27;t keep your head over the sink. It sprays water just like the larger tank water pic so there&#x27;s no getting by that. The newer and larger version which holds more water is the perfect size. I have plenty of water for flossing. Just love it.</li>
            <li> Just the prefect item and cost.</li>
            <li> To clean deep gum pocket daily, this is the one nothing else can replace. I mix mouth wash and water to do the clean. Very good result, much much better than flossing.</li>
            <li> I originally ordered this for my son who had braces. I tried it and fell in love with it!  It holds 40 seconds worth of water,  and that is all you need. 40 seconds to floss your teeth. Really.  I thought it was too good to be true,  so I withheld rating it until I had been to the Dentist twice. I see my regular Dentist and a Periodontist both. At both visits,  I had less plaque and tarter buildup than I had when using floss. Both hygenists were impressed,  and so am I. I truely thought my gums would suffer. They did not. If anything, my checkups were better and SHORTER. I cannot recommend this enough! I should mention I use the \\&quot;plaque seeker\\&quot; tip. Seems to really do the trick.</li>
            <li> I love it.  It works great and shoots out water with enough power to get out trapped food after brushing.  I use it almost every day because it&#x27;s easy to use.  It is bulky though so it takes up extra space in your travel kit. But don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll find anything that works as well.</li>
            <li> Okay. Is there a better portable water flosser is market?? --Nope. But does this help you for for most part, I will let you decide for yourself--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) How long does it last after one charge - a week, given i floss 3-5 times/day (good battery storage so far)&lt;br /&gt;2) Does it clean my teeth - yes&lt;br /&gt;3) is the design awkward to fill water - yes (its not flexible to move or turn or twist the water tank)&lt;br /&gt;4) how bad is design? How much water does it use bcoz of horizontal filling - 90-95% (pretty much all water can be used)&lt;br /&gt;5) how many times i have to fill the tank for one time floss - 1-3 times depending on what i eat and if i brushed before flossing (really can you complain abt it ;-)&lt;br /&gt;6) can i take in my wallet or purse - No (too big for that)&lt;br /&gt;7) can i take it in my back pack to school/office - absolutely yes (not too big for a pocket in back pack)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have owned it for few months now and i absolutely cann&#x27;t live without it :)...</li>
            <li> I got this thing from Costco as part of a kit that has the normal plug in to the wall one, and this cordless one. I CANNOT say enough good stuff about the plug in one. This thing, however, is a festival of suck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-battery life is total and absolute crap. expect to get 1 use with full power, and then it tapers off to worthless in about 5 uses.&lt;br /&gt;-the reservoir is too small. if you&#x27;re doing a quickie job it&#x27;s not. if you&#x27;re being thorough, it is TOOOOOO SMALLLLL.&lt;br /&gt;-the high isn&#x27;t very high. the plug in one has a 1-10 pressure adjuster. when my cordless was new, &#x27;high&#x27; on it was about equal to &#x27;7&#x27;. before it finally became unusable, it was like &#x27;3&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;-it takes too long to charge. for something that i can only use for like 6 minutes before it requires charging, it would be nice if said charging took less than a couple hours.&lt;br /&gt;-the battery self-discharges quickly. if you charge it up, and then wanna use it after a couple weeks...too bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If i had gotten this from wal-mart, and it had cost 9.99, i would be much less annoyed by all of its shortcomings. But seriously, this thing just sucks. The fact that it did actually work, and kinda decently, for a couple months, is the only reason it didn&#x27;t get a 1-star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING! GEEK LEVEL ANALYSIS AHEAD:&lt;br /&gt;I work on electronics for a living, so i know a thing or two. When this thing&#x27;s battery died, i took it apart to figure out what went wrong. It&#x27;s poorly designed. The charger doesn&#x27;t create DC power, which is what ALL batteries charge on. No, it converts 110vac to 3vac, and then uses a diode to sorta kinda turn that into pulsed DC, and THAT is what charges it. I think this explains the long charge times and the lame battery life. So, to &#x27;fix&#x27; it, i took the battery out, and modified it so that the charging cord hooked straight to the motor, and set up a few Dcell batteries to act as its power source. That&#x27;s working ok so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*update - died a few weeks after my D cell mod.extra amps and volts probably fried the motor.</li>
            <li> I have many crowns in my mouth. Flossing and brushing did not get the small particles at the base of my crowns. Using the waterpik, I see many small particles being removed!!!</li>
            <li> The Waterpik Waterflosser Cordless PLUS has been exactly what we needed. It does the job and is relatively easy to use.</li>
            <li> I liked this cordless water pik. Not to big to be packed in a trip and not too heavy for daily use. The water capacity is adequate. My only problem was that when I ordered it, it did not specify that it a 110V only or it wasn&#x27;t too clear and I missed it. I needed an autovolt - which most products these days are - or a 220V item. The accessories that came with it - 3 extra picks - were good. Other than that, the water pick is great and priced correctly from my perspective.</li>
            <li> This is a great item. So great that I ordered a number of them to carry in my own store! Even after flossing this unit will dislodge food between teeth and gums. I&#x27;ve had no problems and have used it for over a year. I add some Listerine with warm water leaving an extra actual and clean feeling.</li>
            <li> I keep this this waterpik at work. My teeth and gums are clean all them time. The water presser is a little to strong.</li>
            <li> This was a great little water pik!  I was amazed at how much better it cleaned my teeth than just regular flossing.  Sadly the plastic water reservoir cracked at the seam after about 4 1/2 months of use.  I will not purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Water tank capacity is too small to hold enough water for one cleaning cycle.</li>
            <li> I chose the Waterpik Waterflosser over the product from Sonicare based on the customer reviews. It was a very good decision and my gums feel healthy and well taken care of. The gadget does not take up too much space on the bathroom counter and is very easy to use. My only (small) complaint would be that although the water reservoir seems big, it empties very fast because it sprays a lot of water, even on the low setting. I usually fill it twice more before I feel really finished. That being said though, even with 2 or 3 run-throughs, the process is still quicker and far more pleasant than using dental floss.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had two of these for traveling. The first one died after a year and probably a total of 25 days&#x27; use. The second one just died after about two years and roughly 50 days&#x27; use. The second one never did work properly -- the nozzle always was in free float: you had to hang on to it to keep it pointed in the right direction. The price for this incredibly cheaply made trash is unconscionable. Happily it looks as if some of Water Pik&#x27;s patents are expiring. I think I&#x27;ll be able to buy a replacement from some other outfit this time.</li>
            <li> My mouth has never felt cleaner ! Amazing I can&#x27;t believe I went so long without using one, thank goodness my new dentist recommended it! You won&#x27;t be disappointed (easy set up)</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. I take it everywhere nonetheless being a bit bulky.</li>
            <li> I love the clean feeling after using a waterpik and my gums are so much healthier.  I used to use the full size model - this one sounded more convenient. Be warned - at first you will squirt water everywhere.  It is harder to manipulate the entire large container attached to the little end than it is to manipulate the end at the end of a narrow hose.  And it will run out of water unless you time your squirts… you can get a good shot between every tooth, inside and out and then the water reservoir itself it out.  I still highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Glad I bought this water flosser for our three week trip.  It does a good job helping me care for my gum-line pockets; however, it is dificult to fill the tank without spillage and the discharge runs off the tank and gets everywhere.  I will continue using it on future trips.</li>
            <li> This product leaves us short of satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;The water reservoir leaks when the Waterpik Cordless is tipped to clean the teeth.  The unit lacks power; even at the highest setting, the stream is sluggish.&lt;br /&gt;We need that size for travel (3-4 days of the week) and are now considering buying an additional more cumbersome base unit that is far better at flossing and cleaning the teeth, even though it is not suitable for travel.</li>
            <li> this is my travel one i have the other model {home} . i love this product as it helps to clean ur teeth , and keeps ur gums healthy.</li>
            <li> When I first took this cordless Waterpik out of the box, I thought, \\&quot;What good can this do?\\&quot; Then I tried it and I love it! It travels easily, holds a charge for up to a week, and is a pretty powerful little tool. I wear braces, so this has really been a life-saver for me. I keep it at work and use it daily after lunch.</li>
            <li> works but thin cheap plastic case;  water capacity adequate but must rinse teeth quickly or will run out &amp; have to refill</li>
            <li> The water jet was a gift for my husband.  He is a no-frills man who doesn&#x27;t care to bother with \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; that is extra in the morning.  He has been using the water jet every day and feels it is really helping his gum issue.</li>
            <li> Used one of the original plug-in-the-wall Pik units back in the &#x27;60s as a kid. Considered it a chore. 50 years later, with gingival issues, I didn&#x27;t realize then how important it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The PLUS is a great product. Battery good for about 2 weeks of use (once with regular tip, once with pocket-pic, daily,) and a large enough water reservoir. You can safely ignore the poor guy who complained about the tip \\&quot;spinning around\\&quot; because he was too ignorant or stupid to actually insert the tip into the unit properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it to everyone. Gingivitis (which affects almost everyone, eventually) can lead to increasing pocket depths, which contributes to bone loss, which, if bad enough, will lead to tooth loss. Those scary pamphlets in your dentist&#x27;s office have a valid point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a good road to go down, unless you admire the toothless hillbilly look. There have been many published dental studies (I read about 40 of them on-line in the Journal of Periodontology) that confirm the efficacy of disruption of bacteria whether physically or chemically (by, say, chlorhexidine,) and the PLUS (and Pocket-Pik tip) are good tools in that ongoing war. Cheap at twice the price, but don&#x27;t use it to remove ear wax (one study details how you&#x27;ll rupture your eardrum.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about a month of use, it seems to be consistently good for about 2 dozen or so uses between charges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of charging, someone commented about corrosion on the charging contact pins. It&#x27;s true -- I noticed minor corrosion almost immediately. It would have been better if Water-Pik had provided some sort of plug/barrier to keep water out of the plug-in cavity, or, better yet if they had used an induction-charge system with no contact points or pins as do many electric toothbrushes and other devices (either would make the product slightly more expensive, the later more so, but it would be well worth the extra dollar or three.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, unfortunately, they didn&#x27;t. Nonetheless, the corrosion problem is easily solved without buying any Radio Shack parts. Carefully scrape any minor corrosion off of the pins with the tip of a knife and use an inch of tape (anything that&#x27;s about 1/2\\&quot; wide) over the plug-in cavity to keep water out of the plug-in cavity while in use between charges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully, they read this stuff and will either add some sort of (attached to the unit) plug or go to an induction-type re-charge method on the next version of the PLUS, if they haven&#x27;t already concluded that one or the other is a good idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, I still HIGHLY recommend the PLUS. It gets all sorts of stuff out of your mouth that brushing and flossing can&#x27;t and don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I bough this after another brand constantly failed. I&#x27;ve had it at least 6 months with no problem and the batteries last long.</li>
            <li> this product is very bulky to use and not very handy. Amazon kept ture to the 14 day refund and issued it in a very timely fashion. This product would work as a travel item. Too bulky for eveyday use at home.</li>
            <li> I really like it being handheld.  I wish it could hold more water, but it good for a quick rinse or a tough spot that only a pick can get to.  For me, the pressure is too weak. Overall, it&#x27;s fine and I&#x27;ll keep it for a travel version.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time.  Works as expected.  Only annoying thing is emptying the tank.  The water does not completely come out.</li>
            <li> My parents have the non-travel version of this product and love it. I didn&#x27;t want the full-size version to take up space on the bathroom counter top, so I went with this version after reading a lot of reviews. Unfortunately, I ended up returning the product.&lt;br /&gt;- Contrary to what I read in other reviews, the reservoir ended up running out of water in less than one minute. I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to stay full through a week&#x27;s worth of teeth cleaning, but emptying before one brushing was complete was not acceptable.&lt;br /&gt;- I didn&#x27;t look at the dimensions closely enough. Though this product is cordless, it was still larger than I expected. It wasn&#x27;t something I&#x27;d want to leave sitting out on the counter.&lt;br /&gt;- Using this water flosser was a bit messy, but I haven&#x27;t used one before and expect that it would get easier with time and practice.</li>
            <li> The waterflosser is terrific. It gets all the food particles out from around my teeth. The hygienist had very little to do the last time I went to the dentist.</li>
            <li> I sent back two of the three Panasonics I ordered and went back to Waterpik which works well and is reliable. Recommend highly.</li>
            <li> Portability, does a better job than string flossing. Battery charge holds up for nearly a week. Takes 2-3 uses to get used to the flying water.  Provides a good excuse to wipe down the bathroom mirrors since they were already wet.</li>
            <li> I love it. ...and the attachments are great.  I expecially like the little brushes that I can use to give my front lower teeth an extra little polish--and the tea and coffee stains are g-o-n-e !  again....I LOVE IT !</li>
            <li> We have used this waterpik for about 6 months now without any problems. The chamber holds enough water to rinse the gums once over, but needs refilling if more rinsing than that is needed, but this is not a big deal. Very light and easy to hold and use.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband in Jan 2014 and he uses it once a day. He has been very happy with it and credits it with improving his gums.&lt;br /&gt;However, the ability to charge the battery is deteriorating -- must now charge every 2 days, and even that is becoming unreliable. I hate the idea that this will soon end up in the landfill.</li>
            <li> This is a very fun product and I can only trust the science that it does what it claims to. My only complaint is that the device is a bit bulky and takes a good amount of space in the bathroom. However, it is cordless and lasts a very long time without recharging (I barely have to charge it) which is really convenient. Also comes with several different tips for different purposes although it is sometimes hard to reach far ends of the mouth.</li>
            <li> This is good for on the go</li>
            <li> I have never used one of these before so after reading multiple reviews I decided to go for the cordless one so that I didn&#x27;t have a big machine on my counter top. The worst thing about this is that you have to refill it about 3 times to do your entire mouth, it never really got everything in between (maybe im doing it wrong?), and honeslty for the price I don&#x27;t think I would ever purchase this product again. The company I got it from also took forever to send it! I waited over two weeks before I ever got it, the longest I have waited for anything on here, and to top it off I was in target the other day and found this exact one for cheaper than I paid here.</li>
            <li> Works great and leaves teeth clean. The only issue I&#x27;ve seen is that it runs out of water quickly, so have to refill several times. Its a little noisy, but doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> Since having caps put on, I have depended on this machine for better dental care. I just replaced my old one with this model, after constant use for three years. This is a bit smaller, and runs with great speed and water pressure. I am lost without using the Waterpik Water Flosser. Don&#x27;t waste your time with the \\&quot;sink\\&quot; model. I agree with the reviewer that states, that machine is unreliable as to staying in place and makes a mess. This is the better alternative for sure. Go ahead, buy it. You will feel exactly as happy as I do.</li>
            <li> Do yourselves a favor and do not buy this! It worked okay for 4 months and then stopped charging. It was impossible to do your whole mouth in one fill-up, but I could live with that. It leaked water in big puddles after emptying, but I could live with that. It was noisy and screamed when the water got low, but I could live with that. But the battery giving out after 4 months, when I was careful about keeping it on the recharge most of the time, is ridiculous!</li>
            <li> I have used this waterpik for about a month now. Since I have not used a waterpik before, I had a bit of a learning curve to make it most effective, and keep water off the bathroom ceiling. I have the following observations:&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s going to be a bit messy. Get over it. It is worth the effort.&lt;br /&gt;-You will have about 30 seconds before the unit runs dry, but it refills very easily. This is the disadvantage of a smaller, portable unit that is easy to travel with. But if you do it right, 30 seconds is enough.&lt;br /&gt;-If you pik after you brush, you can see &#x27;bits&#x27; of what was left over in your mouth, that brushing didn&#x27;t get. Then you realize why you are using one of these in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;-Since cold water is painful, use warm water. Or, I just fill it when I&#x27;m done with it, and it will be room temp for the next time I use it.&lt;br /&gt;-This unit takes up very little counter space, or goes in a drawer nicely, as compared to the larger units. I like this, since counter space is a premium. Downside is that you have to recharge it, but after daily use for a month, it is still on its first charge. Best of both worlds.&lt;br /&gt;-Unit feels like quality, and performs well.&lt;br /&gt;-Different tips are provided, but I&#x27;ve only used the basic one for now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: It has been almost a year with this unit, and I have had one problem. The unit wouldn&#x27;t re-charge, and I discovered that the brass contacts where the cord plugs in, had developed a layer of corrosion. A sharp knife, and a few scrapes later, it was back in shape. Otherwise, it is working well, and my dentist is happy.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: It has been a little over a year, and the charging cord has failed. Therefore, the unit is kaput. However, I kept my box, and it says it has a 2-year warranty, so we&#x27;ll see how Water Pic handles the return. I notice the new units in the stores have only a 1-year warranty. The cord is an ongoing concern, and I wish they would fix it.</li>
            <li> I purchased one of these about a year ago and within a few months it began to become increasingly sluggish. I took it apart and found that the entire internal cavity housing the mechnism was filled with a slimy gray substance with the consistency of stringy Jello, which was strangling the moving parts. I cleaned it out as well as I could, and it worked better for a while and then slowed down again - I checked and it was full of goop again. I contacted Water Pik and asked what was causing this and how to prevent it - their only response was to send me a replacement unit, but no acknowledgement of the problem. I used the unit for a few months and then it began accumulating the same moldy substance. I discarded the unit and replaced it with a standard Interplak (non-rechargable) - so far, so good.</li>
            <li> I like the fact I can travel with it but the reservoir is not well designed for cleaning unit. Also if you fill it you must use it ASAP ir water leaks out.</li>
            <li> I bought this one from amazon by recommendation of my dentist.   Now I don&#x27;t know how I cleaned my braces before :) It is a \\&quot;must have\\&quot; thing for braces, I think now.  The only bad thing is that battery capacity is rather low from my point of view. I need to charge it every 2-3 days during whole night.</li>
            <li> Since I have limited space in my bathroom I opted for the cordless plus waterflosser. I found it very difficult to use effectively. The tank quickly drained and I had a hard time controlling the water as I flossed. I have returned the unit to Amazon.</li>
            <li> Worked just fine for about 1 week.  Then the motor failed.  I like the idea behind the waterpik, but unfortunately they use very cheap parts which break quickly.  Made in China, no doubt.  Good idea, bad implementation.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be more convenient than my older model that plugs in to the wall and has a rectangular reservoir for water.  I was wrong.  This thing runs out of water before I&#x27;m halfway done, and you have to hold it vertically or it stops pumping.  The tube from my countertop model is a minor inconvenience compared to having to tilt my head around to accommodate this dumb vertical thing.  Also, this has two power settings, Low or High, where the other one is continuously adjustable over a wider range of pressures.  On the plus side, it basically does the job, just not as conveniently as my older one.</li>
            <li> Even with an Oral-B motorized brush, this waterflosser does an excellent job in cleaning between teeth down deep in crevices. Does a good enough job on flossing, with the annoyance of using actual floss.</li>
            <li> I recommend using this unit in the shower .... No mess and you&#x27;ll have a great check up. The Waterpik is able to reach below the gum line and new studies in periodontal health show that adding a 1/4 teaspoon of household bleach to the water will reduce the bacterial colony.  Try it and see for yourself if your Hygienist isn&#x27;t impressed!</li>
            <li> Waterpik works as expected.  The fact that it&#x27;s portable is very, very convenient.  Easy grip simple to use.  I really  have no complaints</li>
            <li> Holds enough water so you don&#x27;t have to refill every time you use it.  I use it three times a day-after each meal.</li>
            <li> Who has time to write reviews?  This time, I had to speak up.  What everyone says re poor battery life is true.  The battery will work for some months, but when it loses its life, it barely holds a charge.  But that&#x27;s not it.  It&#x27;s big and bulky.  It&#x27;s almost impossible to use without slobbering all over the device.  And sometimes it turns back on again by itself shooting water all over the bathroom.  It&#x27;s very difficult to get all the water out of it, so it never really dries.  Who knows what grows in there over time.  The jet works well, but the rest of the product is horrible.  Get a wired one instead.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with the performance of this water pick. I bought this water pick on recommendation from my dentist. He suggested that I look into purchasing a water pick because I have limited dexterity in my hands. Since I&#x27;ve been using this product I&#x27;ve noticed that my mouth feels much healthier than it did before I began using it.</li>
            <li> They warn you about this in the directions at least -- drain the battery fully once, and it there&#x27;s no repair. It will never charge up again to be useful. If you&#x27;re never going to move and can leave it plugged in for eternity, I guess it was a fine product to you. But if you ever need to plug something else in (or move in my case) and keep it unplugged for a few days, and you just have to throw it away. What a waste.</li>
            <li> This lasted a total of five months.  It would not hold a charge after that point.  Lousy battery I think.  It did have decent &#x27;power&#x27; on the pik.  I would skip this one.</li>
            <li> I have one wisdom tooth I&#x27;m trying to avoid having removed and it&#x27;s really been hard to keep the gum area clean.  Flossing and brushing were just not doing the job - my gum area was sore and bleeding - it wasn&#x27;t going to be very long before I was going to lose the battle.  I had used the older, \\&quot;big\\&quot; version of the Waterpik with a large reservoir and the wand with a cord many years ago - noisy, messy, took up a lot of counter space. How many times did I have water squirt all over the place?  Ugh!  Yes, it did the job of toughening my gums and cleaning out food particles.  But I dreaded using it.  So I read the Amazon reviews, understood what I could expect... and not for different devices.  I settled on the Waterpik Waterflosser.  Within three days of twice daily use, my wisdom tooth stopped complaining.  No more sensitivity; no bleeding gums and I have avoided a visit to the oral surgeon.  Furthermore, my jaw appreciates that I don&#x27;t have to open it very wide to have clean gums and minimal pockets.  Pros:  Tip choices (easy to switch); takes up very little space; easy to clean and fill with water (or mouth wash); relatively quite compared to the big model; delivers a powerful stream at the high setting; minimal mess if you keep your lips closed around the probe.  Cons:  Small reservoir (well, yes, obviously - only 200 ml, but that&#x27;s a plus too - just stick it back under the faucet and re-fill); might be a little bulky for small hands.  Other than that, I&#x27;m thrilled with how well it works for the price and convenience of not having a bulky device sitting on my countertop. I started out using my Waterpik twice a day and now use it only at bedtime.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a week and my gums feel better already.  My old waterpik with the separate tank was thrown away years ago because of the space it took, the need to stretch the hose and electric cord down the cabinet to use it, and the moldy slime that tended to form in the tank top.  I love this new rechargeable model because of the decrease in counter clutter, ease of filling/emptying, and it has lasted the full week without recharging.  After using one of the extra tips, my husband was so impressed that I ordered a second unit for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About other complaints:  Yes, you do have to lean low over the sink as instructed.  Don&#x27;t turn it on until the pik is in your mouth and turn it off before removing it.  There is noise from the pump - not a big deal.  Yes, to do both upper and lower gums requires a single refill for me which  takes about 10 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.  It is worth the price to just dislodge the piece of nut that gets stuck in between the tooth and gum from time to time!  My 80 year old mother has used a water pik for 40 years and still has ALL of her own teeth.  Wish that I had started earlier.</li>
            <li> This is the second purchase for the Waterpik Waterflosser Cordless Plus. The first Waterpik funtioned very well when received but after about (1) year after purchase the product lost water pressure and had to be charged frequently just to operate. I like the product but if the second purchase becomes defective after one year, I will be checking for another manufacturer for a similiar product.</li>
            <li> I purchased Waterpik for me and my wife as it seemed to be a good deal. I liked to use it everyday and even sent a couple of these waterflossers to my relatives abroad. But after about a year my unit stopped working because the battery didn&#x27;t charge anymore. It was replaced by the manufacturer as it comes with 2-year warranty. But the funny thing is that the same problem happened to my relative&#x27;s Waterpiks after the same period of time! Have to say that they didn&#x27;t bother with shipping them to US for replacements. After using my new flosser for a little bit over a year it died and stopped charging. This time the company customer service wasn&#x27;t that nice and didn&#x27;t replace the unit as it has been over two years from the original purchase date. So if you plan to buy it be cautious because they replace the product under the warranty only once! I am disappointed in this product as I bought 3 of them and ALL broke after about a year of daily use. This time I&#x27;m going to find something more reliable.</li>
            <li> Counter tops? No, just charge this thing up and put it in your shower, don&#x27;t worry about making a mess, life is so easy now, wish someone would&#x27;ve told me this 10 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the charging not working after a few months (as many people have complained about), the other reviewer here correctly explained the issue (the contact points stop contacting the cord to receive the charge). The other reviewer suggested getting a different charging cord that had a tighter fit, but the solution I found was just use a bobby pin to clean off the funk that builds on the charging tips on the device. Its a poor design, being \\&quot;level\\&quot; the water can accumulate there &amp; build deposits on the tips, preventing the charge from transferring. Just clean off the charging tips so the juice can flow across, easy fix.</li>
            <li> Granted the water reservoir is small but I wanted it for travel, so it&#x27;s perfect for me. The force of the water is not as strong as the full size model, but it still works better than just brushing or just flossing, especially with my braces. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Pros: cordless, not sure how long the charge lasts, takes up small amount of space on counter&lt;br /&gt;Cons: awkward for smaller hands, water only lasts for 20 seconds on low setting.  Not enough to clean whole mouth.  Power seems weak.  Water reservoir awkward to fill, can&#x27;t empty completely for storage because of location of fill hole.</li>
            <li> battery on the first one lasted 10 months.  second one 4 months.  there will not be a third.  the manufacturer will not fix this defect while people continue to buy.  there are more reliable products out there.  0 stars</li>
            <li> The Waterpik water flosser cordless PLUS works well but as a hand held unit, it tends to be somewhat messy.</li>
            <li> Great product for removing food particles. Has good battery life and a small foot print on the vanity. Hold adequate quantity of water for one session.</li>
            <li> I have had two of the older cordless Waterpiks which each lasted less than two years each.  I bought a new W450WP and after about 18 months the battery is deader than a door nail.  The charger connections are OK and the receptacle on the flosser is corrosion free.  Just a dead battery.  Although I liked the features of the Waterpik and its effectiveness, I think I will go back to Panasonic.</li>
            <li> The water pic broke after 1 week of use.  I would not recommend this product.  The negative reviews were very credible.</li>
            <li> Cordless water flosser good to travel with.&lt;br /&gt;But battery just died in less than 6 months, at which time cannot be recharged.&lt;br /&gt;Happy to buy a new battery, but cannot open the unit to find a removeable battery.&lt;br /&gt;Get the A/C plugged-in unit &amp; not travel with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Manufacturer, if you read this, please advise if this dead unit can be revived.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> I was wondering how this would be for traveling. I have had a full sized one at home for years to compare it to. This portable one is a bit larger than I imagined but not heavy. The water tank will empty pretty quick but if I&#x27;m quick I can usually get my teeth done unless there&#x27;s some food that&#x27;s jammed. The high setting is a bit weaker than my home unit dial set 1/3 of the way up which is fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One use tip if you want to use it where there isn&#x27;t a sink just keep your mouth closed and drink the water as you go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If something changes I&#x27;ll update my review...</li>
            <li> When I received my new Waterpik Waterflosser Cordless Plus from Amazon, I charged it for 24 hours.  I noticed that it was always on high setting and it could not be changed to low.  I called the Waterpik Company and they told me to run a couple tablespoons of vinegar along with the water through it and then clear water and that I should charge it for 48 hours.  Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t work.  I still couldn&#x27;t change the setting .  My dental hygienist told me to always use it on low.  The company sent me a new one which I was very pleased with.  Unfortunately this one is doing the same thing.  The setting cannot be changed from high to low.  Now I&#x27;m in the process of doing what they suggested again (the vinegar &amp; water, etc.).  Hopefully this will work.  If not, I&#x27;m going to have to call them again.  The very first one I had worked great for a couple of years before&lt;br /&gt;it quit.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended the Waterpik to me, saying he&#x27;s been using it for years. Me being the lazy flosser that I am, I thought I&#x27;d give it a go. Don&#x27;t fall into the trap like I did! Using it is easy enough, but that&#x27;s the only redeeming aspect. It&#x27;s bulky, poorly designed, and one charge doesn&#x27;t last long. I bought it less than 18 months ago and already the rechargeable battery is losing juice. Before, an eight-hour charge would give me about a week of use, around 45 seconds each night. Now, a twelve-hour charge barely gives me three or four days, same amount of time nightly. I&#x27;ve followed the care instructions, but the fact that it&#x27;s cordless is the major problem. Water gets EVERYWHERE - outside and inside, which probably isn&#x27;t good for the hardware. So, just stick to regular flossing. You can buy the string for a few dollars or a pack of the picks, either of which will last you several months for a tenth of the cost. It might take you longer, but I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s more effective than this hunk of junk.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used a water pick in probably 30 years but I put it on my wishlist b/c I&#x27;ve had a lot of dental problems the past 10 years.  This is very easy to use, and even my kids like it.  It is small and doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of counter space.  The blue plastic tank comes off easily so I just take it out after each use and let it air dry.  I haven&#x27;t traveled with it but it is certainly small enough to pack.  Great water pik!</li>
            <li> Great flossed. Dentist recommended. Easy to use</li>
            <li> My dentist says that since I am using this pic every day that my gum condition has improved.  This pic can be used away from the electric socket as most pics have short cords.  I take it into the shower with me to avoid a mess.</li>
            <li> I purchased a used or display model at discount and paid dearly for the good deal in the long run.  Upon receipt the pump was feeble.  I took it apart and found that one of the pump reed valves was deformed but easily fixed.  After that the unit only ran two to three tanks of water before it was too pooped to pump.  I rigged a voltmeter to the battery terminals and found out that voltage dropped to under 1.25v when the pump was running:  Clearly, the batteries were dying and would not take a charge.      I took it apart and noted that the batteries were two solder-tab style AA size Nickel-metal hydride - NiMh- 1.2v cells wired in series.  They were in shrink wrap that said 2.4v, 1500 Milli&#x3D;ampHour - MaH.  I installed a pair of 1.2V, 2500 mah cells from the auction site.  Wow - it&#x27;s a different machine:  The motor runs faster and the pump puts out a far better stream of water.  So far it has emptied over ten tanks of water and is still going strong on the first charge.    I&#x27;ll note here that there is a &#x27;dry&#x27; side of the unit that is sealed against moisture.  The seal had failed and the battery was fairly corroded.  The motor casing and on/off switch had superficial corrosion.  I applied a corrosion inhibitor called Corrosion-X before reassembly.    Now that it&#x27;s running right I&#x27;m considering the installation of a charge LED so I know the batteries are charging.  And maybe install air vents and water drains, since I know it will get inside.  Or add a door and appropriate connectors to the battery compartment so I can use disposable batteries and eliminate the charger.    Batteries are living things, and unless new, corrosion free and kept on a charger they become an unknown quantity.  Also, not knowing how long the machine sat on the shelf with the internals corroding before I bought it, it seems only fair to allow for a dead battery and score it as it runs after repair.  If I ran into these problems with a new unit at list prices I would not be so generous.  Ditto ifI weren&#x27;t so handy and consider these things challenges.  Bu then, I would have returned it.    In the interim I got the Panasonic oral irrigator and love it:  they fixed the one weakness of the Waterflosser:  - dead or dying batteries -by making them replaceable; which also eliminates the problem of lost chargers and corroded connectors.  The Panasonic also collapses the power head into the tank, so it travels small.  http://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-EW-DJ10-A-Oral-Irrigator/dp/B0027LSEPS</li>
            <li> I knew from reading reviews before I purchased that there is no light to indicate when the battery is charging and when it is fully charged, but it is annoying.  I also thought the water stream would be more forceful than it is.  Overall, it is better than just brushing and it is very difficult for me to floss since I have braces so this is an improvement.</li>
            <li> Battery does not recharge after 10 months. No return possible. Recommendation: If you want something that is dependable shop electronics at a more reliable source.</li>
            <li> works great!  Wife is very happy!!!</li>
            <li> Great product. I use it in the shower to avoid splashes</li>
            <li> My husband really likes this waterpik waterflosser.  It is lightweight and it charges up fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to everyone who wants to protect their teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> Keep your receipt and register the product as I predict you will need it a year down the line and then they will replace it!  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love it but the previous model did not last 9 months.  I use it on a daily basis and love this product but don&#x27;t completely trust it yet but it has a 2 year warranty so I went with this model.</li>
            <li> I like the power it has and the attachments but it is messy to fill and use.  I think they should have built a protective flap over the power plug hole.  I question its long term shelf life because that area cannot help but get water in it.  Time will tell!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this flosser for about 10 times and it&#x27;s stopped working! Low quality product!</li>
            <li> works fine but the resavor is small and does not&lt;br /&gt;hold enough but if you use it in the shower you can&lt;br /&gt;refill easier.</li>
            <li> But it works.  My older one filled differently and all the extra water in the container could be drained out.  Also, it was smaller and easier to handle.  Otherwise, it is working great.</li>
            <li> thx! I bought in KOREA, delivered in good condition!</li>
            <li> The Waterpik cordless was recommended by my dentist for cleaning between my bridgework and gums and once I became used to using it, about three (3) times, I found that it was doing a excellent job and my mouth has never felt this clean before.</li>
            <li> Love my waterpik waterflosser and I use it at least once a day,  very powerful on low setting  my only least favorite thing is that I travel for work so I have to have a case big enough to hold the base that fills the water. Great if you just have to use it at home. I may look for one to take on the road and use this at home. It gets the job done and your mouth feels clean after every use. Great product.</li>
            <li> My son just got braces and uses this 4 times a day - Magical !  The other models were too messy and cumbersome. It give you 45 seconds of water flossing at a time - but the most important thing is : HE USES IT !</li>
            <li> It is a good alternative to having the plug in the wall unit if you are limited with space. It is also quieter. I used to have the old waterpik which did an excellent job but took space and was noisy.  However, the water force is not as strong and the water reservoir, naturally is smaller so you might have to fill it twice to get a decent cleaning.</li>
            <li> Does what it sys it will.  Easy to handle.</li>
            <li> This is excellent for individual who have a hard time flossing or getting in between teeth. Love this product and works just like a charm.</li>
            <li> This Waterpik is the second one I have owned.  I LOVE this gadget.  It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.  Think your teeth are clean after brushing??  Not really.  If you use this on a daily basis, you can fight plaque and keep your gums massaged at the same time.  Makes your mouth feel so clean.  My dentist says he sees lots of improvement!!!</li>
            <li> I have owned this product for 3 years now, and use it at least twice a week. It still runs great, and the different attachments are all in good working order. Make sure and clean it regularly like the instructions say, by running a capful of vinegar with water through the machine to keep it from clogging. The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I am not completely happy with the way the instruments swivel on the base. I have to turn it off manually to swivel the attachment, and then go back to cleaning those hard to reach teeth. I wish it would swivel on it&#x27;s own. Really though, a very good tool!</li>
            <li> Got this because i needed to keep up with my dental hygiene when traveling and for that is great.  Not so good for every day.</li>
            <li> Had this for a few years and loved it. I just replaced it with the newer model. This model did not allow the tank to be emptied completely as the opening was on the side.</li>
            <li> I bought mine in 2013 and have really tried to like the thing, but I can&#x27;t.  The battery doesn&#x27;t hold a charge for more than one use, so it is always plugged in and in the way.  The biggest complaint though is the weakness of the jet.  It just is not strong enough to do a complete job of flossing.  So, I just bought a counter top unit and love it.  A good strong jet and a large capacity reservoir.  I don&#x27;t recommend the cordless model.</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I expected. This is way too big to travel with.  However it does seem to work well.</li>
            <li> Does what it says it will do.....leaves the mouth and teeth clean and debris free. I would recomend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have had extensive peridontal work done and this item works even better than my older waterpic  I have recommended it to friends.  I have used a waterpic for many years but I really like the variety of heads this offer as well as the fact that the water container comes off.  This feature will make it easier to clean and to empty for travel.</li>
            <li> A great alternative to manual flossing....adding teaspoon of bleach reduces/eliminates gum pockets that I had gotten through failure to or inadequate flossing.  Takes a little getting use to...but does job!</li>
            <li> I hate flossing but love the feel of a super clean mouth. This is one of the best inventions for your mouth!! It&#x27;s not the cleanest job to do... Sometimes I forget to shut it off and water squirts everywhere. Kinda funny.. I&#x27;ve read the other reviews and yes, the water does run out quick but once you get used to it you can get your entire mouth water flossed in 45 secs. Also, just wipe it off before you plug it back in; that way the adaptor won&#x27;t rust out.</li>
            <li> Perfect for travel.  I have a Waterpik that sits on the counter and is not suitable for travel.  This cordless model works better than expected.  I fill it twice to get the same result as my other one.  Read and follow the instructions and you&#x27;ll have no worries.</li>
            <li> I might as well have swished a mouth full of water around in my mouth for 60 seconds.  I returned it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much nicer than the full sized one, comes with four different heads so multiple people can use it. I normally refill it and use it twice as it only lasts 45 seconds, but it&#x27;s so much nicer than keeping the larger one on the counter!</li>
            <li> I loved my Waterpik, it was the first one I had ever had.  Unfortunately it died at an early age.  Less than a year old.  I called the company and explained that it was not holding a charge and now would not take a charge at all.  I was told I had to keep it plugged in all the time.  All the time???  Stupid me!!!!  I thought that when it said \\&quot;portable\\&quot; it meant I could leave it unplugged for a few days before having to recharge.  It was a piece of junk and a waste of my money.  Since I can&#x27;t afford to buy one every 10-11 months I&#x27;m now in the market for another brand.  If I could I would give the Waterpik NO stars.  Barbara</li>
            <li> I bought this product ignoring the comments that it stopped working after a few months, well it did, that is stop working like it should and the return policy expired about 30 days before it stopped working properly. I understand the reservoir issue but that is only if on the high setting, had no problem with charging, the issue I have and continue to have is there is no pressure now like I had before with the two settings and now there is no difference between the two settings. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT FROM AMAZON BUY IT FROM WATERPIK, WHERE THEY STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCTS. THEY ARE SENDING ME A NEW UNIT FREE OF CHARGE, CALL THEM AT 1-800-525-2774, OH AND SAVE THE BOX, IT HAS THE MODEL # AND SERIAL # ON IT, WHICH YOU WILL NEED.</li>
            <li> It is a very poorly designed, low quality, useless piece of junk.  I purchased it from Costco along with the wired version of the unit and took this one for my overseas trip without checking it first.  It turned out to be such a piece of worthless junk.  The fully charged batteries lasted only a few minutes, and the unit broke in a week.  I hope it is not designed in US or it will put US engineering in really shame!  Good luck to you if you thinking buying it indeed.</li>
            <li> My son uses this once to twice daily and it does the job and is perfect. I like that it&#x27;s not a huge &amp;#34;system.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m starting to get educated about AmazonPrime (however). There were other sellers that were selling the same product for less. I see that the &amp;#34;free shipping&amp;#34; that you get through Prime pays for itself as the products that are Prime-eligible are are about $10 higher in general.</li>
            <li> I use this product religiously 2 times a day. I like the process and have checked with a proxy brush to see it there is residue left behind which there was not. I wish it was a little smaller to hold.</li>
            <li> The tank is SMALL, I admit and I have to fill&#x27;er up twice, but it works fine and I sure like the smaller footprint on my counter.  I used to have the big mamou sized one and hated how much space it ate up, plus hated those tubes attached.  This is much more portable, smaller, but still does a good job.  I&#x27;d rather fill it twice than put up with all of the other problems.</li>
            <li> I am so upset from this product! After using it for less than 3 weeks! The waterflosser lost power, not charging anymore, and totally useless. I did charge it for one time upon reviving it as instructed, used it for couple of times, after I did try to recharge it again! But no way! Not charging and no power at all!</li>
            <li> i love this pik, it has a good size water resevoir and holds a charge for weeks of use. has very good water pressure your gums feel so clean like you just had a professional cleaning! Been using this product for over a month now.</li>
            <li> When you lean over so that the water goes in the sink the unit cannot pick up the water once it&#x27;s half empty.  I have never used a non cordless but I am sure that the hose corrects that issue.  Very loud and does not hold enough water to do your whole mouth.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that it lasted a week on one charge. Used it two times a day for 3 days and one time a day the other four.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace the older/smaller version. Works well and has a bigger water tank. Hopefully the battery will last longer than the previous version.</li>
            <li> Of course, there is the water flossing but it is not as big a pain. Why? Don&#x27;t know. And it is very effective. I used to be a cavity a visit guy, no more.</li>
            <li> Bought it and used it periodically for a few months and water started leaking out of the bottom. Customer support is useless. All they do is try to get you to buy replacement parts to fix the unit and don&#x27;t even listen to what you ask them. Totally worthless product by Waterpik. I wish I had my money back to try a different brand!</li>
            <li> This one is so much an improvement over the old Waterpik which was cumbersome with those coily cords and the motor from heck. This is no hummingbird, but the noise is tolerable. You&#x27;ll likely have to refill 1-2x to get the job done right, but if you need a waterpik, I think this is the way to go.</li>
            <li> The cordless waterpic flosser is okay. Anything cordless is nice but it is kind of big. I guess my husband  says it works ok.</li>
            <li> The high spray adjustment does the job without hurting gums. It takes two seconds to fill and usually contains enough water to finish the job without refilling. The cordless feature makes it easy to use.</li>
            <li> This waterpik arrived on time and in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works very well. There are 2 settings; high and low. It also comes with additional tip/ head attachments, which is nice. My only complaint is that water holder doesn&#x27;t hold enough water for one use, but having to refill once midway through isn&#x27;t a terrible thing I suppose just a minor nuisance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend to anyone who wants to give up conventional string flossing. It&#x27;s a great alternative, much gentler on your gums, and seems to work just as well.</li>
            <li> Little too messy.  The water seems to be used up too quickly. Like my sonic air flosser better because it&#x27;s easier to use and you can leave the water in it.</li>
            <li> I bought this model because I didn&#x27;t want to have to plug one in to use it and thought it would be good for travel.  It&#x27;s not powerful, could not be used in lieu of floss.  About all it&#x27;s good for is a rinse or to flush under a bridge.</li>
            <li> It can wash my teeth very clean, I am very satisfied, but it does not power tips, more distressed!But I&#x27;ll stick with it</li>
            <li> I use to think these products were just gimmicks, until my dentist reccommend that i get one, now i am sold, I have had mine for about two weeks and its working perfect for me..</li>
            <li> taking the aesthetics out (this thing is kinda huge), the water pik came recommended from my dentist.  I think it is strange that for 1 full flossing sessions, I need to fill the reservoir 3 times.  That alone is reason to take it back.</li>
            <li> Item works as advertised and seems to have plenty of power to do the job. My one gripe is that the  reservoir is a bit too small and sometimes has to be refilled to finish a session.</li>
            <li> i got a defective one and sent it back no refund yet</li>
            <li> My wife loves this for her new braces and says it gets everything out without the hassle of the toothbrush bristles getting stuck in her braces.  Also gives her a new freshness to her breath.</li>
            <li> I have only used this a couple of times. Bought primarily for travelling purposes.  Does not seem quite as powerful as my corded one used at home, but should serve the purpose as a portable water pik.</li>
            <li> I have a Waterpik for home use in my bathroom, but it is a little too large to travel with. I travel a lot and still wanted to be able to have the use of my Waterpik. Once you start using one you don&#x27;t want to stop. Your mouth feels so much cleaner and this is a lot smaller and easy to travel with. It had several attachments and the charger that comes with it as well.</li>
            <li> This Product is really noisy and huge size. The water reservoir used fast. The Battery cannot last for long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, I liked the shuttering steam of water instead of steady one as other product.</li>
            <li> First time I used it, the water was plashing all over my T-shirt.&lt;br /&gt;Then the guidebook helped me a lots.&lt;br /&gt;Now I feel very happy. My gums are getting better day by day...&lt;br /&gt;P.S.: I&#x27;m wishing it has got a larger water tank.</li>
            <li> Product arrived properly packaged and in a very timely manner. The jet stream can be adjusted and does an excellent job of loosening items between the teeth or in the gum-line. Flushes out the items that a toothbrush or string- floss may have missed. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> great product...easy to fill and operate  both power settings worked well  tips easy to change good value for the money</li>
            <li> I really love this item.  It;s portable.  Took it away with me.  My mouth feels much cleaner with it.  Can&#x27;t wait till my next dental appoinment.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a more powerful stream, this doesn&#x27;t seem powerful enough to do anything. I can do better smiling at my showerhead!  After 6 seconds my mouth is full of water. I fill 4 times to get around my mouth. Did I get a defective unit or are they all like this?</li>
            <li> I love the travel version of my big Waterpik, actually I use it everyday and not just for travel.  It takes up less space on the bathroom counter than the original size one.</li>
            <li> My son just got braces and the waterpik makes brushing much better by removing particles that he could no longer get to with the braces..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for. It&#x27;s much more convenient than the waterpik with the cord. Enough water storage for one use.</li>
            <li> Perfect! My grandson has one and it looked so easy to use, and found out that my dentist recommended one, so I ordered it and some extra tips.  I really do like the waterflosser, it makes my flossing time faster.</li>
            <li> I would not buy this if I had a good countertop - we have a countertop model that has more pressure, a larger tank, and is more convenient to pik with. But, whoever last remodeled our bathroom forgot electrical outlets. Sheesh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, I do recommend this and thanks for all the great reviews I was able to read before buying. The positive reviews that answer all the negatives are pretty much dead-on, folks, and you can buy this in confidence. The best advice is to keep the power jack wires clean even though there&#x27;s no way to keep them dry, and I am blowing out the water in the jack after every use and will use the vinnegar technique if deposits form. Unfortunately, water continues to drain down into the jacks even after you thoroughly dry the unit... probably not a serious issue if you&#x27;re keeping them clean, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s powerful enough on the low setting to pik through the spaces between teeth, though quite a bit less than the counter top model. The high power setting is sufficient for cleaning with any of the standard piks; I do not need any more power. It&#x27;s a comfortable pressure but won&#x27;t give you that stinging sensation of the counter top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reservoir is on an angle and it is easy to under-fill it, though once you realize this it is easy to fill it all the way. The first time I used this I ran out of water, but the second time the extra fill gave me about 10 more seconds. Also, I save a little room to add a bit of listerene just before closing the latch. If I run out of water, I&#x27;m right there at the faucet anyway so it just takes a coupld of seconds to add a little more. You can&#x27;t fill and re-insert the tank because there is a litte hole on the bottom where the pik draws the water, but I&#x27;d prefer to fill while it is attached anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not loud. It sounds just like the countertop model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a little learning curve to holding the unit, but by the second use I was able to do the outside and inside of mygums. The countertop model is much more easily manipulated, of course. You have to keep your head down with this one, so it is messy but everything goes in the sink and it doesn&#x27;t spray out unless you take it out of your mouth. The head does not move around freely but it is easily moved, and this can take some getting used to but is not a problem after a couple of uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit gets completely wet during use. Rinsing it off, opening the latch to shake out water left in the tank, drying it on my bathtowel and blowing a little air in the jack takes a couple of seconds. As I noted, a little water continues to drop down from somewhere and some of this can get into the jack, but it is all well sealed and does not seem to make a difference. If it does, there&#x27;s always the vinegar technique mentioned in another review (couple of drops, let it sit, blow it out).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paid about 15% more at Target than I could have paid here on Amazon because I was worried about a convenient return if I didn&#x27;t like it, but I won&#x27;t be returning it. Buy it here on Amazon with confidence, read the reviews, and enjoy.</li>
            <li> Too bad I didn&#x27;t read the instructions first - I would have returned this right away. First it says &amp;#34;..no consumer-servicable electrical items.&amp;#34; Ok. Then I find out the battery is not replaceable, and &amp;#34;at the end of the battery life, please recycle the unit...&amp;#34;  Seriously?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I should&#x27;ve listened to other reviewers who said that the reservoir is too small. It&#x27;s too small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shame on Waterpik for poor design principles.</li>
            <li> I love this! I put mouth wash in mine love cordless just charge once a week really nice great quality also...very affordable too!</li>
            <li> Cleans and rinses all food particles between teeth.  Charge holds for a few weeks, and water capacity is enough to get job done well.</li>
            <li> I bought this item a couple of years ago for my disabled son. Its easy for him to use and is still working flawlessly.</li>
            <li> The play between high and low pressure is slight and often high comes on with a slight move of the hand and ouch too much power on the gums!</li>
            <li> it does the job&lt;br /&gt;very well it&#x60;s worth the money i will tell my friends about this product in the future</li>
            <li> Good for getting out the food stuck between the teeth  but watch out....you have to really hang over the sink so you don&#x27;t get water all down your front.</li>
            <li> i dont need to floss my teeth any more, I use it every day. I very recoment this product :)</li>
            <li> Our dentist recommended this, and our check-ups have been greatly improved since using it.  This find stuff left after brushing and flossing.</li>
            <li> My teeth always feel icky 1 month before I&#x27;m due for a cleaning so I do use a waterpik to get through that last month. I went to get the thing out and found it simply no longer worked and I had it several years so I looked for a replacement and was interested to see the new and actually 2nd gen cordless ones but worried about the lackluster reviews. It turns out I love the thing and use it more than the corded one. The corded one was a pain and messy. I could only be used at the sink then it has to sit there and dry and be put away. This I can grab and fill up and jump in the shower with it and put it back in the cupboard. I find the amount of fluid is more than enough to get along all the gums very thoroughly. I would buy this again if it quit because I feel I&#x27;ve already gotten my monies worth from it. I love the little brush attachment it came with as opposed to the plain tube.</li>
            <li> did not operate at all</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s great to finally have an easy-to-use portable bidet to help keep myself clean and comfortable. Plus, it fits neatly into my briefcase so I can easily use it after lunch, before a meeting, or while in queue at the bank!</li>
            <li> It works great. Is easy to use. I own a Sonicare toothebrush and cannot believe how much food is removed by the waterflosser even after brushing.</li>
            <li> I had one earlier that finally gave out after a couple of years.  This one seems to work much better and has faster pulses than the previous one.  I like that and it seems to clean much better.</li>
            <li> I have used and liked Waterpiks for years.  They all worked for years but this one worked for barely 5 weeks, then died..</li>
            <li> easy to use and handle while flossing; the price is right;I especially like the number of different flosser heads with the unit; battery holds it&#x27;s charge too!</li>
            <li> This Waterflosser is great and because of my using it I got a good report from my Dentist.  It is a bit messy to use at first, but got the hang of using it soon.</li>
            <li> Maybe I haven&#x27;t figured out the right way to perform this...but I soak everything including myself even though I have my mouth closed around the tip.  You have to expel the water and no matter what, it seems I get water everywhere.</li>
            <li> This is crazy good! I wish I would have had this years ago. My teeth and gums are in the best shape ever. Fresher breath and super clean gums and teeth. you will not be sorry.</li>
            <li> Would not keep charge.  Got rid of it!</li>
            <li> This was hard to use. Much bigger than I expected.</li>
            <li> although the stream is not as strong as the larger model, the cordless suits my purposes.  the first charge lasted a long time and I&#x27;m just today re-charging it.</li>
            <li> keeps the teeth and mouth fresh and clean but be ware not to use it at the sink as you will get wet best to use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> I had to send the first unit back because it wouldn&#x27;t fit any of the included tips.  Waterpik was very courteous and shipped me a whole new package, tips and all, right away.  The new unit works great and have had no further issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit works very well and has just enough water to floss your whole mouth quickly.  I like to spend extra time flossing so I may invest in the more expensive sink-top model later on, but for now this one is doing a fine job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as use, they recommend that you hold your mouth open while you use it to allow the liquid to drain out; however I have found that method to be very messy.  I recommend you to keep your mouth closed and floss each section separately, turning off the unit and spitting in between, I&#x27;m sure each person will have their own preference for what works best for them in this regard.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this. My dentist recommend I use this instead of floss and it has made a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Okay, but my hydrofloss is better. It serves its purpose. I bought this to be my travel waterpik since the hydrofloss is so big for traveling. It is not as powerful as my hydrofloss and doesn&#x27;t do as good of a job, but for travel purposes, it works.</li>
            <li> Ours did ok.  15 months with nearly daily use primarily by my wife.  She said it&#x27;s not charging but I am using it now.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time using it without water running down my face, neck and arm and spitting out onto to the mirror.  I returned it to the manufacture under their 14-day return policy I found on their website. PROS: It did clean my mouth rather well, its small and compact, it fit nicely on my small sink, and although I had to refill it a few times for the entire mouth, this did not bother me.  CONS: Its very messy. If you do not hold your mouth in a relaxed closed way and let the water trickle out, the water goes everywhere. I think the shower model would be a better purchase, that way there is no concern about water flying all over, unless you are buying this for travel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK. I bought this for my friend as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad part of this is that I found it kinda &amp;#34;bad packed.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t look like it&#x27;s worth so much.</li>
            <li> Pros: Seems to work better than the Airflosser.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It&#x27;s very big, and water on the repository will only last for about 40 secs. It will make a huge mess in your toilet if you plan to use it with a mirror. You gotta pull the water like you do with a straw and move it around your teeth blindly.</li>
            <li> Fits our tiny space, does the job, is quiet, easy to clean.  The only product improvement that I would suggest is a charging base so that you do not have to plug/unplug to use.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t blame this on the product itself since I should have realized that a cordless Waterpik with this capacity was going to be big, but it does not fit comfortably in my hand.  I gave up on using this item.</li>
            <li> the older model was better (now at half the price). will probably return this new one and get the old model waterpik. the problem is that these should be used in the shower and the new waterpik does not have a rubber cover for the recharging input. they saved 1/10th of a cent and they built-in planned obsolescence. the old model does have this. reviewers have said that the new model dies after awhile, not so much because the battery wears out (although it seems to), but because the contacts get corroded and the battery will not fully charge. so this is not a customer-centric design.  furthermore, i believe it uses up the water supply faster than the old model. the water reservoir is larger but, on high, does not last as long (42 seconds). this would not be such a problem since, in the shower, which is were it belongs, you can fill it up during use if you cup your hand over the fill hole, but the fill opening is small and not well placed. with the old model this \\&quot;active\\&quot; filling was easier as the fill opening was at the top and larger.  another disappointment is that the new model does not seem to deliver the water quite as strongly - it is definitely not \\&quot;way better\\&quot; than the old model. additionally, the button placement and button feel and action are not up to modern day standards. i would like to see apple make one of these.  i will either get the older model or it may be time to try the panasonic with rechargable batteries and see how well that works.</li>
            <li> I have been using my waterpik for about a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros - It has really helped with my breath and gums.  My dentist has been very pleased.  It comes with a lot of spare pik heads.&lt;br /&gt;Cons - It is a little large to travel.  After a year, I have noticed that it is not holding a charge as long as it used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hints:&lt;br /&gt;-I noticed that water directly out of the faucet sometimes bothers my gums because it is too cold, so fill it up as soon as I finish using it so the water temperature normalizes before the next use.&lt;br /&gt;-I put a little mouthwash in it before I fill it with water and it makes your mouth tingle.&lt;br /&gt;-If you take it with you on the road, remove the pik head before packing and pack it separately or it may break off during transport.</li>
            <li> A little messy to use, and have to refill the water couple of times, but it leaves my teeth clean. Definitely get better result than using the regular floss. I have not tried other brands, so I can not compare.</li>
            <li> This item is probably an excellent product but I can&#x27;t say for sure because I haven&#x27;t been able to use it. Before I ordered this device, I specifically enquired if it would work with 240 volts electricity supply. I was told \\&quot;no problem, it&#x27;ll work with any voltage\\&quot;. It arrived in a timely manner, less than a week after I ordered it, full marks for that, but when I took it out of the box and went to plug it in I first checked what was written on the charger....you guessed it \\&quot;110-120VAC\\&quot;. I checked with Waterpik, the company that makes it and was told they make a different model that will run on 240 volts. Amazon should have known this and made it clear that this model will only run on 110 volts. Rather than return the item and get the proper one (shipping costs are prohibitive) it was cheaper and easier to get a voltage converter so I can use it; not the best solution but a practical one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please Amazon, indicate in your product description if the item can only use 110 volts, most of this world uses 240.</li>
            <li> It works great! I was apprehensive because my teeth are so close together I did not think it would work. After using it, I decided to use regular floss to test the Waterpik. Well, there was nothing left behind for the string floss to pick up. I will recommend this product to all my friends. I only thing I do not like is the mess made from the water.</li>
            <li> i have had this product for four months it became nearly useless in the 3rd charge the battery just can&#x27;t last for one minute and it&#x27;s dead in the beginning i thought that probably 1 hour of charging will earn one minute of usage of the product but when i kept the charger plugged for 6 hours it&#x27;s still the same and eventually it just like urination it barely last 10 seconds and it won&#x27;t even shoot further than 4 foot so i would not recommend this product most of the 5 star reviews are most likely written by the company itself or inpatient people that just received the product in hand and played with it a few minutes my cousin  also have this problem just not as worse as me</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it says it will do. Works excellent. Not sure about those other critisizing the product. I got my money worth and I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> While the product had battery life, I found it very efficient. But when I came to charge it, I blew it up. No where on the product listing does it tell me that it is a 110-120v. I found it on the bottom of the box, where it also says \\&quot;Do not plug this device into a voltage system that is different from the voltage system specified on the device or charger\\&quot; I live in Australia where the voltage is 240V. It would have been nice to have been advised that the product would not work here. Now I must find out if I can get a charger suitable for the country or do I just have to throw away the device, which to me is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time, in good condition.  It works very well.  I have a suggestion though for the manufacturer:  an indication light that there is a full charge, or low battery.  The unit is easily unplugged by mistake.</li>
            <li> I recently got Invisalign and this is perfect to clean between my teeth.  It&#x27;s easy for me to bring to work and even though its on the noisy side, it expedites the cleaning process (flossing is slower) and my dentist is happy I am using it.  Sometimes the reservoir runs out of water but it is very simple to refill.</li>
            <li> Small water capacity sometimes not finish to clean and have to refill&lt;br /&gt;Oxidation on the battery charger conector&lt;br /&gt;Battery is dead and canot be changed&lt;br /&gt;Unit have to go to the trashcan after less than 2 years using&lt;br /&gt;My advise Panasonic DJ40 is much better, more powerful and i enjoy it from over 18 months now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve previously used the waterpik that you hook up to your shower which after returning this one, I bought again. Although this is probably a good waterpik, it feels to me like there is very little pressure. After I used it, I flossed and still got food out. With the oral breeze in the shower there is nothing left in there! The amount of water is fine. I was able to get through my mouth with one fill of water. I never had an issue with battery. I charged once and it worked the week I had this. Having only used the shower one, I was not used to water going everywhere. It makes a huge mess in my opinion but thats just probably operator error. I also see no point in the different heads. I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in using them.</li>
            <li> Had the previous model which worked well, the new model has more power and the accessories provided are useful also.  Overall the waterpik performs as advertised and thus far I have found no down side.</li>
            <li> Works great...just what I wanted</li>
            <li> Makes flossing faster and less of a hassle.. also if you have problems flossing this is the tool for you.  You can get into the tooth pocket where floss wouldn&#x27;t reach.  I got a better dental check up after using this for 6 months.. love it.</li>
            <li> This is 100% better then dental floss.&lt;br /&gt;So far really like this product</li>
            <li> The cordless waterpik is a great product.  I can use use it on my orthodontic work.  It is also great for crowns, bridges, etc.  It is very convienent to take while traveling and will packs easily.</li>
            <li> water pik water flosser cordless is very good it help me so much i love this so much..... 5 star</li>
            <li> One tank lasts about 28 seconds and it doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s on low or high pressure.  I use it for ear lavage on low and as a dental waterpik on high.</li>
            <li> It is convenient to use and small enough to take with me on trips and does not cost that much for what you get!</li>
            <li> As far as I know the recipient has had no problems with this device and is pleased with it&#x27;s performance.</li>
            <li> Love the waterpik. Best and easiest way to floss.</li>
            <li> I love the way my teeth feel after using it, but it is messy, and the water doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Meh. Good for travel but not as powerful as my home water flosser which plugs in for use. Battery dies quickly</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended I buy a waterflosser and I chose Waterpik because of the reputation.  I have been completely satisfied with its performance and I am sure my dentist will be too.[[ASIN:B000UWAWQU Waterpik Waterflosser Cordless PLUS]]</li>
            <li> I have mixed feelings about this product.  On the one hand, it works great for what it was intended to do.  On the other hand, the product life is just too short.  I bought one at Target last August, and it&#x27;s had moderate use since then.  As I&#x27;ve said, it worked perfectly.  However, just over a year later, the battery refuses to accept charge at all any more.  It does not use a standard adapter, so I can&#x27;t even test to see if the adapter is the problem.  So unless my unit was a dud, the life of the product makes it not worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: So I read some of the other reviews and what do you know: Other people were having the same problem.  Applied good old fashioned electrical grade CRC to the charging points and rubbed with an old toothbrush and Voila!  It&#x27;s charging again.  Upgraded from 3 stars to 4 stars.  Not going to 5 stars because they should have figured this out before going to market.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product about 4 months ago and overall have been happy with the performance of this water flosser. It cleans very nicely, easy to use and has good power, however, after only a few months, it quit charging. I thought maybe the charging lead went bad so tested it and it was fine so turned out it is the unit so will have to throw it away which is disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When reading the reviews on this water flosser as I am looking for a replacement, there has been a very high volume of complaints about the unit not charging at less than 1 year old.  I decided it is not worth taking a chance on this model again as more than likely the same problem will occur so will be purchasing a different brand. If you do purchase this, I would recommend you 1) read the reviews out there about it and 2) if you purchase it, be sure to keep your receipt/box as more than likely you will be returning it after a few months due to charging problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did contact the company in hopes that they will work on correcting this problem as again, it works great but if it doesn&#x27;t charge, is pretty useless and overall ends up a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 10/2/2012&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wrote to Waterpik via their web site expressing my disappointment at their product, I received an email from them within hours requesting that I supply the serial number to verify warranty, the next day I received the following email, I have up-graded to two stars the extra star for customer service, will update this review further after using the replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dear xxxxx&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for providing the necessary information to verify your warranty.  We apologize for the difficulty you are experiencing with the WP-450.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A replacement WP-450 has been ordered and should arrive in 7-10 business days.  Order Wxxxxxxxx&lt;br /&gt;will ship from our Shelton, CT warehouse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AFTER USE CARE:&lt;br /&gt;When finished water flossing, we recommend completely emptying the internal pump housing of water. Empty the reservoir and then run the unit for 7-10 seconds to remove the excess water from the internal sections of the water flosser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CHARGING:&lt;br /&gt;To maximize the capacity and life of the rechargeable batteries, the unit should be charged for 24 hours before the first use.  Do not use the unit with the charger pin engaged. The unit can be left on the charger when not in use. For extended battery life, the unit should be charged at least 24 hours after 7-10 uses. Do not allow the WP-450 Water Flosser to completely discharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit should be fully charged before extended periods of no use.  The battery will bleed down its charge in 6-9 months. We recommend fully charging (24 hours) every month if the unit will be in storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CLEANING:&lt;br /&gt;We recommend cleaning the unit once a week - remove the reservoir and wipe all parts with a damp cloth.  Mild diluted dish soap can be used, and a soft damp toothbrush can be used to clean hard to reach areas and crevices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Removing the jet tip after each use is also recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please contact us if you have any further questions or concerns! Thank you for allowing us to assist you.</li>
            <li> The unit works fine. Charges easily and is powerful if you feel you need it. For me the medium setting or the pulse setting works best. The drawback is the size of the fluid reservoir. Takes two fills to get through a full mouth cleaning which is inconvenient to stop for a refill. Nothing against the unit, but in hindsight, I wished I would have purchased the non-cordless unit with a larger reservoir..</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I felt like I needed it to really clean around the crowns on new dental implants and I have to say I love it. It&#x27;s simple to use, and small enough to keep on the bathroom counter. I really don&#x27;t have any complaints, it has plenty of water pressure and does the job. I plan to buy one for my husband for a Christmas gift. Also the dental hygienist was thrilled by what she called my home care.</li>
            <li> I have previously used the traditional and larger &amp;#34;waterpik&amp;#34; device.  I have found that the smaller, &amp;#34;waterpik&amp;#34; flosser does the job every bit as well, and is much easier to pack for travel if necessary.</li>
            <li> It does what is advertised.  I am comfortable using the product.  Suggest using warm water.  Works better on high speed</li>
            <li> I like it because it is compact and fits on my sink without taking up a lot of space.  My dentist said I have greatly improved!</li>
            <li> I liked the cordless plus because it doesn&#x27;t have a cord to navigate while using.  I wish it had some type of button to let me know how much is left in the charge or to let me know when it is fully charged.  We will see how effective it is on my next visit to the dentist.</li>
            <li> Battery lasts quite long.  This is a good investment for your money.  All you need is a source of clean water.  Even bottle water will work.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful.  I love the way my teeth feel afterwards.  It feels like I have just left the dentist office from having my teeth cleaned.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m realizing that these WaterPik things  are an example of you get what you pay for. This model is the second pik i&#x27;ve gotten that has been pretty sh&amp;tty. With this one, the strength of the water isn&#x27;t quite strong enough, but I could live with that. I can&#x27;t live with the fact that it loses it&#x27;s whole charge after about 2 1/2 days though. Don&#x27;t get this thing unless you want to leave it plugged in all the time (which will prob in turn fry it&#x27;s battery in no time).</li>
            <li> I had my Waterpik Cordless for only 3.5 months before it stopped working. Waterpik&#x27;s customer service department was easy to contact and they agreed without argument to replace it. Kudos to them for good customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it worked it did the job well. The pressure is well-calibrated and the water reservoir is large enough for a thorough cleaning. It is well-balanced and pleasant to hold and use. It also comes with a very good selection of heads and a charger than has a long cord  that attaches securely to the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you&#x27;re going to buy one of these you need to be aware that the current charging instructions are to either keep it on charge when not in use, or to recharge it for 24-hours after seven uses. These instructions do not cause me any problems as I have a  battery operated water-flosser that I use when travelling and keep this one continuously on-charge, but your needs may be different.</li>
            <li> The tab that closes the reservoir opening broke in the first or second week of use.  I wonder if there is a way to get a better closing lid/system.</li>
            <li> If you read the description, you are led to believe that this product includes the tongue cleaner. It does not. I contacted Amazon and was given a partial refund, however I checked the box afterwards and it does not show this tip. I won&#x27;t order the tongue cleaner until after I have the opportunity to test the product after charging but I was hoping for a &#x27;whole mouth clean&#x27; which will require an additional 25% over the selling price of the item for something I thought I had already paid for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next part is simply personal preference.  How much could it hurt to include a charge indicator light on this thing. That has been pretty much standard for any device if this type except the waterpik. Hopefully this oversight doesn&#x27;t indicate a desire to skip quality for cheap manufacturing.</li>
            <li> Great product. We bought 3 so far, so everybody in the household has its own. Amazing what it can do for cleaning your teeth, even after you worked with an electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> Update 6/20/14:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the quick failure of the replacement sent by Waterpik, outlined below, I e-mailed them about it. I received an email back offering to send me the counter-top model instead. I jumped at the offer. After using it a couple months-- I LOVE the unit. Not really that big, holds plenty of water, and has 10 pressure settings. I use it twice a day and it does a great job. I would recommend spending a bit more for a countertop model that plugs in, and don&#x27;t waste your money, time and aggravation on the hand held.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will add that the customer service at Waterpik is STELLAR. So refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 3/16 to original review (which is below):  I received the replacement from Waterpik. On about ONLY the 6th use, half way through a session, the pressure suddenly dropped and the sound of the pump increased...the same noise it makes when it runs out of water and is just pumping air. However, it was not out of water, it was half full. Fully charged, filled tank with water again...no-go. First one lasted a few weeks before doing this. Replacement unit lasted 6 or so uses. I haven&#x27;t read any other reviews with this issue, yet find it incredible I received TWO units with pumps that have failed in a short time. I would say ZERO stars if there were an option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will call Waterpik again to see what they want to do about it, but I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;ll be time for a refund from Amazon this time around. I do want something like this, I will check around for a different brand.&lt;br /&gt;_________&lt;br /&gt;February 2014 Review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoyed using this, it was recommended by my dental hygienist. I was surprised at the bits of debris that came out of my mouth even after brushing my teeth. I am not trying to avoid traditional flossing, but use this as a supplemental cleaning step. I find that the reservoir is big enough for a full cleaning, if not, who cares, pop the cap and refill it, it takes three second to do that. I use lukewarm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed when, after just a couple months, the pressure suddenly was half what it was. I checked for clogs, battery charge, etc to find and easy fix, but it seems the pump simply lost pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally got around to calling Waterpik&#x27;s 800 Customer service number and have to say I was DELIGHTED that I only had to press one automated prompt, to select the product line...and suddenly, a REAL person was talking to me...a very friendly, helpful and delightful young  lady. This compares to cancelling a magazine subscription earlier in the day, that took five minutes of voice mail prompts, and never a live person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway...I explained the problem, gave her the model and serial number and then...wait for it........she said, \\&quot;If you give me your name and address, we&#x27;ll get a replacement in the mail to you right way.\\&quot; WOW. No hassles, having to ship the unit back, no &#x27;shipping fees.\\&quot; I was floored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a problem with your unit, don&#x27;t hassle Amazon with it, just call Waterpik (the number is on their website) and as long as you are in the warranty period, they&#x27;ll send a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said all that...I hope the new one lasts a bit longer than two months.</li>
            <li> It has meet all our needs and exceeded.  I have been enjoying it very much.  I has met all of the needs that I want it to.</li>
            <li> This water-pik is terrible. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to refill it FOUR times just to QUICKLY cover all 4 quadrants of my mouth.  SMALL reservoir!  If you want to do a thorough job, you&#x27;re going to be refilling it all morning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The filling orifice is so small that you will overrun it unless you turn the tap down to a minimum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s taller than the height of my faucet.  I have to tilt it awkwardly just to get the opening under my faucet.  Your faucet may be taller and not a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no adjustment on the pressure.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you tilt it while using it, the water stops.  You have to keep the darned thing straight up in order to use it, meaning that you are drooling all over it and your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The socket for the charger is on the handle, meaning that when you&#x27;re washing it off after you&#x27;ve drooled all over it, you&#x27;re getting water in the socket.  To be safe, I&#x27;m waiting till the water in the socket dries before I plug it in to recharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you&#x27;re using it, you&#x27;re holding the entire device, not just a spigot.  It feels too clunky in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I&#x27;d bought it in a store so it would be easy to return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to use it only until I buy a better model.  Then it&#x27;s going to be relegated to my suitcase just so I&#x27;ll have _something_ for when I travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY...</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like how easy they are to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is my second cordless Waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;The first can&#x27;t hold energy for more than two days.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m carefull not to drain the battery, I keep the battery over 50% full. Now I don&#x27;t have the problem that the battery can hold energy.</li>
            <li> My dentist highly recommended a waterpik for my daily use. This item came quickly and I was amazed at how well it works. Great to use instead of flossing. It has a set of four tips for different uses. I highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Small reservoir notwithstanding, 2 design inadequacies:&lt;br /&gt;The fact that a product is cordless implies that it is portable and more convenient than a wired model.&lt;br /&gt;Two major gripes about this flosser so far: The charger is 110/120V only meaning it&#x27;s not suitable for frequent international travelers.  I cannot, for example, imagine that a Braun power toothbrush is single voltage and if you travel to Europe you can&#x27;t recharge it.&lt;br /&gt;And #2, where&#x27;s the charging indicator on this thing?  There must be a way to let you know that (a) it&#x27;s charging and (b) it is fully charged.&lt;br /&gt;And what does Waterpik do?  It tries to miniaturize its traditional water flosser into a smaller version, but still cumbersome version, and keeps the cordless and potentially easily portable version constrained with the above</li>
            <li> Love this - I fill it at sink lean over clean my teeth to my hearts desire - charge it every other week and I have the happiest teeth.  This is a perfect product!  You can have warmer water to make it less harsh, you can leave it in the bathroom without a plug for several weeks and NO HASSLE.  LOVE LOVE THIS!  I HATE FLOSSING AND WANTED TO DO A BETTER JOB WITH MY TEETH.  And Now I am.</li>
            <li> I purchased this unit for one thing: travel. We love to take road trips in a tiny little sports car, where space is at a minimum, and in the past it meant leaving the Waterpik at home. Even when we fly for a warm vacation, we like to travel light, and the bulk of the regular unit was annoying, so once again, we&#x27;d suffer through yucky teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now we can take our Waterpik with us. It&#x27;s not too heavy to use and the ergonomics of it are good -- it feels good in the hand, is balanced, is of a size and weight that are comfortable, and can be angled easily. Because I like a lower pressure pulse and my husband likes a higher, this unit is ideal, since it has a switch that offers high or low pressure. You have to fill it twice to do your teeth (actually one and a half does the trick), but it&#x27;s easy to fill, and it sure beats feeling yucky for two weeks. If the reservoir had been any bigger, the unit would have weight and balance issues, so I feel satisfied with the design. We found it holds a charge for five days, but we have yet to take it on a longer trip, so it could be more. We also invested in the carrying case, which is very handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For day-to-day use at home, I would recommend the regular counter top unit with the larger reservoir, but this one is ideal for travel. For those who are buying your first Waterpik, it is a must-have for a clean-feeling mouth. I&#x27;m a recent convert, using it since my husband got one for use with his braces, and I love it. After careful brushing and flossing, there are still bits of food that are flushed out from the gums, and your mouth feels much cleaner after using your Waterpik,</li>
            <li> My countertop InterPlak died and I decided to give this a try. It works, but it is awkward to use especially when trying to clean behind the lower teeth. I expected to either love this thing or hate it. Instead I just find it to be terribly mediocre. I am going to get another countertop unit.</li>
            <li> My wife really wanted this.  Ordered based on recommendation from her dentist.  She is really excited about using.the ester pik.</li>
            <li> lacked information 110 or 220v quality product, Another difficulty is always to supply the refill, good for day-to-day, I recommend</li>
            <li> I bought the WP450 cordless model in June 2012, after repeated 6-month dentist appointments with ever deepening \\&quot;pockets\\&quot; and me saying: OK, I&#x27;ll try harder, brush better, floss better/more often, reach those corners better.  Phooey, it was all obviously to no avail.  I hate string flossing, and sort-of tolerate the Reach flosser, so I wondered how I&#x27;d ever use this regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It turns out that this device is pleasant to use.  Even when I first started I had virtually no pain in those most sensitive areas of my gums.  Now? Forget it; there&#x27;s NONE.  I&#x27;ve used it very regularly.  Now I really miss it if I don&#x27;t use it.  It just makes me feel better and even helps make brushing easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This device has made a huge difference.  I&#x27;m now a \\&quot;poster-child\\&quot; for turning around imminent gum disease.  ALL of my pockets have improved immensely over the 6 months.  My hygienist was amazed, even though she has used one for some time. I told her which model I purchased and that I prefer to use it in the shower because I don&#x27;t have to worry about being neat.  She thought that was a great idea and said she&#x27;d ditch her corded model too and start \\&quot;doing it\\&quot; in the shower.  Once in a while I&#x27;ll use about 1/3 hydrogen peroxide with the water fill; this makes a very good germ killer/breath freshener.  I&#x27;m one of those folks who dislikes the strong flavor of mouthwashes and &#x27;mint-this-or-that&#x27; in particular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is really useful for doing a great flossing job - there&#x27;s not much more to say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t seen any problems with the connector pins on the unit.  They are gold-plated, so they should not corrode.  I never plug it into the charger after use; it&#x27;s just not smart to do that wet - electrochemistry WILL happen if you do.  Let it dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it loud?  This depends on the person.  I would say it is somewhat.  It&#x27;s quieter and completely tolerable when it&#x27;s pumping fluid.  It&#x27;s louder when it&#x27;s empty.  I&#x27;m a function-over-almost-anything kind of person, so the benefits far outweigh that trait of the appliance.  Make your dentist happy; get flossing! Water-flossing, that is!</li>
            <li> it failed after 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Works really good.. Helps and replace flossing</li>
            <li> Super portable and great for travel, however, after some time it starts to get yucky and the battery charge doesn&#x27;t hold as long.  I bought mine with insurance from Amazon and ended up having to file a claim because it no longer worked after 8 months.  I would stick with the non-portable waterpik if you are looking into purchasing one.</li>
            <li> fantastic  just buy it and use with mouthwash.  the dentist will tell you there is a difference</li>
            <li> Muy buen producto, limpia y mejora la salud de tus dientes y encías.., lo recomiendo a todas las personas de cualquier edad, úsenlo y verán los resultados en poco tiempo, gracias por todo..,</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it would be a great alternative to my countertop WaterPik when I traveled. When I received it, the shipping label said \\&quot;Primary lithium battery - not for transport on passenger aircraft.\\&quot; Amazon refunded everything. But this information needed to be in the product description. Don&#x27;t buy it if you&#x27;re traveling by plane!!</li>
            <li> the switch is not flexible,and the water pressure cannot satisfied me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! overall it is good ,after all it&#x27;s cheap !</li>
            <li> Why would anyone buy something you have to gerry rig to make it work?  If I&#x27;m travleing I want something that&#x27;s going to work as it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> My dentist told me that I had 2mm pockets, but that overall my gums were nice and healthy. I wanted to see how good this waterpik was, so I started using it every day. I rinsed my gums out with coca cola religiously 3 times a day after brushing my teeth. 6 months later I went to go see my dentist. She said that I now have stage 4 periodontal disease with 7-8 mm pockets with 90% bone loss. This is a great product and I would recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> Well, I was dubious, but I thought it would be great for oral health -- and it is.  But, it is just as poorly engineered as other reviewers have mentioned.  I &amp;#34;trained&amp;#34; the battery carefully, but a greater problem is the location of the socket for the charger, which is placed where water can easily get into it.  Thus, I spent as much time drying out the electrical connections as using it on my mouth.  Still, it didn&#x27;t last.  Has been acting &amp;#34;finicky&amp;#34; switching off unpredictably and nursed back into action for months.  And then it simply quit.  Yes, I do not like it despite the fact that -- when it was working -- it did exactly what it was supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Why would you make a great product to take with you on your travels but only supply a 110 volt charger?&lt;br /&gt;Laptops, phones and the like have universal 110-220 volt chargers so why can&#x27;t you favorite dental hygene tool?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disappointing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gary T</li>
            <li> I have nothing to compare it with but his teeth are cleaner and whiter then they use to be. He said it is very refreshing!</li>
            <li> This is a nifty waterflosser with a small footprint. It is small enough to take it along for travel. It works very well, considering its small size. It has a dual pressure control system. The water reservoir is big enough to allow for 30 - 40 sec of flossing at a time. Can also be used with an OTC mouth wash or a therapeutic rinse to address periodontal problems. It would be nice to have a third setting for even stronger pressure. One full battery charge allows for several applications.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had various waterpiks for years and this one is really terrific.  It&#x27;s light and very easy to hold.  There&#x27;s just the right amount of water in the container.  I dry it after I use it with a towel which may or may not do anything.  It holds a charge for more than a week and I use it twice a day.  I highly recommend it.  And the price is right.</li>
            <li> I put water from the kettle into the waterpik to mix with cold water as I don&#x27;t like ice cold water against my teeth.  The flap on the waterpik melted and fell off.  It still works, but the plastic must be of low quality.  Using a waterpik certainly makes a big difference in cleaning my teeth - pity it is not more robust.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for anyone who needs healthier gums and wants to improve dental hygiene, etc&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product did take a little getting used to the first time i used it and took longer than 60 seconds! lol .. but once you get your head around how to maneuver it around your mouth, it only takes 60 secs and you&#x27;re done!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;your whole mouth feels fresher and cleaner - it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Buy this if you want your bathroom to look like a wet dog shook off all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned it.</li>
            <li> I have one for each house , this s a great product  easy to use and does its job. I now have three.</li>
            <li> It does its part well. It is a portable device, so you expect to give up some power. I liked it.</li>
            <li> This is my third cordless waterpik and I cannot live without it. First one stopped working after about a year because we have hard water and I did not follow the cleaning instructions. Next one I had for more than 2 years and I dropped it on the ceramic tile floor. The pik broke off and so did the flap where the water goes in. I figured it&#x27;s time for a new one anyway. With the cost of dental treatments fifty bucks is a good investment.</li>
            <li> Excellent water pick that can be used all week on a single charge.</li>
            <li> This was a present for my husband!</li>
            <li> like the older model better</li>
            <li> I recently purchased my second unit [third if I count the one I gave my spouse]. The first lasted 2 years. I was pretty annoyed about that until I read on this site the positive customer review that included a detailed and well-conceived explanation about the care and charging of the battery. I had started shopping for a new device, determined to never purchase another WaterPik flosser. After reading that review, I checked the terminals on my unit and sure enough they were corroded. I always kept the first unit connected to the charger when not in use. I did wipe the unit each time, but I did not spend much time drying the terminals, if at all. Now I place a piece of clear tape over the terminals until the unit needs to be charged; I only charge the unit when the battery is spent. No wet, corroding terminals and the unit seems as powerful as the first time I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this device, except for the cost. Having borne the expense of deep cleaning, I am glad I have it in my dental toolkit. My teeth and gums look and feel cleaner and healthier when I use it which is every day. It is like a massage for your mouth. Originally, I purchased the flosser as an alternative to string floss. Wonder where I got that idea?!? Big mistake. The dental hygienist could not believe how much more plaque I had since the previous 6th month appointment- she seldom has to spend much time cleaning my teeth. She explained I need to use the device in conjunction with string floss. Each serves a different purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From a hygiene point, I could not wait to obtain another water flosser, but I wish I could have due to the now lower price! I also wish WaterPik would address the battery/corrosion issues. At this price why should I have to add a piece of tape to extend the unit&#x27;s life?</li>
            <li> I used my waterpik for the first time today. I was unsure about getting this or the countertop model but decided on this one as the other one seemed much too bulky to display on the countertop. Plus, I travel every now and then so I like the idea of being able to carry this around. Well! On to the next part... I used it for the first time today! WHAT A MESS!!! I believe I sprayed everything within a two foot radius in my bathroom :/ NOT what I expected! Soooo hard to maneuver.... I was pretty dissapointed and the \\&quot;low&#x27; setting seemed much too harsh for me. I immediately began trying to figure out how to return it and what to get instead... after a couple more clumsy attempts (during which I changed tips three times) and two refills I turned it off. I smiled at my mirror which happened to be covered in water and WOW!! WAS I IMPRESSED! My teeth looked great!! Much better than when I floss. I CANNOT believe this little machine could do THAT much in ONE use. I am anxious to continue using it and seeing how much better my teeth will look (eventually) SO... in conclusion, although I had a difficult time controlling it it really does pay off! I just need to get the hang of it :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I will update this review later on*</li>
            <li> Great job I love the Waterpik, it is a very good product.  I feel like I don&#x27;t nee to floss anymore.</li>
            <li> I tested it and decided I cannot use it for everyday because of the water limit. So i bought a larget water flosser.</li>
            <li> It took a little getting used to, but now I love it! It&#x27;s great for cleaning between two teeth that are too tight to get floss between.</li>
            <li> Waterpikin&#x27; as we call it, is the best thing to keep you mouth and gums healthy. With this cordless model it is so easy to use and store.</li>
            <li> This model is a superior product compared to the basic model. The battery lasts me at least 2 weeks, longer actually. I&#x27;m glad I took a chance on it. Plus, it anything goes wrong Waterpik will replace it if you keep your receipt.</li>
            <li> Works good, and price was much lower than what my dentist office offered.  Noticed a difference after the first couple uses, very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> This is my second cordless waterpik. Good while they last but they don&#x27;t last. I had the same issue as last one - battery life and corrosion on contact points preventing changing. Do not buy the cordless - stay with the plug-in cord type.</li>
            <li> This little machine does an excellent job.  Used the smaller version for yrs. but they don&#x27;t  last more then a yr.  So hopin&#x27; this unit will last a little longer.  The pump on this has a bout a 1/3 more power then it&#x27;s little brother and get the job done quick.</li>
            <li> easy to use,.. great jet pressure... compact...would recommend to anyone who wants to get a good cleaning between teeth (along with flossing of course.)</li>
            <li> This thing really gets the food particles out from between your teeth and under your gums.  Only takes a couple of tries to become very proficient at using.  This is the first tool I have ever had to clean my teeth this way so perhaps all of them do as well.  All I know is I was looking at some that cost twice as much but I don&#x27;t see how they could possibly work better.  Reservoir holds plenty of water for one pass and is easily and quickly refillable.  I use 3 times a day after brushing after each meal.  I still floss at night but very seldom is any other residue dislodged.  Battery lasts at least 2 weeks between charges.  I wish I had bought one of these years ago but in reading the reviews I think a lot of improvements have been incorporated in this newer model.</li>
            <li> Love this waterpik. It&#x27;s my second one. Battery on 1st went capput after a couple of years. My dental exams are markedly improved after using this. I put mouthwash in the vessel with some warm water for a really refreshing clean. This with flossing will improve your dental checkups pronto.</li>
            <li> I have three units.  All worked great for two or three months.  Purchased over the last 9 months.  Now none work.  Customer service graciously replaced one unit but now wants receipts, etc.  Too much trouble.  Product doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> The pressure on this flosser seems to be lacking in comparison to the old Waterpik cordless flosser I had.  It is a little upsetting because I only had the last Waterpik for a short period of time before it would no longer hold a charge.  I am sure this one will do the same because it looks like that wasn&#x27;t taken care of in this product either.  The charging contacts are out in the open so that they get wet and eventually one of the contacts will turn green and won&#x27;t electrically connect with the plug.  Also the water tank was redesigned and I think the old design was much easier to fill.  It is really hard to fill this one fully.  I wish Waterpik would get it together and make a charging system more like the Sonicare products, which are a closed charging system and they hold a charge much longer.  I am sure I will be replacing this one within a year again! When they work though, they work.  I feel they make a huge difference for flossing around my caps, especially the front of the caps where you can&#x27;t really floss, it gets all the gunk out for a fresher mouth.</li>
            <li> The unit loses power mid-use so I try to really hit my rough spots early on.  I love the waterpik and swear by it.  This unit I have to keep plugged in constantly to maintain any power for use though and it&#x27;s still quite lackluster.  My sister has another model that she doesn&#x27;t have an issue with.</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time and is working great for me. I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, 2 power settings, fits in the hand well.  Broke the old one and tried this because of the price.  Very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;Cunfunit</li>
            <li> I was always sceptic about the waterpick versus flossing. But this product does  work the same and maybe even better. It does get the teeth very clean, in every little pocket. I have  braces and it works great around them with the standard tip. No more touching the gross floss :))  Pros: Gets the teeth sparkling clean. Period.  Cons: The tip DOES rotate easily, like other reviewers mentioned. Not sure if it&#x27;s a safety issue, but it is rotating way too easy. Workaround - I just hold it by the tip instead of the body and regulate it.  The tank does empty very fast, but the workaround - just keep the faucet running and from time to time just fill in the water without stopping, just bend low :) It works fine and saves time.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT...DOES WHAT THE BIG ONE DOES ...DOES NOT TAKE UP MUCH COUNTER SPACE ..HAS 4 DIFFERENT HEADS TO GO WITH IT</li>
            <li> Was working good for 4 months, then pump wont pump water anymore it just died all of sudden. Tried cleaning it but still no water pressure, its useless now.</li>
            <li> I have never used a waterpik for flossing before.  This thing is wonderful--doesn&#x27;t hurt the gums or teeth.  Much better than using regular wooden or plastic picks.</li>
            <li> This was not the first time I&#x27;ve purchased this product. When my former pik needed to be replaced (I dropped it on a tile floor and good-bye flosser) I took the easy route and purchased what had been working very well. I love the &amp;#34;action&amp;#34; and the tip settings are easy to use. My  gums are much healthier (per dentist) so it must be doing its job. My only complaint about this product is the reservoir - the only way to completely empty the last bit of water is to disassemble and dry/shake it out. Big deal????? not really, just one more thing to do and inconvenient when in a hurry. If not for that, I&#x27;d  give this 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I love this WaterPik.  It works great, just enough time on.  It&#x27;s just enough to totally rinse your mouth out.  I look so forward every day to using this.  More then once a day.  Gets out those popcorn husks you can&#x27;t get with a tooth pick.  Easier on the gums then toothpicks.  It&#x27;s stylish.  My dentist recommended this and I&#x27;m glad she did.  Love, love.  I put in my cap full of mouth wash and its all done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used one before, so this is my first experience.  My husband has used the bigger one and I didn&#x27;t want to clutter my bathroom, so I never tried and now I wonder why I waited so long.  My teeth never felt cleaner.  It&#x27;s just the right amount of pressure and water to complete the job. and... it is small enough not to &#x27;clutter&#x27;.  I love it!!</li>
            <li> works great and a very good price I would recommend this to anyone. My dentist recommended I get one to help my gums</li>
            <li> Its good for a once over and usually needs to be refilled to finish the job. The pressure is a little low even on the high setting, but on the upside it doesn&#x27;t wake up the neighbors like the plugin ones I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> This is not the waterpik I grew up with! It is so much better; no messy container to fill with water- this is portable with a long lasting battery. It comes with 4 different tips ( 2 are specifically for bridge work and braces!). I use it 2 times a day and the battery charge lasts me a good 10 days. Remember to use with warm water for better cleaning and minus the shock of 40 psi of cold water blasting your teeth and gums- unless you are into that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reaserching several dental websites, it is apparant that this does not replace flossing; this is good for cleaning gumlines and overall food removal. The dental floss is still best at cleaning  the surfaces between teeth. I do not even play a dentist on TV so please do your own research:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You cannot go wrong with using this in concert with flossing and a spinning toothbrush head! No more of those awfully expensive and very painful dental deep scalings of the  gums! A very inexpensive method to prevent THAT madness!  My wife and son both have braces and they both love their Waterpik waterflossers!</li>
            <li> This will be used for travel only.  It does compair with the standard unit I use, but it will do for travel, I found the instructions lacking.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my dentist and I&#x27;ve been using it for 3 months now. I  started off on low pressure and had some gum bleeding using it but now I use it on full power and there is no gum bleeding so it is working.  I find it much easier then flossing with the string and that means I will actually do it!  Fits nicely in my hand and the tank holds enough water to do half my teeth then a quick refill and the other half.</li>
            <li> The water sprays everywhere, except where its supposed to. Very difficult to use and poor instructions. Terrible product! I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> enough so that she uses it, which is the point, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have trouble with it myself, tend to squirt myself in the face or the wall - and prefer my corded countertop model so i can lean over the sink and drool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does seem noisy - but then, you&#x27;re holding the motor right near you ears. Naw - i can hear it from the next room - it IS noisy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s powerful enough to stand on the porch and squirt the cats stalking the birds at the feeder. Cats hate it, birds cheer.</li>
            <li> Takes up so little counter top space, always handy and the convenience of not having a tube connected to the dispenser.  Strong enough to do a good rinsing job and soft enough to not hurt the gums.  Empties sooner than I am finished but refilling simply takes a couple of seconds.  The minor element of having to refill is easily offset by the comfortable size that fits easily in the hand. In a very short time I have come to wanting to use it every night before bed for the comfortable refreshing feeling that then accompanies me when falling to sleep.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and it always works well for me. I can definitely tell the difference before/after flossing with it.</li>
            <li> Waterpik Waterflossers have always been GREAT products!  This smaller model is perfect for travel, or for your younger family members ... it is more compact but still the same great quality as the larger models.  It is well made, versatile, and easy to use!  Nothing better than the feeling of a super clean mouth and teeth!</li>
            <li> Really like the item until I had to recharge about every other day then daily. Then was replaced and the replacement worked for about 3 months before the battery/charger started acting up again. Company replaced with the wired unit and we are happy with it and really like the way both cleaned our teeth/gums.</li>
            <li> WONDERFUL ! USE IT TWICE PER DAY. MAKES MY  MOUTH FEEL  GREAT.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for three years. It would seem like it being a rechargeable device would make it a plus to have. But not so. After about a year, something happens to the rechargeable battery inside of it. It just gets really weak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It runs completely dead after a number of uses before you need to plug it in again to recharge. That&#x27;s normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is not normal (or maybe it could be normal, I really don&#x27;t know) is that I started to have to plug it in after less and less usage. Meaning that: while new, I would only need to recharge it after say, six uses. Then as time goes by, I had to recharge it after five uses, then after four, then three, then two, till now I have to recharge it after each and every use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it even runs dead, from fully charged, in the middle of an operation. So even though it took years to disappoint me, it still  happened non-the-less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I thought that I would have had this thing forever, without the need to be here searching for a different one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely will not buy another rechargeable one. I am looking for one that uses an electric cord or battery because I don&#x27;t want to have the same experience again.</li>
            <li> So far, much better than previous small model portable Waterpick - bad battery life. Battery lasts 12 months plus 1 day.</li>
            <li> THIS ITEM WORKS FAIRLY WELL.  THE &amp;#34;DOOR&amp;#34; OPENING TO PUT WATER IN BROKE ALMOST IMMEDIATLY.  SUPPOSE TO FLOP DOWN BUT BROKE OFF AND REQUIRES PUSHING BACK ON .  COULD BE MUCH BETTER DESIGNED</li>
            <li> recommended by my dentist.  It has made amazing difference in my gums withing 3 minths.  Dentist very pleased and now no issue with my gums.  Love the product.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a waterflosser I could take on vacation, but this is almost too heavy to use and difficult to maneuver.</li>
            <li> It is a gift for my husband. My father also like it. So, I buy another one for my father.</li>
            <li> This works very well and seems to get into crevices where floss never seemed to fit. Only complaint is the water pressure on the Hi setting could be stronger and the fact that it is very difficult to find replacement tips doesn&#x27;t help either.</li>
            <li> Flossing with water really works. Ask your dentist. Using one of these will prevent gum pockets from forming around teeth. If you already have pockets in your gums, you must use a water-flosser twice daily, to prevent them from getting deeper. Deep pockets will give you gingivitis, unless you clean them 2X daily. The Cordless Plus is convenient to use, holds its charge well, and so far (5 months) has worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> This is amazing.  I never realized how much more our teeth need even after flossing.</li>
            <li> Makes water-picking in the shower allot easier.</li>
            <li> 4 stars because the battery is not replaceable if it goes out, it goes in trash</li>
            <li> I travel a good deal and this is indispensable for both its portability and for its cleaning power.  I purchased a cheaper one first and there is no comparison as far as cleaning my teeth and gum spaces.  It now goes everywhere with me!</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I liked it while it worked, but stopped working after 2 years.</li>
            <li> I love this flosser. Not sure why i hadn&#x27;t bought one years ago! Portability is a big plus. The price was great as well.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for mom but she thinks it&#x27;s bulky</li>
            <li> I used this flosser daily until it broke.  WaterPik replaced my leaking unit with a new one.  I&#x27;ve since switched over to the travel model with global voltage as it&#x27;s much easier for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do absolutely recommend using a waterpik every day.  This was my starter unit.  And I would still use it every day if I didn&#x27;t have my travel model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I waterpik after brushing and stuff still comes out.  Additionally, I notice that the spaces between teeth are cleaned out of the biofilm that remains after brushing.  If I get lazy and stop using it for a while I notice that my gums bleed for the first few days of use.  This tells me that my gums really are getting stimulated and healthy from regular use of the waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t have a waterpik you should buy one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular portable model has an easy fill reservoir with the fill hole located on the side so when it&#x27;s tilted under the faucet of a small sink it fills easily.  My father has the older model that must be filled from the top using a cup.  This one is better and comes with a year longer warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find 2-3 fillings required for a nice thorough cleaning.  I use the high setting always with the regular jet tip.</li>
            <li> I have used the waterpik for about a month now.  I am really pleased with the product, easy to use, easy to store.  Mouth feels really clean.</li>
            <li> Its not worth it, it is all a return product from customer who bought it and not liking how it works...it is a waste of time to look and a waste of money to buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have the latest Waterpik complete it comes with sonic toothbrush..this is an excellent buy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like that it is a continuous flow of water, that you have no control without shutting it on or off. It is ok.</li>
            <li> This waterpik is good and perfect for travel. I have been using it for a month now and the charge stays atleast for a week if not more. Its water capacity is sufficient and can be easily filled. I have a the regular waterpik ultra flosser (countertop version) at home, but this is good enough and most importantly portable. Also there are only two speed settings, so i would suggest this for not regular use but for days when you are on the move or on travel. I would recommend this product but I think this should come with a bag to carry it around - but it doesn&#x27;t - so do find appropriate ways to carry especially the tips.</li>
            <li> I owned my &#x27;rechargeable&#x27; unit for less than three months when it would not hold a charge after two uses.  After reading that it is a basically disposable appliance (you cannot replace the battery), I was extremely disappointed with the purchase and the waste of it all.  Shame on you Waterpik.</li>
            <li> I never used one of these before but it has integrated itself well into my lifestyle.  I did a lot of research before I bought this one and it appeared to have the best reviews with one caveat.  A lot of reviewers said they had problems with it holding a charge after about a year because water may be getting into the unit via the cord attachment.  Suggestions have been to put a little petroleum jelly into the plug area and/or cover the area with some duct tape when not plugged in.  I have an electric toothbrush which has lasted me over 7 years and I don&#x27;t see why this, &#x27;Waterpik Waterflosser Cordless PLUS&#x27; shouldn&#x27;t do the same.  So I&#x27;m using the jelly and the tape just to make sure, so far everything is working great.</li>
            <li> Brushing teeth with braces can be tricky. My daughter uses this waterpik flosser for those hard to reach areas. She finds it easy to use.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t do it without making a mess and or running out of water too soon. Flossing is better when compared to this. I wanted it to work but not for me or my husband.</li>
            <li> Does a good job, much easier for me than flossing, but I have to fill the resevoir twice to get the job done. Could also be used as a bidet...if you&#x27;re in the mood.</li>
            <li> So handy being cordless, but powrful enough to do a great job!!</li>
            <li> Works great, the only downside is that you have to keep refilling the water reservoir. But I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> by far not so strong and effective as the normal standard Watepik which, by the way, has a very short life as the hose breakes no matter how careful you handle the Waterpik. No repair possible.</li>
            <li> The Waterpik Ultra Cordless was recommended by our dentist. It&#x27;s lived up to the recommendation in its ease of use and efficacy. Even my young daughter likes it, so it must be a great product. I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t use on all my teeth before it ran out of water.  Maybe they all work this way, but I was not pleased with the product.  It was also very awkward to hold and move around my mouth.  I returned the item and got a refund as soon as the seller got it back.  There was nothing wrong with the seller and their service was great.  Thanks for the chance to write this review.  I&#x27;m just sorry that it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for travelling purposes. It meets my needs just fine. Not too large, easy to pack, and reasonably light in weight. Easy to handle and maneuver while using. The jet is concentrated and penetratiing, giving a perfect clean and aeration, as well as gum health maintenance and preservation. The water reservoir holds only seven ounces, so you may need to refill as necessary for personal preference. I would not recommend it for home use, would be too time consuming, I&#x27;d prefer a much larger model. However, it is ideal for travelling, to which end, I use it with every satisfaction, and I do recommend it.</li>
            <li> I thought the bad reviews may be a fluke and I decided to purchase this item for myself.  Let me just be blunt...This item is awful.    Every flaw you&#x27;ve read about is true.  The water reservoir runs out in about 15 seconds.  This isn&#x27;t even enough time to do one part of your mouth.  The pick itself rattles around and ends up pointing in every direction imaginable.  This makes it impossible to use the device to clean your teeth and gums.  Water ends up shooting everywhere.  You also have to hold the device upright in order for it to work.  As a result, the discharged water ends up running out on the device, and you end up with a mess on your hands.    If I were Waterpik, I&#x27;d be embarrassed to even market this.  They clearly either didn&#x27;t put any research into this item, or they will just blindly sell whatever they can without any regard for usability or practicality.    Trust me...these negative reviews are spot on.  Do NOT waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> The on-off switch is touchy--and responds in the off position, even at a slight touch--which is unfortunate. The result is water all over my bathroom. Now I know why my dentist suggested the shower-proof version. It also takes two or three tankfuls of water to get the job done. I was hoping to travel with it, but it&#x27;s quite bulky. All I can say positive--which is of course the main thing--is that it goes where no floss and toothbrush have gone before, flushing away debris one-two-three.</li>
            <li> This item is great.  It does not adjust as much as we would like but we love that you can use it while it is not plugged in since we do not have plugs all over the place like newer homes have.  Easy to travel with and easy to use.  It is somewhat large but I don&#x27;t think they could make it smaller and still have enough water to clean one entire mouth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for less than week but I&#x27;m very pleased with it now hoping it will stay like it&#x27;s now&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve charged it once for the whole night &amp; it&#x27;s still works since then (4 days ago)</li>
            <li> I found the Waterpik Waterflosser Cordless handy, but the batteries got defective after a few months, so you need to charge the unit more and more often.</li>
            <li> Replaced same unit when battery would not hold a full charge. New unit works fine but is a little noisy.</li>
            <li> Got it for a child with braces.  Has improved her ability to maintain her mouth properly including around her hardware.</li>
            <li> I have had three of the cordless WaterPik rechargeable oral irrigatiors over the past year and a half.&lt;br /&gt;Each unit failed after several months of use. The problem was the same each time: it would not take a charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In reading reviews provided by others, this is a very common occurrence. It&#x27;s so, common, in fact, that retailers such as Amazon, Walmart, CVS, etc , might consider discontinuing this product.</li>
            <li> LOVE THE CORDLESS WATERPIK WATERFLOSSER, IT ACTUALLY MAKES FLOSSING FUN! ONLY WISH THE WATER RESERVOIR WERE A LITTLE LARGER AND CLOSURE LEAK-PROOF TO PREVENT WATER FROM SPILLING, WHILE TILTING THE UNIT TO FLOSS INSIDE OF LOWER JAW. WOULD DEFINITELY BUY AGAIN DUE TO CORDLESS/PORTABLE CONVENIENCE.    THIS IS AN UPDATE TO THE ABOVE - DON&#x27;T BUY - I NOTICED A DESIGN FLOW, THE AREA AROUND THE CHARGER PLUG, CAME LOOSE, WATER GOT INTO THE UNIT&#x27;S BACK, WHEN I SAW IT, THE WHOLE INSIDE WAS COVERED IN BLACK MOLD. I TRIED TO REMOVE IT BUT WAS UNSUCCESSFUL, DUE TO THE LOCATION OF THE MOLD. UNFORTUNATELY, DON&#x27;T HAVE TIME TO CONTACT EITHER THE MANUFACTURER OR AMAZON. TOOK PIC&#x27;S TAKING THE UNIT APART (SO I COULD PUT IT BACK TOGETHER AGAIN, WHAT A WASTE)    ANYWAY, IF YOU HAVE THE UNIT LOOK AT IT BEHIND THE WATER RESERVOIR AND MAKE SURE THE SMALL ELECTRIC PLUG-IN IS NOT LOOSE. BLACK MOLD IS VERY BAD FOR YOUR HEALTH AND CAN KILL YOU IF YOU ARE ALLERGIC!!!!    GOOD LUCK!!!</li>
            <li> Having read other comments before purchasing, I kept the terminal opening covered with tape when not recharging. Worked great for 7 months, then the battery would no longer charge. This is a ripoff.</li>
            <li> My Waterpik Waterflosser is wonderful.  I had a difficult time using regular floss and this works great, especially with 2 different pressures of the water. The only negative, and I guess it has to be, is that it is large in size. But my gums have been healthier than ever.</li>
            <li> I had the WP-360W for years, until the battery gave out.  The battery cannot be replaced.  I got this larger model WP-450 because the warrantee is better, suggesting that this larger one is better.  But...  1-It&#x27;s hard to fill.  2-It&#x27;s hard to empty so that the tank will dry between uses.  3-The tank is bigger and is hard to hold.  4-Even though the tank is bigger, it still takes 2 fills to clean my mouth satisfactorily.  Too bad.</li>
            <li> It is too unweildy.  Feels uncomfortable in the hand while using it.  Turning the machine while it&#x27;s operating is difficult.</li>
            <li> This Waterpik may feel a little bit bulky at first compared to a regular toothbrush but if it was any smaller the water well would not hold enough water. The cordless feature is wonderful and it comes with a sampling of tips so you can see which ones you like the best. This is my second one. I used the first one for several years before needing a replacement.</li>
            <li> The water pik water flosser is pretty effective and convenient but disappointing in the end. I have bought two units of the products and they worked well initially but after a short time they stopped charging. I bought the first unit in March 2012 and it worked well initially but stopped charging after three months. I then bought the second unit in September 2012 and took it outside the US. The second unit is already having charging problems,after just 4 weeks of use. I contacted waterpik&#x27;s customer service but they were not helpful, they promised to contact me but they never did. Another reviewer had already complained about the charging system of the unit so thought they have worked on it and improved it so am disapointed that the unit is still having charging problems.&lt;br /&gt;Another issue is that the unit is designed for use only with 110 - 120v electricity, which means if you have to take it to a country with 220-240v electricity, as I had to do, you must get a transformer which is additional cost and sometimes dont work very well.</li>
            <li> The unit initially worked quite well; a great adjunct to the oral hygiene routine. I used a peroxide based mouth wash with water and had good result.  Yes, the reservoir is small but it&#x27;s so easy to refill that I don&#x27;t find that to be an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within about a week of using the device, the power started to fall off quickly between charges.  I get one or two uses on high and then the high setting became like the low.  Eight weeks in the device wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge -- and the entire assembly where the reservoir meets the main unit was moldy.  Maybe I missed something in the instructions, something about having to take the reservoir off each time and let the unit dry out?  I don&#x27;t know because I didn&#x27;t see any instructions that said anything about that. It would be been a pain but I would have done it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t contact Waterpik because frankly my time is worth more than sitting on the phone or packing the thing up and sending it back.  It went into the trash.</li>
            <li> Bought this on recommendation of ortho when son first got his braces.  He had it less than a week when he dropped it, breaking one tip, (but worse) cracking the bottom of the plastic reservoir.  Promoted on Waterpik website as great for kids, but I don&#x27;t think so.  $54 and broken within one week.</li>
            <li> OK but doesn&#x27;t really have a lot of force.  Will do for short trips.  Also a bit messy, water dripples out when in use, and the reservoir is fairly small, so takes a refill or two for a thorough cleansing</li>
            <li> Pressure is not adjustable enough and it does not hold enough water. OK but returned for a WP100 whick works great!</li>
            <li> excellent product and service</li>
            <li> I like the job it does just don&#x27;t like the water running back out of my mouth onto ,my hands and the water pic</li>
            <li> The product is everything that I was looking for. Yours truly has always been a &amp;#34;toothpick&amp;#34; person. This waterpik completely surpasses my old technique of clearing food particles from between my teeth. The water spray is so much more comfortable and efficient.</li>
            <li> This Waterpik model is great and does the job.  OMG...I thought I was getting my mouth clean with my electric toothbrush...guess not!  I&#x27;m amazed what is flushed out by this product.  I purchased another Waterpik for my husband for Christmas and thought it was the same exact model.  It was not...his does not have the &amp;#34;low and high&amp;#34; speed option.  I like this model better.  If you use it on high speed - it seems to run out of water faster than what I would like but I guess I could go a bit faster huh?  Holds a charge for 2-3 uses before I have to charge it again.  Great price and value for the money.</li>
            <li> I bought this along with the plug in unit for a gift - I have had such great success with mine...pay it forward *smile*</li>
            <li> This definitely doesn&#x27;t work for me.  The water reservoir is waaaay too small.  On high, the water runs out in 20 seconds.  I have to refill it three times to get through a good cleaning.  For Tavel, it works but definitely not for daily use.</li>
            <li> Had this for a month, after which it simply wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge. It was so lousy I didn&#x27;t even bother calling on the warranty to get a new one. Instead I got the Panasonic EW1211, which is a far superior device. That comes with an induction charger stand, so no issues of corrosion and fiddly plugs, plus there is an LED indicator to show when it is charging. The modelling is far better and it makes less noise. The improvements are so obvious and make so much sense you have to wonder what Waterpik&#x27;s product development team are doing. Obviously nothing, judging by the constant complaints of charging problems.</li>
            <li> This product was designed for a person like me. I have trouble taking the time to floss but with the water pic I grab after brushing and rinse my mouth with it. I put some mouth wash in and mix with warm water and I get multi relief. It does not do as well as string flossing but it will keep your gums and the pockets around them clean. So....fresh breath, clean teeth and happy gums. Good news.</li>
            <li> This is even better than I thought it would be.. The price was good and the service was great.  I would recommend this to anybody..</li>
            <li> Great product, my teeth and gums feel healthier. I should of purchased this earlier ! For the people that say it runs out of water to quick and you have to refill... That means the product is working hard.</li>
            <li> This is the best battery operated product that Waterpik has come up with but I wish they would work on one that is less bulky.  My mother is in her 80&#x27;s and it is hard to hold onto while using - even for me.  The plug in one is great but the cord from the base to pik is so short you have to be a contortionist to get it to your mouth.  The makers obviously don&#x27;t use their own product!</li>
            <li> I only had the 1st one for a year when suddenly it wouldnt charge thus work anymore. Thinking it was a fluke I bought another within 6 months that one also wouldn&#x27;t charge/work. Don&#x27;t waste your money, get another brand of water pick. I never write reviews but I certainly thought it was important to do so this time. Two thumbs DOWN!</li>
            <li> I almost didn&#x27;t buy this product because the first reviews were not good at all.  However, I read all the reviews and purchased anyway, glad I did!  None of the problems experienced by the other buyers have even been an issue.  I have only charged the battery once since I bought the product(a month ago)and it is working wonderfully.</li>
            <li> It was recommended that I use a waterpick along with my toothbrush so I could reduce plaque buildup.  I will know more on my next dental checkup and cleaning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed, it&#x27;s not much smaller than a regular Warepick, the water pressure is also lower and the water container is not large enough</li>
            <li> Very good, easy to use and very, but very practical! The only down side is that if you don&#x27;t keep the waterpik charge all the time, it doesn&#x27;t hold the charge very long. So, if you are going for a few days, bring the charger!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Rating is guesswork on my part since I have not actually used the Waterpik Waterflosser Cordless Plus.  But I have not had any complaints from its owner.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom actually and she absolutely loves it.  So I would recommend it - buy without hesitation.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  Unfortunately not on long-lasting product.  We have well water and I feel that has an effect on the longevity. But overall it is great for flossing your teeth.  Have been told by hygienist that my mouth is in great shape!</li>
            <li> Work great, holds charge over a week, teeth feel as clean as after visiting the dentist, and a lot cheaper</li>
            <li> Too small for home use. Too big for taking in short trips. I bought it for my girl-friend and she&#x27;s very happy. But as for me if you want to use waterflosser at home it&#x27;s better to buy bigger item. And if you&#x27;re going out from home occasionally (not regularly) it&#x27;s better to use a strings.</li>
            <li> I expected a compact hand held container with a laser thin stream of water, but instead its like holding a big bottle of mouth wash, while water rapidly fills your mouth and spills out down your chin....but my teeth look whiter!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and transport! Surprisingly good power and pressure for such a small device. Still takes up some countertop space but is easy enough to tuck in a drawer.</li>
            <li> does the job as expected, I would recommend this to anyone who wants to get a deeper clean and healthy teeth</li>
            <li> The item is spoilt. I can&#x27;t charge it at all. Water jet was ok. But I only get to tried it for a while before the battery runs out</li>
            <li> This Waterpik works very well so far. The real test of these things is how long do they Last. I&#x27;ve used many, mostly the older type, and None have made it for a year yet. At least the company is willing to replace the units that die young. One reviewer said they don&#x27;t last because the parts don&#x27;t fit tight enough and water entering the interior ruins them prematurely. He named replacement parts that will fit and extend the life of this useful appliance. These can be purchased at Radio Shack, and he gave the part numbers, 273-1742 and 273-1743. If I can get a Waterpik to last for over a year I&#x27;ll give it a higher rating because they do get a lot of food out of my teeth.</li>
            <li> During the first month it worked perfect, but after that I must have charging constantly. I bought a other Waterpik to solve this problem.</li>
            <li> i love this product.  my teeth never felt so clean even after regular flossing.  the only thing i can say negative is that it is not as powerful as the one you hook up to your faucet, but the attachments for this clean the gumline better.</li>
            <li> I like it because it doesn&#x27;t take up too much space.  You might have to fill it twice, but a minor inconvenience.  Despite being rechargeable, It works just as well as my old hard wired apparatus that took up too much space.</li>
            <li> Fabulous Waterpik.  I have tried several and this one is the best.  You will get a great check up form your dentist if you use this one.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and does a fantastic job.  Appreciate the different brushes and the new design for filling the tank as well as the new charging method.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> unit has appropriate power and a wonderful battery life. does a great job and has multiple tips for different uses.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic and so userfrendly.&lt;br /&gt;It flosses teeth and gums&lt;br /&gt;I feel that my teeth and gums are clean</li>
            <li> Like many others, I thought this would replace my countertop unit, which finally gave out after 20 years.  Bt no, sorry, it just doesn&#x27;t cut it.  The water pressure is just not there, and even when the reservoir is full, it doesn&#x27;t clean my teeth the way my old one did.  And the reservoir is a joke.  I had to fill it 4 times to completely clean my teeth . . . and that&#x27;s just too much of a pain. Finally, like many before me, I find that the tips just rotate all by themselves.  I&#x27;m ordering another countertop unit.</li>
            <li> When the Olympic trainers come looking for me, I&#x27;ll be in my bathroom, practicing not spraying my mirror, clothing or walls with my water pik. The first time I used it, I hit my significant other in the face. (That was awkward.) The second time I used it, I managed to make it HALFWAY THROUGH my top teeth before I laughed at something and water went everywhere. It&#x27;s now been weeks and I&#x27;m a darn pro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It says it works better than floss. Here&#x27;s a secret no one will tell you: It may very well work better than floss, but... you&#x27;ll totally miss the search and kill mission of your floss and your gums, coming together to find the enemy in one, swift motion. You may keep flossing because you don&#x27;t WANT to stop flossing. No one owns you. You do what you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s a weapon. Your child wants to come into the bathroom and you&#x27;re enjoying 45 seconds of peace and quiet? All you have to say is, &amp;#34;The water pik is aimed at the door. I have about 11 seconds of cool, watery burst. Check yourself.&amp;#34; They&#x27;ll run! It works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The charger charges it. (That seems redundant. Let me explain: The charger actually does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.) In most electronics, this is a novel concept. (A bit like finding that elusive white squirrel in the backyard that you saw last week and now you can&#x27;t find, but you&#x27;re going to find it. BY GOD YOU&#x27;RE GOING TO FIND IT.) The charger works for about 2 weeks. Enough said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It holds water without leaking. See? Novel. It works like it&#x27;s supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- There are two levels: Deadly and Deadlier.  The first level is all like, &amp;#34;I&#x27;m going to spray the *#$&amp; out of your teeth.&amp;#34; The second level is like, &amp;#34;I&#x27;m going to spray the*#$&amp; out of your teeth and then invite you over for pie.&amp;#34; As you can imagine, that&#x27;s awkward. So, I use the first level. No one wants to eat pie after they cleaned their teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Be prepared to look like an idiot. you have to close your mouth. It&#x27;ll fill up your mouth quite quickly, so you need to remember to spit often. (I swear on my Catholic upbringing, I do not mean this the way you think I mean this.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- You&#x27;ll miss the minty-fresh taste of your floss&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, you should just buy it.. you have to close your mouth.

            <li> I like the product and find I use it more often than the old corded style because I can take it into the shower.  I would have given it four stars except I find the fact that there is no docking station and I have to plug it in for charging and then unplug it to use it a real pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have bought two more if it had the docking station.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it is, I will wait for the next model and hope it has a docking station.</li>
            <li> Bought to have in my suitcase for when I travel. Excellent and reliable no matter where I am. Would purchase again</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll recommend it to have to anyone that is traveling a lot&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s good to keep your smile and breath in check&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kiddy Hamman</li>
            <li> I have owned 2 of these.  The quality is abysmal.  Switches have failed on both.  On the more recent one, the two speeds became one speed within weeks.  Then the on-off switch eventually became erratic and is now non-functional.  I refuse to buy another, although I need something like it according to my periodontist, because I refuse to reward a company for producing such an unreliable product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product in the Fall of 2011. After a couple of months&#x27; usage, the connection between the unit and the tip began to leak and finally failed. Since the unit was under warranty, Waterpik replaced it immediately. The replacement unit did not work at all. The unit would not charge right from the start. I used my charger from the previous unit; and, that didn&#x27;t work either. I&#x27;m discarding the new unit and will not bother to replace it. For me, it&#x27;s a thorough flossing, brushing and peroxide rinse.</li>
            <li> I loved this when it worked. Portable and cordless, it was quite convenient and I felt it did a great job, based on the junk that it flushed from my mouth after I had already brushed with my Phillips Sonicare. Unfortunately all the battery complaints are true. After ten months it won&#x27;t hold a charge at all. I agree with a previous reviewer that Waterpik should fix this problem rather than me buying something at Radio Shack to make it better. I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> For the past yr. my dentist encouraged me to purchase a Waterpik.  Last month I purchased the Cordless Plus and am very pleased. I used the Waterpik for 3 wks and went to my scheduled dentist appointment. It was the best appointment I had in yrs.  The appointment took less than 15 minutes.  My dentist was amazed at how little plaque build up she had to scrape away.</li>
            <li> I did buy two of these items within the last year ... the first one lasted for 6 months and the second one only three months.&lt;br /&gt;Both of them suffer from the same problem, no more charging.</li>
            <li> This is a great item since I never floss, it&#x27;s also very easy to use. I just wish the charge would last longer. I use the water pik twice a day and charge it twice a week.</li>
            <li> Although the product worked to my satisfaction, my cordless Waterpik waterflosser lasted less than two years before it would no longer take a charge.  I&#x27;m switching to the Panasonic which appears to be more portable and it uses batteries so that you don&#x27;t have to throw away a mechanically sound device because you can&#x27;t put a new battery in it.  If you do buy a Waterpik, however, I do not recommend some of their attachments (e.g., tongue scrapper, and deep pocket nozzle), as I found them to be useless.</li>
            <li> This works great. Charge last long and does a great cleaning job on my teeth. It holds enough water to clean a row of teeth real quick. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this waterpik two months ago. I can honestly say this is a convenient product but not very effective. The pressure coming out of it is not what it needs to be to clean your teeth and the amount of water it holds runs out quickly. I ended up returning it and got back charged over $11! which really put me off about ordering from any merchant on Amazon that will charge you to return it. I went to the Walmart site, found the Waterpik 360 for the same price as Amazon, no shipping or return shipping and bought it there. This product is the one to buy since it can hold way more water and has the pressure you will need to get your teeth cleaned. I can say, I will search Walmart.com as well as Amazon since I can return items for free if they do not meet my expectations. By the way, no matter what waterpik products you buy you will be leaning over the sink to make sure the water does not get all over you.</li>
            <li> I was excited to purchase this water pick.  Once out of the package i charged it and filled with filtered water.  On the high setting it uses all the water in about 10 seconds max.  On low setting i might make it 20 seconds without having to fill it again.  I will stick with flossing and chalk this up to a bad purchase.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how much this water flosser is essential to my life. This view was changed as soon as I tried it for the first time. Now that I can&#x27;t live without it, the battery died!! FML</li>
            <li> I bought this product approximately one year ago.  At month four I began to have trouble charging. This product just would not hold a charge for more than one use. The trouble just kept getting worse until the final death last week. This waterpik will no longer re-charge.  Had to chuck it into the trash.  I am very displeased.</li>
            <li> Great little device. Definitely not as effective as the benchtop, mains power model, but it does the job, and I travel a lot. However, something sold as a travel item should surely come with a travel case.</li>
            <li> Used it for only a week and will no longer work.  Read the reviews about buying new adapter @ Radio Shack, but really think it should work longer than 5 days.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Waterpik Waterflosser for two weeks now.  My teeth feel cleaner and I know that it gets things that my electric tooth brush misses.  My only con for this product is that it has no lights to tell you when it is fully charged.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.  I bought Model 450 for travel.  After just six or seven uses, it will no longer charge. Of course, time has passed so I no longer have the packaging.  What a rip-off.  DO NOT buy this product.</li>
            <li> Obviously, the wired water pic is still the best, but the cordless is an adequate substitute for those times when we are traveling and have no access to the traditional product.  At such times it&#x27;s either the cordless water pic or nothing.</li>
            <li> Compact takes little space on sink&lt;br /&gt;works well on teeth and gums&lt;br /&gt;I would purchase again, happy with looks, price and function.</li>
            <li> I have used the Waterpik Ultra for some time and I am very happy with it.  I bought the Cordless Plus to use when I travel. Unfortunately, even though I only use the Ultra at about 60% of the full power setting I found the Cordless Plus did not provide equal power even at its highest setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend the Cordless Plus unless you are sure you do not need a very strong jet of water - if, for example, you already have the Ultra and find that you use it with the power dial set to the halfway mark or below.</li>
            <li> 1. It is so loud it will wake anyone sleeping. Coffee grinder loud!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The reservoir is so small it runs out in 10 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The tip is so mobile (rotates all over the place), you can&#x27;t control it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. It is poorly designed, too large, and difficult to hold&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Poor battery life, long charge time, no charge indicator. After two uses I needed to recharge! (yes I let it charge up initially for 16 hours!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Expensive, Poor Value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. Poor Reservoir Capacity&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8. Terrible portability, large/inefficient size, ungainly ergonomics&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9. Weak water stream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10. Very bad. Main problem is the tip won&#x27;t stay fixed, it keeps rotating, so it sprays water everywhere but your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;11. The reservoir is so small that it empties before you are ready to stop using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HORRIBLE PRODUCT. HATE IT!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with it, no problems so far. The two pressure options are good, and it indeed clean the teeth.</li>
            <li> It was a matter of survival after oral surgery. I took this to Italy with me. Then it refused to recharge anymore. I learned that this is just what they do. I had to spend a hundred bucks to buy one in Italy that has a foreign plug on it and must be used with an international adapter, here in the USA. I feel there is some deception because of this known flaw in the product. The manufacturer should be ashamed.</li>
            <li> Works well,really pleased with this product.I understand that there is one with a larger reservoir, however the refill only takes a few seconds on this one.The size is convenient.I would purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist recommended this product. I&#x27;ve found it to be easy to use. I fill it with warm tap water. It came with four tips (3 types). I have to fill the bottle twice to use all three types. Good price and reliable Amazon delivery.</li>
            <li> It really works. I use it every day and it does make my teeth cleaner than use toothbrush alone. The battery lasts for a week, which is a sound performance.</li>
            <li> I have very limited counter and cabinet space in my bathroom, so I haven&#x27;t had a Waterpik in ages. My dentist suggested I get one because of some weird spacing in my teeth. I was happy to find this gadget so that I wouldn&#x27;t have to have massive clutter in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The water reservoir *is* small. On the low setting, it runs out of water after about 45 seconds. On the high setting, I&#x27;d say it runs out of water after about 35 seconds. The great thing about that is, it&#x27;s really easy to fill the reservoir back up and keep going. Much like my sonic toothbrush thingie that has a timer on it, I just consider the empty reservoir to be my timer. Fill it up, use it on one side until it runs out, fill it back up, use it on the other side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I wish this had is a cover for the tip.</li>
            <li> Quick and easy to use and does a great job.  Many different tips to choose from. Small enough to leave on the counter top.</li>
            <li> I own the Ultra model which is the corded model.  I became so addicted to my waterpik, that I bought the cordless one for travel since I work out of town during the week.  I would say that the cordless works well, but if you can afford the counter space and have an outlet, invest in the Ultra model.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my dentist.  I got the model with a water reservoir in the handle.  The small charging station and handle reservoir make this so handy for small spaces and travel.</li>
            <li> I have bought two Waterflosser Cordless PLUS Waterpik because dental cleaning system I like and wanted him not for my international travel. However, the first of these stopped working after 6 months and bought the second lasted only three months and stopped working. Check in reimbursement policies and points to the product and it can not return. Terrible product and terrible service. Would not recommend to anyone. And but I have returned with another product despite Waterpik: Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser on, it stopped worked some purchased one year nor refunds.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying this purchase.  After only 2 1/2 weeks of use, I went to Dentist for cleaning and she could tell the difference in my gums.  It works.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this, it&#x27;s a must have!</li>
            <li> I  love  the  portability</li>
            <li> I would rather go without brushing my teeth than not flossing.  Wish I knew about this wonderful item years ago.  My hygienist recommended it and I am forever grateful to her.  I now get good reviews when I go for my six-month dental checkup...</li>
            <li> This is my second waterpik, but like the first one, battery can&#x27;t be charged even within 1 year, even I charge for 24 hours, will not operate after one time use, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am not pleased with this product.  The battery does not hold a charge for more than two days.  This means the power runs low and the strength of the water is weak.  The nozzle swivels and is hard to keep in place. I  have to fill the resevoir at least twice to do my whole mouth.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that I can now take my Waterpik with me while traveling.  It is compact yet efficient.</li>
            <li> This review is not for the product itself - because the product I received was *used*. A used oral care product that was sold as new is criminal in my mind. If it wasn&#x27;t for the fact that parts were missing, which prompted me to look carefully at the tip that was there, I might have used some stranger&#x27;s toothbrush. That&#x27;s pretty horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon is usually awesome, but this is almost unforgivable..</li>
            <li> Works Perfect, just the right amount of water per application. And the batteries last a week before recharging. Better than Flossing</li>
            <li> My dentist suggesting me use this Waterpik Waterflosser with warm water and peroxide.  I use it about 2-3 times a week.  It seems to work well.</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THIS ONE SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE IT IS CORDLESS. I CHARGED IT FOR A FULL 24 HRS PRIOR TO 1ST USE AS INSTRUCTED, BUT FOUND IT TO BE GROSSLY UNDERPOWERED IN COMPARISON TO THE TRADITIONAL PLUG IN VERSION THSAT&#x27;S BEEN AROUND FOR YEARS. EVEN PLUGGING IT IN DURING USE DID NOTHING TO IMPROVE ITS&#x27; PERFORMANCE. THIS WAS A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY!!!!</li>
            <li> compact, powerful and customizable.  I love it.  It takes up no space in the bathroom, and it has a variety of useful tips.</li>
            <li> The problem with this Waterpik is that it does not have enough power when set on high.&lt;br /&gt;It is also awkward to use. There is not enough water capacity.&lt;br /&gt;If you want it for travel it would do for light flossing.&lt;br /&gt;For home get Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser. It takes more room but it is far better.</li>
            <li> This flosser gets the area between my teeth amazingly clean.  I have several crowns, bridges and implants, made necessary because all my life I&#x27;ve had an auto-immune disease that prevents me from producing a normal level of saliva.  That is necessary to enable enzymes to suppress the bacteria that cause dental caries.  My gums are in better shape after only ten days of use than they have been in many years.  the color has improved greatly, and it appears that my gums are starting to regrow</li>
            <li> I bought this model as it was cordless would actually be used (as opposed to the static wall plug types which invariably end up back in the box)&lt;br /&gt;This unit is powerful, portable, sits right next to the basin and we all use it daily&lt;br /&gt;10 out of 10</li>
            <li> Tongue cleaner tip not included as represented in what comes with device needs to be updated for buyers as incorrect listing.</li>
            <li> I will not buy this product again. The charging of the unit was &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; from the start. It just would not hold charge.</li>
            <li> THE BATTERY LIFE BECAME UNACCEPTABLE IN SIX MONTHS. I WROTE THE MANUFACTURER AND THEIR CURT REPLY WAS TO LEAVE IT PLUGGED IN FULL TIME. NOT WHAT I THINK IS THE PURPOSE OF A BATTERY OPERATED DEVICE. NOW AFTER A YEAR I FIND THAT A 24 HOUR CHARGE IS INSUFFICIENT FOR EVEN ONE GOOD USE. LOOK FOR AN ALTERNATE PRODUCT. POOR DESIGN AND UNCARING POST PURCHASE CUSTOMER SERVICE.</li>
            <li> The Waterpik is a vital part of my daily dental hygiene. It makes my mouth feel fresh and clean even after brushing. The only downside is that there are no light indications to alert you of battery life. The Waterpik just dies out when it needs to be recharged with no warning.</li>
            <li> Got this to help with keeping braces clean. Does a nice job. Has choice of atrachments to use. Charged it the day I got it and haven&#x27;t needed to recharge it yet 2 weeks later.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend bought this for us. If you are looking for a pic this is perfect. It has 2 settings (use the lighter one if you are new to water piks!!!) and a large container for water. You can fill it on its side to fit even more in. Its cordless so you can use it in the shower if you are really messy. You can mix listerine and water in there for a more intense cleaning</li>
            <li> I like the fact that this is rechargeable&lt;br /&gt;The Water Pik comes with various type wands. My dental hygienist recommended using the Water Pik for an even better daily clean &amp;  flossing. Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Waterpik products for decades. My old plug-in-the-wall model bit the dust (the rubber seals in the pump eventually wore out) after maybe 12-15 years and i purchased this rechargeable hand-held. Works fine but kinda bulky and inconvenient when you have to tip it to reach back in the mouth, at which point the water level will sometimes fall below the intake and it will spin its wheels, so to speak. Also, the water coming out of your mouth drips all over the hand-held part so you spend a lot of time cleaning up after using it!</li>
            <li> Have a stationary model I use everyday. This is a &amp;#34;travel&amp;#34; version. Not powerful enough to use on daily basis.</li>
            <li> I hate this thing. Bought it for my wife after our 1970&#x27;s model Waterpik finally died. She thought this would be a good idea, but it isn&#x27;t IMO.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s bulky, hard to control and aim, just as noisy as the old ones were and does not hold enough water. Plus, they only come with one of each type of flossing head, so if two or more people are using it, they have to share the same tip!!!</li>
            <li> I have an implant and it is the best thing for cleaning under it. Works GREAT!</li>
            <li> AS stated above the charger stopped working after the first charge, works only on 110 V and not dual voltage</li>
            <li> Well, I sure don&#x27;t get the bad reviews of this great dental hygiene booster.  Maybe some have had quality control issues?  My case has been a very, very happy one, although I&#x27;m just a few days into it...but I WILL update if disappointment comes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this portable job after researching the counter top edition and seeing that this one performs the same task, with the same assurances of better oral health, but doesn&#x27;t take up counter space (of which I have none) and is just a lot less to fuss with in terms of cleaning, worrying about hose length, and generally just being a lot more bulk to deal with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the first Waterpik I&#x27;ve ever tried, and I got it because I&#x27;m lazy with flossing and I shouldn&#x27;t be, so I was looking for a better, quicker way to accomplish some good oral hygiene -- basically a cheat for being a lousy flosser....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of the box, it looks and feels like the kind of thing a dentist would use -- solid, well-built, easy to operate, and came with everything needed.  It does require an initial 24 hour charge.  But, impressive to look at, so that seemed a good sign.  All the parts clicked and fit perfectly, and it comes with four &amp;#34;nozzles&amp;#34; or attachments, just like advertised in the photos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m only a few days into using it, so, as a say, I&#x27;ll update if things go sideways, but, my first experience is that I really love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did watch some vids on YT to get a sense of how to use it, and it&#x27;s easy once you get the hang of it.  Just put it in your mouth, place it where you want to start cleaning -- close your mouth somewhat to keep in the spray (very important ahaha, as I found out when I forgot to do that), then hit the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; button, and it does the job, shooting a firm stream of water.  As the instructions say, just move along the gum line at a 90 degree kind of angle, and yes indeed, it does a GREAT job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that, because the on/off switch is right in my hand, it&#x27;s easy to do a section at a time, turning it off in between (excuse the gross out) to, ahem, spit.  I can do it in four neat sections, stopping to rid the accumulated water, a section at a time.  The instructions say to just let the water run out of your mouth, but that is a bit more messy, and I wasn&#x27;t a fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does work QUICKLY so it&#x27;s not like my electric toothbrush where you have time to kind of focus on each tooth, since this one has a limited reservoir, and it runs out pretty fast, plus your mouth fills up with water might fast too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, that actually makes it a fast job -- as they say in the instructions, about a minute and a half and you&#x27;re done, working top and bottom, and I did both the &amp;#34;outer&amp;#34; side and &amp;#34;inner&amp;#34; side of my teeth, if that makes sense....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mouth was definitely super clean.  I opted for warm water and then poured some mouthwash in there -- worked terrific and my mouth felt like I&#x27;d just come from the hygienist.  NO mouth pain at all, but then again I&#x27;m doing as they suggest, starting at low, then eventually going to the high setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, yup, a happy camper here!  It&#x27;s quick, painless, effective and adds just a few minutes to the oral health routine, for (according to all the research I could find on it) the huge benefit of far superior oral hygiene, for us lazy flossers out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend!!!sy to do a section at a time, turning it off in between (excuse the gross out) to, ahem, spit.

            <li> quality product... better than the big bulky one they sell with a cord... use this it&#x27;s easy and takes up a quarter of the room</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even think about it. It&#x27;s very bulky. Pressure nothing like tank model.  High/low Switch broke after one month.  Basically a piece of junk.</li>
            <li> My teeth and I love this waterflosser.  It&#x27;s the 3rd one I&#x27;ve bought because the battery doesn&#x27;t hold up much more than a year or so,  but it&#x27;s not all that expensive and does a really good job.  The reservoir is bigger on this one which I also like.</li>
            <li> Personally, I would like a little more pressure.  I still have to floss, but this does clear away the debris.</li>
            <li> It is ok for casual use because the water tank is too small. For daily use, the water capacity is too small</li>
            <li> Sure wish the price of these would stop going up. We bought everyone in our family one for Christmas this past year. Everyone just loves it. No more flossing Yeah!!!</li>
            <li> After ordering this from a 3rd party vendor through Amazon.com, I see in the booklet warnings that if a person takes antibiotics before dental procedures (common for those with artificial joints), you should check with your dentist. I checked with my doctor, and was told not to use it. Now I&#x27;m having problems getting a return authorization.</li>
            <li> I messed up and bought one for each person in our family.  These are very large and very hard to hold onto and awkward  use. We do not like them. A huge waste of money.</li>
            <li> it is a good product overall. but as time past, the electric does not last as long as before. I have to charge it like every week and I only use it once daily....</li>
            <li> Great for cleaning teeth in shower.  Water reservoir lasts just long enough to clean teeth thoroughly.  I charged it once when I bought it, and it&#x27;s been multiple weeks, and I still haven&#x27;t charged it again yet.  great battery life!</li>
            <li> I wore my last one out and will do the same with this one</li>
            <li> I love waterpiks and use it daily.  It is amazing what flossing misses or can&#x27;t get too.  My only complaint is that the plug in on the device does get water into it and I can see corrosion occurring and it is hard to clean it out.  My last one of the same design ended up no longer charging because of this.  I try and dry it out the best I can after each use but still think it might have some future problems.</li>
            <li> Great water flosser. It takes some used to getting used to as far as timing. Once you learn how to use it it will only take one fill, maybe two. I used it while I had baces and it was a fantastic tool to have.</li>
            <li> The product works great, and the battery lasts a long time.  It is a good size for travel, but the way the water reservoir is designed it makes it a challenge to keep the flow steady as you move the tip around your teeth.  You have to hold it at a certain angle when the water level drops.  That&#x27;s the only (minor) issue I have with it.  Good overall product.</li>
            <li> I found the product easy to use, that it works well with warm water, and that my dentist says my gums have never looked better! I started using the product about 5 years ago when recommended to me after having gum surgery and have seen fantastic results since I began using it!!. Thank-you Waterpick!!</li>
            <li> I have had three of these and the battery always craps out. My meticulous friend bought one and the same thing happened. I really like the way it is designed but the life is just too flawed. I hop they fix it one day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE am hopefol that the new charger cord will solve the problem but am abs horrified that i may have discarded the old ones for no reason. One of the reviewers commented that it appears te crd should not be used when wet so i will deff try that -- makes sense!</li>
            <li> I have owned this cordless product and also Water Pik&#x27;s Ultimate Water Flosser.  There are advantages and disadvantages to each.  The water conduit/hose on the countertop model is a hassle.  It is short and water will run out of it onto the counter after you finish using it.  The cordless model is easier to handle. However, the water pressure is not as strong as the countertop model.  Also, because of the design of the water tank, it is impossible to empty the tank completely, and it is also not possible to scrub the inside of the water tank, which raises concerns in my mind about cleanliness or contamination.</li>
            <li> I love this water flosser! I only gave 4 stars because the battery life will not last for few days, I am so afraid that I&#x27;ll use all the power. It says on the manual that you can&#x27;t consume all the charge it may affect the performance of the flosser&#x27;s battery in the future. Another thing, you have to keep on refilling the tank, I guess that factor comes in for the fact of having a cordless. All in all it does the job!</li>
            <li> This is smaller, more portable and easier to use than my oral B. Also gives a much better clean and mouth feels great.However I have had to return two of these items both for the same reason. After a few days of working beautifully the battery on both failed to charge. After a few seconds the machine would stop working. Seeing that this happened twice I thought it might be something to do with the fact that I was using an adapter plug to use in Australia. Not so apparently, I asked a friend who is an electrical engineer to check it out - his verdict is that there must be a fault with the device. Both machines have been returned to Amazon and I have, very reluctantly, ordered an Oral B Oxyjet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little akward holding the whole unit at first, but the pivoting head allows you to hold it however it is comfortable for you.  It is very easy to use and the low pressure has been strong enough for me so far.  I haven&#x27;t switched  it to high yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just bought one for my father for Christmas.  I hope that he likes it as much as I do!</li>
            <li> My husband and I have been using this now for about a month and we are okay with it. The power of the water is not great and I always doubt it is doing as good a job as regular dental floss, so often I just use both to be sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The amount of water held is a little skimpy but this I can deal with by refilling the tank. I like that it is cordless and that makes it really easy to share since we have separate sinks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price was right and for dental implants this was recommended by the dentist so I hope it is doing the job!</li>
            <li> I bought this item from UK and received it from America!  I live in Spain, the electric voltage is wrong and I can&#x27;t buy a transformer, so I am not able to use it. Very disappointed!!  The voltage we have in Spain is 220 v, America is 110 v. So this item cannot be used!</li>
            <li> I like the ease of the cordless waterpik.  The thing&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like, compared to the non-mobile kind I used&lt;br /&gt;growing up, is that the holding tank for the water seems&lt;br /&gt;to run out much to quickly.  I find myself filling it up a&lt;br /&gt;second time to get the amount of cleaning I want done.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews that have the same problem as I do with the charging I will try cleaning the contacts and see if I can maintain a charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I opened the unit thinking I would need to replace the batteries and found a ton of black mold inside. YUK!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why is the unit not sealed against water seepage? Gross!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I rinsed out the inside with hot water and used a brush to get the mold out of all the nooks and crannies. Terrible product design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also noticed moild growing where the water tank enters the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it worked it worked well, but the water holder also tends to build up mold inside. You really have to make an effort to get in there with a brush and some bleach to clean it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way my dentist told me to add a few drops of bleach to the water to really be effective in healing your gums. My gums are great now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep using this unit if I can get it to maintain a charge. If not I&#x27;ll switch to another brand.</li>
            <li> Compaired to the large models it quit even though its next to your ear. I rated this 5 comparing it to the larger ones that I had that the tubing always breaks and is much loader. My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t have a light indicating if it is charging and auttomatically shuts off when fully charged as most other units that are rechargible do. Others say they had trouble with the connection corroding they should have a door on it or have a plug plugging the area so water doesn&#x27;t get into the connection area. I love it as its much more coveenent than the larger ones.</li>
            <li> This waterflosser is fantastic! The flow of water is quite strong, the portability of it allows me to use it in a small bathroom where I have no room for our older Waterpik flosser. Also, because this has no \\&quot;hose\\&quot; connecting the tank to the sprayer, no liquid gets left in the hose and turns into black gunk that gets squirted into your mouth the next time you use it (YUCK!). Sometimes I take more time squirting, so I have to refill the reservoir, but that takes approximately 5 seconds to do. And if the reservoir were any bigger, I think the unit would be too cumbersome to handle. Finally,be sure to charge it for a full 24 hours before using, then keep it plugged in except for when you&#x27;re using it, this way it keeps a charge beautifully. I use my flosser one or two times a day, and I have no trouble with it being fully charged every time. I love this thing!&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: As others have noticed, this unit starts having problems with staying charged. It is not that the battery does not hold the charge, but that the cord does not fit snugly into the unit so it does not charge the battery. I have found that jamming a very narrow piece of plastic (or other non-metal item) the thickness of a credit card into a tiny gap above the cord where it is plugged into the unit will create the contact necessary for the battery to receive the charge. Once I figured this out, my unit went back to full power. No need to purchase anything additional! (And don&#x27;t forget to disconnect the unit from the cord when in use.)</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work upside down can&#x27;t do back of the teeth.  The plug in unit was better than this cordless one.</li>
            <li> Keeps my teeth incredibly clean and my gums healthy. Be careful with the maximum pressure setting, don&#x27;t get it too close to your gums. Start off slowly and learn your own limit and tolerance level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I had braces, this product was a life saver because flossing is such a complicated task. This brush gave me excellent oral health and it was confirmed by my orthodontist and hygienist.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no neat, non-messy way to use this product, as it almost has to be standing straight up to use; any tilt to allow you head and mouth to pour over into the sink, and the thing gets clogged and the water starts leaking and dribbling onto your hands.  Also, the &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; setting is not really that powerful compared to another model (Gurin Hydroflosser) I used.  It&#x27;s also a bit bulky.  And the reservoir can&#x27;t be removed and filled because the hole on the bottom allows the water to come out.  Overall, it&#x27;s not a very convenient product.</li>
            <li> I had the bigger version of this product and I was very happy with it. But I moved and couldn&#x27;t bring it with me, so decided to order the smaller one and it turned to be a failure.&lt;br /&gt;I used it 10 times max, and even after charging it during the whole night, next morning it doesn&#x27;t work properly, rush of water is very weak, so there is no point of using it at all. Definitely regret the purchase</li>
            <li> This unit worked ok but after 5 months it now fails to hold a charge. Reading other reviews, this seems to be a very common problem. Very disappointed in the quality level. Definitely won&#x27;t be purchasing any Waterpik products in the future.</li>
            <li> Completely satisfied with this product and the service provided. Free shipping and prompt delivery was a pleasant experience. Easy to follow instructions and everything as described and at a good price, what&#x27;s not to like.</li>
            <li> This is a great water flosser and easy to travel with. I find that many other water piks are bulky and messy, but this one is easy to maneuver and actually fits in my medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> The low pressure setting is gentler than others I have used which is nice for people with sensitive gums.  The product works well but after a few months the pressure went down to the point where it couldn&#x27;t be used.  The first one also had a leaking water reservoir which meant emptying it after each use (which isn&#x27;t a big deal and is probably a good idea anyways).  The unit comes with multiple heads. I&#x27;ve purchased another one with hopes that it will last longer.</li>
            <li> People complaining that this thing isn&#x27;t quite powerful enough, I&#x27;m not sure what they&#x27;re using this for!  I used it on the low setting and it found plaque that I&#x27;ve had for years.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this model.  I don&#x27;t find it to be bulky at all.  My dentist always complains that I don&#x27;t floss enough but I&#x27;m sure after using this I&#x27;ll get better reviews!</li>
            <li> I love this product my dentist suggested that I get it and have been using it ever since. After using my waterpik the first couple of times I still flossed just to see how effective it was and it left little to nothing left behind. I haven&#x27;t had any problems out of the battery life but would love to know how much power is remaining so I won&#x27;t keep it on the charger. I have had this product for almost a year now and still works like it I first brought it. This waterpik only has two settings which is high and low and high is just a little too much for my gums but the low level works perfect for me. Highly recommend this product for people who have braces.</li>
            <li> Works great! I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This water flosser works pretty well, better than the string stuff. It gets stuff stuck in Your teeth out. I use it after brushing and still see bits of food come out of my teeth. It could be a little more powerful. It is nice that it&#x27;s more portable than the regular waterpic. I actually will give it 3.5 stars.</li>
            <li> MUCH EASIER TO USE THEN COUNTERTOP ONE AND TAKES UP NO SPACE&lt;br /&gt;JUST WISH TANK WAS A DROP BIGGER SOMETIMES I HAVE TO REFILL BUT I CAN DEAL WITH THAT</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the Waterpik Water Flosser. I like the 3 different types of tips. My favorite is still the standard tip but that could change with more experience using the other 2&lt;br /&gt;For me, a full water tank is about 35 seconds more or less. I fill it about 4 times during each session but it is so easy to fill I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> Cordless flosser gets water over everything. It is much messier than using the waterpik corded flosser.</li>
            <li> I love my waterpik. If I had to choose between my waterpik, dental floss or a toothbrush, I would choose the Waterpik. It&#x27;s gets food from between my teeth much better than a toothbrush or floss can and it removes the fuzzies on the tooth surface better than a toothbrush. Using it at a 45 degree angle against the gum line knocks that food out just below the gum line. It leaves my mouth feeling really clean. I do brush afterward (Philips Sonicare) but the Waterpik does the lion&#x27;s share of the work of cleaning my teeth. .</li>
            <li> I did not know this type of product and not its function to solve search and buy one. As an aid in cleaning! It&#x27;s amazing the power that has this water jet. A fantastic product.</li>
            <li> good value good product</li>
            <li> I think this product is great - I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t purchase one earlier.</li>
            <li> I got this since I have braces. It really helps to clean out particles of food. Also great since it messages the gums!!! Has a nice stream of water that flows out....I recharge it weekly. Wish it came with a cap for the tip of it...i ended up putting a plastic bag over it. My dentist likes that I use it.</li>
            <li> Two issues:  1.  Only 2 pressure settings.  The high is too hard; caused bleeding of gums.  I like the Waterpik that has continuous pressure setting.  2.  You need to keep the waterflosser vertical or it will not draw water to the pik.  Hard to do when you are reaching to the back of your mouth or sides on lower teeth.  Needed to readjust your hold to get water back. Annoying.  Both of these issues are not a problem with the counter mounted Waterpik.  Much better choice.</li>
            <li> This was a disappointment.  It is underpowered and while is much more convenient that the old Water Pik, it needs to be more powerful</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kinda nice, but way too big for traveling... Resulted in going back using normal floss.&lt;br /&gt;At home I would suggest the one with the permanent base station.</li>
            <li> At the begining when I first started using this product I fell in love with it. But after 5 months it stopped working! The &#x27;engine&#x27; that pumps the water doesnt work properly anymore.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned two of these and the rechargeable battery did not recharge after less than a year. Do not buy this product!</li>
            <li> Works well and easy to travel with; good value</li>
            <li> Excellent addition to daily dental care. I have bridges and dental implants and this works nicely to keep those hard-to-reach areas very clean.</li>
            <li> Great for travel and works well.</li>
            <li> very good buy. It suits me very well.</li>
            <li> If you are use to using an electric pic, this will take a while to get use to. Once you do it is fine.</li>
            <li> Had this for several years</li>
            <li> Excellent flosser.  Have had for 1 1/2 years with no problem.  (Watch, now it will self-destruct).  I make sure I dry it thoroughly after use and blow out any residual water in the recessed plug-in spot on the device.  I take this with me on trips as cannot be without it.&lt;br /&gt;If this one conks, I will replace it with the exact same one.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it! Thanks much, Comfort &amp; Warmth!</li>
            <li> Do NOT skip the regular flossing.  I have lots of dental issues - implant, bridges, caps, laminates, bad gums.  I was having problems with my implant and gums.  I added the waterpik to my routine and resolved all of my dental issues.  You must never skip flossing - ever!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a 10 minute routine once a day and it saved my teeth.  First, I brush with toothpaste and my sonicare for the full 2 minutes.  Second, I floss.  Third, I put mouthwash in my mouth (crest whitening) and brush again with the sonicare and mouthwash for a second full 2 minutes of brushing.  Forth, I waterpik with plain warm water using my cordless plus - at first I had to refill and continue, but now I only use one fill.  Last I scrape my tongue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know it is a long routine, but it saved my teeth and gums.  I didn&#x27;t have to remove my implant.  My last dental visit my dentist said my gums are the best he has ever seen them and wanted to know what I was doing.  The only thing I added was the waterpik.  He has never recommended it and said he may change his mind.  Most people stop flossing after starting the waterpik and that is a big problem and why dentists don&#x27;t recommend it more often.  About the battery, I have no issues.  I charge mine every day or several times a week.  I don&#x27;t mind keeping it on the charger.  Also - once in a while I skip on some of the above steps and as long as I don&#x27;t skip often my mouth stays healthy.</li>
            <li> Reasonable power, short battery life.  I went back to the corded models.</li>
            <li> this product is easy to use and effective.  Family members suggested I buy one....glad they did. Recommend using in shower because of water spray.</li>
            <li> I love it.  Much easier for me to handle than the corded one. I keep tape over the charge recepticle just to be safe.  Charge lasts a long time. Water resevoir holds good amount, occasionlly fill it twice. It removes particles that brushing and flossing miss. It has made my life easier.</li>
            <li> This thing was no good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s convenient and takes up little space on the counter-top in the bathroom.  Does a super job of cleaning. Great!</li>
            <li> The opening for the stream of water seems to be too large; I end up with a mouth full of water long before I finish using the waterflosser, and have to keep refilling it. So far I haven&#x27;t tried using all the different tips.</li>
            <li> Easy to fill and use. Works very well and has 2 speeds. I like being able to see in the water resservoir, easier to keep clean.</li>
            <li> I have bee using waterflosser for three weeks. Ihave receding gum line. No matter how I brush my teeth, my hygienist still said I didn&#x27;t brush my teeth well. I have bridge and a couple of crowns in my bottom teeth. One side had become very sore and uncomfortable. My dentist claimed I might lose three teeth on that side and referred me to my oral surgeon who had seen me before. The oral surgeon found nothing new. He suggested me to use Waterflosser. Miraculously, after using it four days, most of my soreness disappeared. Now, I am using the waterflosser and sonicare toothbrush. I felt I just got deep cleaning from a dentist, every time after I brushed my teeth.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised and I don&#x27;t have any of the battery life and water capacity problems brought up in some revues.</li>
            <li> This Waterpik surpassed my expectations! What a relief not to have to deal with tubes and cords! Thrilled with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Although I have a little problem with keepng the waterpik directed properly,&lt;br /&gt;it works as advertised, and I already see an improvement. I would&lt;br /&gt;recommend this product to anyone looking to improve.their flossing.</li>
            <li> This was on my buy list as soon as I get a job and when I brought and received this product and I was very happy. But when I used this product I was very disappointed. I realize I just wasted my money on something which is such a dissatisfying product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My review is not a satisfactory product.</li>
            <li> Yes, this flosser does work fine but don&#x27;t expect it to charge 7-10 months from now. We&#x27;ve had two of these and that&#x27;s about how long they each lasted. (We thought maybe the first one was a bad apple but both failed after several months). Also, for me I always felt like I was racing to floss before the tank emptied. I would have to fill it twice but always felt time pressure to beat the tank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before you buy, ask yourself if you really must have the cordless model. If not buy the Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser instead. It is corded but I love it for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;- the tank is about 3 times bigger and I now take my time flossing&lt;br /&gt;- the pressure settings are great since you can get it &#x27;just right&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;- it&#x27;s much,much easier to hold the small wand attached to base than it is to hold the gigantic cordless machine&lt;br /&gt;- it only costs a few dollars more&lt;br /&gt;The corded model takes a little more counter space but not much more. Go here for details on the most excellent flosser, because how can you live a quality life without a good flosser?:&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GLRREU/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews and bought this. The charge last long enough, I have not had it run out on me before the water runs out. Water in the storage part last long enough for me to do my whole mouth, what else do you need?</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Just think that if it had a bigger reservoir, it should be 5*!</li>
            <li> The item does a great job cleansing your teeth. Works really well when you floss first. Only draw back is that you have to get use to the product because the water comes out rather quickly &amp; can be messy.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t plan on ordering this item, but it came as a package.  I just took it on a trip to New Orleans and was very pleased with it&#x27;s performance.</li>
            <li> This waterpik is indispensable for when you are out on the road.  It doesn&#x27;t take up any counter space.  Its great!</li>
            <li> If you live long enough ever one will need one.  This one uses just a little counter space and it has two speeds so you don&#x27;t have to change tips for different pressures.</li>
            <li> The water pic is really good product is the best thing I have use thin flossing it gets the teeth clean, it does I good job!</li>
            <li> This is another one of those products that I will never do without. It is designed well, works unbelievably! Using this before you brush gets your mouth so clean....just love using it.&lt;br /&gt;  UPDATE ON PRODUCT: In July of 2014, 1 year and 5 months after purchasing this Water Pik, I had the same problem with my Water Pik that other users have had. It quits working after erosion affects the charging connection. I am disappointed that I got such little use out of mine. I will re-rate my purchase at 2 stars because this item lasted little more than 1 year.</li>
            <li> Ok...so if you&#x27;re in need of a great way to achieve the effect of flossing without dragging out the dreaded strings of wax that turn the tips of your fingers numb, this is the real deal. It works exactly as promised. What they don&#x27;t tell you, however, is that you absolutely need a small hand towel handy to catch all the dribbles as you&#x27;re learning to use this handy tool. I would also advise doing this BEFORE you dress for the day (unless you don&#x27;t mind dribbles on your clothes). And fair warning...until you are a master Waterpik user, keep that glass cleaner in full supply as the over-spray will attack your mirror like no other. All in all, it&#x27;s a small price to pay for a nice smile.</li>
            <li> I love it!  I like a cordless waterflosser.  It is easy to use and stayed charged for a long time ( 3 weeks).</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended getting a waterpik and my mouth has been happy ever since.  It&#x27;s amazing how much guck comes out of your mouth that you would never see with just brushing.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it is because the Waterflosser is cordless and does not have as much power, but this was not cleaning my teeth and gums so I returned it.</li>
            <li> It was another on time delivery, what can you say about a waterpik  They pretty much speak fpr themselves and withstand countless droppings but eventually the break.</li>
            <li> I read some of the bad reviews and was a little concerned, but ordered it anyway. Glad I did. It works great!</li>
            <li> This has never work well at all, I had to finally go out &amp; buy another one, I feel I should be able to return this and at least get a partial credit.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and well-packaged. The product is just as advertised. It does the job for sure but will require time to get accustomed to so that it is most effective. Not a good choice for really young kids.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just ok. I was used to using the regular Waterpik (not cordless) and it outperforms this one hands down. This one is bulky and is hard to hold - have to change hands to get to all of the mouth areas and it only has 2 adjustments - not strong enough even on high. I will keep it for travel, but it definitely can&#x27;t replace the countertop Waterpik.</li>
            <li> Works great. Just need more practice! Lol made a mess at frst. I think I got it. Also noticing less plaque and whiter teeth! Very happy with this product</li>
            <li> bottom too bulky to be portable and hard to hold  to the teeth. A slimmer model would be ideal for traveling use.</li>
            <li> This is probably one of the most fun items. I wish it was a little smaller so I can take it with me and use it after lunch. It works well.</li>
            <li> My dentist insisted that I floss more than once a day. Since my other waterflosser is a shower device, this seemed a good option. I have not been disappointed! The cordless aspect makes using it far easier than a former waterpik that was tedious and high maintenance. This was a good investment.</li>
            <li> I have had this Waterpik for about 8 months, and it needs recharging about every 2 days now.  Likely after a year I will have to make a decision whether to replace it.  A corded model is probably a better choice but will take up more counter space..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From reading other reviews, battery life seems to be a weak point with many cordless water flossers.</li>
            <li> Took it travelling with me after a recent purchase. It died right after the initial battery charge ran out, and refuses to charge up again... On a brand new item!  Pretty inconvenient while travelling! It&#x27;s too bulky to take up precious luggage space travelling when it&#x27;s not even working and I can hardly be bothered to go through the customer service procedures when I do get home, I may just leave this white elephant behind. i had read the US Amazon reviews which didn&#x27;t give me any warning about this issue, but later when googling the problem I came across a bunch of lousy reviews on the UK Amazon. So buyer beware!</li>
            <li> This handy cordless water floss prove to be a very hygienic tool I use it daily to Clean my tooth</li>
            <li> Great cordless system.</li>
            <li> It really gives a feeling of dental cleaning.  Awesome product. I asked a couple of my dentist friends and they highly recommended it too.</li>
            <li> Works well. Still getting down how to use it, but it seems to hold exactly enough water for my mouth. Love that it&#x27;s cordless.</li>
            <li> My dentist suggested that I buy a waterpik so I did.  It works fine.  I noted in another review that someone said the knob at the base of the tip didn&#x27;t rotate the tip.  Mine does, but after verifying that it rotated I haven&#x27;t tried to rotate the tip again as  it is easier to rotate the whole body.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product over a year now and I&#x27;m just 100% satisfied with the results.  It reaches areas that are very hard or simply impossible to reach with regular floss. I definitely recommended!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never used a waterpik before this one and after having used it several times I agree with other reviewers that it is best used in the shower as its hard not to get water everywhere unless you just keep it in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like how it doesn&#x27;t have a huge water reservoir, allowing it to easily fit on my crowded counter.  I&#x27;ve found it holds enough water for one cleaning session which is really all you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for its effectiveness, my teeth definitely feel cleaner but the real test will come when I see my dentist next.</li>
            <li> I bought a second one, after the first one failed. The first one worked very well until it quit (6 months). The newer one seems to be lower pressure,  designed that way possibly to prevent failure?  The new one is still working fine over the past year, but I have used other waterpik products more to my liking.</li>
            <li> I have a larger water flosser, but can&#x27;t travel with it.  This is a nice size and easy to pack.</li>
            <li> I have had the smaller model of the rechargeable waterpik (WP360-W) before. I bought it two times in the two years of my braces. Both of them clunked out because, I think, of a design flow--the water tank is positioned so that it collects debris and the motor is not really strong. Te last one was gone within two months. I do not recommend that to anybody. This one is a different design and the motor seems to be stronger. I had it for a couple of months and it is really working nice. The only problem I see is that the panels are attached in a way that it will lcollect debris and become a revolting thing sooner or later. But that may just be what one has to leave with if one has to use one of the rechargeables. I do not have space on my bathroom counter for a bigger machine and need to be able to take it with me for my trips too, so this seems to be a good compromise. Other flaw was the packaging: it did not include the promised tongue cleaner. I was kind of looking forward to trying that out.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Great product. Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> I had to replace my older cordless water pik.....I was so impressed with this one....My teeth felt so much cleaner...It sayd it is better than string floss and that you can see a difference in 2 weeks....I know I can see a difference already....I love this one so much....It is wonderful.....</li>
            <li> i have beef with this version of the waterpik, but the corded one is actually 5 star and is perfect. this one is way too bulky, cant be charged while in use, and doesnt hold much water. the corded one is basically everything this isnt. it even holds the heads for you! get the corded one instead, skip on this crap.</li>
            <li> Works great and effective.</li>
            <li> Does a great job, easy to use</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in this water pic because it makes such a mess while flossing and it also seems like a rinse instead of a floss truly getting in-between teeth.  It is also a bummer not to be able to return it.  I would not recommend it at all.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in the amount of pressure the highest setting gives.</li>
            <li> This is my second one, now I have a water flosser at both my houses.  Really helps to get into nooks and crannies while massaging the gums.</li>
            <li> I have braces and this product cleaned out the food particles right out between my teeth.  Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I purchased two weeks ago thought it was great.  Now, the thing just works for a couple of seconds and stops.  After reading others&#x27; experiences, I will not purchase again.  I had the cordless one.</li>
            <li> This is the third Waterpik Cordless Waterflosser I have owned and love the product.  As one who has always hated to floss this is an easy alternative (one that my dentist endorses).  The only gripe I have is the battery on the previous 2 models lasted between one and two years.  It simply would not hold a charge beyond that time.  On this new model I noticed a redesign of the charging connection and the charger itself is different.  My hope is Waterpik has addressed this obvious problem and corrected it.</li>
            <li> I just wanted to say how much I appreciate all of your advice about ways to handle the bad charger.  I love your inventive minds and helpful attitudes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love my Waterpik, but it&#x27;s ridiculous to replace it every year.</li>
            <li> These devices get an incredible amount of debris out of your teeth! They flow water deep into the gum line to promote healthy gums. Buy one - either the cordless or the base device. The cordless needs 2 to 4 refills to really clean but rinses okay with one.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use in my dorm because I&#x27;m too lazy to take care of a plug-in unit, and also because it would take up too much space on the counter. So for people like me, this is a good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I charged it according to the instructions, and have been using it once every night for the past 3-4 weeks without recharging it a single time, which was definitely a surprise. Currently I am noticing a decrease in water power so I think it&#x27;s finally time to recharge. The water power itself is decent; it&#x27;s definitely not as powerful as a plug-in flosser so I do worry about its effectiveness, but it still beats the hell out of string flossing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As noted in the title, there are a few cons. Firstly, there is no indicator anywhere that tells you how much charge is left; basically you have to depend on your ability to sense a decrease in power as it steadily un-charges over many days, which is akin to watching grass grow. Secondly, you have to use it while bending over the sink, or else you&#x27;ll have a small river flowing down the front of your body. Flossing the opposite side of your mouth will cause all the water to flow over your hand, which is tolerable but kind of gross sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think this is a good product for the lazy and those mildly concerned about their dental health. Those who take their teeth more seriously than I do should probably invest in a table-top flosser with more power.</li>
            <li> I really love the new portable waterpik flosser. It just keeps getting better.&lt;br /&gt;The new plug is more effective and the water well empties more easily.&lt;br /&gt;I am so grateful to be able to have a decent waterpik while travelling.</li>
            <li> Battery doesn&#x27;t last long. It conks off after a few months.</li>
            <li> Love it !  Very powerful cleaning, reach where tooth brush doesn&#x27;t.  Love the cordless part, I can take it in the shower</li>
            <li> I use this nightly in the shower.  The way I use it, it is quite messy.  The charge lasted at least 10 loads of water and going.</li>
            <li> I have an irrigator waterpik wp 70, and I really like it. Therefore, for the road option, I chose the same company and is very happy</li>
            <li> Upon receipt:&lt;br /&gt;My second water pic..after 5 years the battery on my first one woudn&#x27;t hold a charge.  This holds more water than the original and the charge lasted me over a week with 2 uses a day.  By habit, I plug it in on sunday evening but I could take this on vacation, fully charged, and not have to haul the charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are a must have for people with tooth implants or braces.  Since I began using a wagger pic, my checkups have improved dramatically and my dentist is as happy as I am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;June 10-3 months later.  Until 2 days ago, I still liked the portable WaterPic as much as I did from the first.  However when I unplugged the charger monday morning there was no pumping sound, no water spurted out.  I plugged it in once more and thought I&#x27;d try it Tuesday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tuesday..again no charge.  Plugged it in to a different outlet, though I did verify the one I used was truly working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wednesday..It&#x27;s broken.  wrote Amazon only to discover the warranty is expired..3 months?  I hope not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thursday..decided to email WaterPic Corporate.  Meanwhile I don&#x27;t have the flosser which I use twice daily1</li>
            <li> I have really tight teeth, so I got this per a suggestion of my dentist and a friend recommended this one. It works great and I have no problems with it.  Also, use it with rinse diluted with water.  Amazon offered the best price, as always.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended that I get a water pick. I look at quite a few and decided this was the best one for my needs. It is very light weight and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Love this cordless Waterpik. Excellent for travel and it keeps it charge for a long time.  I am going to buy more for my children.  Great Gift</li>
            <li> Several users report that the battery won&#x27;t charge after a short period of usage.  I had the same problem but noticed that the plug to the flossed would slide on too easily.  I slightly bent one of the tangs on the flossed so the plug fit tighter and it now charges again.</li>
            <li> I was diagnosed with TMJ, therefore I couldn&#x27;t get my fingers into my mouth to floss.  My dentist recommended a waterpik.  I love the cordless idea and the portable water tank.  The tank doesn&#x27;t hold enough water for me to finish my job but that really isn&#x27;t a problem since I&#x27;m right at the faucet.  It did the job and no pain in the process as with flossing.</li>
            <li> I use the waterpik waterflosser cordless plus daily. It is so very easy to use and has a dedicated space at my sink. My mouth feels refreshed when I finish--just like the old dental flossing. I am pleased with all phases  of my purchase.</li>
            <li> Delayed buying a water pik for years, but I finally listened to the DDS and bought one.  Found this cordless one on Amazon for $15 less than the sale price in Kohls.  Works easily, does the job and is not as messy as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my daughter who has braces.  This was based on the recommendation of her orthodontist.  She loves it because it&#x27;s so much easier than having to thread floss between braces and teeth.  Cleans her teeth and gums well.</li>
            <li> Love this thing, really cleans out every thing between my teeth, dentist said to keep up what ever I am doing, my check-ups and cleanings have improved. this is my second one and when I wear this one out I will buy another.</li>
            <li> I like a cordless flosser so I can store it under the sink, rather than taking up space on the counter, and having to worry about spilling water.  The downside is that it only holds enough water to last for about 1 minute, and I can&#x27;t &amp;#34;floss&amp;#34; all my teeth in one minute.  So I must refill it and do it again.  The Waterpik is quite noisy, but I think that is unavoidable, and it&#x27;s quieter than a desktop model, because other items on the counter don&#x27;t vibrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once in a while, a &amp;#34;tip&amp;#34; will get food stuck in it, and it is necessary to run it under water and/or use a small paper clip to remove it.  Otherwise, it works well.  I charge mine after every use, and have not had a problem with running out of battery power</li>
            <li> I got this because I hate flossing but figured I still needed something extra than just brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my first use I was surprised by how much this actually hurts.  I didn&#x27;t realize just how thin and strong the water stream is.  It hurt like a needle hitting my gums, and made some of my gums bleed.  Supposedly this is normal and will not happen have a few weeks of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The water tank does not hold as much as expected.  I have to refill it 2-4 times while using it depending on how fast I go.  If I stay between each tooth for three seconds like in the instructions then I have to refill it 4-6 times.  Now I just go very fast with it after I brush and refill it 1 or 2 times at most.  Also, I still use mouthwash after use.  I can tell that it works, after I brush I can feel the difference before and after I use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend spending a little more and getting one with a larger tank, however it is not a big deal to refill it a couple times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am currently using the tip that has a lot of brushes on the end as it does not seem to be as intense as the regular tip.  Once I get more used to it I will switch back to the normal tip.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 2 months, never letting the battery run down, and now it won&#x27;t hold a charge and is for me a useless product.  I&#x27;m sorry I bought this---I&#x27;m going to replace it with an ordinary plug in water pic.  A big disappointment.</li>
            <li> This one has two speeds setting, which is not strong enough to clean teeth. It comes with a very small water container which you can run out of water quickly, you have to refill three or four times to get work done. The worst part is that this wireless waterflosser comes with 110v charger, which no use for me if i travel some countries with 220v charging. I can ignore other drawbacks if it comes with 220v charger. I have to return it.</li>
            <li> It works well, and is very helpful to keep my teeth clean.</li>
            <li> I could use this for hours! But really, it&#x27;s great, teeth feel so clean. I had a shower one prior to this, but this one is much better.  Only setback is I have to keep filling it with water, but that&#x27;s no problem. The price was right for a handheld.</li>
            <li> It runs out of water halfway through a row of teeth.  A real PITA to have to keep mixing new rinse solution if you are not Piking with plain water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the force is not as high as other models-it is not nearly as effective at removing food between teeth as is floss,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the vertical angle one must use in order for the pump to get water from its reservoir, anything coming out of your mouth runs over the body of the appliance.  NASTY unless you clean your water pik hosing everytime you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This feels like another piece of Chinese made junk.  (I don&#x27;t know where it&#x27;s made.)</li>
            <li> Poor piece of equipment quit working just after the warranty ran out. I was hard to hold and very cumbersome to use.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews about the battery not lasting long enough or holding enough water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not my experience at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only used string floss about once or twice per week before this tool, now I use at least once per day, often times twice.  My 3 year old loves to use it too.  He has figured out how to work it, so if the product is only half as effective as string then I am about 10X better off in that i am actually using the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without doubt I would recommend this device</li>
            <li> I like this machine.  Works great.  No charging problems.  Would recommend to friends.</li>
            <li> Hello,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First let me start by saying that this was my first waterflosser, and since I&#x27;ve never liked flossing I was really looking forward to this being good.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I got the cordless is to be able to easily store it, I have a little cabinet where I store all my dental stuff and the corded one wouldn&#x27;t fit there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that out of the way, I have been using it for about a week and I felt the pressure was a bit weak but didn&#x27;t know if it mattered or not, till yesterday when I felt I had something stuck between my front teeth, and using the waterflosser did not help at all, unlike regular flossing. So....&lt;br /&gt;I brought it back where I bought it and just ordered the Aquarius from Amazon, hoping it will be better with a more powerfull waterflosser.</li>
            <li> Bought this because it was portable and it did the trick for travel. While bulking it is still better than trying to lug around a full Waterpik. Wish they had an even more compact version.</li>
            <li> Love the waterpik , easy to use and like the hand held model.</li>
            <li> this product met all expectations.&lt;br /&gt;we are very happy with the product and find it useful for dental hygiene and general health.</li>
            <li> I needed to replace my older waterpik and this one took up less counter space. It is adequate but the water stream is not nearly as powerful as the tradiional model nor does it hold enough water. I need to refill a couple of times. I will keep this one to use while traveling but have already ordered another plug-in water pik.</li>
            <li> This waterflosser make my tooth very clear ,Replace the ordinary toothpick.And is very good for gums,you should buy this one</li>
            <li> i tried it on as soon as i received it... the water compartment is small, but it cant be too big either, incase it gets too heavy and uneasy as a handheld device. otherwise, the sound is bearable and the water pressure is strong. it takes some practice before getting it right in the mouth. for general rinsing only, and doesn&#x27;t replace the dentist.</li>
            <li> I bought this after a recommendation from my dentist. I suppose this is comfortable for some people, but all I experienced was an uncomfortable stream of water into my mouth, without any noticeable pressure into or between teeth. It shot a stream of water into my mouth, required me to spit into the sink. made a mess on my mirror, and didn&#x27;t clean between my teeth anywhere near as well as I was doing before buying it. I fail to see how this method is better than simply flossing. Back it goes! I suppose they&#x27;re compensating dentists for recommending it, but n one is compensating me for the cost of sending it back. :)</li>
            <li> Product performs well, sleek, sturdy, and holds a good charge.  Good value for the money.  I hope my dentist agrees!</li>
            <li> Since my last water pic lasted only 3mos I don&#x27;t want to make assumptions about this one, but functionally it&#x27;s great. The water resivoir is just right and it has various pics that allow for multi person use. I prefer this one over the Phillips costlier air/water burst pic. Will update if I experience any failure.</li>
            <li> I got this for my son who recently got braces.  The ortho recommended it.  It really does a great job of getting food out between the teeth and braces.</li>
            <li> I received my Waterpik Cordless Plus flosser and started using it as soon as it was charged.  I do own the Waterpik Flosser with the cord and needed this to use at school after lunch. This is so convenient as I can get rid of food particles stuck between my teeth and get back to teaching without having remnants of my lunch on display for my students to see. I would recommend this product wholeheartedly to anyone concerned about dental care. It is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Not as powerful as the regular water pic.</li>
            <li> adequate but spray could be stronger</li>
            <li> I really like it and it does the job the only thing I do not like is it is hard to empty all the liquid out when you rinse it out. To bad the drain is not on the bottom. it is a good product however.</li>
            <li> First, the good stuff: It works. I charge it overnight once a week, and haven&#x27;t had it fail using it twice a day in between. It does a great job, especially as I have a lot of dental work; no shredded floss to pick out. The resevoir is large enough to do a twice daily cleaning. It&#x27;s powerful enough to dislodge particles without irritating the gums. Less desirable is the operating button is an on/off switch; it should be a a simple push button. The resevoir is easy to fill and remove, but there&#x27;s no way to empty and clean it.</li>
            <li> Very powerful for a portable. i purchased primarily for travel and is excellent for that purpose.  The only drawback I found is the reservoir needs to be refilled before I am done, but this is true of most mostt portables.  This is not really a big deal.  I still rate it  five stars</li>
            <li> Shooting a stream of pressurized water into your mouth pretty much guarantees a somewhat messy outcome...but the cordless PLUS is an efficient unit and way more contained than the older traditional Waterpik set up.</li>
            <li> I think this is terrific.  My dental hygienist commented that this was my best checkup ever.  Set up is easy.</li>
            <li> I love this water flosser! Who would have thought? It has made an amazing difference in my health. I always had problems sticking with flossing as my gums tend to bleed easily and therefore never really pursued it on a regular basis. I got the water flosser for my husband, who is one of those lucky people who could use a cleaning every 3 months :(. So, I started using it too. Sometimes more than twice a day, if I felt something got stuck between my teeth i.e. after eating strawberries, etc. After about 4 months I due to see my hygienist for a cleaning. I was not so much aware of the change, but he certainly was and I was given the best compliment I think I could ever get from my him: &amp;#34;I wish more people had such healthy gums like you - you made my day!&amp;#34;.  And he asked what I did differently - and so I told him about using the Waterpik Waterflosser.  My husband does not think it makes a great difference preventing his plaque, but he too enjoys how well it cleans and removes leftovers between the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;USE: I find it convenient because it is cordless and does not take up much counter space. The flosser can be replaced easily and the charge lasts a long time. The only think I found annoying in the beginning is that the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; button in not also the &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; button - two separate buttons for each state and that took some time for me to learn :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are plenty of things that I use every single day but none have made such a significant difference to my health. I have therefore no problem giving it a 5-star rating.</li>
            <li> This is phenomenal. I wish I knew about it a LOT earlier. BUY THIS. You will NEVER regret it. The little reservoir on the back holds like 8 oz/30 seconds/half a cleaning of water. So what I did was buy a clear hose at home depot, shoved it onto the handle nozzle, and the other end into an 42 oz. mouthwash bottle filled with water and a splash of mouthwash in it. Now it lasts 42 oz/10 minutes/two full cleanings. Takes 24 hours to charge, lasts about a week.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take up much room on the counter, and I have now gotten the wrist action down so I can do all my choppers with one tank of water.  I never leave the tank thing on the base so no mold problem at all.  I think it&#x27;s pretty good overall--I wouldn&#x27;t want anything stronger that&#x27;s for sure.  Also, I charged the thing once and it&#x27;s still going strong, so I&#x27;m pretty happy with the battery life as well.</li>
            <li> Cheap, easy, light easy to pack</li>
            <li> This is one of the greatest oral hygiene tools ever!  As a guy with LARGE hands...flossing with regular dental floss was always a challenge and therefore I did not do it as regularly as I should.  I travel a lot so cordless was important to me....and this thing is GREAT!  I use it every time I brush my teeth and it really leaves your mouth feeling totally clean and fresh.  When you direct the small jet of water back between and around your teeth...you defintely can tell you&#x27;re getting food particles and &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; out from between your teeth that just brushing does not do.  I am a WaterPik convert for sure!</li>
            <li> Works grat to keep your teeth free of tarter</li>
            <li> I really love my water pik glossed, feel like my teeth are cleaner.</li>
            <li> It works ok, but is more of a hassle than using string/tape floss!  Using cold tap water may be uncomfortable for someone with sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> If you have used the waterpik flosser with cord before then you will hate this one.  I thought this would be an upgrade after my waterpik cord was broken after 5 years.  So I bought this cordless waterpik.  I returned this crap after one use.  The reservoir was too small, after a few second when there&#x27;s less water, if you hold it at a wrong angle, it will start shooting air.  Unlike the cord one, you can hold it at any angle and you can put as much water as you want.  The only good thing I see in this product is for traveling.</li>
            <li> Very please with item!!</li>
            <li> This device is easy to use and most importantly, does the job. I definitely prefer it over normal flossing (despite the water mess, but then again normal flossing is also kind of messy, no further description necessary I think :) because it&#x27;s gentle on the gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To those who complain about battery - the instructions clearly say that the device needs to be charged for a full day before first use. This is necessary to get the max capacity just like with any rechargeable battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tank is quickly refilled, so I&#x27;m not too concerned about the (admittedly surprisingly) short operation length per water load.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Couple areas for improvement (hence only 3 stars at this time):&lt;br /&gt;- the biggest flaw in my opinion is that the tips should have a much smaller hole - I was hoping for much more of a water jet stream than a flowing one. As a side benefit, a smaller hole in the tip should also increase the 45 sec operation to 60-90 seconds in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;- The Hi/Low switch feels cheap and almost like a fisher price kind of switch, it does not clearly click into one position or the other&lt;br /&gt;- it is pretty loud - I live in a condo, and at night I&#x27;m almost concerned it might wake up my neighbors (that said, this might not be as dramatic when you&#x27;re not the one who holds it in hand)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m still happy I made this purchase though, and hope to get good feedback from my dentist.</li>
            <li> Compared to the plug in Waterpik we used to have, this one shoots water too hard on the low setting. Any waterpik, battery or AC, is awkward to use, but it&#x27;s not too bad. Other than that, it seems to work fine. Have had it four weeks. In a very small bathroom, it&#x27;s really the only choice. Definitely gets out the food that gets stuck up in my gums.</li>
            <li> It definitely cleans your teeth!  I am sensitive to temperature, especially in the winter, so I run the hottest tap water, and it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.  It&#x27;s pretty intense, and there&#x27;s definitely a learning curve, but overall, my teeth are much freer of plaque than they used to be.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for 3 weeks and so far it works fine.  The water reservoir could be larger, but its not a big deal to refill it.  As for the comments about it being messy to use, no different than the regular water pik.  Next dental check up will be the test for me if it helps reduce tartar/ plaque issues.</li>
            <li> Using for two weeks. Works fine. Only two levels of force. Don&#x27;t need multiple tips, yet. No light to tell you when it is charged. I leave it plugged in over night once a week. I don&#x27;t like the way the tank works and the door is flimsy and comes off easily. For all the negatives it does what it is supposed to do. If it lasts I will forgive its shortcomings.</li>
            <li> This item arrived in a timely manner.  It performs as expected.  I bought it for travel.  The intensity settings are just low and&lt;br /&gt;high, but not really &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; as the regular model.  I recommend this item.</li>
            <li> It makes a splashy mess, but does seem to clean between my teeth well.  I use on low pressure because the high pressure depletes the water too fast and makes an even bigger mess.  In an attempt to keep the splashes down I keep my mouth closed, but then my mouth fills up with water quickly and I have to open my mouth, and the water gets all over the countertop again.  But, I shall persevere.  I&#x27;ve read other comments about how it has to be recharged often but, using low pressure, I have not had that problem.  I do wish there was a light showing when it is completely recharged.</li>
            <li> Wonderful...portable.  Take it on allmy trips.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I have had 2 of these units and eventually they stop working. The first one, due to corrosion on the charge wiring and male connectors of the unit. I basically solved this problem by putting a piece of electrical tape, covering the male connectors on the 2nd unit I bought. The problem w/the second unit was that water leaked thru the inside therefore corroding the electrical cables inside. There is a little o&#x27;ring that is supposed to stop this from happening, but it doesn&#x27;t. If you don&#x27;t mind spending money for a piece of poor engineering and replace it every 8-12 months it works fine.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this!  Works just as good as my full-size Waterpik (countertop).  No problem with water pressure, length of run time or anything else.  I have had it for several weeks and have not had to recharge it yet.  I would highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> It does the job and fills the purpose for which it was intended. Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy it  it works.</li>
            <li> There is a learning curve for proper use but great product once you know how to use it correctly. Quicker than using string floss, looking forward to my dentist&#x27;s opinion at next check up.</li>
            <li> this waterflosser works perfectly! easy cordless use, would recommend it to everybody who has bridges, implants or both. excellent cleaning.</li>
            <li> BECAUSE OF IMPLANTS AND CROWNS I FOUND MY WATERPIK TO BE WONDERFUL.  HOLD PLENTY OF WATER OR MOUTH RINSE. KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK....THANK YOU WATERPIK.</li>
            <li> Good product for a cordless device.  Has a pretty good forceful stream</li>
            <li> As ordered is a perfect review. Why? Because the picture shows exactly what I get and because of that I recomend this product and this saler for everyone.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for a battery operated water flosser I had for many years. I will use it when I travel. I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to judge the length of time irt holds a charge. It seems to do a good job on my teeth. I would have prefered a replaceable battery so I would not have to use it and recharge it between trips.</li>
            <li> thank you waterpik water flosser cordless plus is improved the last model. is fast shipping.thank you and right pice.a a</li>
            <li> Have used one of these for several years now, long enough to wear out the battery &amp; put plenty of wear &amp; tear on it.  So it was very nice to get a new, fresh one.  Works perfect &amp; showed up as promised.</li>
            <li> We bought this product for travel.  At home I use a Hydrofloss but that is too difficult to take on trips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find the Waterpik Waterflosser Cordless Plus an excellent product for water flossing away from home.  It does almost as good a job as the Hydrofloss.  The biggest downside is the small reservoir.  It only allows for 45 seconds of flossing.  So expect to refill several times before the job is done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another issue is no battery charge/power available indicator.  You have to guess about whether the device needs to be charged or not.  The instructions are very vague about how long to charge or how long a charge will last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, if you take this device to Europe, you will need a power converter. The charger is for 120 volts, not 110-240 volts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those minor shortcomings aside, I think the Waterpik Waterflosser Cordless Plus is the best and only choice for portable, travel-friendly, effective water flossing.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this unit last year on May 6th, and i am using it almost everyday, and now I can review it correctly, for me, it is a perfect unit, I have no problems with battery, noise and size all other reviewers talking about.</li>
            <li> I had the dentist put some crowns on, this Water Pick is fantastic is big, hold a lot of water, I found out that when I eat some food is left on my teeth and I don&#x27;t like it, I used this water pick about 3 times a day, hold the charge for a long time and it a great product for anybody that that wants to keep your gums and teeth clean.</li>
            <li> I am used to the standard models which use much more water force to get between the teeth and clean more the pockets. It&#x27;s ok for travel however for a home model I would choose the regular standard ones again.</li>
            <li> after two years of use I can only use this thrice in every charge. I was expecting that the battery will be better. tried to open up the unit to check if the battery can be replace but it seems that it cannot be replace. such a nice product but the downside is the battery.</li>
            <li> It works great so long as the charge lasts.  However, like everyone else has said, after 5 months it will NOT hold a charge.</li>
            <li> This is a dumbed-down version of Waterpik&#x27;s earlier &#x27;travel&#x27; waterpik and it lacks the power adjustments that I like to have. It is better than nothing, but I prefer the corded version. The water reservoir capacity is minimal.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t get the reservoir under my bathroom faucet to fill it and battery unit would not come off the stand</li>
            <li> I bought this for travel. I cannot carry the big one so I got the little one to keep my teeth clean</li>
            <li> I bought this for travel, it works ok, but I would like it to have more pressure.  I have the larger one for home and like the fact that I can adjust the pressure.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom thinking it would help with her dental hygiene, but she hasn&#x27;t really figured out how to use it without spraying water all over :-(</li>
            <li> This really is an alternative to flossing that is getting in there and doing the job like floss. Like floss, I just don&#x27;t have a clean mouth with all that stuff between my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the ease of use of this relative to flossing, I am &amp;#34;flossing&amp;#34; more than I would with the string. I always kept &amp;#34;meaning&amp;#34; to floss more. Now I am just doing it. A must-have for all households.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There will come a time when we say, like we did with toothbrushes, &amp;#34;What did people do before?&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It does the job but is heavy and awkward to use when full of water.  I am getting better with it but it takes a while to get used to.</li>
            <li> I have had 2 of the less expensive models. Both lasted about 2 years when the batteries failed.&lt;br /&gt;When fully charged (24 hours) they would last for less than three days, then 2 days then one.&lt;br /&gt;This model will last one week or more on a single charge with the same amount of use. I would encourage&lt;br /&gt;buyers to buy this more expensive model for that reason. I hope the batteries in this model last longer than&lt;br /&gt;the previous models I have owned. Why not 5 stars?  I find it difficult to fill without&lt;br /&gt;running water all over the unit.</li>
            <li> I like the deflosser as it is easy to use.  I do with it held more water as it runs out quick but it is for&lt;br /&gt;Traveling so I understand</li>
            <li> This is a newer model of a waterpik I owned.  This one is so much better.  It is easier to fill and I like the different heads, especially the one for crowns.</li>
            <li> nope, just not enough umph even brand new &amp; fully charged.&lt;br /&gt;I use the regular waterpik at home. dentist says I should use it on high setting.&lt;br /&gt;this portable model cannot do that. sending it back.</li>
            <li> I really like the ease of handling the  cordless unit.  I have the corded Waterpik Ultra (WP-100) which is excellent.  But the convenience of taking the cordless unit on the road is a real advantage.  Yes, you may find it necessary to refill the unit once or twice during use.  But refilling is easy and takes only a few seconds.  And yes, the cordless unit has less water pressure than the corded Wp-100 at its maximum pressure setting.  But when the Cordless Plus is set to &amp;#34;HI&amp;#34;, it compares to about  a setting of 7 out of the 10 maximum on the dial of the corded Ultra (WP-100).  That is still plenty of pressure for a handy cordless unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used and loved a conventional corded Waterpik for years.  But I would recommend this cordless unit to anyone that desires an easy Waterpik to take and use on the road, or just demands a handy cordless unit.</li>
            <li> have used portable water pics for years. this is an improved version and does work better.Do wish it had a battery charged light on it tho.</li>
            <li> Works great in the shower! Makes teeth and mouth feel a lot more cleaner when you have braces. Got my braces off a few weeks ago and I will continue to use this! Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother who loved it. It broke after 6 months. She called Waterpik, asked for a replacement -and Waterpik sent her a new one! So far so good...</li>
            <li> Less than two months in, probably two dozen uses and it won&#x27;t hold a charge. FAIL. LAME. RIPOFF. Of course the return expired in only 30 days. In my opinion Amazon should stand behind this. Avoid this thing. When it worked it made for a nice travel option. Now it&#x27;s landfill bound. Inexcusable.</li>
