            <li>It also did a great job of removing eye makeup.</li>
            <li>but this one works great and oil-free</li>
            <li>In my opinion, this is as good as the Mary Kay eye makeup remover, but cheaper.  </li>

            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I was able to get most of the makeup off both of my eyes using one cotton pad.</li>
            <li>I received this product free via Influenster to try, review, and supply my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>and my grand daughter used it.  </li>
            <li>There is nothing about this product that leads me to believe it is better than soap and water.</li>
            <li>I needed to scrub it off with face wash in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li>We have all agreed that this is an outstanding product....if you can find it.</li>
            <li>I love to buy stuff on Amazon because it&#x27;s convenient and</li>

            <li>This is my favorite eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li>I am going to buy more soon.</li>
            <li>If you try this product i guarantee that you will love it.</li>
            <li>which is much better for me.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite of every remover I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>I love this eye make-up remover.</li>
            <li>The only thing was that it didn&#x27;t do a good job of removing its own brand eyeliner!</li>
            <li>I would totally recommended to those looking for a good make up eye remover, and good on price.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s better for light, non-waterproof eye makeup.  </li>
            <li>Inexpensive, works great, and does not irritate my sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>It easily removed my eye cosmetics and my eyes did not feel any pain during or afterwards.</li>
            <li>I wear waterproof eyeliner and mascara and this product removes them both easily.</li>
            <li>its easy on the eyes, not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>normally I get a good deal.</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best makeup remover I have used.</li>
            <li>I recieved this product for free to try and review.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t sting and removes make up smoothly  </li>
            <li>Try looking for it in-store, it&#x27;s often packaged with a free eyeliner or mascara also.</li>
            <li>: I received this item free from Influenster to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but this one is fantastic.</li>
            <li>In fact, I&#x27;m fairly convinced it is just pre-mixed soap and water (quite possibly the most abrasive soap and contaminated water</li>
            <li>My first impression of this product was positive, since it seemed to do a good job removing eye makeup.</li>
            <li>I use it on qtips to even out unruly eyeliner and clean up any smudges and mistakes.</li>
            <li>so i was super excited that i found it on amazon.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for: gentle yet effective and leaves no oily residue.</li>
            <li>The nozzle dispenser on this bottle is the perfect size for delicately coating the end of the Q-tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>love this stuff so much</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a good ten years.</li>
            <li>Most products i get from Rimmel London either don&#x27;t work or live up to the claims on the packaging, but this one did!</li>
            <li>Removes makeup perfectly and gentle enough for sensitive, skin, prone to irritation, just like mine.</li>
            <li>have left an oily, shiny film on my skin, but this one does nothing of the kind.  </li>
            <li>I thought I could trust that this would be as good as all the other products they have</li>
            <li>It did everything it says except remove my waterproof makeup, even though it says right on the bottle it removes waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li>it is not oily at all and cleans all makeup right off.</li>
            <li>it just wipes whatever bit you want, right off.</li>
            <li>Like I said, I&#x27;m going to try it one more time and see if it gets a little better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for years, it is super gentle and does remove makeup.</li>
            <li>I am a contact wearer and this is very gentle to my eyes.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t sting like other makeup removers but it works, and I love that it&#x27;s oil free and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m definitely going to give this one more try</li>
            <li>but as for the first attempt, I have to say I&#x27;m not a fan.  </li>
            <li>I love that its only 5 dollars and works better than more expensive brands and it&#x27;s oil free!</li>
            <li>Just discovered this recently product and found it is most effective.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Overall, I am pleased.</li>
            <li>I first found this make-up remover about 2 years ago.</li>
            <li>and it works very well with removing it!</li>
            <li>This is the first eye makeup remover i have bought that removes waterproof makeup.</li>
            <li>I tend to find ways to save money and be as eco friendly, organic and natural as I can when it comes to beauty products.</li>
            <li>when I first tried to use it, I put waaay too much product on my cotton swab and let me just say that even if the packaging says &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; it still burns when you put a cotton ball soaked with eye makeup remover to your eye.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to my family &amp; friends &amp; most recently to my co-workers.</li>
            <li>Certainly didn&#x27;t expect that.</li>
            <li>This time, I really don&#x27;t think it had anything to do with the fact that I had never used it before.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s definitely gentle.</li>
            <li>It does the job it is supposed to do very well.</li>
            <li>I put a good amount on a cotton ball and press it against each eye for a few seconds before rubbing the makeup off in short strokes.</li>
            <li>I mainly brought it because of the reviews.</li>
            <li>you wear high quality makeup DO NOT buy this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not thick and sticky like Armor All.</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t like Rimmel London products</li>
            <li>It is a very thin liquid, not unlike water, but it still does a great job of removing even waterproof eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>Left my face very oily and it did not take off my makeup.</li>
            <li>Then, about two weeks after I started using it, I suddenly developed allergic contact dermatitis on my eyelids.</li>
            <li>My doctor&#x27;s advice is to run far, far away from any product containing methylisothiazolinone.</li>
            <li>Neutrogenas completely removes all my eye makeup and doesn&#x27;t irritate the eye area or my eyeballs if it accidentaly gets in it.</li>
            <li>For Game of Thrones fans: it looks like greyscale, only bright red.)</li>
            <li>and it only actually smudged my mascara and eyeliner but really just pushed it around.</li>
            <li>I have never gone back to any of my old eye makeup removers and have saved a ton as a result!  </li>
            <li>Coconut Oil is a decently priced for a jar and that one time buy lasts for quite a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s refreshing and gets off tough eyeliner and mascara.</li>
            <li>I used it for about a week and then had to go back to my old ways to heal my skin.</li>
            <li>This stuff barely takes off my eye makeup.</li>
            <li>This really does work and it last a long time!</li>
            <li>In the last year or so, Rimmel sent new end-aisle displays out to all our local drug stores, and they eliminated the hook/slot where the remover used to hang.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even gone so far as to put extra remover on the same cotton ball</li>
            <li>After she ran out she tried some other high price brands and said her eyes felt like it was burning.  </li>
            <li>so I was very curious about this and wondered how it would stand up to my normal routine.  </li>

            <li> This stuff barely takes off my eye makeup.</li>
            <li> This really does work and it last a long time!</li>
            <li> In the last year or so, Rimmel sent new end-aisle displays out to all our local drug stores, and they eliminated the hook/slot where the remover used to hang.  </li>

            <li> After she ran out she tried some other high price brands and said her eyes felt like it was burning.  </li>
            <li> so I was very curious about this and wondered how it would stand up to my normal routine.  </li>
            <li> I had a really tough time removing the eyeliner I got from them but a different eye makeup remover cleaned it up quickly.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d already used, and it is immediately apparent that the black makeup color diminishes from the cotton ball as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Bottle is almost twice as big as the other removers.</li>
            <li> ... can&#x27;t think of a single one!</li>
            <li> You only need a little to do the job and if you get it in  your eyes it doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> If I put on my eyeliner a little crooked, all I need is a Q-tip and this makeup remover.  </li>
            <li> I needed to be really careful to not to get it in my eye</li>
            <li> It became red, overly dried, and started to peel.</li>
            <li> It was a bit pricey but did everything I expected it to do!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I usually use coconut oil for my makeup removal.  I tend to find ways to save money and be as eco friendly, organic and natural as I can when it comes to beauty products. Coconut Oil is a decently priced for a jar and that one time buy lasts for quite a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never used a liquid eye makeup remover before so I was very curious about this and wondered how it would stand up to my normal routine.  I&#x27;ll be completely honest, when I first tried to use it, I put waaay too much product on my cotton swab and let me just say that even if the packaging says &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; it still burns when you put a cotton ball soaked with eye makeup remover to your eye.  Let&#x27;s just call that &amp;#34;user error&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I did try again with less product.  It says that it&#x27;s great for removing waterproof mascara.  Well... my mascara wasn&#x27;t waterproof but my eyeliner was.  And it was HELL to get off.  This time, I really don&#x27;t think it had anything to do with the fact that I had never used it before.  It&#x27;s hard to wipe off makeup in a wrong way.  Seriously.  You put on the remover crap and wipe your eye with it.  Not only did I have to wipe an insane amount of times but it smeared everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m definitely going to give this one more try but as for the first attempt, I have to say I&#x27;m not a fan.  Like I said, I&#x27;m going to try it one more time and see if it gets a little better.  I definitely wouldn&#x27;t have purchased this for myself but it will get used.  In the future though, I think I&#x27;m going to stick to my coconut oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years, it is super gentle and does remove makeup. Just one word on all the negative reviews: what burns your eyes is your makeup, not this makeup remover. Removes makeup perfectly and gentle enough for sensitive, skin, prone to irritation, just like mine. Never had a problem with it. I don&#x27;t use waterproof makeup however, because that irritates and burns my skin, so I can not guarantee any results with this product.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes so this is perfect-it&#x27;s refreshing and gets off tough eyeliner and mascara. I love that its only 5 dollars and works better than more expensive brands and it&#x27;s oil free!</li>
            <li> In my opinion, this is as good as the Mary Kay eye makeup remover, but cheaper.  It&#x27;s non-oily and effective.</li>
            <li> Just discovered this recently product and found it is most effective.&lt;br /&gt;I love love it.  One of my favorite product now.  I recommend it to&lt;br /&gt;all my sisters and girlfriends.  Price is good and product is awesome.</li>
            <li> I recieved this product for free to try and review. Overall, I am pleased. It easily removed my eye cosmetics and my eyes did not feel any pain during or afterwards. I like it.</li>
            <li> I first found this make-up remover about 2 years ago. I love it. Having had cataract surgery in both eyes this product is great because it is not greasy and it does not cling to my lens replacements</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t sting and removes make up smoothly  and i use waterproof make up and it works very well with removing it!</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Works perfectly and not oily.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT SUCKS. IT DOES NOT REMOVE MY MAKE-UP THE WAY IT SAYS IT DOES. COVERGIRL MAKE-UP REMOVER IS A MILLION TIMES BETTER THAN THIS CRAP.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and became a little distraught when I could no longer find it at my local Ulta! Glad I found it here! This really does work and it last a long time!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I am a contact wearer and this is very gentle to my eyes. This is the only eye make up remover I use. I highly recommend this product to my family &amp; friends &amp; most recently to my co-workers. This product is very hard to find in drugstores. The Target &amp; Walmart in my area can&#x27;t keep this in stock.</li>
            <li> I picked up this eye makeup remover while on Vacation in England.  It was a bit pricey but did everything I expected it to do! But here is the surprise...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros... no stinging what so ever and about HALF THE PRICE that it was in England. Certainly didn&#x27;t expect that. I have never gone back to any of my old eye makeup removers and have saved a ton as a result!  And the bottle lasts forever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons... can&#x27;t think of a single one!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years, is the only stuff I will use. It gets the makeup off. You only need a little to do the job and if you get it in  your eyes it doesn&#x27;t hurt. No grease left over on your skin.</li>
            <li> There is no scent to this and it&#x27;s definitely gentle. It didn&#x27;t cause any sensitivity issues, was non-oily/greasy, and even left my skin feeling refreshed and moisturized. I was able to get most of the makeup off both of my eyes using one cotton pad. The only thing was that it didn&#x27;t do a good job of removing its own brand eyeliner! I had a really tough time removing the eyeliner I got from them but a different eye makeup remover cleaned it up quickly. So it&#x27;s better for light, non-waterproof eye makeup.  I received this product free via Influenster to try, review, and supply my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Left my face very oily and it did not take off my makeup. I was very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for: gentle yet effective and leaves no oily residue. I&#x27;ve used oil-based removers that are very good, but they leave a film and can cause zits around my eyes. Ones that aren&#x27;t oil-based simply have not worked as well. This combines the best of both worlds and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> My first impression of this product was positive, since it seemed to do a good job removing eye makeup. Then, about two weeks after I started using it, I suddenly developed allergic contact dermatitis on my eyelids. (It&#x27;s a very painful — and hideous — red, scaly rash. For Game of Thrones fans: it looks like greyscale, only bright red.) The culprit was a chemical called methylisothiazolinone, which is a preservative used in this product. My doctor&#x27;s advice is to run far, far away from any product containing methylisothiazolinone. It&#x27;s notorious for causing dermatitis, and it won the dubious distinction of being named the &amp;#34;allergen of the year&amp;#34; by a dermatologists&#x27; group. Beware!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand remover for a couple years now, IMO it&#x27;s comparable to Clinique&#x27;s liquid remover. I use waterproof mascara, Mac paints, heavy primer and it removes it all. I put a good amount on a cotton ball and press it against each eye for a few seconds before rubbing the makeup off in short strokes. Thats what works for me to remove heavily layered eye makeup. I&#x27;m assuming the reviews saying it doesn&#x27;t work well are people who use those round cotton disks to remove their makeup...I&#x27;ve never had luck with those, they tug on the skin around my eyes and make it a lot of work to remove eye makeup. If you try this product I suggest using cotton balls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price on this listing is about the same as the drug store price, but the shipping charge here makes it cost double. Try looking for it in-store, it&#x27;s often packaged with a free eyeliner or mascara also.</li>
            <li> One of the best eye make up removers I&#x27;ve used.Bottle is almost twice as big as the other removers. Gets rid of all traces of makeup without rubbing the skin off my eyelids and/or without making my eyes red. Unfortunately price has doubled on Amazon, so I will have to get it from a drugstore now.</li>
            <li> I bought this makeup remover from Walgreens a while back and my grand daughter used it.  After she ran out she tried some other high price brands and said her eyes felt like it was burning.  She loves this makeup remover, she said it does burn her eyes and yet removes all traces of mascara.  Will buy again since I can&#x27;t seem to find it anywhere else.</li>
            <li> Have you ever thought to yourself &amp;#34;Hey, I&#x27;d like my eyes to burn like gonorrhea and have makeup smeared everywhere!&amp;#34; then THIS is the product for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My eyes are still watering as I type this and it has been ~5 minutes since I applied this abomination to my face. There is nothing about this product that leads me to believe it is better than soap and water. In fact, I&#x27;m fairly convinced it is just pre-mixed soap and water (quite possibly the most abrasive soap and contaminated water they could combine... I&#x27;m actually contemplating going to the hospital)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you wear high quality makeup DO NOT buy this. It will only disappoint you and possibly leave you blind - I will update later; possibly in braille.</li>
            <li> I can not use an oil based makeup remover because I wear contact lenses. This fills the bill, and also causes no irritation.</li>
            <li> The Rimmel Eye Makeup Remover is a great product. Inexpensive, works great, and does not irritate my sensitive eyes. I recommend it!</li>
            <li> I used this product for the very first time last night and was extremely disappointed with it. It did everything it says except remove my waterproof makeup, even though it says right on the bottle it removes waterproof mascara. I usually love Rimmel&#x27;s products but this one was very disappointing! I actually hated how poorly this worked. I thought I could trust that this would be as good as all the other products they have but it was NOT. When I tried to remove my makeup with this, it stung! I needed to be really careful to not to get it in my eye but I did and it stung! It was hard to remove my makeup with this and it only actually smudged my mascara and eyeliner but really just pushed it around. I needed to scrub it off with face wash in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> Product works well on water-proof mascara with a little rubbing. Does the same on lasting color lipstick. Its not oily and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> There are three women in my household wearing different make-up and all needing a eye make-up remover. We have all agreed that this is an outstanding product....if you can find it. We are Walgreen&#x27;s customers and occassionally Rite-Aid. They no longer stock this eye makeup remover. I was very happy to find it here. Price is comparable to what I had been paying in the store.</li>
            <li> Great product and does not burn my eyes</li>
            <li> I love to buy stuff on Amazon because it&#x27;s convenient and normally I get a good deal. But I&#x27;m wondering why this is $13 when I can buy it at Walmart for like $5 or $6?! Love this product and I&#x27;ve been using it for years. It doesn&#x27;t sting like other makeup removers but it works, and I love that it&#x27;s oil free and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a long time. They&#x27;ve discontinued it in the stores so i was super excited that i found it on amazon. it is not oily at all and cleans all makeup right off. I use it on qtips to even out unruly eyeliner and clean up any smudges and mistakes. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s so great. it doesn&#x27;t smear. it just wipes whatever bit you want, right off.</li>
            <li> Disclosure: I received this item free from Influenster to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product arrived at the perfect time for me. I usually wear a liquid liner and mascara, sometimes waterproof. I confess I hadn&#x27;t used a proper eye makeup remover in months. Baby oil or coconut oil was my go to. I loved the feel of the Rimmel remover, it wasn&#x27;t greasy or oily. It also did a great job of removing eye makeup. However, it did something nasty to the skin around my eyes. It became red, overly dried, and started to peel. I used it for about a week and then had to go back to my old ways to heal my skin. Bummer.  #Rimmel #FrostyVoxBox #Influenster</li>
            <li> This is my favorite eye makeup remover. I wear waterproof eyeliner and mascara and this product removes them both easily. I normally don&#x27;t like Rimmel London products but this one is fantastic. Most products i get from Rimmel London either don&#x27;t work or live up to the claims on the packaging, but this one did! I am so happy!!! This is the first eye makeup remover i have bought that removes waterproof makeup. This product also does not sting if it gets in your eye. I am going to buy more soon. If you try this product i guarantee that you will love it.</li>
            <li> This non-oily remover gets off even waterproof makeup without leaving any residue and without needing repeated effort.  It doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes the way some other brands do.  In the last year or so, Rimmel sent new end-aisle displays out to all our local drug stores, and they eliminated the hook/slot where the remover used to hang.  So, now I can&#x27;t find the product in stores.  I was thrilled to be able to buy it online.</li>
            <li> This product did not remove my mascara; it just smeared it.</li>
            <li> This eye makeup remover is the best I&#x27;ve ever tried.  It is a very thin liquid, not unlike water, but it still does a great job of removing even waterproof eyeliner.  It does not irritate my eyes, either, no matter how bad of a job I do, being exhausted or even intoxicated at the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other waterproof eye makeup removing products I&#x27;ve used have left an oily, shiny film on my skin, but this one does nothing of the kind.  I&#x27;ve even gone so far as to put extra remover on the same cotton ball I&#x27;d already used, and it is immediately apparent that the black makeup color diminishes from the cotton ball as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found that this does an amazing job for touchups as well.  If I put on my eyeliner a little crooked, all I need is a Q-tip and this makeup remover.  I can spot-remove the liner without making too much of a mess of my eye shadow, BB cream, or whatever else I happen to have on at the time.  The nozzle dispenser on this bottle is the perfect size for delicately coating the end of the Q-tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff so much, I keep a bottle of it in two different places of my house.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best makeup remover I have used. A lot of removers I have tried don&#x27;t work well when trying to remove gel eyeliner but this one works great and oil-free which is much better for me. You should definitely try this one out.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite of every remover I&#x27;ve ever tried. It doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes like battery acid like a lot of the others!</li>
            <li> This stuff barely takes off my eye makeup. I usually use Neutrogenas eye makeup remover for waterproof makeup in the small pink bottle, but decided to try something different. Neutrogenas completely removes all my eye makeup and doesn&#x27;t irritate the eye area or my eyeballs if it accidentaly gets in it. This stuff burns my eyeballs if it gets in it and kinda irritates my eye makeup. I would be sticking with my Neutrogena for now on.</li>
            <li> I love this eye make-up remover. I have been using this product for a good ten years. It works well even when taking off waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li> It does the job it is supposed to do very well.</li>
            <li> This stuff is good at cleaning my dashboard. It&#x27;s not thick and sticky like Armor All. Or smell as oddly as Turtle wax.</li>
            <li> I brought this for my daughter and myself. I mainly brought it because of the reviews. Well I am very pleased with this product. its easy on the eyes, not greasy at all. I would totally recommended to those looking for a good make up eye remover, and good on price.</li>
