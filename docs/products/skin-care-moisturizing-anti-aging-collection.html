    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I have fickle skin, and found the best strategy was to use the Ellen Tracy Night Time moisturizer every-other night.</li>
            <li>I am very impressed with the quality of this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>This is an EXCELLENT product!  </li>
            <li>I have oily skin so this would be perfect for me.</li>
            <li>I pile this on under my eyes and for that area, this is perfect.</li>
            <li>I began using this product as soon as it came, but I just wasn&#x27;t that impressed.</li>
            <li>This one does just that and perfectly.  </li>
            <li>While this isn&#x27;t the very best moisturizer I&#x27;ve used, I consider it very good for the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very nice night moisturizer.</li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant.</li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant, not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I thought it wasn&#x27;t going to be good at moisturizing</li>
            <li>But to be fair, I have tried lots of face creams and</li>
            <li>This moisturizer did a fairly good job</li>
            <li>(a good thing, since it&#x27;s a night time moisturizer),</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be using this product again but besides the rash it seemed to feel good on or work as a moisturizer</li>
            <li>A nice product at a nice price!</li>
            <li>I was really VERY pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I liked the feel of it, the smell of it and it would probably work good as a moisturizer</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light, pleasant</li>
            <li>I like the very light pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>I would have liked either no scent or a  more pleasant one, so one star off for that.</li>
            <li>The texture of the cream is nice, and I did not notice an overpowering smell.  </li>
            <li>I probably would&#x27;ve given five stars, as this is a fairly nice</li>
            <li>did receive it in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li>The packaging is very elegant, as is the bottle with its gold top and frosted jar.  </li>
            <li>I think this would work best in the summer on normal to oily skin types.</li>
            <li>like the scent of this cream, it is light and pleasant when you are putting it on, then I don&#x27;t smell it after that.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this product, because it looked like it would be really nice!</li>
            <li>I loved how silky smooth this gel-like cream felt.</li>
            <li>This is the first moisturizer that seems to combine both the serum and the moisturizer in one which makes it a great value.  </li>
            <li>This moisturizer has the consistency of a gel and is very light.</li>
            <li>I love it and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This makes an excellent daytime treatment for me, acting almost like an astringent that I put on after I</li>
            <li>/&gt;The directions say to use this after Ellen Tracy serum, which I was not offered for review, so maybe there would have been better effects with that also?</li>
            <li>Its consistency is that of a gel more so than a cream.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t rave, but I wouldn&#x27;t make efforts to stop people from purchasing it. :)</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I do like my retinol A cream during most days to fight aging, but I really love how this soaks into my face and plumps it up.</li>
            <li>However, this being winter, even my skin craves something a bit more creamy to counteract the dryness of the season.</li>
            <li>but in fact is more a gel consistency, and I can&#x27;t say that I mind it.  </li>
            <li>I almost always use a serum before I moisturize - it seems to help the moisturizer soak into my skin better.  </li>
            <li>This moisturizer didn&#x27;t work any better than the Wal-Mart brand nighttime moisturizer I had been using before it came.</li>
            <li>there is no scent to it which is ok</li>
            <li>so I am picky about what I use, but was happy to try something new.</li>
            <li>and I notice a difference in the fine lines on my face, plus the gel feels refreshing.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this lovely looking cream</li>
            <li>I also did not care for the rather strong smell.  </li>
            <li>It feels cool, comforting and not too overwhelming.</li>
            <li>It is very gentle on the skin and in addition to taking good sun buster precautions (sunscreen and hats), it will keep your skin supple and fresh.  </li>
            <li>It does seem to be a fine product, so I&#x27;ve rated it accordingly.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is inoffensive and light, too.</li>
            <li>But for the cheeks, it goes on too light even for my skin type.</li>
            <li>I would think, if you don&#x27;t like it, it would be because it&#x27;s too light and not from any adverse effects.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes in elegant packaging in a frosted glass jar with a golden lid.</li>
            <li>i doubt it will be any better but worth a try.</li>
            <li>The solution feels very fresh and inviting, not greasy like some moisturizers can be.</li>
            <li>packaging is beautiful and love the little glass jar.  </li>
            <li>but it has a unique sealant-type effect.</li>
            <li>I was already familiar with the product which works well.  </li>
            <li>The moisturizer is absorbed into the skin very quickly and does not make my skin oilier.</li>
            <li>In any case, since I didn&#x27;t have this &amp;#34;first item&amp;#34; to apply, I just washed my face, making sure it was nice and clean (and dry), and then I&#x27;d apply this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m enjoying using it so much</li>
            <li>The label of cream - which is more of a gel - proclaims it was \\&quot;designed using intense moisturizing formulas . . .\\&quot;</li>
            <li>It glides on smoothly over your face and you wake up dewy faced and looking fresh.  </li>
            <li>dry skin of a post menopause woman (52 year old), not so perfect.</li>
            <li>Once it&#x27;s on your face, it absorbs quickly and there&#x27;s no greasy consistency or appearance leftover.  </li>
            <li>It soaks in almost instantly and left my skin feeling wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I do feel there are better choices that last longer and have a greater range of moisturization.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t sting or irritate; reasonably-priced.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very sensitive to smells, so I love how mild it is.  </li>
            <li>but sadly it’s performance wasn’t as impressive as it’s cool texture and very interesting masculine ocean like smell.</li>
            <li>There is no overwhelming perfume or otherwise smell to it, which is good because you would smell it all night!</li>
            <li>This lotion goes on without feeling greasy and has a crisp, clean scent.</li>
            <li>It goes on really smoothly and makes my face feel like it is really working.  </li>
            <li>, I still apply two small layers but it leaves me skin beautifully hydrated and not oily.</li>
            <li>I applied it to my face and it was quickly absorbed by my skin, with no greasy residues whatsoever.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer has the texture of a hair gel, but goes on easily and absorbs quickly, leaving my skin completely grease-free and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I noticed right away there is no perfume smell to this lotion which was a plus for me.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually the first moisturizer I have ever used where my skin is still nice when I wake up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It has a fairly strong generic flowery scent, which (fortunately) fades away.</li>
            <li>Many lotions and creams make my skin break out after a few days, but I am pleased to say this one had no such effect: just smooth, silky skin that smells clean and feels hydrated.</li>
            <li>I very highly recommend this cream!</li>
            <li>:)ry time I DID use it, there was some kind of subtle effect on my face.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using Ellen Tracy products, and I used the night time moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I definitely recommend investing in a better product than this one.</li>
            <li>I love it and can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough!</li>
            <li>The night time moisturizer is more of a gel then a cream, very similar to Clinique&#x27;s Moisture Surge.</li>
            <li>I currently have another cream that works better for my skin.</li>
            <li>I Can&#x27;t pinpoint exactly what in caused it</li>
            <li>It also has a nice, clean scent that is NEVER overwhelming.</li>
            <li>The ingredients list indicates that there&#x27;s no real comodogenic inclusions, which makes it a good choice for others with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Now, my face is more of a medium-sized - largish size, and I remember that I only really needed about the size a of a dime dollop to cover my face and jawline.</li>
            <li>While its price is not outrageous as these products run, I probably would choose a lower-priced product to use over the long term.  </li>
            <li>The price is pretty reasonable for this sort or product with a brand name.</li>
            <li>Although this cream hydrates fairly well when I first put it on, it doesn&#x27;t seem to last through the night and by morning my skin feels slightly dry.</li>
            <li>and so my skin is much drier than it used to be.  </li>
            <li>Also, you really can feel your face tightening as your apply the lotion.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>so much I&#x27;m going to try to find the Ellen Tracy eye cream to try out as well.</li>
            <li>In any case, it seems like a reasonable product for the price.</li>
            <li>I guess I will have to get it here on Amazon since it is really reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>This is a reasonably priced moisturizer for nightly use.  </li>
            <li>When I wake up in the morning my face really is refreshed looking, moisture drenched.  </li>
            <li>My Wal-Mart brand product is so much cheaper than this kind, so I couldn&#x27;t justify purchasing this expensive product when it doesn&#x27;t work any better than the cheaper version.</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>It soaks in nicely within a few minutes.</li>
            <li>This cream is more of a smooth, thick, gel.  </li>
            <li>normally have combination skin, large pores</li>
            <li>The lotion itself is light, soft and creamy, it goes on smooth and does not feel heavy.  </li>
            <li>This cream has an odd consistency -- it feels quite watery and is more of a gel.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin and even with the light fragrance (usually a big clue that my skin will turn red)</li>
            <li>My final verdict on this product is that it is only okay.</li>
            <li>If money is no object to you, then go ahead and buy this product, because it is a decent moisturizer.</li>
            <li>and I did notice the moisture content of my face was high in the mornings.</li>
            <li>The Ellen Tracy moisturizer is relatively light, and will not be suitable for very dry skin; it&#x27;s almost a gel, and while it absorbs quickly into the skin, doesn&#x27;t provide dramatic moisturizing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Rather than being a typical creamy moisturizer, this night moisturizer has an almost gel-like consistency which makes it feel like it soaks into my skin faster and more completely than a</li>
            <li>The key is to use the serum first (I use the deep wrinkle one), let that dry, then use either the day moisturizer during the day or the night moisturizer during the night on top of the serum.</li>
            <li>Tracy\\&quot; cosmetics and was eager to try this new nighttime hydrating</li>
            <li>I really like the replenishing moisturizer done by the Simple line of products, and the generic version done by Wal-Mart also works really well!I&#x27;m willing to spend a little extra money on makeup that is obviously of a very high quality, such as many Clinique products, but this moisturizer doesn&#x27;t seem worth the splurge to me.</li>
            <li>this/my facial skin does not require this product as much as others might, but I am, as a whole, rather neutral as to whether or not to recommend this product.</li>
            <li>this/my facial skin does not require this product as much as others might, but I am, as a whole, rather neutral as to whether or not to recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I am not entirely sure how moisturizing it is -- it feels like the layer of gel is staying on top of my skin rather than sinking into it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It definitely lasts through the night, as you are aware of its presence when washing in the morning.  </li>
            <li>the serum/moisturizer has smoothed out a few fine lines.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft and nourished.  </li>
            <li>My skin is still sensitive</li>
            <li>but if you have sensitive skin I would avoid it.</li>
            <li>Avoid if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>far this goes.</li>
            <li>I was surprised, too, at the...&amp;#34;cooling&amp;#34; effect this gel-cream has.</li>
            <li>It feels soft on your fingers.  </li>
            <li>really like the way this moisturizer feels and works - it&#x27;s changed what I will look for in a moisturizer in the future.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised at its consistency - it is like a gel</li>
            <li>only because I spent money on it i will use it one more time but in a very very tiny quantity and see how it works.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tested some fairly expensive creams and serums, and this Ellen Tracy Night Time Moisturizer honestly works just as well for me as products that cost 5 times as much.  </li>
            <li>I remember that even though there seemed to be a heavy-ish kind of moisture on my face, that &amp;#34;wetness&amp;#34;/&amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; feeling didn&#x27;t last long and soon after, my face felt slightly</li>
            <li>I’ve had better results with other night time moisturizers but they were certainly more expensive than this one.  </li>
            <li>this will be more beneficial but if its winter and you need a serious moisturizer skip it, I have since purchased Perricone MD Face Finishing Moisturizer</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any profound transformative effects on my skin, but it did the job.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a good nighttime moisturizer, because my skin is really dry and flaky from all the wind and cold weather going on right now.</li>
            <li>I normally buy high-end brands, and this one definitely competes with them.  </li>
            <li>Nonetheless, I must say that &amp;#34;a little bit goes a long way&amp;#34; is a very MILD way of describing how...</li>
            <li>If I hadn&#x27;t used other creams that work a little better for me</li>
            <li>I have been using it regularly for 10 days without the recommended Ellen Tracy serum, and my skin feels so soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>In fact, product offers no long lasting hydrating properties whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>I am a 56 year old with dry skin and live in a dry climate.</li>
            <li>It is also light enough to wear during the day when the weather sucks all of the moisture out of your skin and you need something extra.  </li>
            <li>The consistency is closer to a gel than a cream, and I do put it on pretty heavily.</li>
            <li>The brand Ellen Tracy is basically marketed to the middle aged (or older) woman.  </li>
            <li>, I noticed that while there was no HUGE change, every time I DID use it, there was some kind of subtle effect on my face.</li>
            <li>for an individual, such as myself, who seems to be...&amp;#34;plagued&amp;#34; with skin issues galore, I was hesitant to try this product - especially since [as it appears to be from the description I read] is part of a &amp;#34;series&amp;#34; of facial applications by this line of product....or, at least, according to the directions, it&#x27;s supposed to be applied after some other kind of facial cleanser</li>
            <li>And a large amount of people in this group (this reviewer included) have dry or very dry skin.  </li>

            <li> It is very gentle on the skin and in addition to taking good sun buster precautions (sunscreen and hats), it will keep your skin supple and fresh.  </li>
            <li> It does seem to be a fine product, so I&#x27;ve rated it accordingly.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is inoffensive and light, too.</li>
            <li> But for the cheeks, it goes on too light even for my skin type.</li>
            <li> I would think, if you don&#x27;t like it, it would be because it&#x27;s too light and not from any adverse effects.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes in elegant packaging in a frosted glass jar with a golden lid.</li>
            <li> i doubt it will be any better but worth a try.</li>
            <li> The solution feels very fresh and inviting, not greasy like some moisturizers can be.</li>
            <li> packaging is beautiful and love the little glass jar.  </li>
            <li> but it has a unique sealant-type effect.</li>
            <li> I was already familiar with the product which works well.  </li>
            <li> The moisturizer is absorbed into the skin very quickly and does not make my skin oilier.</li>
            <li> In any case, since I didn&#x27;t have this &amp;#34;first item&amp;#34; to apply, I just washed my face, making sure it was nice and clean (and dry), and then I&#x27;d apply this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m enjoying using it so much</li>
            <li> The label of cream - which is more of a gel - proclaims it was \\&quot;designed using intense moisturizing formulas . . .\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It glides on smoothly over your face and you wake up dewy faced and looking fresh.  </li>
            <li> dry skin of a post menopause woman (52 year old), not so perfect.</li>
            <li> Once it&#x27;s on your face, it absorbs quickly and there&#x27;s no greasy consistency or appearance leftover.  </li>
            <li> It soaks in almost instantly and left my skin feeling wonderful.  </li>
            <li> I do feel there are better choices that last longer and have a greater range of moisturization.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t sting or irritate; reasonably-priced.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sensitive to smells, so I love how mild it is.  </li>
            <li> but sadly it’s performance wasn’t as impressive as it’s cool texture and very interesting masculine ocean like smell.</li>
            <li> There is no overwhelming perfume or otherwise smell to it, which is good because you would smell it all night!</li>
            <li> This lotion goes on without feeling greasy and has a crisp, clean scent.</li>
            <li> It goes on really smoothly and makes my face feel like it is really working.  </li>
            <li> , I still apply two small layers but it leaves me skin beautifully hydrated and not oily.</li>
            <li> I applied it to my face and it was quickly absorbed by my skin, with no greasy residues whatsoever.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer has the texture of a hair gel, but goes on easily and absorbs quickly, leaving my skin completely grease-free and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I noticed right away there is no perfume smell to this lotion which was a plus for me.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually the first moisturizer I have ever used where my skin is still nice when I wake up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It has a fairly strong generic flowery scent, which (fortunately) fades away.</li>
            <li> Many lotions and creams make my skin break out after a few days, but I am pleased to say this one had no such effect: just smooth, silky skin that smells clean and feels hydrated.</li>
            <li> I very highly recommend this cream!</li>
            <li> :)ry time I DID use it, there was some kind of subtle effect on my face.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using Ellen Tracy products, and I used the night time moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I definitely recommend investing in a better product than this one.</li>
            <li> I love it and can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough!</li>
            <li> The night time moisturizer is more of a gel then a cream, very similar to Clinique&#x27;s Moisture Surge.</li>
            <li> I currently have another cream that works better for my skin.</li>
            <li> I Can&#x27;t pinpoint exactly what in caused it</li>
            <li> It also has a nice, clean scent that is NEVER overwhelming.</li>
            <li> The ingredients list indicates that there&#x27;s no real comodogenic inclusions, which makes it a good choice for others with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Now, my face is more of a medium-sized - largish size, and I remember that I only really needed about the size a of a dime dollop to cover my face and jawline.</li>
            <li> While its price is not outrageous as these products run, I probably would choose a lower-priced product to use over the long term.  </li>
            <li> The price is pretty reasonable for this sort or product with a brand name.</li>
            <li> Although this cream hydrates fairly well when I first put it on, it doesn&#x27;t seem to last through the night and by morning my skin feels slightly dry.</li>
            <li> and so my skin is much drier than it used to be.  </li>
            <li> Also, you really can feel your face tightening as your apply the lotion.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> so much I&#x27;m going to try to find the Ellen Tracy eye cream to try out as well.</li>
            <li> In any case, it seems like a reasonable product for the price.</li>
            <li> I guess I will have to get it here on Amazon since it is really reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> This is a reasonably priced moisturizer for nightly use.  </li>
            <li> When I wake up in the morning my face really is refreshed looking, moisture drenched.  </li>
            <li> My Wal-Mart brand product is so much cheaper than this kind, so I couldn&#x27;t justify purchasing this expensive product when it doesn&#x27;t work any better than the cheaper version.</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> It soaks in nicely within a few minutes.</li>
            <li> This cream is more of a smooth, thick, gel.  </li>
            <li> normally have combination skin, large pores</li>
            <li> The lotion itself is light, soft and creamy, it goes on smooth and does not feel heavy.  </li>
            <li> This cream has an odd consistency -- it feels quite watery and is more of a gel.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin and even with the light fragrance (usually a big clue that my skin will turn red)</li>
            <li> My final verdict on this product is that it is only okay.</li>
            <li> If money is no object to you, then go ahead and buy this product, because it is a decent moisturizer.</li>
            <li> and I did notice the moisture content of my face was high in the mornings.</li>
            <li> The Ellen Tracy moisturizer is relatively light, and will not be suitable for very dry skin; it&#x27;s almost a gel, and while it absorbs quickly into the skin, doesn&#x27;t provide dramatic moisturizing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Rather than being a typical creamy moisturizer, this night moisturizer has an almost gel-like consistency which makes it feel like it soaks into my skin faster and more completely than a</li>
            <li> The key is to use the serum first (I use the deep wrinkle one), let that dry, then use either the day moisturizer during the day or the night moisturizer during the night on top of the serum.</li>
            <li> Tracy\\&quot; cosmetics and was eager to try this new nighttime hydrating</li>
            <li> I really like the replenishing moisturizer done by the Simple line of products, and the generic version done by Wal-Mart also works really well!I&#x27;m willing to spend a little extra money on makeup that is obviously of a very high quality, such as many Clinique products, but this moisturizer doesn&#x27;t seem worth the splurge to me.</li>
            <li> this/my facial skin does not require this product as much as others might, but I am, as a whole, rather neutral as to whether or not to recommend this product.</li>
            <li> this/my facial skin does not require this product as much as others might, but I am, as a whole, rather neutral as to whether or not to recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am not entirely sure how moisturizing it is -- it feels like the layer of gel is staying on top of my skin rather than sinking into it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It definitely lasts through the night, as you are aware of its presence when washing in the morning.  </li>
            <li> the serum/moisturizer has smoothed out a few fine lines.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin soft and nourished.  </li>
            <li> My skin is still sensitive</li>
            <li> but if you have sensitive skin I would avoid it.</li>
            <li> Avoid if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> far this goes.</li>
            <li> I was surprised, too, at the...&amp;#34;cooling&amp;#34; effect this gel-cream has.</li>
            <li> It feels soft on your fingers.  </li>
            <li> really like the way this moisturizer feels and works - it&#x27;s changed what I will look for in a moisturizer in the future.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised at its consistency - it is like a gel</li>
            <li> only because I spent money on it i will use it one more time but in a very very tiny quantity and see how it works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tested some fairly expensive creams and serums, and this Ellen Tracy Night Time Moisturizer honestly works just as well for me as products that cost 5 times as much.  </li>
            <li> I remember that even though there seemed to be a heavy-ish kind of moisture on my face, that &amp;#34;wetness&amp;#34;/&amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; feeling didn&#x27;t last long and soon after, my face felt slightly</li>
            <li> I’ve had better results with other night time moisturizers but they were certainly more expensive than this one.  </li>
            <li> this will be more beneficial but if its winter and you need a serious moisturizer skip it, I have since purchased Perricone MD Face Finishing Moisturizer</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any profound transformative effects on my skin, but it did the job.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good nighttime moisturizer, because my skin is really dry and flaky from all the wind and cold weather going on right now.</li>
            <li> I normally buy high-end brands, and this one definitely competes with them.  </li>
            <li> Nonetheless, I must say that &amp;#34;a little bit goes a long way&amp;#34; is a very MILD way of describing how...</li>
            <li> If I hadn&#x27;t used other creams that work a little better for me</li>
            <li> I have been using it regularly for 10 days without the recommended Ellen Tracy serum, and my skin feels so soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> In fact, product offers no long lasting hydrating properties whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> I am a 56 year old with dry skin and live in a dry climate.</li>
            <li> It is also light enough to wear during the day when the weather sucks all of the moisture out of your skin and you need something extra.  </li>
            <li> The consistency is closer to a gel than a cream, and I do put it on pretty heavily.</li>
            <li> The brand Ellen Tracy is basically marketed to the middle aged (or older) woman.  </li>
            <li> , I noticed that while there was no HUGE change, every time I DID use it, there was some kind of subtle effect on my face.</li>
            <li> for an individual, such as myself, who seems to be...&amp;#34;plagued&amp;#34; with skin issues galore, I was hesitant to try this product - especially since [as it appears to be from the description I read] is part of a &amp;#34;series&amp;#34; of facial applications by this line of product....or, at least, according to the directions, it&#x27;s supposed to be applied after some other kind of facial cleanser</li>
            <li> And a large amount of people in this group (this reviewer included) have dry or very dry skin.  </li>
            <li> It did keep sweat next to my skin because it couldn&#x27;t evaporate through the thin film after it dried a bit, but mostly the product stayed both shiny and sticky.  </li>
            <li> However, where the moisture surge left my skin dry and flaky by morning this Ellen Tracy does not.</li>
            <li> did try using the night moisturizer by itself and it actually seemed to dry my skin out.</li>
            <li> The amount you receive is tolerable and should last for at least a month or two depending on how much you use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So disappointed this product doesn&#x27;t live up to its claims or the promise suggested by its sophisticated packaging.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It worked well on my sensitive skin; I didn&#x27;t have any kind of bad reaction to it and found it didn&#x27;t make me break out or cause any trouble spots.</li>
            <li> The moisturizing sensation lasts all night long.  </li>
            <li> In all fairness I look forward to smoothing it on right after my tough workouts.......</li>
            <li> The moisturizer absorbs quickly and doesn’t leave skin feeling heavy or greasy, though it does feel thick.  </li>
            <li> were I do put it on in the morning because my face is dry for a morning walk or the elements</li>
            <li> I found it lessened the dry skin around my eyes and did not make me break</li>
            <li> and as I have dry skin and am 60, I have been using richer creams for my skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You only need a small quantity of this cream so this 1.77 oz glass jar will last for quite a while.</li>
            <li> For reference, I am very dry.  </li>
            <li> On a scale of 1-10 with 10 being lots of oily residue left behind and 1 being completely absorbed into the skin, I would put it at a 5; my skin doesn&#x27;t absorb it completely, but by morning it usually has and there is just a bit of oil left behind.</li>
            <li> Sadly, this didn&#x27;t really help me actually &amp;#34;use&amp;#34; it for about a week or so, until I got in a routine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;As time went on, I (sadly) didn&#x27;t do it every day - forgetting every several days - but, as a whole, even though I did forget</li>
            <li> This is not really moisturizing, maybe for someone who has oily skin</li>
            <li> I would guess, too, that it takes [roughly] two weeks to notice any &amp;#34;significant&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> My overall impression is that I probably wouldn’t go to the trouble of ordering this one again.  </li>
            <li> Those who don&#x27;t like a heavy feel would probably prefer a different brand, but this feels to me.  </li>
            <li> I look forward to trying other products in this line.</li>
            <li> I have only used Clinique lotions for the last 15 years because the Clinique acne system finally saved my skin after nothing else helped, even expensive prescriptions.</li>
            <li> So to combat dryness, one reaches for a nighttime moisturizer, which is usually an amped up version of your daily cream.  </li>
            <li> I haven’t tried any of the other skin care formulas in the Ellen Tracy line – so I don’t know about the other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is a faint smell, but it&#x27;s pretty non descript.  </li>
            <li> Ellen Tracy Nighttime Hydrating Cream seems to fulfill its promise, at least this is my experience over the short time I&#x27;ve used it.  </li>
            <li> for effectiveness, I rate this one as average.  </li>
            <li> It will banish dark circles under your eyes and make them vanish!  </li>
            <li> Since I hate facial creams with a too-strong smell, this fits very well for me.</li>
            <li> I live where it is very cold and dry, I am also in my 40&#x27;s</li>
            <li> This is a gel with a touch of creaminess in it, too drying for my drier skin, I had to apply it in layers, at least 3 to get my skin to stop feeling tight.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not entirely satisfied with the results, either.</li>
            <li> I could hardly believe how well this moisturizer works given the price.  </li>
            <li> ; however, that hardly seems to be the case.  </li>
            <li> Within seconds after application, my complexion felt tight and uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> The sad fact is this gel formulation wouldn&#x27;t even cut it for daywear, and can&#x27;t even imaging applying makeup over this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it was bad.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was so excited to try this lovely looking cream but sadly it’s performance wasn’t as impressive as it’s cool texture and very interesting masculine ocean like smell. This is a gel with a touch of creaminess in it, too drying for my drier skin, I had to apply it in layers, at least 3 to get my skin to stop feeling tight. This is not really moisturizing, maybe for someone who has oily skin this will be more beneficial but if its winter and you need a serious moisturizer skip it, I have since purchased Perricone MD Face Finishing Moisturizer and it’s a miracle product in comparison, I still apply two small layers but it leaves me skin beautifully hydrated and not oily.</li>
            <li> I have fickle skin, and found the best strategy was to use the Ellen Tracy Night Time moisturizer every-other night. On &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; nights, I use a heavier moisturizer. The Ellen Tracy moisturizer is relatively light, and will not be suitable for very dry skin; it&#x27;s almost a gel, and while it absorbs quickly into the skin, doesn&#x27;t provide dramatic moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked well on my sensitive skin; I didn&#x27;t have any kind of bad reaction to it and found it didn&#x27;t make me break out or cause any trouble spots. The ingredients list indicates that there&#x27;s no real comodogenic inclusions, which makes it a good choice for others with sensitive skin. The fragrance is inoffensive and light, too.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with the quality of this moisturizer.  I normally buy high-end brands, and this one definitely competes with them.  It leaves my skin soft and nourished.  The texture of the cream is nice, and I did not notice an overpowering smell.  It&#x27;s a very nice night moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using Ellen Tracy products, and I used the night time moisturizer.  The packaging is very elegant, as is the bottle with its gold top and frosted jar.  I noticed right away there is no perfume smell to this lotion which was a plus for me.  The lotion itself is light, soft and creamy, it goes on smooth and does not feel heavy.  I have used this at night for about a week now and notice a difference.  I live where it is very cold and dry, I am also in my 40&#x27;s and so my skin is much drier than it used to be.  This lotion has helped my skin look and feel hydrated, you can actually see a difference in my skin tone. I love it and will continue to use it. I look forward to trying other products in this line.</li>
            <li> I could hardly believe how well this moisturizer works given the price.  I&#x27;ve tested some fairly expensive creams and serums, and this Ellen Tracy Night Time Moisturizer honestly works just as well for me as products that cost 5 times as much.  I&#x27;m very sensitive to smells, so I love how mild it is.  Also, you really can feel your face tightening as your apply the lotion.  Once it&#x27;s on your face, it absorbs quickly and there&#x27;s no greasy consistency or appearance leftover.  I&#x27;m enjoying using it so much, I&#x27;m thinking about purchasing the cleanser and anti-aging serum too.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This cream has an odd consistency -- it feels quite watery and is more of a gel. I am not entirely sure how moisturizing it is -- it feels like the layer of gel is staying on top of my skin rather than sinking into it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not entirely satisfied with the results, either. I do not feel that my skin is any different than it was before, and I have switched back to using my regular products. I definitely recommend investing in a better product than this one.</li>
            <li> The consistency is gell-like instead of a lotion so I thought it wasn&#x27;t going to be good at moisturizing but it has a unique sealant-type effect. It locks in moisture and I did notice the moisture content of my face was high in the mornings. Since I hate facial creams with a too-strong smell, this fits very well for me. It&#x27;s very light, pleasant and I would buy this again!</li>
            <li> This is an EXCELLENT product!  It will banish dark circles under your eyes and make them vanish!  It is very gentle on the skin and in addition to taking good sun buster precautions (sunscreen and hats), it will keep your skin supple and fresh.  I love it and can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough!</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer. I have only used Clinique lotions for the last 15 years because the Clinique acne system finally saved my skin after nothing else helped, even expensive prescriptions. My skin is still sensitive so I am picky about what I use, but was happy to try something new. The night time moisturizer is more of a gel then a cream, very similar to Clinique&#x27;s Moisture Surge. However, where the moisture surge left my skin dry and flaky by morning this Ellen Tracy does not. It&#x27;s actually the first moisturizer I have ever used where my skin is still nice when I wake up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it so much I&#x27;m going to try to find the Ellen Tracy eye cream to try out as well.</li>
            <li> I am a 56 year old with dry skin and live in a dry climate. Although this cream hydrates fairly well when I first put it on, it doesn&#x27;t seem to last through the night and by morning my skin feels slightly dry. But to be fair, I have tried lots of face creams and only a couple of them have given me the moisture I need to last through the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the scent of this cream, it is light and pleasant when you are putting it on, then I don&#x27;t smell it after that. The consistency is closer to a gel than a cream, and I do put it on pretty heavily. It soaks in nicely within a few minutes. If I hadn&#x27;t used other creams that work a little better for me I probably would&#x27;ve given five stars, as this is a fairly nice cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive it in exchange for my honest review. I like it and will use it up, but when it&#x27;s gone I will not buy it. I currently have another cream that works better for my skin.</li>
            <li> dry skin of a post menopause woman (52 year old), not so perfect. At my age I am looking for a cream that moisturizes. This makes an excellent daytime treatment for me, acting almost like an astringent that I put on after I shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The list of ingredients would have told me so if I had read them before ordering: Water, Glycerin, cyclomethicone, Betaine, Butylene Glycol, Cyclopentasiloxane/Dimethicone, Polyacrylamide/Laureth-7/C13-14 Isoparaffin,Niacinamide,Beta-Glucan, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Panthenol, Hydroxyethylcellulose, Allantoin, Diazoldinyl Urea/Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Perfume</li>
            <li> This moisturizer did a fairly good job and I would consider purchasing it again. The breakdown: 1) On a scale of 1-10 with 10 being the heaviest and 1 being the lightest I would put this moisturizer at a 6 or 7; it&#x27;s got some weight to it (a good thing, since it&#x27;s a night time moisturizer), but it&#x27;s not daunting. On a scale of 1-10 with 10 being lots of oily residue left behind and 1 being completely absorbed into the skin, I would put it at a 5; my skin doesn&#x27;t absorb it completely, but by morning it usually has and there is just a bit of oil left behind. The scent is pleasant.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer has the texture of a hair gel, but goes on easily and absorbs quickly, leaving my skin completely grease-free and moisturized. I could see using this any time, not just at night. It has a fairly strong generic flowery scent, which (fortunately) fades away. I didn&#x27;t notice any profound transformative effects on my skin, but it did the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions say to use this after Ellen Tracy serum, which I was not offered for review, so maybe there would have been better effects with that also? In any case, it seems like a reasonable product for the price. I would have liked either no scent or a  more pleasant one, so one star off for that.</li>
            <li> While this isn&#x27;t the very best moisturizer I&#x27;ve used, I consider it very good for the price. The key is to use the serum first (I use the deep wrinkle one), let that dry, then use either the day moisturizer during the day or the night moisturizer during the night on top of the serum. I&#x27;ve used it for about a week and the serum/moisturizer has smoothed out a few fine lines. The plus for me is that it doesn&#x27;t have a scent and doesn&#x27;t make my overly-sensitive skin break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did try using the night moisturizer by itself and it actually seemed to dry my skin out. Not a problem when using the serum underneath.</li>
            <li> The brand Ellen Tracy is basically marketed to the middle aged (or older) woman.  Am that.  And a large amount of people in this group (this reviewer included) have dry or very dry skin.  For reference, I am very dry.  So to combat dryness, one reaches for a nighttime moisturizer, which is usually an amped up version of your daily cream.  The label of cream - which is more of a gel - proclaims it was \\&quot;designed using intense moisturizing formulas . . .\\&quot;; however, that hardly seems to be the case.  In fact, product offers no long lasting hydrating properties whatsoever.  Within seconds after application, my complexion felt tight and uncomfortable.  The sad fact is this gel formulation wouldn&#x27;t even cut it for daywear, and can&#x27;t even imaging applying makeup over this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is beautiful and love the little glass jar.  So disappointed this product doesn&#x27;t live up to its claims or the promise suggested by its sophisticated packaging.</li>
            <li> I loved how silky smooth this gel-like cream felt. It soaks in almost instantly and left my skin feeling wonderful.  It is also light enough to wear during the day when the weather sucks all of the moisture out of your skin and you need something extra.  I have super sensitive skin and even with the light fragrance (usually a big clue that my skin will turn red), it was actually quite soothing.  I would continue to buy this one just for use during the day.  I haven&#x27;t seen it at any stores, so I guess I will have to get it here on Amazon since it is really reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Whatever is in this product caused me to break out in a rash. Used it on the neck, around areas of the face and had an allergic reaction everytime I used it. I liked the feel of it, the smell of it and it would probably work good as a moisturizer but if you have sensitive skin I would avoid it. I Can&#x27;t pinpoint exactly what in caused it but it was bad. I won&#x27;t be using this product again but besides the rash it seemed to feel good on or work as a moisturizer but I won&#x27;t put it on my face again. Avoid if you have sensitive skin. 2 stars.</li>
            <li> Ellen Tracy Nighttime Hydrating Cream seems to fulfill its promise, at least this is my experience over the short time I&#x27;ve used it.  Its consistency is that of a gel more so than a cream.  It definitely lasts through the night, as you are aware of its presence when washing in the morning.  While its price is not outrageous as these products run, I probably would choose a lower-priced product to use over the long term.  It does seem to be a fine product, so I&#x27;ve rated it accordingly.</li>
            <li> So....originally, upon receiving this in the mail I set it &amp;#34;aside&amp;#34;/in a place where I knew I would see it and then use it. Sadly, this didn&#x27;t really help me actually &amp;#34;use&amp;#34; it for about a week or so, until I got in a routine. I think that this is truly the manner in which to see the effectiveness (if any) for this product. I would guess, too, that it takes [roughly] two weeks to notice any &amp;#34;significant&amp;#34; improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for an individual, such as myself, who seems to be...&amp;#34;plagued&amp;#34; with skin issues galore, I was hesitant to try this product - especially since [as it appears to be from the description I read] is part of a &amp;#34;series&amp;#34; of facial applications by this line of product....or, at least, according to the directions, it&#x27;s supposed to be applied after some other kind of facial cleanser (but nothing was indicated that something was to follow). In any case, since I didn&#x27;t have this &amp;#34;first item&amp;#34; to apply, I just washed my face, making sure it was nice and clean (and dry), and then I&#x27;d apply this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would describe the texture as a cross between a gel and a cream. It has the density of a cream, but the feel and....well, when you put it on, it has the feel of a gel. Nonetheless, I must say that &amp;#34;a little bit goes a long way&amp;#34; is a very MILD way of describing how...far this goes. Now, my face is more of a medium-sized - largish size, and I remember that I only really needed about the size a of a dime dollop to cover my face and jawline. I was surprised, too, at the...&amp;#34;cooling&amp;#34; effect this gel-cream has. I remember that even though there seemed to be a heavy-ish kind of moisture on my face, that &amp;#34;wetness&amp;#34;/&amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; feeling didn&#x27;t last long and soon after, my face felt slightly softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As time went on, I (sadly) didn&#x27;t do it every day - forgetting every several days - but, as a whole, even though I did forget, I noticed that while there was no HUGE change, every time I DID use it, there was some kind of subtle effect on my face. However, I will say this: it could be that I maybe don&#x27;t &amp;#34;need&amp;#34; this/my facial skin does not require this product as much as others might, but I am, as a whole, rather neutral as to whether or not to recommend this product. I wouldn&#x27;t rave, but I wouldn&#x27;t make efforts to stop people from purchasing it. :)ry time I DID use it, there was some kind of subtle effect on my face.

            <li> My review is for the Ellen Tracy Night Moisturizer (label shows P.M. Moisturizer).  This is a reasonably priced moisturizer for nightly use.  The moisturizer absorbs quickly and doesn’t leave skin feeling heavy or greasy, though it does feel thick.  The scent is pleasant, not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for effectiveness, I rate this one as average.  I’ve had better results with other night time moisturizers but they were certainly more expensive than this one.  My overall impression is that I probably wouldn’t go to the trouble of ordering this one again.  I haven’t tried any of the other skin care formulas in the Ellen Tracy line – so I don’t know about the other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall – this does have a temporary moisturizing effect and doesn’t leave skin greasy.  I do feel there are better choices that last longer and have a greater range of moisturization.</li>
            <li> Love it.  This cream is more of a smooth, thick, gel.  It feels soft on your fingers.  It glides on smoothly over your face and you wake up dewy faced and looking fresh.  I love this stuff.  In all fairness I look forward to smoothing it on right after my tough workouts.......it feels like such a treat.  There is a faint smell, but it&#x27;s pretty non descript.  When I wake up in the morning my face really is refreshed looking, moisture drenched.  I admit there are some days were I do put it on in the morning because my face is dry for a morning walk or the elements and I know it will be taking a beating through the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally have combination skin, large pores and I am prone to breakouts.  I have not noticed any additional blocked pores or breakouts since I started using Ellen Tracy night cream. I do like my retinol A cream during most days to fight aging, but I really love how this soaks into my face and plumps it up.</li>
            <li> 3.5 Stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel like texture of this moisturizer means it&#x27;s not greasy or oily when applied to the skin. I have oily skin so this would be perfect for me. However, this being winter, even my skin craves something a bit more creamy to counteract the dryness of the season. I pile this on under my eyes and for that area, this is perfect. It feels cool, comforting and not too overwhelming. But for the cheeks, it goes on too light even for my skin type. I think this would work best in the summer on normal to oily skin types.</li>
            <li> I had thought this would be a cream type moisturizer but in fact is more a gel consistency, and I can&#x27;t say that I mind it.  It goes on really smoothly and makes my face feel like it is really working.  I have been using it for a couple of weeks and I notice a difference in the fine lines on my face, plus the gel feels refreshing.</li>
            <li> I almost always use a serum before I moisturize - it seems to help the moisturizer soak into my skin better.  This is the first moisturizer that seems to combine both the serum and the moisturizer in one which makes it a great value.  Rather than being a typical creamy moisturizer, this night moisturizer has an almost gel-like consistency which makes it feel like it soaks into my skin faster and more completely than a cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the way this moisturizer feels and works - it&#x27;s changed what I will look for in a moisturizer in the future.</li>
            <li> This facial gel says that it will moisturize your skin.  I didn&#x27;t see it.  It did keep sweat next to my skin because it couldn&#x27;t evaporate through the thin film after it dried a bit, but mostly the product stayed both shiny and sticky.  I also did not care for the rather strong smell.  Not a fan.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer did make my skin softer. I found it lessened the dry skin around my eyes and did not make me break out.&lt;br /&gt;However, I have not seen any anti-wrinkling effects yet. I suppose keeping the skin hydrated will, in time, ease the effects of aging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the bottle and the presentation. The solution feels very fresh and inviting, not greasy like some moisturizers can be. It feels rather luxurious, like a treat, to put it on at night. There is no overwhelming perfume or otherwise smell to it, which is good because you would smell it all night! The price is pretty reasonable for this sort or product with a brand name. The amount you receive is tolerable and should last for at least a month or two depending on how much you use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend someone looking for a product like this, to try it out. It&#x27;s inexpensive enough to try and not suffer buyer&#x27;s remorse if you don&#x27;t like it. I would think, if you don&#x27;t like it, it would be because it&#x27;s too light and not from any adverse effects.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product, because it looked like it would be really nice! I&#x27;ve been looking for a good nighttime moisturizer, because my skin is really dry and flaky from all the wind and cold weather going on right now. I began using this product as soon as it came, but I just wasn&#x27;t that impressed. This moisturizer didn&#x27;t work any better than the Wal-Mart brand nighttime moisturizer I had been using before it came. My Wal-Mart brand product is so much cheaper than this kind, so I couldn&#x27;t justify purchasing this expensive product when it doesn&#x27;t work any better than the cheaper version. My final verdict on this product is that it is only okay. If money is no object to you, then go ahead and buy this product, because it is a decent moisturizer. If, however, you are on a budget like I am, and you&#x27;re always looking for the smartest ways to spend your money, opt for a cheaper moisturizer. I really like the replenishing moisturizer done by the Simple line of products, and the generic version done by Wal-Mart also works really well!I&#x27;m willing to spend a little extra money on makeup that is obviously of a very high quality, such as many Clinique products, but this moisturizer doesn&#x27;t seem worth the splurge to me. Spend $5 on the Simple moisturizer, because it works just as well for a fraction of the price!</li>
            <li> It must be taken into consideration that I like a moisturizer I can feel, just enough to convince me it is working.  This one does just that and perfectly.  Those who don&#x27;t like a heavy feel would probably prefer a different brand, but this feels to me.  The moisture is clean-feeling, but still one I can feel.  The moisturizing sensation lasts all night long.  My skin does not feel overburdened or greasy, and I have noticed a definite improvement in my skin&#x27;s moisture.</li>
            <li> I was already familiar with the product which works well.  I will order again in the future when this runs out.</li>
            <li> This lotion goes on without feeling greasy and has a crisp, clean scent. Many lotions and creams make my skin break out after a few days, but I am pleased to say this one had no such effect: just smooth, silky skin that smells clean and feels hydrated. Absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t sting or irritate; reasonably-priced.</li>
            <li> This is from my wife:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never tried/used \\&quot;Ellen Tracy\\&quot; cosmetics and was eager to try this new nighttime hydrating cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in elegant packaging in a frosted glass jar with a golden lid. I was really surprised at its consistency - it is like a gel and as I have dry skin and am 60, I have been using richer creams for my skin.I was really VERY pleased with this product.I applied it to my face and it was quickly absorbed by my skin, with no greasy residues whatsoever. I like the very light pleasant scent. I have been using it regularly for 10 days without the recommended Ellen Tracy serum, and my skin feels so soft and hydrated. I think this might also work well as a day cream for me and I will try using it as such and see the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You only need a small quantity of this cream so this 1.77 oz glass jar will last for quite a while. The price is reasonable. I very highly recommend this cream!</li>
            <li> I have combination/oily skin and I am always looking for moisturizers that will not make my skin look shiny or give me breakouts. This moisturizer has the consistency of a gel and is very light. It also has a nice, clean scent that is NEVER overwhelming.The moisturizer is absorbed into the skin very quickly and does not make my skin oilier. A nice product at a nice price!</li>
            <li> there is no scent to it which is ok but it is in a gel form. once you apply it feels like you are spreading glue. your face feels sticky and i spread this all over my face and now twenty minutes later it still feels sticky to the touch. what on earth did they put in this that they forgot to list? somekind of adhesive? not something i would buy again. only because I spent money on it i will use it one more time but in a very very tiny quantity and see how it works. i doubt it will be any better but worth a try.</li>
