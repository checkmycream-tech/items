    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Works great!  </li>
            <li>This is a good alternative to the porcelain rings that fell off and broke.  </li>
            <li>The seller was good</li>
            <li>I thought a metal oil ring would be superior to a ceramic one because the ceramic absorbs the oil.</li>
            <li>they are great on a litebulb with your favorite scent.  </li>
            <li>These give off a good scent and are easy to use.</li>
            <li>Great product, fast shipping, fair price.  </li>
            <li>M UCH BETTER ON A LIGHTBULB THAN HAVING A LIT CANDLE IN THE ROOM</li>
            <li>MUCH MORE OFTEN.............</li>
            <li>I love cinnamon.</li>
            <li>arrived very quickly,inexpensive and works great on my lamp,I dont know what else to say about it,i would order them again</li>
            <li>ALSO DO NOT USE ON WOOD FURNITURE if oil spills on wood it will eat the finish off  use on tile counter or stone top or put something under lamp</li>
            <li>These are great if you want sent to spread strongly HOWEVER USE CAUTION when you put this on lamp and pour oil in do not move lamp around or bump lamp as ring will fall off and oil is HOT</li>
            <li>They do the job but fall off easily.</li>
            <li>Manufacturer will need to make modifications so that they will fit the newer bulbs.</li>
            <li>I purchased 2, and one of them fell off the light bulb twice spilling oil everywhere</li>
            <li>Here, I thought, with the oil just sitting in the ring there&#x27;d be a more powerful diffusing of the scent.</li>
            <li>This is VERY small &amp; kind of just balances on top of the light bulb.</li>
            <li>The price prevents a higher rating.</li>
            <li>Good product, works on the old light bulbs, but the newer longer life bulbs, a little large .  </li>
            <li>, I have an older one from Caswell-Massey that never ever did that</li>
            <li>so I suppose my expectations were high.</li>
            <li>I could barely smell the same oil which would normally fill my room using my old ceramic ring.</li>

            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend due to the tiny size.</li>
            <li> Why companies keep selling the same size ring when light bulbs have changed is crazy.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely not.</li>
            <li> Too bad the company doesn&#x27;t ship to Canada, I had to have the order sent to a friend in NY and then have it mailed here.</li>

            <li> I wanted a metal ring because my porcelain one broke. This is VERY small &amp; kind of just balances on top of the light bulb. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend due to the tiny size.</li>
            <li> M UCH BETTER ON A LIGHTBULB THAN HAVING A LIT CANDLE IN THE ROOM AND YOU CHANGE THE FRAGRANCE MUCH MORE OFTEN.............</li>
            <li> I had one of these rings before. they are great on a litebulb with your favorite scent.  I love cinnamon.</li>
            <li> Good product, works on the old light bulbs, but the newer longer life bulbs, a little large .  Manufacturer will need to make modifications so that they will fit the newer bulbs.</li>

            <li> I purchased 2, and one of them fell off the light bulb twice spilling oil everywhere, I have an older one from Caswell-Massey that never ever did that so I suppose my expectations were high. I will not purchase another one of these ORIN oil rings. The seller was good and I got my items swiftly.</li>
            <li> Why companies keep selling the same size ring when light bulbs have changed is crazy.  But they all keep the same size rings.</li>
            <li> They do the job but fall off easily.</li>
            <li> The price prevents a higher rating.</li>
            <li> It keeps falling of the bulb.</li>
            <li> The rings do the job. Too bad the company doesn&#x27;t ship to Canada, I had to have the order sent to a friend in NY and then have it mailed here.</li>
