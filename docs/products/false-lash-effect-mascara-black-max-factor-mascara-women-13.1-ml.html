            <li>This mascara is great</li>
            <li>but it isn&#x27;t as great as people claim it to be.</li>

            <li>Love it!!</li>
            <li>Believe me, buy this product, its amazing!</li>
            <li>I have tried many kinds of mascara over the years trying to find the best one that thickens your lashes.  </li>
            <li>I brought four of these and would buy another four for the rest of my life, loved it and came recommended from a workmate.</li>
            <li>I consider myself a mascara addict and have tried a good lot of them.</li>
            <li>Fairly good coverage and lengthening</li>
            <li>I heard this was a good mascara</li>
            <li>But I swear to you that it STILL looks good.</li>
            <li>good.</li>
            <li>lool Yep, its that good. 5 stars.</li>
            <li>, this is a good choice.  </li>

            <li>It was good.</li>
            <li>This mascara was amazing, its did not clump up and it looked clean and awesome.</li>
            <li>Another great thing about this mascara is that it doesnt smudge, flake and most of all</li>
            <li>I wear it without eyeliner most days and it just looks great.</li>
            <li>Love, Love this mascara and will buy again!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li>I really love this mascara!</li>
            <li>what I like the most about it - it doesn&#x27;t clump at all!  </li>
            <li>I love this mascara!</li>
            <li>It fans my lashes out really nicely and adds length.</li>
            <li>It gives you really nice seperated feathery lashes.</li>
            <li>But at $30 a tube for something I use so often, it&#x27;s just not cost effective.</li>
            <li>This one is one of the best so far!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing Max Factor for about 10 years and this is my favorite kind.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who wanted a good clean mascara.</li>
            <li>The very first day I wore it to work, I had someone comment that I looked so good that day - and that I looked &#x27;refreshed.&#x27;</li>
            <li>I can get my favorite mascara now.</li>
            <li>Love you Amazon.</li>
            <li>but I really love the brush.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.</li>
            <li>But it really did fan my lashes out and looked great.</li>
            <li>Most reviews have noted that it&#x27;s no longer for sale in the US anyway -</li>
            <li>and i love it.i</li>
            <li>i love</li>
            <li>&#x3D;).</li>
            <li>Awesome product and the only one I use.</li>
            <li>Glad I can still find this on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Better than many others</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big Max fan and thought this would be perfect.  </li>
            <li>I love how my lashes look when I wear this mascara.</li>
            <li>I have tried several and this is the best!</li>
            <li>I love all Max Factor products.  </li>
            <li>But I was never quite satisfied.</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;d try this since it came with such a wonderful recommendation from a well known makeup artist.</li>
            <li>I have found a number of mascaras that I liked but that didn&#x27;t fit all my criteria.</li>
            <li>It may be a GREAT choice for those who don&#x27;t demand so much from a mascara like I</li>
            <li>It may be a GREAT choice for those who don&#x27;t demand so much from a mascara like I do.</li>
            <li>I want one that also comes off easily when I want to remove it and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li>First of all, I noticed there was no scent, which was nice.</li>
            <li>It comes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t give me that spider leg lash appearance while giving me a full and lengthy set of lashes!</li>
            <li>SUPER SELLER! ‹(•&amp;iquest;•)›</li>
            <li>My new favorite,  just ordered it again, separates lashes, lengthens lashes and most of all makes them look fabulous!</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t as great as it was hyped to be, but I&#x27;d definitely continue to purchase if it was available in the US.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t a huge brush</li>
            <li>a fabulous</li>
            <li>for it not being available, I guess it&#x27;s just where you look.</li>
            <li>I actually bought this mascara because Lisa Eldridge (makeup artist on Youtube) recommended it as a great drug store brand mascara.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>It glided on smoothly.</li>
            <li>It also very rarely flakes -</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so excited about the results.</li>
            <li>but it is fairly substantial with short comb-like bristles.</li>
            <li>If it gave me a bit more volume, I would really like this.</li>
            <li>It contains parabens and other harmful ingredients, but it works great.  </li>
            <li>it drys quickly and doesn&#x27;t smudge throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Super easy to clean, just washes off with mild face cleanser without damaging your natural lashes.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>I actually like it better!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a reasonable cost, goes on smoothly, separates lashes, lengthens lashes, lasts all day, doesn&#x27;t clump, doesn&#x27;t flake, and comes off with ease.</li>
            <li>Which is the point, right?</li>
            <li>I love Max Factor products in general.</li>
            <li>The first coat was decent, nothing special.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even bother curling my lashes first, and my eyes looked runway-ready.</li>
            <li>I will be heading back up there for a couple more tubes in case they run out of supply.</li>
            <li>it really does what it says!</li>
            <li>They do exactly what</li>
            <li>Overall, it is an okay mascara.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t apply primer the first time I tried it because I wanted to see how the mascara performed alone.</li>
            <li>clearly not enough for me to stop looking for even better results).</li>
            <li>clearly not enough for me to stop looking for even better results).</li>
            <li>(Hint: A basic eye with this mascara, and bright red lips.</li>
            <li>I have tried many mascaras for my straight Asian eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products out there everything from expensive designer brands to cheap drug store brands and this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>and it seems to dry more on the lashes.</li>
            <li>The brush was too large</li>
            <li>But with this mascara, it certainly looks like I do.</li>
            <li>I have purchased just about every brand of mascara, ranging from just a few dollars, to close to fifty (yes, embarrassingly, I&#x27;ve paid that much before for certain French-made mascaras with popular well known manufacturers).</li>
            <li>It is clump free even with numerous coats which is a real plus.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon sending me a advertisement on the mascara</li>
            <li>it really makes my lashes thicker and longer</li>
            <li>just apply it correctly, dont get much product on the wand or gently dab the wand on a piece of tissue.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, I bought it on a whim and went straight home to try it.</li>
            <li>(I really did, I bought a whole slew of makeup</li>
            <li>I was really hopeful but I will try another brand.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not waterproof, but it is very water resistant.</li>
            <li>I get asked if my eyelashes are real or not when I wear this.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, it really builds the volume and length of your eye lashes.</li>
            <li>It really makes my eyes pop.</li>
            <li>It really opens up my eyes.</li>
            <li>It gives your lashes a lot of volume but sometimes, the brush grabs too much formula and clumps the ends.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not asking for much, am I?  </li>
            <li>bought it anyway and was very eager to try it.</li>
            <li>It does give a false lash effect, but in a more believable way, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>More than one layer will give you more dramatic look and</li>
            <li>mascara was worked better as i can wear it longer than the other mascaras that I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>if it does, it&#x27;s barely noticeable, and it&#x27;s only if I&#x27;ve used more than 2 coats and rub my eyelashes on accident.</li>
            <li>This is my new go-to mascara!</li>
            <li>If you put one coat only you will achieve super long fluffy lashes that look natural, perfect for daily look.</li>
            <li>Really does a great job extending lashes for a false lash look!</li>
            <li>The wand is pretty hefty, with tiny, short bristles, which helps the mascara go on smoothly, and helps comb through the lashes.</li>
            <li>Love this mascara ive used it everyday since i got it</li>
            <li>They look full and long and make my eyes pop!</li>
            <li>There are only few mascaras that have good brushes for my short eyelashes</li>
            <li>Fantastic look but a little clumpy.</li>
            <li>The effect was thick, very black, very long, and perfectly curled lashes that framed my eyes so dramatically they looked twice their size.</li>
            <li>This mascara clumped considerably.  </li>
            <li>I quess it was old.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t call it the &amp;#34;false lash effect,&amp;#34; but the volume it builds is natural looking.</li>
            <li>(I always gently stroke my lashes with my fingertip to separate and prevent any clumps, but it&#x27;s not entirely necessary with this mascara.)</li>
            <li>downside to this brand is that you only buy it online thanks to Amazon.</li>
            <li>I wish the company would make a natural version.  </li>
            <li>No flaking under my eyes, just a soft smudge under my eyes that almost looks (dare I say?)</li>
            <li>This mascara is recommended by Lisa Eldridge, a professional makeup artist.  </li>
            <li>The mascara&#x27;s consistency is not very thick nor liquid, and it does not dry out in the container over time.</li>
            <li>It seperates your lashes like no other.</li>
            <li>I am not sure I&#x27;d order it again just because it doesn&#x27;t stand out as great or not great.</li>
            <li>I only buy natural products.  </li>
            <li>Max Factor isn&#x27;t sold in the U.S. any longer apparently, but I managed to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>When I do properly remove my eye makeup, this mascara comes off like a dream with no heavy tugging.</li>
            <li>It really can make your eyelashes look like you are wearing full false ones.  </li>
            <li>However, I did not look like I had false lashes on nor did I find the mascara to be that much better than a couple of cheaper drugstore mascaras</li>
            <li>I love the Max factor calorie 2000 dramatic volume..</li>
            <li>This false lash effect doesn&#x27;t.. personally feel it&#x27;s more the brush than the formula.</li>
            <li>Before you know it, your lashes are long, without a clump, wow.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a testament to the mascara because my lashes are NOT long.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping to finally find a great mascara that made my very small eyelashes look like false eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>i  have sensitive eyes which means i am limited on what mascaras i can use.&lt;br</li>

            <li> SUPER SELLER! ‹(•&amp;iquest;•)›</li>
            <li> My new favorite,  just ordered it again, separates lashes, lengthens lashes and most of all makes them look fabulous!</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t as great as it was hyped to be, but I&#x27;d definitely continue to purchase if it was available in the US.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a huge brush</li>
            <li> a fabulous</li>
            <li> for it not being available, I guess it&#x27;s just where you look.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this mascara because Lisa Eldridge (makeup artist on Youtube) recommended it as a great drug store brand mascara.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> It glided on smoothly.</li>
            <li> It also very rarely flakes -</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so excited about the results.</li>
            <li> but it is fairly substantial with short comb-like bristles.</li>
            <li> If it gave me a bit more volume, I would really like this.</li>
            <li> It contains parabens and other harmful ingredients, but it works great.  </li>
            <li> it drys quickly and doesn&#x27;t smudge throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Super easy to clean, just washes off with mild face cleanser without damaging your natural lashes.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> I actually like it better!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a reasonable cost, goes on smoothly, separates lashes, lengthens lashes, lasts all day, doesn&#x27;t clump, doesn&#x27;t flake, and comes off with ease.</li>
            <li> Which is the point, right?</li>
            <li> I love Max Factor products in general.</li>
            <li> The first coat was decent, nothing special.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even bother curling my lashes first, and my eyes looked runway-ready.</li>
            <li> I will be heading back up there for a couple more tubes in case they run out of supply.</li>
            <li> it really does what it says!</li>
            <li> They do exactly what</li>
            <li> Overall, it is an okay mascara.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t apply primer the first time I tried it because I wanted to see how the mascara performed alone.</li>
            <li> clearly not enough for me to stop looking for even better results).</li>
            <li> clearly not enough for me to stop looking for even better results).</li>
            <li> (Hint: A basic eye with this mascara, and bright red lips.</li>
            <li> I have tried many mascaras for my straight Asian eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products out there everything from expensive designer brands to cheap drug store brands and this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> and it seems to dry more on the lashes.</li>
            <li> The brush was too large</li>
            <li> But with this mascara, it certainly looks like I do.</li>
            <li> I have purchased just about every brand of mascara, ranging from just a few dollars, to close to fifty (yes, embarrassingly, I&#x27;ve paid that much before for certain French-made mascaras with popular well known manufacturers).</li>
            <li> It is clump free even with numerous coats which is a real plus.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon sending me a advertisement on the mascara</li>
            <li> it really makes my lashes thicker and longer</li>
            <li> just apply it correctly, dont get much product on the wand or gently dab the wand on a piece of tissue.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I bought it on a whim and went straight home to try it.</li>
            <li> (I really did, I bought a whole slew of makeup</li>
            <li> I was really hopeful but I will try another brand.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not waterproof, but it is very water resistant.</li>
            <li> I get asked if my eyelashes are real or not when I wear this.  </li>
            <li> Very pleased!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, it really builds the volume and length of your eye lashes.</li>
            <li> It really makes my eyes pop.</li>
            <li> It really opens up my eyes.</li>
            <li> It gives your lashes a lot of volume but sometimes, the brush grabs too much formula and clumps the ends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not asking for much, am I?  </li>
            <li> bought it anyway and was very eager to try it.</li>
            <li> It does give a false lash effect, but in a more believable way, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> More than one layer will give you more dramatic look and</li>
            <li> mascara was worked better as i can wear it longer than the other mascaras that I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> if it does, it&#x27;s barely noticeable, and it&#x27;s only if I&#x27;ve used more than 2 coats and rub my eyelashes on accident.</li>
            <li> This is my new go-to mascara!</li>
            <li> If you put one coat only you will achieve super long fluffy lashes that look natural, perfect for daily look.</li>
            <li> Really does a great job extending lashes for a false lash look!</li>
            <li> The wand is pretty hefty, with tiny, short bristles, which helps the mascara go on smoothly, and helps comb through the lashes.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara ive used it everyday since i got it</li>
            <li> They look full and long and make my eyes pop!</li>
            <li> There are only few mascaras that have good brushes for my short eyelashes</li>
            <li> Fantastic look but a little clumpy.</li>
            <li> The effect was thick, very black, very long, and perfectly curled lashes that framed my eyes so dramatically they looked twice their size.</li>
            <li> This mascara clumped considerably.  </li>
            <li> I quess it was old.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t call it the &amp;#34;false lash effect,&amp;#34; but the volume it builds is natural looking.</li>
            <li> (I always gently stroke my lashes with my fingertip to separate and prevent any clumps, but it&#x27;s not entirely necessary with this mascara.)</li>
            <li> downside to this brand is that you only buy it online thanks to Amazon.</li>
            <li> I wish the company would make a natural version.  </li>
            <li> No flaking under my eyes, just a soft smudge under my eyes that almost looks (dare I say?)</li>
            <li> This mascara is recommended by Lisa Eldridge, a professional makeup artist.  </li>
            <li> The mascara&#x27;s consistency is not very thick nor liquid, and it does not dry out in the container over time.</li>
            <li> It seperates your lashes like no other.</li>
            <li> I am not sure I&#x27;d order it again just because it doesn&#x27;t stand out as great or not great.</li>
            <li> I only buy natural products.  </li>
            <li> Max Factor isn&#x27;t sold in the U.S. any longer apparently, but I managed to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> When I do properly remove my eye makeup, this mascara comes off like a dream with no heavy tugging.</li>
            <li> It really can make your eyelashes look like you are wearing full false ones.  </li>
            <li> However, I did not look like I had false lashes on nor did I find the mascara to be that much better than a couple of cheaper drugstore mascaras</li>
            <li> I love the Max factor calorie 2000 dramatic volume..</li>
            <li> This false lash effect doesn&#x27;t.. personally feel it&#x27;s more the brush than the formula.</li>
            <li> Before you know it, your lashes are long, without a clump, wow.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a testament to the mascara because my lashes are NOT long.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping to finally find a great mascara that made my very small eyelashes look like false eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> i  have sensitive eyes which means i am limited on what mascaras i can use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Product was ok not what i expected as it does say false lash effect which did not give ig that effect.</li>
            <li> and and definitely not better than pricier ones like They&#x27;re Real and DiorShow.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It dried out a little faster than I had hoped and clumped a little more than I expected.</li>
            <li> spent hours testing different looks with the stuff</li>
            <li> /&gt;i have been searching for a couple of  years now to find one that doesn&#x27;t hurt yet still gives me the long lashes that I want.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> It is expensive, but worth it!  </li>
            <li> I work so hard on, so I started purchasing high end department store mascara.</li>
            <li> seemed too dry.  </li>
            <li> It lasted 3 weeks before it dried out.ill Stick with your more expensive product for the effects</li>
            <li> The first day I put it on in the morning, my mom was like &amp;#34; why are you putting false lashes during the day?&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This holds curls extremely well, goes on without clumping, and does NOT smudge at all even after a long day (and sweating...</li>
            <li> I bought this because the 2000 calorie was hard to find and more expensive.</li>
            <li> This mascara is defining and builds a minimal amount of volume.</li>
            <li> this is not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Either it didn&#x27;t last all day (heavy smuding under eyes, flaking, etc.), or it immediately clumped.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve slept in my makeup since buying this product, and it does smudge some, but that is to be expected.</li>
            <li> I have straight, medium length lashes that are thin and need to be plumped up.</li>
            <li> This gives me thick lush eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I have tried the other top-rated mascaras, and this one gives me the thickest, darkest lashes, without any clumps</li>
            <li> For the price point, this mascara delivers well although I think it&#x27;s a tad pricey compared to other drugstore mascaras that work well like Covergirl&#x27;s LashExact which is around $7.00 and gives comparative results.</li>

            <li> And there were at least ten vendors that I saw selling it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> For the price this mascara is not worth it.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money..</li>
            <li> Hands down to this mascara.</li>
            <li> that it was a dark black.</li>
            <li> Even better with a couple coats and getting it into the base of your lashes by blinking a little into the brush.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t run down my face if my eyes tear up a little.</li>
            <li> I do wish the product was a little bit thicker</li>
            <li> (Because sadly, I can&#x27;t find a store near me that carries Max Factor.)</li>
            <li> Definitely would not support a criminal.. ever.</li>
            <li> The formula is not watery or messy.</li>
            <li> a few people have remarked that my lashes are &amp;#34;so long&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> a few people have remarked that my lashes are &amp;#34;so long&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think anyone would think I am wearing false lashes - just that I have incredibly long lashes (which I do NOT, btw).</li>
            <li> When it gets a little hard to work with I add a drop or two of water in the tube and that is all it needs.</li>
            <li> Not sure why maybe my technique needs improvement.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see a difference in this and other less expensive brands.</li>
            <li> I am a mascara fanatic.</li>
            <li> The tube is thick but the brush is almost like a comb.</li>
            <li> I want a mascara that will give me crazy long and thick lashes, won&#x27;t clump, won&#x27;t streak or flake, and won&#x27;t look spidery.</li>
            <li> This is the only make up product I use that has bad ingredients</li>
            <li> The mascara is worse than the cheapest Duran Reade</li>
            <li> After hearing about and reading reviews of Max Factor False Lash Effect Mascara, I had to try it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Which makes me angry, because it messes up the eye shadow</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after watching a review of it on youtube, but I was not really impressed.</li>
            <li> The effects are dramatic!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m disappointed. .</li>
            <li> I HATE</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I can no longer get Max Factor in the U.S. Thanks to Amazon sending me a advertisement on the mascara I can get my favorite mascara now. It,s everything they say it is and the delivery was prompt. Love you Amazon.Thank you Blush Cosmetics from the U.K.</li>
            <li> I was going to return this item simply because the shipping was going to take over a month to get here. However it came way earlier than the estimated delivery said it would. Anyway this mascara is awesome. It seperates your lashes like no other. It has zero clumps and doesn&#x27;t clump your lashes together. It fans my lashes out really nicely and adds length. I do wish the product was a little bit thicker but I really love the brush. It gives you really nice seperated feathery lashes. I&#x27;m going to try lash blast after this because I have heard they are identical and lash blast is a third of the price.</li>
            <li> When I bought this mascara I fell in love!! I adore this product it really makes my lashes thicker and longer and it doesnt clump at all! just apply it correctly, dont get much product on the wand or gently dab the wand on a piece of tissue. Believe me, buy this product, its amazing! Best mascara that i have ever had!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara. It wasn&#x27;t as great as it was hyped to be, but I&#x27;d definitely continue to purchase if it was available in the US. It dried out a little faster than I had hoped and clumped a little more than I expected. But it really did fan my lashes out and looked great. I loved it while it lasted!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never tried this mascara before.. Most reviews have noted that it&#x27;s no longer for sale in the US anyway - however, I found mine in the Fashion District of LA, in Santee Alley. And there were at least ten vendors that I saw selling it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I bought it on a whim and went straight home to try it. (I really did, I bought a whole slew of makeup and I always try everything immediately.) I was amazed at the results. I didn&#x27;t even bother curling my lashes first, and my eyes looked runway-ready. The effect was thick, very black, very long, and perfectly curled lashes that framed my eyes so dramatically they looked twice their size. (In a haute couture way, not in a \\&quot;Take me to your leader\\&quot; way.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spent hours testing different looks with the stuff and I&#x27;m so excited about the results. (Hint: A basic eye with this mascara, and bright red lips. I felt like a 50&#x27;s movie star.)Really a fabulous product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for it not being available, I guess it&#x27;s just where you look. I will be heading back up there for a couple more tubes in case they run out of supply.</li>
            <li> ‹(•&amp;iquest;•)› THANK YOU! GREAT DEAL! SUPER SELLER! ‹(•&amp;iquest;•)›</li>
            <li> item arived before scheduled time,whitch was awesome and i love it.i think it&#x27;s cheaper in some stores but i just couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere besides on line.</li>
            <li> I brought four of these and would buy another four for the rest of my life, loved it and came recommended from a workmate.</li>
            <li> This gives me thick lush eyelashes. Even better with a couple coats and getting it into the base of your lashes by blinking a little into the brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very good mascara I recommend it</li>
            <li> For the price this mascara is not worth it.</li>
            <li> There are only few mascaras that have good brushes for my short eyelashes and this is one of them. The mascara&#x27;s consistency is not very thick nor liquid, and it does not dry out in the container over time.</li>
            <li> Before you know it, your lashes are long, without a clump, wow. Keep applying, still no clumps.will buy again and again</li>
            <li> This mascara clumped considerably.  It also flaked throughout the day.  I ended up throwing it out after 10 uses.  I did like that it was a dark black.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara ive used it everyday since i got it (:</li>
            <li> seemed too dry.  I quess it was old. Will not rebuy. I was really hopeful but I will try another brand.</li>
            <li> excellent. totally recommended . perfect</li>
            <li> its great stuff cant find it in stores in las vegas nv anymore...i love it does everything i want it too</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been battling countless brands of mascara for years because I have this problem where mascara transfers from the ends of my eyelashes, to my mid-eyelid area during long-wear. (I have no idea what the technical term is for this.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which makes me angry, because it messes up the eye shadow I work so hard on, so I started purchasing high end department store mascara. But at $30 a tube for something I use so often, it&#x27;s just not cost effective. I actually bought this mascara because Lisa Eldridge (makeup artist on Youtube) recommended it as a great drug store brand mascara.&lt;br /&gt;And I loved it! It didn&#x27;t transfer onto my eyelids, it was a great &#x27;volumizing&#x27; mascara, and I&#x27;m ordering another tube! (Because sadly, I can&#x27;t find a store near me that carries Max Factor.)</li>
            <li> This mascara was amazing, its did not clump up and it looked clean and awesome. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who wanted a good clean mascara.</li>
            <li> I bought this because the 2000 calorie was hard to find and more expensive. I&#x27;m glad I did! I actually like it better! Goes on well and it seems to dry more on the lashes. It doesn&#x27;t flake or smear! I will keep buying this!</li>
            <li> I consider myself a mascara addict and have tried a good lot of them. I love Max Factor products in general. This mascara does not clump which is wonderful and deserving of the three stars alone. This mascara is defining and builds a minimal amount of volume. I wouldn&#x27;t call it the &amp;#34;false lash effect,&amp;#34; but the volume it builds is natural looking.</li>
            <li> Received but the product is open and is not covered.</li>
            <li> I have tried many mascaras for my straight Asian eyelashes. This one is one of the best so far! This holds curls extremely well, goes on without clumping, and does NOT smudge at all even after a long day (and sweating...it&#x27;s still perfect after I run 3 miles). It&#x27;s not waterproof, but it is very water resistant. It also very rarely flakes - if it does, it&#x27;s barely noticeable, and it&#x27;s only if I&#x27;ve used more than 2 coats and rub my eyelashes on accident. The wand is pretty hefty, with tiny, short bristles, which helps the mascara go on smoothly, and helps comb through the lashes. I don&#x27;t need an eyelash comb with this mascara wand &#x3D;). This is my new go-to mascara!</li>
            <li> Product was ok not what i expected as it does say false lash effect which did not give ig that effect. It lasted 3 weeks before it dried out.ill Stick with your more expensive product for the effects</li>
            <li> I have tried many kinds of mascara over the years trying to find the best one that thickens your lashes.  This is IT!!!!  No need to apply layer upon layer.  Awesome product and the only one I use.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to finally find a great mascara that made my very small eyelashes look like false eyelashes.  I FOUND IT!  Love this mascara!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Max Factor for about 10 years and this is my favorite kind.  It really can make your eyelashes look like you are wearing full false ones.  I get asked if my eyelashes are real or not when I wear this.  It is expensive, but worth it!  So bummed they stopped selling MF in the States.  Glad I can still find this on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I thought I would try something different. Nope. This is clumpy, smelly, and doesn&#x27;t do what it says it does. I&#x27;m a makeup fiend, and this didn&#x27;t pass my test at all.</li>
            <li> Fairly good coverage and lengthening</li>
            <li> Better than many others</li>
            <li> I have done tons of research trying to identify The Best ____ (mascara, eyeliner, lipstick, skin cream...) This mascara was well-deserving of the rave reviews it got! I have tried the other top-rated mascaras, and this one gives me the thickest, darkest lashes, without any clumps (I always gently stroke my lashes with my fingertip to separate and prevent any clumps, but it&#x27;s not entirely necessary with this mascara.) I will probably buy another one to keep in my car.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.  I&#x27;m a big Max fan and thought this would be perfect.  I didn&#x27;t see a difference in this and other less expensive brands.</li>
            <li> The brush was too large</li>
            <li> I just got this today. Nervous to use it because there is no packaging/safety seal/etc.</li>
            <li> I heard this was a good mascara but it doesn&#x27;t adhere to my lashes well. Not sure why maybe my technique needs improvement.</li>
            <li> I love how my lashes look when I wear this mascara. They look full and long and make my eyes pop! This is a great mascara and I want to always have it in my makeup bag!</li>
            <li> I use this ink of the month and I&#x27;m disappointed. . before I decided to buy read the reviews about it.&lt;br /&gt;unfortunately this is not what I expected. The mascara is worse than the cheapest Duran Reade</li>
            <li> My new favorite,  just ordered it again, separates lashes, lengthens lashes and most of all makes them look fabulous!</li>
            <li> I really love this mascara! The effects are dramatic! Love, Love this mascara and will buy again!! I am a mascara junkie! I have tried several and this is the best!</li>
            <li> Amazing&lt;br /&gt;Best mascara ever</li>
            <li> I love the Max factor calorie 2000 dramatic volume.. it really does what it says! This false lash effect doesn&#x27;t.. personally feel it&#x27;s more the brush than the formula.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.. I bought this before I knew about the grandson.. Definitely would not support a criminal.. ever.</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara on the market!  I like how it goes on, stays on and doesn&#x27;t &#x27;clump&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Very pleased!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 star</li>
            <li> Hands down to this mascara. I have tried so many products out there everything from expensive designer brands to cheap drug store brands and this one is my favorite. It goes on smoothly, it really builds the volume and length of your eye lashes. If you put one coat only you will achieve super long fluffy lashes that look natural, perfect for daily look. More than one layer will give you more dramatic look and what I like the most about it - it doesn&#x27;t clump at all!  Another great thing about this mascara is that it doesnt smudge, flake and most of all it doesn&#x27;t irritate your eyes like some mascaras out there. Super easy to clean, just washes off with mild face cleanser without damaging your natural lashes.&lt;br /&gt;Only downside to this brand is that you only buy it online thanks to Amazon.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t flake but can smear later in the day.  Really does a great job extending lashes for a false lash look!</li>
            <li> I only buy natural products.  When it came to mascara they all sucked and clumped up in like a month.  I had to compromise and buy this product.  It contains parabens and other harmful ingredients, but it works great.  This is the only make up product I use that has bad ingredients so I can justify its use.  It really makes my eyes pop. Best mascara I have ever used.  I wish the company would make a natural version.  I have had this product for months and it still goes on great.  When it gets a little hard to work with I add a drop or two of water in the tube and that is all it needs.</li>
            <li> I love all Max Factor products.  They are the best of any of the ones on the market.  They do exactly what&lt;br /&gt;they are advertised to do and I know their ingredients are also the best.</li>
            <li> Loved this mascara!!! It comes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t give me that spider leg lash appearance while giving me a full and lengthy set of lashes! Love it!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this mascara after watching an online makeup tutorial (the person doing the tutorial does celebrity makeup). I have purchased just about every brand of mascara, ranging from just a few dollars, to close to fifty (yes, embarrassingly, I&#x27;ve paid that much before for certain French-made mascaras with popular well known manufacturers). But I was never quite satisfied. Either it didn&#x27;t last all day (heavy smuding under eyes, flaking, etc.), or it immediately clumped. So I decided what the heck - I&#x27;d try this since it came with such a wonderful recommendation from a well known makeup artist. Max Factor isn&#x27;t sold in the U.S. any longer apparently, but I managed to find it on Amazon. When it came, I tried it immediately. First of all, I noticed there was no scent, which was nice. It glided on smoothly. It separated the lashes and lengthened them - to my amazement. A product that actually reflects what&#x27;s in its name?? Yes! It does give a false lash effect, but in a more believable way, in my opinion. I don&#x27;t think anyone would think I am wearing false lashes - just that I have incredibly long lashes (which I do NOT, btw). But with this mascara, it certainly looks like I do. Which is the point, right? The very first day I wore it to work, I had someone comment that I looked so good that day - and that I looked &#x27;refreshed.&#x27; It really opens up my eyes. I wear it without eyeliner most days and it just looks great. I&#x27;ve slept in my makeup since buying this product, and it does smudge some, but that is to be expected. But I swear to you that it STILL looks good. No flaking under my eyes, just a soft smudge under my eyes that almost looks (dare I say?)... good. When I do properly remove my eye makeup, this mascara comes off like a dream with no heavy tugging. This is without a doubt the best mascara I have ever used. It&#x27;s a reasonable cost, goes on smoothly, separates lashes, lengthens lashes, lasts all day, doesn&#x27;t clump, doesn&#x27;t flake, and comes off with ease. What else could anyone ask for?lse could anyone ask for?</li>
            <li> This mascara is recommended by Lisa Eldridge, a professional makeup artist.  My lashes are almost non-existent. In fact, my family kids me about them.  I use my Shu Uemura eyelash curler, also recommended by Lisa Eldridge, and this mascara and I suddenly have lashes.  This mascara adds length and thickness.  Finally, after all these years I have eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Fantastic look but a little clumpy.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara! The first day I put it on in the morning, my mom was like &amp;#34; why are you putting false lashes during the day?&amp;#34; lool Yep, its that good. 5 stars.</li>
            <li> i  have sensitive eyes which means i am limited on what mascaras i can use.&lt;br /&gt;i have been searching for a couple of  years now to find one that doesn&#x27;t hurt yet still gives me the long lashes that I want.&lt;br /&gt;This mascara was worked better as i can wear it longer than the other mascaras that I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;I will probably keep searching for one that doesn&#x27;t hurt my eyes though.</li>
            <li> This mascara is great but it isn&#x27;t as great as people claim it to be. I purchased this product after watching a review of it on youtube, but I was not really impressed. Overall, it is an okay mascara. It gives your lashes a lot of volume but sometimes, the brush grabs too much formula and clumps the ends. The formula is great though....it drys quickly and doesn&#x27;t smudge throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I am a mascara fanatic. I want a mascara that will give me crazy long and thick lashes, won&#x27;t clump, won&#x27;t streak or flake, and won&#x27;t look spidery. I want one that also comes off easily when I want to remove it and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes. I&#x27;m not asking for much, am I?  I have found a number of mascaras that I liked but that didn&#x27;t fit all my criteria. After hearing about and reading reviews of Max Factor False Lash Effect Mascara, I had to try it. But $15 for a drugstore mascara? Ouch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it anyway and was very eager to try it. The tube is thick but the brush is almost like a comb. It isn&#x27;t a huge brush but it is fairly substantial with short comb-like bristles. The formula is not watery or messy. I didn&#x27;t apply primer the first time I tried it because I wanted to see how the mascara performed alone. The first coat was decent, nothing special. Three coats in, I did have longer looking eyelashes. They were darker and a bit thicker. I didn&#x27;t get a lot of volume with the mascara which is often the case with me. I have straight, medium length lashes that are thin and need to be plumped up. This mascara did give me enough volume so that my lashes didn&#x27;t look like spidery sticks. However, I did not look like I had false lashes on nor did I find the mascara to be that much better than a couple of cheaper drugstore mascaras and and definitely not better than pricier ones like They&#x27;re Real and DiorShow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mascara doesn&#x27;t flake throughout the day and it holds up well. I have allergies and sometimes my eyes water a bit and the mascara didn&#x27;t run. That is not to say it is waterproof or even water resistant but it doesn&#x27;t run down my face if my eyes tear up a little. If it gave me a bit more volume, I would really like this. It is clump free even with numerous coats which is a real plus. I HATE clumps!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mascara washes off with my facial cleanser or eye makeup remover and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes at all. I do think it is a BIT pricey for the results but I have been wearing it and a few people have remarked that my lashes are &amp;#34;so long&amp;#34;. That&#x27;s a testament to the mascara because my lashes are NOT long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all, I am going with 4 stars. I wasn&#x27;t blown away but it takes a LOT to blow me away and only a couple of mascaras ever have (but clearly not enough for me to stop looking for even better results). For the price point, this mascara delivers well although I think it&#x27;s a tad pricey compared to other drugstore mascaras that work well like Covergirl&#x27;s LashExact which is around $7.00 and gives comparative results. I would go with 3.5 stars but can&#x27;t so I went to 4. If you are looking for a mascara that lengthens, darkens, and adds some volume and that isn&#x27;t clumpy, this is a good choice.  It may be a GREAT choice for those who don&#x27;t demand so much from a mascara like I do.een wearing it and a few people have remarked that my lashes are &amp;#34;so long&amp;#34;.

            <li> It was good. As Mascara goes. I just ordered a more expensive mascara and so we shall see how it compares. But no complaints. I am not sure I&#x27;d order it again just because it doesn&#x27;t stand out as great or not great.</li>
