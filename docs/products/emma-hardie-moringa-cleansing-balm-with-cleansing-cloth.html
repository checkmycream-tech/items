            <li>Best cleanser I have ever used.</li>

            <li>The muslin cloth is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Then I use a washcloth or muslin cloth to take it off with warm water.</li>
            <li>a nice product but</li>
            <li>This is the most luxurious and effective cleansing balm I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>It does a great job of taking off the residual makeup that the wipe may have missed (especially eye makeup) and the hand towel that comes with it is great.</li>
            <li>It has a very strong citrus scent which I love, but I&#x27;m sure some people don&#x27;t enjoy it so just be warned!</li>
            <li>I know this cleansing balm is a favorite amongst YouTube bloggers.</li>
            <li>Love it, love it, love it.</li>
            <li>I love this.  </li>
            <li>excellent deep cleansing .</li>

            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love how it makes my skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what people consider &amp;#34;pea sized&amp;#34; but I use quite a bit more than that.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s amazing that an oil cleanser like this works on my super oily skin.</li>
            <li>All commercials/advertisements make you think you need super foamy cleanser for oily skin but not so people!  </li>
            <li>This product is fantastic.</li>
            <li>My skin feels clean and nourished after I use this product.</li>
            <li>Love the creamy balm texture and light floral (natural) scent.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s a very nice formula that cleanses the skin well and doesn&#x27;t leave it striped or dry, in fact, your skin feels moisturized right after cleansing.</li>
            <li>rub a bit onto your dry face and massage it around for 30-60 seconds or so then take a warm wash cloth and lay on face for a few minutes then rinse and massage face with the warm cloth and then rinse with warm water -3-5 times.</li>
            <li>It really helps to smooth the skin.</li>
            <li>After countless beauty bloggers recommended this as an amazing cleanser, I splurged and bought it.</li>

            <li>and she really knows her stuff!</li>
            <li>If I swipe my face with grapeseed oil first it works well.</li>

            <li>leaves skin so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I love this cleanser, a little goes a long way which is good since it is pricey...</li>
            <li>, I really don&#x27;t like the smell of this.</li>
            <li>It smells really earthy and herbal.</li>
            <li>Bought this solely based on how much Caroline Hirons raves about this product all the time.</li>
            <li>It has helped my skin so much.</li>
            <li>I had previously tried another rather expensive cleansing balm on recommendation and it was good, however not as good as this one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ruined for most other balm cleansers!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without this stuff anymore.</li>
            <li>In two weeks, I noticed my skin hadn&#x27;t break out from this product and my skin looked very clear.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin very soft and not dried out at all.</li>
            <li>you only need a large pea size to cleanse face and neck.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I took off one star is that I think it costs too much for what it is.</li>
            <li>Smells lush, doesn&#x27;t break me out, feels like manna from heaven on the skin.</li>
            <li>I have bought several tubs of this despite the high price!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not cheap, but you only have to use a little bit to get a good cleanse.</li>
            <li>i usually dont write reviews, but this cleanser is worth the money!  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t bare to have it on my face for too long.&lt;br /&gt;Overall,</li>
            <li>Not cheap but worth</li>
            <li>I generally have to go in twice just to rub off my basic eye makeup (not waterproof) but its definitely relaxing before you go to bed!</li>

            <li> I know this cleansing balm is a favorite amongst YouTube bloggers. And it&#x27;s a great cleansing balm. The only reason I took off one star is that I think it costs too much for what it is. But it&#x27;s a very nice formula that cleanses the skin well and doesn&#x27;t leave it striped or dry, in fact, your skin feels moisturized right after cleansing. There is very little actual Moringa oil in here, as it&#x27;s one of the last ingredients. I think I might try to make something like this and save some $$.</li>
            <li> This is the best cleanser I have ever used. Recommended by Caroline Hirons and she really knows her stuff!</li>
            <li> It it too thick which causes a lot of pulling on skin. If I swipe my face with grapeseed oil first it works well. Grapeseed oil is faster and CHEAPER !</li>
            <li> Love it, love it, love it. Smells lush, doesn&#x27;t break me out, feels like manna from heaven on the skin. Can&#x27;t live without this stuff anymore. I&#x27;m ruined for most other balm cleansers!</li>
            <li> Best cleanser I have ever used. I think it&#x27;s amazing that an oil cleanser like this works on my super oily skin. I&#x27;m serious - I get extremely shiny on the hour if I don&#x27;t blot. That goes against everything we were taught. All commercials/advertisements make you think you need super foamy cleanser for oily skin but not so people!  I have bought several tubs of this despite the high price!  That&#x27;s speaks volumes.  I massage it in and add a little water too to work it in. Then I use a washcloth or muslin cloth to take it off with warm water. It makes your skin very soft and not dried out at all. It&#x27;s not the best at taking eye makeup off so use something else for that to supplement this.</li>
            <li> I love this.  It really helps to smooth the skin.</li>
            <li> excellent deep cleansing .</li>
            <li> Very enjoyable to use!</li>
            <li> Love this balm as a second cleanse to help remove makeup and/or SPF. It&#x27;s just the loveliest thing I&#x27;ve ever put on my face. It&#x27;s not cheap, but you only have to use a little bit to get a good cleanse.</li>
            <li> After countless beauty bloggers recommended this as an amazing cleanser, I splurged and bought it. I&#x27;ve been using it now for a couple of weeks. I usually use a makeup removing wipe first and use a little bit of this to get whatever was missed.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get me wrong. It does a great job of taking off the residual makeup that the wipe may have missed (especially eye makeup) and the hand towel that comes with it is great. I just don&#x27;t know if it justifies the price.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I really don&#x27;t like the smell of this. It&#x27;s a hard smell to describe. It smells really earthy and herbal. I can&#x27;t bare to have it on my face for too long.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a nice product but the price makes me think twice about buying it again.</li>
            <li> Love the creamy balm texture and light floral (natural) scent. It&#x27;s a bit pricy for what it is</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser, a little goes a long way which is good since it is pricey...rub a bit onto your dry face and massage it around for 30-60 seconds or so then take a warm wash cloth and lay on face for a few minutes then rinse and massage face with the warm cloth and then rinse with warm water -3-5 times. Very good for removing mascara and make up.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing cleanser and moisturizer I have ever used! I am in love with this product!!</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic. Not cheap but worth it&#x27;s money.</li>
            <li> I love this cleansing balm. I had previously tried another rather expensive cleansing balm on recommendation and it was good, however not as good as this one. My skin feels clean and nourished after I use this product.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have found for removing makeup. It leaves my face soft and smooth. I followed the directions and had no problems. A little goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I put some on over my night cream and wake up with great skin.&lt;br /&gt;I did order extra of the little face cloth and the lip balm treatment. Great products.</li>
            <li> i usually dont write reviews, but this cleanser is worth the money!  you only need a large pea size to cleanse face and neck.  leaves skin so soft and smooth.  not greasy at all.  the only reason for four stars instead of five was because of packaging.  would like it better if it came in a tube.  hate sticking my fingers in the jar.</li>
            <li> Bought this solely based on how much Caroline Hirons raves about this product all the time. She can never do anything wrong..... I love this product! It has helped my skin so much. I have oily combination skin with hormonal acnes. When I first used this, I was scared cuz it was thick &amp; moisturizing. In two weeks, I noticed my skin hadn&#x27;t break out from this product and my skin looked very clear. This has become my holy grail product and I love it. I recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s looking for something different than the cleansing lotions that strips moisture out of your skin and makes skin very tight.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I love how it makes my skin. Works as a cleanser and a mask.</li>
            <li> Great cleansing balm. Doesn&#x27;t wash off all your makeup as some people claim. I generally have to go in twice just to rub off my basic eye makeup (not waterproof) but its definitely relaxing before you go to bed! I don&#x27;t know what people consider &amp;#34;pea sized&amp;#34; but I use quite a bit more than that. its been about a month and I&#x27;ve used about half. I&#x27;d say that each tub lasts me 2 months. It has a very strong citrus scent which I love, but I&#x27;m sure some people don&#x27;t enjoy it so just be warned!</li>
            <li> This is the most luxurious and effective cleansing balm I have ever used.  It is worth every penny.  I look forward to washing my face at night now.  The muslin cloth is amazing.  I wish Amazon would stock the three pack. One is not ideal.  I will be religiously repurchasing!  Thank you Amazon!</li>
