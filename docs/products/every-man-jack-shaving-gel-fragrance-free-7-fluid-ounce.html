            <li>it worked very nice on my legs.</li>
            <li>i was looking for something without all the chemicals (e.g. paba, sodium lauryl sulfate, peg, etc) and this product fit the bill perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Good:</li>
            <li>Good lather, very smooth, felt great.</li>
            <li>gel works great and proves you don&#x27;t need all those chemicals made out of petroleum to provide a great shave.</li>
            <li>The gel creates a nice creamy foam for shaving.  </li>
            <li>I kind of like the smell.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But Everyman Jack Cream in a tube was totally it&#x27;s own thing.  </li>
            <li>It has a pleasant, mild fragrance from botanicals--and seems to be really good for his skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s developed into a pleasurable weekly ritual, and I&#x27;ve been looking for ways to perfect</li>
            <li>Leaves my face feeling fresh and gives me a great shave.</li>

            <li>look that I love.  </li>
            <li>My favorite shave.  </li>
            <li>Every Man Jack Gel has been great so far!</li>
            <li>I started when Fred the Barber retired, and the new kids weren&#x27;t as good.  </li>
            <li>Every Saturday morning, I shave my husband&#x27;s head for the smooth soldier of fortune</li>
            <li>The Feather blade skates smoothly around swells and swails, no nicks.  </li>
            <li>Jack shave gel for $5.00 each on line with free shipping over $25.  </li>
            <li>Good all natural shaving gel.</li>
            <li>The Every Man Jack gel foamed up quickly and made shaving  twice as easy as before.  </li>
            <li>Amazon reviews inspired me to try Headblade, which was fun, and closer, but more fun than closer.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for years and can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li>First, a warm steaming towel wrap, then I warm the Jack briefly in my hands before I smooth it around his scalp, massaging gently.  </li>
            <li>Just a super shave in all respects.</li>
            <li>Many of the shaving creams on the EWG website that quality as toxin-free are either the old style soaps or come in a tune.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t foam up like other gels, but gives a good lubricating, slippery layer on your face.</li>
            <li>Takes very little gel to get a great shave.</li>
            <li>I just married to change to a fragrance-free shaving cream, since I&#x27;m allergic to perfume.  </li>
            <li>interesting especially when you whip the lather to creamy consistency.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely end up ordering more.</li>
            <li>Graduated to a Merkur shaver with Feather Blades, which took very little to adapt to for a superior shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this very highly.</li>
            <li>My husband really likes it, and I do too.  </li>
            <li>I use the Environmental Working Group (EWG) website to find personal products that are free of toxins.</li>
            <li>This is a quality shave gel that has been very helpful in minimizing ingrown hairs, and also preventing razor burn.  </li>
            <li>When I touch up at the end, I dampen my fingers to find the sandpaper parts, and there is still enough lube to shave them completely smooth when dampened.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smooth shaves, no nicks, no dyes or fragrance, can lasts 2 months with daily use.</li>
            <li>: looks like semen...for real</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>New to head shaving.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and have not had any problems with this product.</li>
            <li>I have used the standard commercial foam shave gels and the creams, then switched to healthier less synthetic products including Aveno sensitive skin, and then Alba Mango cream (which made my face turn red and hurt), then later Avalon Organics shave gel for sensitive skin which is one of the best shaving lotions that I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve figured for him so far.  </li>
            <li>A previously hard to shave beard became soft and the razor now easily glides across my face with Every Man Jack.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more expensive than most shave cream, but no better.  </li>
            <li>I opted to try this out because I had been using Gillette Pure and Sensitive shave gel, but apparent quality control problems started cropping up (e.g. propellent leaks meaning you could only use half the canister!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>This is the only cruelty free product I have found that my boyfriend will use without complaint.&lt;br /&gt;Yay - no more &amp;#34;Barbarsol&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li>This was hard to track down, but so glad I did.  </li>

            <li> I asked the man I just married to change to a fragrance-free shaving cream, since I&#x27;m allergic to perfume.  This was hard to track down, but so glad I did.  My husband really likes it, and I do too.  The gel creates a nice creamy foam for shaving.  It has a pleasant, mild fragrance from botanicals--and seems to be really good for his skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this product with the HeadBlade.  It&#x27;s more expensive than most shave cream, but no better.  Probably will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is the only shave gel/cream I can use.  It works better than everything else I have tried over the years.  I use it with a Merkur double edge safety razor.</li>
            <li> This is the only cruelty free product I have found that my boyfriend will use without complaint.&lt;br /&gt;Yay - no more &amp;#34;Barbarsol&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> I use the Environmental Working Group (EWG) website to find personal products that are free of toxins. It&#x27;s very hard to find a shaving cream that does not contain fragrances; all of the ones carried at major drug store chains have fragrances and other bad chemicals that give me headaches. Many of the shaving creams on the EWG website that quality as toxin-free are either the old style soaps or come in a tune. This is the OnLY mens shaving cream (gel) I could find that comes in a pressurized can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works as well as the mainstream brand shaving gels without the nasty fragrances or chemicals and I kind of like the smell. Please support this brand.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and can&#x27;t say enough good things about it. I bought it because it lacks all the ridiculous chemicals that mainstream shaving companies have been dumping on us for decades.  Every Man doesn&#x27;t test on animals either.&lt;br /&gt;This gel works great and proves you don&#x27;t need all those chemicals made out of petroleum to provide a great shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m prone to ingrown hair, as I have thick facial hair.  This is a quality shave gel that has been very helpful in minimizing ingrown hairs, and also preventing razor burn.  I have very sensitive skin, and have not had any problems with this product.</li>
            <li> Every Saturday morning, I shave my husband&#x27;s head for the smooth soldier of fortune look that I love.  I started when Fred the Barber retired, and the new kids weren&#x27;t as good.  It&#x27;s developed into a pleasurable weekly ritual, and I&#x27;ve been looking for ways to perfect it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gilette shaver was fine, although not as close as I would have liked.  Amazon reviews inspired me to try Headblade, which was fun, and closer, but more fun than closer.  And a bit of a pain to change blades.  Began using a boar brush and cup of lather.  interesting especially when you whip the lather to creamy consistency. Graduated to a Merkur shaver with Feather Blades, which took very little to adapt to for a superior shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Everyman Jack Cream in a tube was totally it&#x27;s own thing.  SERIOUSLY great lubrication.  In fact too much, because it was so thick and globby that it took a long time to rinse the blade as I shaved him.  So I tried Everyman Jack gel in the aerosol can-- and I&#x27;m about to order my third can.  It has all the lube that the cream has, but lighter consistency (10w40 versus crisco).  It&#x27;s easier to use in aerosol, and it takes very little -- maybe a large walnut size, but not a golf ball. First, a warm steaming towel wrap, then I warm the Jack briefly in my hands before I smooth it around his scalp, massaging gently.  The Feather blade skates smoothly around swells and swails, no nicks.  When I touch up at the end, I dampen my fingers to find the sandpaper parts, and there is still enough lube to shave them completely smooth when dampened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best damn shave I&#x27;ve figured for him so far.  Further suggestions always welcomed.</li>
            <li> i was looking for something without all the chemicals (e.g. paba, sodium lauryl sulfate, peg, etc) and this product fit the bill perfectly.  great shave without irritation, skin feels great afterwards and it&#x27;s a great value price-wise.</li>
            <li> My favorite shave.  No strong smell.</li>
            <li> I opted to try this out because I had been using Gillette Pure and Sensitive shave gel, but apparent quality control problems started cropping up (e.g. propellent leaks meaning you could only use half the canister!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Every Man Jack Gel has been great so far! I think I get an even smoother and closer shave, no irritation at all.  I&#x27;ll definitely end up ordering more.</li>
            <li> Good all natural shaving gel. I only use this now.</li>
            <li> New to head shaving.  Read reviews and made this choice.  6 weeks of shaving without a nick.  I will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> No better shaving creme out there. Leaves my face feeling fresh and gives me a great shave.</li>
            <li> Smooth shaves, no nicks, no dyes or fragrance, can lasts 2 months with daily use. It doesn&#x27;t foam up like other gels, but gives a good lubricating, slippery layer on your face. Takes very little gel to get a great shave. What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
            <li> Great for sensative skin!!!</li>
            <li> Ordered as a gift, recipient was delighted!</li>
            <li> Good: soft slick and CFC free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad: looks like semen...for real</li>
            <li> it came in differently looking canister. it worked very nice on my legs. it doesn&#x27;t have obnoxious smell</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been experimenting with some different shaving creams, and this one has blown the others away. Just a super shave in all respects. Good lather, very smooth, felt great. I&#x27;d recommend this very highly.</li>
            <li> I have used the standard commercial foam shave gels and the creams, then switched to healthier less synthetic products including Aveno sensitive skin, and then Alba Mango cream (which made my face turn red and hurt), then later Avalon Organics shave gel for sensitive skin which is one of the best shaving lotions that I have tried.  However, when I switched to Every Man Jack Gel for Sensitive skin,  I was shocked at just how much better Every Man Jack was over all the others.  The Every Man Jack gel foamed up quickly and made shaving  twice as easy as before.  A previously hard to shave beard became soft and the razor now easily glides across my face with Every Man Jack.  Highly recommended.  You will not be disappointed.    Walgreens sells cans of Every Man Jack shave gel for $5.00 each on line with free shipping over $25.  Not in their store.</li>
