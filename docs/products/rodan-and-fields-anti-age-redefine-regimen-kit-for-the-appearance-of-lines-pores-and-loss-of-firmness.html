            <li>Oh yes you can make money by joining this amazing company and share your journey with others.</li>
            <li>I used this product and liked it</li>
            <li>Honestly, I wasn&#x27;t looking for skin care.  </li>
            <li>These products are super nourishing and are filled with the best anti age fighting ingredients out there</li>
            <li>It seems many on here are consultants and of course have their own regime in mind which bothers me.  </li>
            <li>Amazing product I Skin feels and looks healthy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure R+F is amazing for most...</li>
            <li>And the most sought after.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to do your research, and cease application immediately if you start having a reaction and do not follow their advice to &#x27;give it a try and let your skin adjust&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>Going through a consultant is better than purchasing via private-60 day money</li>
            <li>There are many more products out there</li>
            <li>Also the blue and silver squishy things are excellent.</li>
            <li>Proactiv is still among the top selling skin care line in the world.  </li>
            <li>They all state &amp;#34;they are not associated with Rodan and Fields&amp;#34; because if they identify with Rodan and Fields then they will no longer be able to get the products to sell.</li>
            <li>I love Rodan and Fields...</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this product..</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels soooooooo much better since using this.</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t believe how much better the R&amp;F Redefine was for me.</li>
            <li>I love my Rodan + Fields products....</li>
            <li>i love this product every one of them.</li>
            <li>My skin looks SO much better</li>
            <li>This is a great product and I would highly recommend it -</li>
            <li>The texture, smell, and feel of the various products in this regimen are very pleasant.</li>
            <li>You will not regret this purchase, nor becoming an affiliated consultant.</li>
            <li>I loved the product so much that I started telling all of my friends about it.  </li>
            <li>This is way more than what these products are originally priced at.  </li>
            <li>I took out my camera and snapped some &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; pictures all excited to see the results that everyone claims would be caused by this outstanding product.</li>
            <li>So when divided by months it really is not bad at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peace!</li>
            <li>A lot of these ratings are super biased (super upvoted/down voted) but im actually pretty happy with this product.</li>
            <li>Or more like - Yeah, right!</li>
            <li>I  felt that my skin was fine.  </li>
            <li>Can already see and feel a huge difference in my skin and skin tone.</li>
            <li>(Free shipping comes with being a Preferred Customer)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had great skin, but recently stumbled upon r+f redefine regimen + macro exfoliator + AMP MD</li>
            <li>get it through a consultant, become a preferred customer and get a discount plus free shipping...</li>
            <li>Risk free.</li>
            <li>You can just re order unless you spend 80 to get free shipping.  </li>
            <li>Completely ruined my smoother than a baby&#x27;s butt / near flawless skin</li>
            <li>While I would love nothing more than to throw my contact information on here and beg for you to select me as your Rodan and Fields consultant, I do not find it to be an ethical business</li>
            <li>Worth EVERY penny!</li>
            <li>Am using full line of Redefine notice a huge difference in 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This cost is more than getting it directly from a consultant and might not be authentic</li>
            <li>Toner - nothing special.</li>
            <li>My daughters thought I had changed make-up because my skin looked so good - this was only after using it a couple of weeks!</li>
            <li>Pay the one time &amp;#34;perks&amp;#34; price of 20 bucks and be confident your getting the real stuff at a cheaper price.</li>
            <li>Yes arrived quickly..........</li>
            <li>I am not the sort of person who gives up quickly.</li>
            <li>The products are really good and worth the money because they do last about three months.</li>
            <li>If you are consistent, like anything else, you will see results too!</li>
            <li>The price here on Amazon is pretty high, the people who sell the products from home offer much better deals.</li>
            <li>Besides how could a company be sky rocketing with success if the products did not</li>
            <li>back guaranteed (empty bottle), solution tool (decide on what product is best to use on your skin), and nurse.  </li>
            <li>Many of you may be surprised to learn thar Drs.</li>
            <li>Also you can order just what you need directly through the consultant and most important have help being directed to what you really need for your skin type.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, I have to write my own personal story....</li>
            <li>If I have a full faced make-up, then yes, I do use a cleanser first, then the 2 minute mask, toner, then PM cream.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money but $199 on Amazon?</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t cure acne, but you can control the cycle and stop it with the right products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and we all know what a flop that was, right?</li>
            <li>how can otc brands that cost less be as good?  </li>
            <li>but I use these because they are super gentle with my eczema</li>
            <li>There are several regimens from Rodan + Fields,  how can you be sure you are getting the right one by reading descriptions and reviews?&lt;br /&gt;Get</li>
            <li>These 2 doctors who created not only rodan and fields, but also proactiv are the most respected in the world.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend RF products!!  </li>
            <li>First off, yes - I guess this does work, but for the price?</li>
            <li>So you must first wash your face with another cleanser in order to remove your make-up (Or</li>
            <li>Most companies only offer 30 days.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re interested in a discount, email me amorin31@yahoo.com</li>
            <li>First off, I am NOT a consultant but a customer of a consultant.</li>
            <li>For those who are breaking out, I did too for the first week then my skin adjusted.</li>
            <li>First I want to say that these products are really Rodan and Fields products  because the Rodan and Fields consultants are supplying the products to these companies to sell.</li>
            <li>The Compliance  team is watching these sells and pretty soon everyone will know who they really are.</li>
            <li>Not only will you get better pricing than what is offered on amazon you will also receive free shipping and the 60 day money back guarantee from the company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I see fine lines diminished and my skin overall fresher looking.  </li>
            <li>It was a hard sell by a relative who previously rarely contacted me, suddenly I was friended on fb, phone calls etc like we were best friends.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Again do research,  there are otc brands that cost just as much.</li>
            <li>I really did try to stick this out</li>
            <li>The products are real</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the people or stores selling that aren&#x27;t real.  </li>
            <li>Does absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li>If you really want to try these products let me help you out with cheaper prices and a guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really like it and is affordable</li>
            <li>the real results of ANY regimen will not come until AFTER you have rode out this process.</li>
            <li>It really has helped even my skin tone and even form my skin.</li>
            <li>So much cheaper going thru a consultant...</li>
            <li>Real medicine cost thousands and you have to put High amounts in to get results.  </li>
            <li>They are also very gentle on sensitive skin like mine.</li>
            <li>Also mild burning/stinging is ALSO normal, as with anti aging products you are technically exfoliating the wrinkles out of your skin- weather</li>
            <li>Not technically a scam, I suppose, but not anywhere worth the money.</li>
            <li>I felt you all should know this is completely NORMAL.</li>
            <li>Love the product, but don&#x27;t waste your money here.  </li>
            <li>but my face texture is super smooth and even instead of the usual patchy, peely, sensitive skin I have.</li>
            <li>1.)- if you are buying products second hand you really have no idea what your getting, they could be expired,  the creams do not come with a seal, how would you know if the real products were removed?&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention this is against policy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can get MUCH higher quality products for the same price ( just hit Saks, Nordstrom, Sephora, etc).&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>I actually stopped using it for a couple of months and switched to Timewise from Mary Kay (only because like I said I&#x27;ve tried everything and like to give as many things as possible a try)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read some of the comments as to where you have to first use a regular cleanser before the mask...</li>
            <li>All skin is not equal that&#x27;s why there are four different packages for your special skin type.</li>
            <li>Also the AM/PM cream is not greasy (I have combo skin as well) and only requires a super tiny bit.</li>
            <li>Someone actually thought I was pregnant because of my sudden and fierce breakouts.</li>
            <li>So youcan continue to buy diluted down products or spend a little more and get the right meds, with amounts that will change skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was a huge waste of money.</li>
            <li>It is truly amazing and the reason I faithfully stand behind it as a part time consultant.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t experience any breakouts nor did it clear up any acne</li>
            <li>I have always considered myself to have somewhat sensitive skin</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t all too surprised about that.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I am very neutral on these products and unsure if I will order again.......</li>
            <li>and hey it&#x27;s never too early to start this kinda stuff.</li>
            <li>so far i find it a bit drying , i used dr helen pansantis retinol and roc and they were not as drying</li>
            <li>However these products are cheaper directly frm Rodan and Fields Consultants.</li>
            <li>I am 45 years old</li>
            <li>/&gt;To find a consultant near you go to rodanandfields.com</li>
            <li>Ultimately I joined the company and now am making money selling Rodan + Fields and getting my favorite product for less!  </li>
            <li>Never in a million years would I poke holes in my face, the potential for infection is way too high and</li>
            <li>Once I explained that I had already reached CS and that they were the ones to instruct reaching out to the nurse, and inquired why I was getting the runaround, I recieved no valid explanation except that they would be willing to go out of their way to extend the return policy for partial refund of what I&#x27;m assuming is the unused portion...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much cheaper if you buy from an actual consultant&#x27;s web site, plus you get a 60 day money back guarantee.</li>
            <li>For the people who state it&#x27;s the same as drugstore brands &amp; high retail brands, your obviously uneducated.  </li>
            <li>BUT you should not bother buying through any channels outside of a direct consultant with Rodan and Fields.</li>
            <li>Rodan and Field are the same doctors that developed Proactiv</li>
            <li>However, you should only purchase these direct from a Rodan + Fields consultant.</li>
            <li>I used it and then went forward to try other products and would go back to this if it was sold at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>apparently the legnth of the needles are too short to stimulate the collagen response that you get at a derm spa.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money but $199 on Amazon?</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t cure acne, but you can control the cycle and stop it with the right products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and we all know what a flop that was, right?</li>
            <li> how can otc brands that cost less be as good?  </li>
            <li> but I use these because they are super gentle with my eczema</li>
            <li> There are several regimens from Rodan + Fields,  how can you be sure you are getting the right one by reading descriptions and reviews?&lt;br /&gt;Get</li>
            <li> These 2 doctors who created not only rodan and fields, but also proactiv are the most respected in the world.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend RF products!!  </li>
            <li> First off, yes - I guess this does work, but for the price?</li>
            <li> So you must first wash your face with another cleanser in order to remove your make-up (Or</li>
            <li> Most companies only offer 30 days.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re interested in a discount, email me amorin31@yahoo.com</li>
            <li> First off, I am NOT a consultant but a customer of a consultant.</li>
            <li> For those who are breaking out, I did too for the first week then my skin adjusted.</li>
            <li> First I want to say that these products are really Rodan and Fields products  because the Rodan and Fields consultants are supplying the products to these companies to sell.</li>
            <li> The Compliance  team is watching these sells and pretty soon everyone will know who they really are.</li>
            <li> Not only will you get better pricing than what is offered on amazon you will also receive free shipping and the 60 day money back guarantee from the company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I see fine lines diminished and my skin overall fresher looking.  </li>
            <li> It was a hard sell by a relative who previously rarely contacted me, suddenly I was friended on fb, phone calls etc like we were best friends.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Again do research,  there are otc brands that cost just as much.</li>
            <li> I really did try to stick this out</li>
            <li> The products are real</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the people or stores selling that aren&#x27;t real.  </li>
            <li> Does absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li> If you really want to try these products let me help you out with cheaper prices and a guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really like it and is affordable</li>
            <li> the real results of ANY regimen will not come until AFTER you have rode out this process.</li>
            <li> It really has helped even my skin tone and even form my skin.</li>
            <li> So much cheaper going thru a consultant...</li>
            <li> Real medicine cost thousands and you have to put High amounts in to get results.  </li>
            <li> They are also very gentle on sensitive skin like mine.</li>
            <li> Also mild burning/stinging is ALSO normal, as with anti aging products you are technically exfoliating the wrinkles out of your skin- weather</li>
            <li> Not technically a scam, I suppose, but not anywhere worth the money.</li>
            <li> I felt you all should know this is completely NORMAL.</li>
            <li> Love the product, but don&#x27;t waste your money here.  </li>
            <li> but my face texture is super smooth and even instead of the usual patchy, peely, sensitive skin I have.</li>
            <li> 1.)- if you are buying products second hand you really have no idea what your getting, they could be expired,  the creams do not come with a seal, how would you know if the real products were removed?&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention this is against policy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can get MUCH higher quality products for the same price ( just hit Saks, Nordstrom, Sephora, etc).&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> I actually stopped using it for a couple of months and switched to Timewise from Mary Kay (only because like I said I&#x27;ve tried everything and like to give as many things as possible a try)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read some of the comments as to where you have to first use a regular cleanser before the mask...</li>
            <li> All skin is not equal that&#x27;s why there are four different packages for your special skin type.</li>
            <li> Also the AM/PM cream is not greasy (I have combo skin as well) and only requires a super tiny bit.</li>
            <li> Someone actually thought I was pregnant because of my sudden and fierce breakouts.</li>
            <li> So youcan continue to buy diluted down products or spend a little more and get the right meds, with amounts that will change skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was a huge waste of money.</li>
            <li> It is truly amazing and the reason I faithfully stand behind it as a part time consultant.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t experience any breakouts nor did it clear up any acne</li>
            <li> I have always considered myself to have somewhat sensitive skin</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t all too surprised about that.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I am very neutral on these products and unsure if I will order again.......</li>
            <li> and hey it&#x27;s never too early to start this kinda stuff.</li>
            <li> so far i find it a bit drying , i used dr helen pansantis retinol and roc and they were not as drying</li>
            <li> However these products are cheaper directly frm Rodan and Fields Consultants.</li>
            <li> I am 45 years old</li>
            <li> /&gt;To find a consultant near you go to rodanandfields.com</li>
            <li> Ultimately I joined the company and now am making money selling Rodan + Fields and getting my favorite product for less!  </li>
            <li> Never in a million years would I poke holes in my face, the potential for infection is way too high and</li>
            <li> Once I explained that I had already reached CS and that they were the ones to instruct reaching out to the nurse, and inquired why I was getting the runaround, I recieved no valid explanation except that they would be willing to go out of their way to extend the return policy for partial refund of what I&#x27;m assuming is the unused portion...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much cheaper if you buy from an actual consultant&#x27;s web site, plus you get a 60 day money back guarantee.</li>
            <li> For the people who state it&#x27;s the same as drugstore brands &amp; high retail brands, your obviously uneducated.  </li>
            <li> BUT you should not bother buying through any channels outside of a direct consultant with Rodan and Fields.</li>
            <li> Rodan and Field are the same doctors that developed Proactiv</li>
            <li> However, you should only purchase these direct from a Rodan + Fields consultant.</li>
            <li> I used it and then went forward to try other products and would go back to this if it was sold at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> apparently the legnth of the needles are too short to stimulate the collagen response that you get at a derm spa.</li>
            <li> Long story short, I tried the Redefine Regimine (also known as the Anti Age Regimine) and I was hooked.  </li>
            <li> Harsh product, damaged my skin and took 6 weeks of my previous regimen to get my skin right.</li>
            <li> Of course when you start using a new skin care regimen you will have a few breakouts...</li>
            <li> Give it a try, 60 day empty bottle money back guarantee.</li>
            <li> If your skeptical buy it and use it yourself and not take advice from the negative reviews, make your own judgment and get your money back if you don&#x27;t like</li>
            <li> You need to allow it to dry for 2 minutes, then wash it off.</li>
            <li> My psoriasis patches came back and started itching again when I started using the Mary Kay Timewise and within a few days back on the Redefine Regimen (which was almost 2 months ago)</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m now scarred all over my face  #bitter</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try the \\&quot;Reverse\\&quot; regimen next, to tackle my uneven skin tone and sun damage.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I am going to try the product the other posted suggested.</li>
            <li> I seemed to take a while to receive compared to other things I order from Amazon</li>
            <li> She has thrown away all of her other products, including La Mer, Sicily and Chanel!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you try one regimine and find that it is not right for you, the company will put you in touch with their nurse and help you find the product that works for your type of skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Add it up and remember RF regimens last at least 2 months, sometimes longer.  </li>
            <li> it is derma-abrasion or a &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34;, it is breaking down the layers of your skin to reveal the rejuvenated layers UNDERNEATH.</li>
            <li> Rodan + Fields return rate is 1% or less</li>
            <li> my skin feels tighter (less saggy).</li>
            <li> Sadly I will have to leave this theater early!!</li>
            <li> and they will do a skincare consultant and then narrow down the products that YOU</li>
            <li> I saw little if any improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> What you got to loose!!!!</li>
            <li> R+F is not cheap.</li>
            <li> These prices listed here are also ridiculously expensive compared to R+F direct pricing.</li>
            <li> I have never seen a product line so heavily promoted by those making money off of it.</li>
            <li> If you have a drawer of products that don&#x27;t deliver results don&#x27;t waste your time buying more.&lt;br /&gt;Seriously!</li>
            <li> Seems pointless to me, but</li>
            <li> If you are looking to feel nostalgic and would like to rewind back to your pubescent years than hey, this product is for you!!</li>
            <li> No better way to go.</li>
            <li> The products are expensive and don&#x27;t in any way give the results shown on the obviously retouched after photos.</li>
            <li> I also have a couple small patches of psoriasis on my face and since I&#x27;ve been using this product I haven&#x27;t had one flare up..</li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive skin by any means, yet these products broke my face out horribly.</li>
            <li> I paid all that money to improve my skin, instead I have the worst facial skin I&#x27;ve seen in years.</li>
            <li> Needless to say....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the person who will stay and watch a terrible movie to the end (even after half the theater walked out after 20 minutes).</li>
            <li> Awful.</li>
            <li> Now my face is so terrible that I am embarrassed to go out of the house.</li>
            <li> TERRIBLE product!  </li>
            <li> This stuff is terrible, really terrible.</li>
            <li> Terrible breakout from this.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> 1.)- if you are buying products second hand you really have no idea what your getting, they could be expired,  the creams do not come with a seal, how would you know if the real products were removed?&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention this is against policy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.) If you buy here you don&#x27;t get the 60 day money back guarantee!  If your skeptical buy it and use it yourself and not take advice from the negative reviews, make your own judgment and get your money back if you don&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.) Rodan + Fields return rate is 1% or less&lt;br /&gt;that speaks volumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.) For the people who state it&#x27;s the same as drugstore brands &amp; high retail brands, your obviously uneducated.  This is the ONLY brand out there with pharmaceuticals to transform skin being the closest to a prescription.  You don&#x27;t have to believe me, look at before and afters.  Besides how could a company be sky rocketing with success if the products did not deliver?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.) These 2 doctors who created not only rodan and fields, but also proactiv are the most respected in the world.  And the most sought after.  Stanford trained, they still practice dermatology,  I think they know what they are doing and they would not put their names on a product if they did not believe in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6.) For those who breakout, you don&#x27;t need this regimen you need unblemish for acne.  You can&#x27;t cure acne, but you can control the cycle and stop it with the right products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7.) There are several regimens from Rodan + Fields,  how can you be sure you are getting the right one by reading descriptions and reviews?&lt;br /&gt;Get with a Rodan + Fields consultant and they will do a skincare consultant and then narrow down the products that YOU need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8.) If you have a drawer of products that don&#x27;t deliver results don&#x27;t waste your time buying more.&lt;br /&gt;Seriously! how can otc brands that cost less be as good?  Real medicine cost thousands and you have to put High amounts in to get results.  So youcan continue to buy diluted down products or spend a little more and get the right meds, with amounts that will change skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again do research,  there are otc brands that cost just as much. (A regimen consist of wash, toner, am cream &amp; pm cream)  Add it up and remember RF regimens last at least 2 months, sometimes longer.  So when divided by months it really is not bad at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peace!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure R+F is amazing for most... Completely ruined my smoother than a baby&#x27;s butt / near flawless skin and I&#x27;m now scarred all over my face  #bitter #scarredforlife #scared&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted their Customer Support and was instructed to contact their &#x27;Nurse&#x27;. After 3-4 business days and multiple follow up emails, she reached out and instructed me to contact Customer Support... Once I explained that I had already reached CS and that they were the ones to instruct reaching out to the nurse, and inquired why I was getting the runaround, I recieved no valid explanation except that they would be willing to go out of their way to extend the return policy for partial refund of what I&#x27;m assuming is the unused portion... And not a refund for the portion/product that actually the caused the damage to my skin. R+F is not cheap. Make sure to do your research, and cease application immediately if you start having a reaction and do not follow their advice to &#x27;give it a try and let your skin adjust&#x27;.  Definitely not for everyone</li>
            <li> My daughters thought I had changed make-up because my skin looked so good - this was only after using it a couple of weeks!</li>
            <li> These products are amazing BUT you should not bother buying through any channels outside of a direct consultant with Rodan and Fields. Only through a consultant do you get a 60-day satisfaction guarantee. These prices listed here are also ridiculously expensive compared to R+F direct pricing. People selling on outside channels should be ashamed of themselves.</li>
            <li> BEST skincare products! Worth EVERY penny!</li>
            <li> Redefine has re-fined wrinkles on my forehead and added moisture back into my skin!!  I highly recommend RF products!!  Going through a consultant is better than purchasing via private-60 day money back guaranteed (empty bottle), solution tool (decide on what product is best to use on your skin), and nurse.  Not every RF product designed for one person fits A-L-L so I suggest using the solution tool.</li>
            <li> Since using the product my face has been breaking out like a teenager&#x27;s.  I paid all that money to improve my skin, instead I have the worst facial skin I&#x27;ve seen in years.</li>
            <li> This cost is more than getting it directly from a consultant and might not be authentic&lt;br /&gt;Www.amybuzzell.myrandf.com</li>
            <li> This is way more than what these products are originally priced at.  Also, you don&#x27;t get a 60 money back guarantee and you have no way of knowing if these products are expired.</li>
            <li> First off, yes - I guess this does work, but for the price? Forget it! You can get MUCH higher quality products for the same price ( just hit Saks, Nordstrom, Sephora, etc).&lt;br /&gt;All these reviewers saying you should &amp;#34;buy from a consultant&amp;#34; because of the 60 day guarantee ARE consultants looking to make money off of you!&lt;br /&gt;That said... here is my opinion of this product line&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) the cleansing mask is in fact a mask - it does NOT remove make-up, etc. So you must first wash your face with another cleanser in order to remove your make-up (Or purchase R +F Redefine makeup remover wipes). Once this is done then you apply the cleansing mask. You need to allow it to dry for 2 minutes, then wash it off. Seems pointless to me, but hey? What do I know!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Toner - nothing special. Worked the same as any toner I&#x27;ve purchased from the drug store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) AM Cream - worked as well as drug store creams. Personally I prefer Bliss moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) PM Cream - left my face feeling greasy no matter how frugal I was when applying the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy this again? No way. This was a huge waste of money. I saw little if any improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> I love Rodan and Fields Redefine line!  The mask is awesome...  I put it on, brush my teeth, then rinse it off...  Followed with toner and moisturizer I see fine lines diminished and my skin overall fresher looking.  I have tried LOTS of face lotions and potions, but Redefine is a great combination for my skin and I will stick with it!</li>
            <li> very pleased with this product</li>
            <li> Not technically a scam, I suppose, but not anywhere worth the money.</li>
            <li> I used this product and liked it but, found it to be way overpriced and I did buy from a consultant.  It seems many on here are consultants and of course have their own regime in mind which bothers me.  I used it and then went forward to try other products and would go back to this if it was sold at a reasonable price.  There are many more products out there which I will try before ever going back to R&amp;F&#x27;s because of the price.  Came on today looking to see if the price had changed but, of course it has not so I am going to try the product the other posted suggested.</li>
            <li> I wanted to order this from somewhere besides my friends as to not to have to &amp;#34;chose&amp;#34;.  I seemed to take a while to receive compared to other things I order from Amazon and perhaps my impatience got to me a bit on that.  I like the facial cleaner and toner but I cannot use the am &amp; pm moisturizers as they make my face feel &amp;#34;greazy&amp;#34; and the am moisturizer breaks me out.  I have always considered myself to have somewhat sensitive skin so I wasn&#x27;t all too surprised about that.  I do use the pm moisturizer around my eyes.  Overall, I am very neutral on these products and unsure if I will order again.......</li>
            <li> Awful. Made me break out in giant, festering, scabby pimples around my mouth. Used it for four days, but it will take weeks for these scabs to heal. Let&#x27;s hope they don&#x27;t scar.</li>
            <li> A lot of these ratings are super biased (super upvoted/down voted) but im actually pretty happy with this product. I am only 22 but I use these because they are super gentle with my eczema and hey it&#x27;s never too early to start this kinda stuff. I didn&#x27;t experience any breakouts nor did it clear up any acne but my face texture is super smooth and even instead of the usual patchy, peely, sensitive skin I have. My mom uses some sticky wrinkle stuff and it helped with her facial lines. Also the blue and silver squishy things are excellent. Definitely would buy again. Also the AM/PM cream is not greasy (I have combo skin as well) and only requires a super tiny bit. The price here on Amazon is pretty high, the people who sell the products from home offer much better deals.</li>
            <li> Yes arrived quickly..........love this product!</li>
            <li> If you are looking to feel nostalgic and would like to rewind back to your pubescent years than hey, this product is for you!! I started this product four weeks ago. I took out my camera and snapped some &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; pictures all excited to see the results that everyone claims would be caused by this outstanding product. Now my face is so terrible that I am embarrassed to go out of the house. Someone actually thought I was pregnant because of my sudden and fierce breakouts. I have four kidney bean sized eruptions on my face.  Before I tried this I was complaining that my 34 year skin was beginning to wrinkle. Ha, to think I was complaining then. I hope that after I stop using this product my face can hopefully look how it did.  Just for the record... I am not the sort of person who gives up quickly. I really did try to stick this out but it&#x27;s not looking hopeful. I&#x27;m the person who will stay and watch a terrible movie to the end (even after half the theater walked out after 20 minutes). Sadly I will have to leave this theater early!! Needless to say....TERRIBLE product!  Save your money and your skin!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this regimen from an R+F consultant, and have used it for 60 days, along with the R+F needle roller. I&#x27;ve been very impressed. My skin looks and feels great, my lines are diminished, and my skin feels tighter (less saggy). The texture, smell, and feel of the various products in this regimen are very pleasant. I&#x27;m going to try the \\&quot;Reverse\\&quot; regimen next, to tackle my uneven skin tone and sun damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to add here, also, that I paid only $174 for this regimen, plus tax. (Free shipping comes with being a Preferred Customer) So about $60 cheaper to buy from a consultant&#x27;s R+F website.</li>
            <li> While I would love nothing more than to throw my contact information on here and beg for you to select me as your Rodan and Fields consultant, I do not find it to be an ethical business practice.&lt;br /&gt;I will however inform you that this product changed my life.  It is truly amazing and the reason I faithfully stand behind it as a part time consultant. The proof is in the pudding. Try it and you will be amazed with the results.  Many of you may be surprised to learn thar Drs. Rodan and Field are the same doctors that developed Proactiv and we all know what a flop that was, right? Or more like - Yeah, right! Proactiv is still among the top selling skin care line in the world.  You will not regret this purchase, nor becoming an affiliated consultant. The results sell the product, not you.</li>
            <li> I use this combined with the AMP MD roller and have had some INCREDIBLE results after 5 months!  If you are consistent, like anything else, you will see results too!</li>
            <li> First I want to say that these products are really Rodan and Fields products  because the Rodan and Fields consultants are supplying the products to these companies to sell. The only way for these sellers to have access to Rodan and Fields products are through Rodan and Fields or from a Rodan and Fields consultant. They all state &amp;#34;they are not associated with Rodan and Fields&amp;#34; because if they identify with Rodan and Fields then they will no longer be able to get the products to sell. The Compliance  team is watching these sells and pretty soon everyone will know who they really are. The products are real it&#x27;s the people or stores selling that aren&#x27;t real.  It is cheaper to buy from a Rodan and Fields consultant. The products are really good and worth the money because they do last about three months. Also you can order just what you need directly through the consultant and most important have help being directed to what you really need for your skin type.</li>
            <li> Harsh product, damaged my skin and took 6 weeks of my previous regimen to get my skin right. Told it is a miracle anti aging product, not for me. Beware.</li>
            <li> i only bought the night creme with retinol and used one so far i find it a bit drying , i used dr helen pansantis retinol and roc and they were not as drying</li>
            <li> This stuff is terrible, really terrible. I do not have sensitive skin by any means, yet these products broke my face out horribly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had great skin, but recently stumbled upon r+f redefine regimen + macro exfoliator + AMP MD and it is a godsend. I will recommend anyone and everyone to this skin care brand. #4 in premium skin care brands in the US, but I agree it is over priced on amazon- get it through a consultant, become a preferred customer and get a discount plus free shipping... No better way to go. Of course when you start using a new skin care regimen you will have a few breakouts... Don&#x27;t nix it because of that, give your skin time to adjust and then the best skin you have ever had will shine through. Give it a try, 60 day empty bottle money back guarantee. Risk free.</li>
            <li> Terrible breakout from this.</li>
            <li> Does absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li> Amazing anti aging line. These products are super nourishing and are filled with the best anti age fighting ingredients out there (I&#x27;ve done my research). They are also very gentle on sensitive skin like mine. However these products are cheaper directly frm Rodan and Fields Consultants.</li>
            <li> I found Rodan + Fields by accident.  Honestly, I wasn&#x27;t looking for skin care.  I  felt that my skin was fine.  Long story short, I tried the Redefine Regimine (also known as the Anti Age Regimine) and I was hooked.  I didn&#x27;t realize how dehydrated my skin had been.  Within weeks of using the Redefine System my skin was fuller, dewier and younger looking.  The texture of my skin has totally changed.  I don&#x27;t wear foundation anymore!!  I loved the product so much that I started telling all of my friends about it.  Ultimately I joined the company and now am making money selling Rodan + Fields and getting my favorite product for less!  You can&#x27;t beat that!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For people who are thinking about trying Rodan + Fields, they offer a 60 day money back guarantee!  Most companies only offer 30 days.  Additionally they have four different regimines to choose from, because not everyone has the same type of skin.  If you try one regimine and find that it is not right for you, the company will put you in touch with their nurse and help you find the product that works for your type of skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I have to write my own personal story.... I am used to receiving a big hug when I see my mother.  Not anymore.  Now, instead of hugging me, she takes my hand and places it on her face saying, \\&quot;Feel my skin! Feel my skin!\\&quot;.  She is 70 and the Redefine Regemine has dramatically changed the texture and appearance of her skin.  She has thrown away all of her other products, including La Mer, Sicily and Chanel!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is best to purchase Rodan + Fields from a representative in the company.  That way you can get your 60 day money back guarantee.  Call the company to find a rep in your area.  It will be the best skin of your life!!</li>
            <li> I love Rodan and Fields...however we are not supposed to be selling the products like this. It&#x27;s much cheaper if you buy from an actual consultant&#x27;s web site, plus you get a 60 day money back guarantee. If you really want to try these products let me help you out with cheaper prices and a guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> I suspect all the 5 star reviews are from consultants. I have never seen a product line so heavily promoted by those making money off of it. The products are expensive and don&#x27;t in any way give the results shown on the obviously retouched after photos. I used to products for aging skin, and bought the derm roller before I knew what it was. It was a hard sell by a relative who previously rarely contacted me, suddenly I was friended on fb, phone calls etc like we were best friends.Never in a million years would I poke holes in my face, the potential for infection is way too high and apparently the legnth of the needles are too short to stimulate the collagen response that you get at a derm spa.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product.. I am 45 years old and I feel like I&#x27;ve tried everything out there for my skin. I also have a couple small patches of psoriasis on my face and since I&#x27;ve been using this product I haven&#x27;t had one flare up.. My skin looks and feels soooooooo much better since using this. I actually stopped using it for a couple of months and switched to Timewise from Mary Kay (only because like I said I&#x27;ve tried everything and like to give as many things as possible a try) and I couldn&#x27;t believe how much better the R&amp;F Redefine was for me. My psoriasis patches came back and started itching again when I started using the Mary Kay Timewise and within a few days back on the Redefine Regimen (which was almost 2 months ago) my skin looks amazing again. I love this product!</li>
            <li> The product is over priced and that is so the consultants that sell it can get their cut and their sponsors get a cut too and of course the DRs gotta get their cut too.  It didn&#x27;t help my T-zone area and toward the end it ended up burning my skin.  You can just re order unless you spend 80 to get free shipping.  I am using Paula&#x27;s Choice now.  Really like it and is affordable</li>
            <li> I am a licensed esthetician and have not used these products HOWEVER, these comments about your skin breaking out I felt you all should know this is completely NORMAL. When you are starting regimens like this it is pulling all the impurities and junk from your skin- the real results of ANY regimen will not come until AFTER you have rode out this process. Also mild burning/stinging is ALSO normal, as with anti aging products you are technically exfoliating the wrinkles out of your skin- weather it is derma-abrasion or a &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34;, it is breaking down the layers of your skin to reveal the rejuvenated layers UNDERNEATH.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and I would highly recommend it - I love my Rodan + Fields products....amazing results!!</li>
            <li> Had to stop using it caused me to have a acne break out</li>
            <li> This regimen is amazing! It really has helped even my skin tone and even form my skin. If you&#x27;re interested in a discount, email me amorin31@yahoo.com&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t order this product for retail price.</li>
            <li> First off, I am NOT a consultant but a customer of a consultant. My skin has never looked as good as it does now. I have been using R &amp; F Redefine for almost a year and I plan on continuing using it. I&#x27;ve read some of the comments as to where you have to first use a regular cleanser before the mask... I agree to an extent. If I have a full faced make-up, then yes, I do use a cleanser first, then the 2 minute mask, toner, then PM cream. In the morning though, It&#x27;s just the mask, toner, then the AM cream. For those who are breaking out, I did too for the first week then my skin adjusted. I swear by this stuff! I get compliments on my skin all the time. It&#x27;s worth the money but $199 on Amazon? No way... go to a consultant. Pay the one time &amp;#34;perks&amp;#34; price of 20 bucks and be confident your getting the real stuff at a cheaper price.</li>
            <li> These products are amazing! Best I have ever used. However, you should only purchase these direct from a Rodan + Fields consultant. Not only will you get better pricing than what is offered on amazon you will also receive free shipping and the 60 day money back guarantee from the company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To find a consultant near you go to rodanandfields.com</li>
            <li> Amazing product I Skin feels and looks healthy. i love this product every one of them. Am using full line of Redefine notice a huge difference in 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely rate this product 5 stars</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this regimen plus the dermaroller for about 6 months. My skin looks SO much better AND I no longer have to wear foundation! I did buy from the company though- it was cheaper from them and I got the 60 day guarantee just in case I needed it.</li>
            <li> In the top four anti ageing regiments on market today!! Founded by two drs that know all about skin. All skin is not equal that&#x27;s why there are four different packages for your special skin type. Oh yes you can make money by joining this amazing company and share your journey with others. What you got to loose!!!! Find a consultant it will be cheaper !!</li>
            <li> Love the product, but don&#x27;t waste your money here.  So much cheaper going thru a consultant...way more cheaper!</li>
            <li> Have been using these products as my daily regimen for about 3 weeks along with the Redefine Night Renewing Serum.  Can already see and feel a huge difference in my skin and skin tone.</li>
