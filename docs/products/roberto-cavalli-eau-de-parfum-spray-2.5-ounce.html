            <li>I certainly was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>It was everything I expected, but buying fragrances for a woman with her own preferences is risky.  </li>
            <li>months.&lt;br /&gt;The smell was like in the shop where I tried it first.</li>
            <li>Is it first rate and not some knock-off?  </li>
            <li>Great as Usual, Thank you!!</li>
            <li>I will definitely order a full bottle on Amazon, they have very reasonable prices.</li>
            <li>The suit is much weaker than it used to be.</li>
            <li>I got this as a gift for my mom and she absolutely loves the scent and it came on time.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It goes very well for daytime as well as night.</li>
            <li>(Unless I just didn&#x27;t read the description very well)</li>
            <li>I love it soft smell that last all day</li>
            <li>was able to buy the larger 2.5oz bottle for the cost of smaller 1.7oz bottle as listed anywhere else.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend says it smells like a high fashion (executive) business class woman.  </li>
            <li>Great for a gift as well - cannot go wrong with this one</li>
            <li>I completely adore this fragrance, and you get so much for the price.  </li>
            <li>and the bottle was smaller and the price higher.  </li>
            <li>First got it in a sample from Ulta and then had to get a big bottle.</li>
            <li>Unexpected surprise!</li>
            <li>Scent last the whole day.</li>
            <li>Not heavy, but not too soft either.</li>
            <li>It is soft, but stays on for hours.</li>
            <li>This is the second time I buy this perfume, it lasts the whole day and everyone loves the smell and ask what I am wearing</li>
