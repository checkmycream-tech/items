            <li>Good, old-fashioned metal nail file.  </li>
            <li>Nothing fancy- good tool</li>
            <li>she just loved what i got her</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this nail file.</li>
            <li>I was happy to be able to find this product offered.  </li>
            <li>Thing is huge!!</li>
            <li>but I still love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I have better results, with emery boards!&lt;br /&gt;I prefer , metal files, however, these files are not well made!</li>
            <li>May be OK for men&#x27;s toes!  </li>
            <li>Fine grade to smooth nails perfectly</li>
            <li>This is the kind of file that used to be around years ago that lasts and lasts.  </li>
            <li>this works nice</li>
            <li>My new 8&amp;#34; triple cut nail file is the greatest.</li>
            <li>It seems very strong and durable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, this is a great file, stainless &amp; sturdy!</li>
            <li>Great, large size, excellent file, ordered a second one to keep in my purse.  </li>
            <li>Probably more appropriate for filing metal or something.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the newer \\&quot;emery board\\&quot; files sold in most stores now, so bought this.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to find one like it.  </li>
            <li>The file I&#x27;m trying to replace is slender and more flexible than the one I received.  </li>
            <li>Completely satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>I bought this file on Amazon and ordered two more.</li>
            <li>They are fantastic!  </li>
            <li>Heck, I have a swiss multitool that has a better file than this one.</li>
            <li>Most files now have that sintered surface, and I prefer the cut pattern this uses.  </li>
            <li>would work better on a baby&#x27;s nails than mine.</li>
            <li>I love this for my toenails.</li>
            <li>I will gift this nail file as stocking stuffers to everyone I love.</li>
            <li>You have to get used to using it, because you can take off way more than intended.</li>
            <li>The difference between the grains on either side could be greater.</li>
            <li>recommend it, and I&#x27;m sure, you&#x27;ll be glad, as me...</li>
            <li>Item was as advertised and pleased with product</li>
            <li>Would like it better if I had got a 6\\&quot; instead of 8\\</li>
            <li>it is all silver and has a notch in the top.</li>
            <li>The file received is a cheap, stamped metal file that should sell for a dollar at most.</li>
            <li>The length makes reaching them easier and it grinds fairly aggressively so I don&#x27;t have to spend much time getting the results I want.</li>
            <li>I does a good job, you don&#x27;t need much strength to use it.</li>
            <li>This company ships very quickly and do all you expect in service.  </li>
            <li>No hole in the end to hang or thread a cord through, so they are easy to misplace.</li>
            <li>The file is strong and well made.</li>
            <li>Old school, feel good nail file :) No annooying scratching noises</li>
            <li>These work fine.</li>
            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>it works fine, im</li>
            <li>Its strong , wont bend, does a perfect job, and its worth every single penny.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always throwing away those cheap emery boards.  </li>
            <li>The files&#x27; are course and do not file smoothly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually also great on thicker toe nails.</li>
            <li>It is just cheaply made junk.</li>
            <li>I can see why these are so cheap.  </li>
            <li>But if you want a DOZEN cheap files, these are for you.</li>
            <li>It was  the right decision, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li>I only use that kind of file on wood!  </li>
            <li>But adequate and fairly cheap.</li>
            <li>Wonderful and useful nail file!it&#x27;s so difficult to find this type of nail file in south Am√©rica , I&#x27;m glad that I found it here!</li>
            <li>I like the file, but there shouldn&#x27;t be a full shipping charge for each one if you want to buy 10 or 20.</li>
            <li>Very well pleased.  </li>
            <li>However, my quick Internet search turns up the fact that this particular file sells in lots of 500 for .51 cents a piece (or just slightly more than the $6.42 I paid for this one...</li>
            <li>I returned this junk and spent $11 on a German sapphire file - the best one available.  </li>
            <li>It was barely worth the $.01 cost I paid.  </li>
            <li>well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>This product is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, considering the size of this thing, it would be kinda nice if it had a hole in the handle for possible hanging</li>
            <li>does the job just right.  </li>
            <li>Longer than I expected (a true 8\\&quot;), it&#x27;s a nice triple-cut file.  </li>
            <li>so i just wanted something to keep clean not do intense nail maintenence.</li>
            <li>The nail  file I received is not the one I ordered, but I think it is pretty convenient and useful.</li>
            <li>This is one of them and so far it is working fine.</li>
            <li>This is a super effective nail file - very sharp on both sides.</li>
            <li>I really like this file!</li>
            <li>I love it and suspect it may last forever.</li>
            <li>;-).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This file is nice and long but the cross cut sucks, it would be perfect for preparing horse huffs before shoeing.</li>
            <li>It is ok and seems as though it will last awhile.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice long one that should last a lifetime.  </li>
            <li>; long and looks more like a weapon than a nail file and it doesn&#x27;t look like any of the pictures shown with the item I thought I was ordering.  </li>
            <li>I guess the old adage is true, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>While I have strong nails, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for someone used to the sandy ones or with fragile nails.</li>
            <li>I was browsing for large &amp;#34;diamond&amp;#34; metal nail files, and this was in the search results.  </li>
            <li>Not quite as large as I&#x27;d hoped but still, quite serviceable.</li>
            <li>but what they may be a tad coarse for fine finishing ladies&#x27; nails.</li>
            <li>The quality is pretty decent and it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do</li>
            <li>Much preferred to cardboard emery boards.</li>
            <li>cheap - leaves a roughness to the nail, I&#x27;ll go back to Revlon</li>
            <li>Much better than I expected.</li>
            <li>Several people who purchased this file said they had the same experience and were so happy to finally find this file.</li>
            <li>Both sides are straight and the one I received has a crescent shape on one side.</li>
            <li>The one I received has a stamp on the handle \\&quot;Stainless Steel Burmax\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Very sturdy STEEL nail file.</li>
            <li>She loves this file so much</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s stainless.</li>
            <li>Very durable.</li>
            <li>I tied a wide length of ribbon around the end of each, looks tacky but easy to keep track of.</li>
            <li>Still trying to find a decent triple cut nail file.  </li>
            <li>The price was high but decided to try it.</li>
            <li>unless you&#x27;re a lady, &amp; want something a little finer, or you&#x27;re a &amp;#34;file snob&amp;#34;, you won&#x27;t regret buying one of these. :-)</li>
            <li>The old one did the job but was much softer and finer.</li>
            <li>too rough  - doesn&#x27;t leave a smooth edge</li>
            <li>: First of all it is too long, it will not fit any any kind of normal nail set.</li>
            <li>As a senior knows, toe nails become more trouble with age.</li>
            <li>it was a super long piece of metal.</li>
            <li>In other words-- HUGE for a nail file.  </li>
            <li>There is a reason they have been replaced in the stores with new and improved products.  </li>
            <li>To make matters worse, I was so sure I&#x27;d found the right file</li>
            <li>This file is large enough for older hands to hold onto.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>Okay, was looking for something with the sharp pointy end, that was metal and would actually file.  </li>
            <li>works just great, if you really need a good nail file, and sick and tired ... as me, with all these \\&quot;diamond\\&quot; nail files on the market...</li>
            <li>These are true treasures for those that simply can&#x27;t abide the sandy, gritty, skin-crawling feeling of emery boards or diamond nail files.  </li>
            <li>At 8&amp;#34; long, &amp; with a finger-grip notch in the handle, my only regret is that I didn&#x27;t buy a second one at this price, which I could&#x27;ve kept in my truck to double as a (seemingly innocent), emergency defensive weapon!</li>
            <li>A metal sapphire file for a buck and a half from your local drug store is better than this one.</li>
            <li>This file works faster than an emery board or diamond file, but it is too coarse - it tends to snag your nails at certain angles.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s large enough to help someone escape from prison!</li>
            <li>They seemed a bit large, but I may just be accustomed to the smaller ones I had before.  </li>
            <li>Surely these companies could be a little more generous and charge the customer the price of mailing that is at least close to the lesser price they pay to mail.</li>
            <li>The file I received (please see the pictures above) is in fact an 8\\&quot; stainless steel triple cut nail file sans the plastic handle and with a notch cut into it for grip.</li>
            <li>The only thing I use this for is poking holes in the top of bottle seals that I can&#x27;t grip well enough to open with their tabs, or for retrieving the last gummies in the vitamin bottle which tend to get stuck at the bottom of the jar.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s big, man sized and with that triple cut feature, it really files my nails in a hurry.</li>
            <li>Nicely cut, uniform, very fast cutting but controllable.  </li>
            <li>It was a little more coarse than I expected, but works very well.</li>
            <li>I like the long length and prefer it to the large cardboard emory boards.</li>
            <li>Mine says &amp;#34;BURMAX&amp;#34; on it, which is much preferable to me, cuz being a GUY, I&#x27;d MUCH rather have one that says &amp;#34;BURMAX&amp;#34; on it, than &amp;#34;DEBRA LYNN&amp;#34;, for some odd reason....</li>
            <li>Not the same file as the picture, and much too coarse for filing fingernails.</li>
            <li>While it was much coarser than I expected.</li>
            <li>both sides are the same though as far as rough/coarse</li>
            <li>Not worth much!  </li>
            <li>The sharp point, however, is very helpful</li>
            <li>This is actually the same style my mom had when I was young</li>
            <li>Just a regular coarse old fashioned nail file.  </li>
            <li>get me wrong, it&#x27;s a nice enough file.</li>
            <li>Apparently they have stopped making metal nail files like these, you can only get the emeryl cut.</li>

            <li> well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> This product is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, considering the size of this thing, it would be kinda nice if it had a hole in the handle for possible hanging</li>
            <li> does the job just right.  </li>
            <li> Longer than I expected (a true 8\\&quot;), it&#x27;s a nice triple-cut file.  </li>
            <li> so i just wanted something to keep clean not do intense nail maintenence.</li>
            <li> The nail  file I received is not the one I ordered, but I think it is pretty convenient and useful.</li>
            <li> This is one of them and so far it is working fine.</li>
            <li> This is a super effective nail file - very sharp on both sides.</li>
            <li> I really like this file!</li>
            <li> I love it and suspect it may last forever.</li>
            <li> ;-).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This file is nice and long but the cross cut sucks, it would be perfect for preparing horse huffs before shoeing.</li>
            <li> It is ok and seems as though it will last awhile.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice long one that should last a lifetime.  </li>
            <li> ; long and looks more like a weapon than a nail file and it doesn&#x27;t look like any of the pictures shown with the item I thought I was ordering.  </li>
            <li> I guess the old adage is true, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> While I have strong nails, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for someone used to the sandy ones or with fragile nails.</li>
            <li> I was browsing for large &amp;#34;diamond&amp;#34; metal nail files, and this was in the search results.  </li>
            <li> Not quite as large as I&#x27;d hoped but still, quite serviceable.</li>
            <li> but what they may be a tad coarse for fine finishing ladies&#x27; nails.</li>
            <li> The quality is pretty decent and it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do</li>
            <li> Much preferred to cardboard emery boards.</li>
            <li> cheap - leaves a roughness to the nail, I&#x27;ll go back to Revlon</li>
            <li> Much better than I expected.</li>
            <li> Several people who purchased this file said they had the same experience and were so happy to finally find this file.</li>
            <li> Both sides are straight and the one I received has a crescent shape on one side.</li>
            <li> The one I received has a stamp on the handle \\&quot;Stainless Steel Burmax\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Very sturdy STEEL nail file.</li>
            <li> She loves this file so much</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s stainless.</li>
            <li> Very durable.</li>
            <li> I tied a wide length of ribbon around the end of each, looks tacky but easy to keep track of.</li>
            <li> Still trying to find a decent triple cut nail file.  </li>
            <li> The price was high but decided to try it.</li>
            <li> unless you&#x27;re a lady, &amp; want something a little finer, or you&#x27;re a &amp;#34;file snob&amp;#34;, you won&#x27;t regret buying one of these. :-)</li>
            <li> The old one did the job but was much softer and finer.</li>
            <li> too rough  - doesn&#x27;t leave a smooth edge</li>
            <li> : First of all it is too long, it will not fit any any kind of normal nail set.</li>
            <li> As a senior knows, toe nails become more trouble with age.</li>
            <li> it was a super long piece of metal.</li>
            <li> In other words-- HUGE for a nail file.  </li>
            <li> There is a reason they have been replaced in the stores with new and improved products.  </li>
            <li> To make matters worse, I was so sure I&#x27;d found the right file</li>
            <li> This file is large enough for older hands to hold onto.</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> Okay, was looking for something with the sharp pointy end, that was metal and would actually file.  </li>
            <li> works just great, if you really need a good nail file, and sick and tired ... as me, with all these \\&quot;diamond\\&quot; nail files on the market...</li>
            <li> These are true treasures for those that simply can&#x27;t abide the sandy, gritty, skin-crawling feeling of emery boards or diamond nail files.  </li>
            <li> At 8&amp;#34; long, &amp; with a finger-grip notch in the handle, my only regret is that I didn&#x27;t buy a second one at this price, which I could&#x27;ve kept in my truck to double as a (seemingly innocent), emergency defensive weapon!</li>
            <li> A metal sapphire file for a buck and a half from your local drug store is better than this one.</li>
            <li> This file works faster than an emery board or diamond file, but it is too coarse - it tends to snag your nails at certain angles.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s large enough to help someone escape from prison!</li>
            <li> They seemed a bit large, but I may just be accustomed to the smaller ones I had before.  </li>
            <li> Surely these companies could be a little more generous and charge the customer the price of mailing that is at least close to the lesser price they pay to mail.</li>
            <li> The file I received (please see the pictures above) is in fact an 8\\&quot; stainless steel triple cut nail file sans the plastic handle and with a notch cut into it for grip.</li>
            <li> The only thing I use this for is poking holes in the top of bottle seals that I can&#x27;t grip well enough to open with their tabs, or for retrieving the last gummies in the vitamin bottle which tend to get stuck at the bottom of the jar.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s big, man sized and with that triple cut feature, it really files my nails in a hurry.</li>
            <li> Nicely cut, uniform, very fast cutting but controllable.  </li>
            <li> It was a little more coarse than I expected, but works very well.</li>
            <li> I like the long length and prefer it to the large cardboard emory boards.</li>
            <li> Mine says &amp;#34;BURMAX&amp;#34; on it, which is much preferable to me, cuz being a GUY, I&#x27;d MUCH rather have one that says &amp;#34;BURMAX&amp;#34; on it, than &amp;#34;DEBRA LYNN&amp;#34;, for some odd reason....</li>
            <li> Not the same file as the picture, and much too coarse for filing fingernails.</li>
            <li> While it was much coarser than I expected.</li>
            <li> both sides are the same though as far as rough/coarse</li>
            <li> Not worth much!  </li>
            <li> The sharp point, however, is very helpful</li>
            <li> This is actually the same style my mom had when I was young</li>
            <li> Just a regular coarse old fashioned nail file.  </li>
            <li> get me wrong, it&#x27;s a nice enough file.</li>
            <li> Apparently they have stopped making metal nail files like these, you can only get the emeryl cut.</li>
            <li> Just a tad coarser than I would&#x27;ve preferred, but still, at long last, an actual cross-cut FILE, as opposed to those cheapo things I&#x27;ve been buying, which are basically a piece of steel with some grit glued onto &#x27;em which wears off in no time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, just a tad pointier (is that a word?)</li>
            <li> Oly time will tell how long it will last.</li>
            <li> it is 8 solid inches long.  </li>
            <li> If you want to shape your nails with a long file, go to eBay and search for Solingen.</li>
            <li> (long) Use it all the time for filing and smoothing out my nails.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, it is LONG.  </li>
            <li> I have been looking for at least two years for a file to replace the old US-made Diamond Deb files (now made in China and just not the same).  </li>
            <li> This file is much bigger than I expected and the &amp;#34;grain&amp;#34; is quite rough.</li>
            <li> If you wish a true trim and not these silly emery boards, then this product will do the job for you.  </li>
            <li> This is a coarse file for taking down the nail.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found it difficult to find adequate nail files at the stores where I shop, so when I searched on your site and found two</li>
            <li> I did a little digging and found out that it is actually a BURMAX file (Model 130928315).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was looking for a file that would knock off the rough edges of my fingernails after I cut them.</li>
            <li> Not as pictured (no handle) and not much &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find cross cut nail files in the stores anymore, the other versions just don&#x27;t do the same job.</li>
            <li> I was tired of the glass files getting dull within a short period of time and the stainless steel will stay sharp for a long time.</li>
            <li> One side is a bit courser than the other</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have noted, this file comes W/O the plastic grip shown.  </li>
            <li> No handle and a long pointed narrow tip.  </li>
            <li> In the past two weeks I have bought 3 files and finally got one that works the way I like it.  </li>
            <li> &quot; other than that no problem.</li>
            <li> It cuts faster and slightly rougher than an emery board, but it&#x27;s not too rough</li>
            <li> I dont know if its my imagination but other nail files i have used make me think of what its like when someone runs their finger nails down a chalk board.</li>
            <li> This is really harsh but that is expected since it is metal.</li>
            <li> All other nail files are dead to me.</li>
            <li> I did a little research and decided to order the Debra Lynn 8\\&quot; Triple Cut Nail File.</li>
            <li> I will stockpile a little hoard of them</li>
            <li> It works well for filing my nails, It doesn&#x27;t create that annoying half nail part that cheap nail files often create.</li>
            <li> Very stiff and rough.  </li>
            <li> But worse is the fact that although tripple cut, the file is not aggressive enough.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time on this file -</li>
            <li> Recommend for man&#x27;s nails, not sure</li>
            <li> Very Disappointed because it bends easily and it tears up my nails</li>
            <li> Hard to find metal files in stores that are of this quality.  </li>
            <li> Thank you Amazon for carrying the triple cut, they are hard to find.</li>
            <li> Not really good, here are the reasons</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed in this purchase because I was expecting something different.  </li>
            <li> A triple cut metal nail file is very hard to find.  </li>
            <li> I was really tired of the drugstore counter nail files.</li>
            <li> This is crudely made and does not work well.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> It was barely worth the $.01 cost I paid.  I did like that it was a longer nail file.  That works for me.  Surely these companies could be a little more generous and charge the customer the price of mailing that is at least close to the lesser price they pay to mail.</li>
            <li> WORKS GREAT ON MY HORSES</li>
            <li> This file is large enough for older hands to hold onto. One side is a bit courser than the other so you can use the smoother side to finish manicure. I am very satisfied with this nail file.</li>
            <li> The best file I have bought. Oly time will tell how long it will last.</li>
            <li> A triple cut metal nail file is very hard to find.  This is a very nice long one that should last a lifetime.  Get one.</li>
            <li> Great, large size, excellent file, ordered a second one to keep in my purse.  This is the kind of file that used to be around years ago that lasts and lasts.  Much preferred to cardboard emery boards.</li>
            <li> I was really tired of the drugstore counter nail files. The price was high but decided to try it. I was stunned! I didnt know there even was a nail file out there with this quality. Its strong , wont bend, does a perfect job, and its worth every single penny.I dont know if its my imagination but other nail files i have used make me think of what its like when someone runs their finger nails down a chalk board. This nail file is wonderful, and comfortable to use</li>
            <li> This is a super effective nail file - very sharp on both sides. One swipe will file off a good amount of nail.</li>
            <li> Wow!  I have been looking for at least two years for a file to replace the old US-made Diamond Deb files (now made in China and just not the same).  Here it is!  A really excellent file, well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> not what I wanted.  I thought it was a Diamond File</li>
            <li> My mom lost her triple cut file and was searching with no luck...Just out of curiosity I found one on here and ordered it...She loves it</li>
            <li> cheap - leaves a roughness to the nail, I&#x27;ll go back to Revlon</li>
            <li> Not the same file as the picture, and much too coarse for filing fingernails. It tears the edges of my nails apart. Probably more appropriate for filing metal or something.</li>
            <li> Much better than I expected.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have noted, this file comes W/O the plastic grip shown.  The file is strong and well made. However, the grain is CORSE. If you want to get rid of a lot of nail in a hurry, this is your file. If you want to shape your nails with a long file, go to eBay and search for Solingen.</li>
            <li> This product is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I like the file, but there shouldn&#x27;t be a full shipping charge for each one if you want to buy 10 or 20.</li>
            <li> Good, old-fashioned metal nail file.  It has quite a bite on it.  I expect it will last longer than I will.</li>
            <li> This file works faster than an emery board or diamond file, but it is too coarse - it tends to snag your nails at certain angles.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the newer \\&quot;emery board\\&quot; files sold in most stores now, so bought this.  Longer than I expected (a true 8\\&quot;), it&#x27;s a nice triple-cut file.  It cuts faster and slightly rougher than an emery board, but it&#x27;s not too rough and I prefer the speed over smoothness.</li>
            <li> I really like this file! Gave it 4 stars because the size is big. (long) Use it all the time for filing and smoothing out my nails. Good value too!</li>
            <li> does the job just right.  Nothing fancy- good tool</li>
            <li> This is a coarse file for taking down the nail.</li>
            <li> It is a great file, but I didn&#x27;t see in the description that it was a DOZEN files!  I guess everyone will be getting a file in next year&#x27;s Christmas stocking...</li>
            <li> Last nail file you&#x27;ll ever buy.  I&#x27;m always throwing away those cheap emery boards.  This is actually the same style my mom had when I was young and she still has it today.  This thing is going to last forever.</li>
            <li> Works as it should.. with no complaints..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed in this purchase because I was expecting something different.  I&#x27;ve been looking for a fingernail file that I purchased years ago.  I&#x27;ve never been able to find one like it.  Several people who purchased this file said they had the same experience and were so happy to finally find this file. The reviews sounded just like what I was looking for.  The file I&#x27;m trying to replace is slender and more flexible than the one I received.  Both sides are straight and the one I received has a crescent shape on one side. The biggest difference is that the file is so coarse.  It&#x27;s like a file out of my husband&#x27;s tool box!  It tears up your fingernails and your skin. The old one did the job but was much softer and finer. The one I received has a stamp on the handle \\&quot;Stainless Steel Burmax\\&quot;.  To make matters worse, I was so sure I&#x27;d found the right file, I purchased two. Oh well, I guess that&#x27;s the chance you take when you order online.</li>
            <li> Item NOT as described but I still love it!</li>
            <li> Apparently they have stopped making metal nail files like these, you can only get the emeryl cut. So now I have a dozen which should last me and my children the rest of our lives and then some. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Just like in the drugstore. And because it&#x27;s longer, I don&#x27;t stab myself so often.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, just as my wife used to buy before the world went nuts.  If you wish a true trim and not these silly emery boards, then this product will do the job for you.  This company ships very quickly and do all you expect in service.  Simple product that works!</li>
            <li> It works well for filing my nails, It doesn&#x27;t create that annoying half nail part that cheap nail files often create.</li>
            <li> Christmas present for my sister, she doesnt like the cardboard nail files..she just loved what i got her</li>
            <li> Great nail file!  It&#x27;s large enough to help someone escape from prison!</li>
            <li> The nail  file I received is not the one I ordered, but I think it is pretty convenient and useful.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy STEEL nail file. I love it and suspect it may last forever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for these everywhere!  These are true treasures for those that simply can&#x27;t abide the sandy, gritty, skin-crawling feeling of emery boards or diamond nail files.  View these files as investments - they will last and last and last!</li>
            <li> What I received is 8&amp;#34; long and looks more like a weapon than a nail file and it doesn&#x27;t look like any of the pictures shown with the item I thought I was ordering.  No handle and a long pointed narrow tip.  It does the job though.</li>
            <li> It was a little more coarse than I expected, but works very well.</li>
            <li> Completely satisfied with this product. It works perfectly for what I bought it for - filing toenails!!</li>
            <li> Hard to find cross cut nail files in the stores anymore, the other versions just don&#x27;t do the same job. I bought this file on Amazon and ordered two more. They are fantastic!  No hole in the end to hang or thread a cord through, so they are easy to misplace. I tied a wide length of ribbon around the end of each, looks tacky but easy to keep track of. Expensive but worth it if you want something that really works.</li>
            <li> Very Disappointed because it bends easily and it tears up my nails---I am going to throw it out---I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> In the past two weeks I have bought 3 files and finally got one that works the way I like it.  Excellent.</li>
            <li> I guess the old adage is true, you get what you pay for. This is crudely made and does not work well.</li>
            <li> This file is much bigger than I expected and the &amp;#34;grain&amp;#34; is quite rough.</li>
            <li> Not really good, here are the reasons: First of all it is too long, it will not fit any any kind of normal nail set. But worse is the fact that although tripple cut, the file is not aggressive enough. Heck, I have a swiss multitool that has a better file than this one. A metal sapphire file for a buck and a half from your local drug store is better than this one.</li>
            <li> Love it! Old school, feel good nail file :) No annooying scratching noises</li>
            <li> This is one of three gifts my Mom asked for for Mothers Day.  Her last one she had finally stopped working, but she had it for 30 years.  She loves this file so much I got one for myself too.  It does a great job over and over............</li>
            <li> I was looking for a file that would knock off the rough edges of my fingernails after I cut them. I did a little research and decided to order the Debra Lynn 8\\&quot; Triple Cut Nail File. The file I received (please see the pictures above) is in fact an 8\\&quot; stainless steel triple cut nail file sans the plastic handle and with a notch cut into it for grip. I did a little digging and found out that it is actually a BURMAX file (Model 130928315).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s a nice enough file. It&#x27;s stainless. The quality is pretty decent and it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do so I won&#x27;t return it or ding the rating. However, my quick Internet search turns up the fact that this particular file sells in lots of 500 for .51 cents a piece (or just slightly more than the $6.42 I paid for this one...).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, caveat emptor.</li>
            <li> Not as pictured (no handle) and not much &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34;.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Hard to find metal files in stores that are of this quality.  Both and gave on to all of my sisters, brother, mother and even my brother in law wanted one.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I was happy to be able to find this product offered.  Most files now have that sintered surface, and I prefer the cut pattern this uses.  They seemed a bit large, but I may just be accustomed to the smaller ones I had before.  These work fine.</li>
            <li> this picture shows that it has a plastic handle- mine did not. it was a super long piece of metal. wasnt very happy with the file part either... would work better on a baby&#x27;s nails than mine.</li>
            <li> I love this for my toenails. The length makes reaching them easier and it grinds fairly aggressively so I don&#x27;t have to spend much time getting the results I want.</li>
            <li> The files&#x27; are course and do not file smoothly. I have better results, with emery boards!&lt;br /&gt;I prefer , metal files, however, these files are not well made!</li>
            <li> Mine says &amp;#34;BURMAX&amp;#34; on it, which is much preferable to me, cuz being a GUY, I&#x27;d MUCH rather have one that says &amp;#34;BURMAX&amp;#34; on it, than &amp;#34;DEBRA LYNN&amp;#34;, for some odd reason.... ;-).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this is a great file, stainless &amp; sturdy! Just a tad coarser than I would&#x27;ve preferred, but still, at long last, an actual cross-cut FILE, as opposed to those cheapo things I&#x27;ve been buying, which are basically a piece of steel with some grit glued onto &#x27;em which wears off in no time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, just a tad pointier (is that a word?) than I would&#x27;ve preferred, but this thing is great nevertheless! At 8&amp;#34; long, &amp; with a finger-grip notch in the handle, my only regret is that I didn&#x27;t buy a second one at this price, which I could&#x27;ve kept in my truck to double as a (seemingly innocent), emergency defensive weapon! Seriously!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, considering the size of this thing, it would be kinda nice if it had a hole in the handle for possible hanging (hey, I&#x27;m a GUY, remember?), but I can drill one myself, for that matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line...  unless you&#x27;re a lady, &amp; want something a little finer, or you&#x27;re a &amp;#34;file snob&amp;#34;, you won&#x27;t regret buying one of these. :-)</li>
            <li> Bought for my mom and she just loves it.</li>
            <li> This file is the perfect size and milled perfectly to file the way you&#x27;d expect. I was tired of the glass files getting dull within a short period of time and the stainless steel will stay sharp for a long time. Great product.</li>
            <li> I will never use another nail file again. I will gift this nail file as stocking stuffers to everyone I love. I will stockpile a little hoard of them so I never have to go without. All other nail files are dead to me.</li>
            <li> Excellent for my nails. This unit will outlast any diamond covered file from China. Material and cross-hatch milling seem to be made in USA.I can even use these on my toe nails. As a senior knows, toe nails become more trouble with age.</li>
            <li> Great seller and product!</li>
            <li> While it was much coarser than I expected. I does a good job, you don&#x27;t need much strength to use it. While I have strong nails, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for someone used to the sandy ones or with fragile nails. It&#x27;s actually also great on thicker toe nails. You have to get used to using it, because you can take off way more than intended. Very durable.</li>
            <li> Works fine. The difference between the grains on either side could be greater. The sharp point, however, is very helpful</li>
            <li> Fine grade to smooth nails perfectly</li>
            <li> Wonderful and useful nail file!it&#x27;s so difficult to find this type of nail file in south Am√©rica , I&#x27;m glad that I found it here!</li>
            <li> This is NOT a Debra Lynn file - it&#x27;s a BURMAX file.  Just a regular coarse old fashioned nail file.  I returned this junk and spent $11 on a German sapphire file - the best one available.  Don&#x27;t waste your time on this file - any $1 drug store file is the same as this one.</li>
            <li> Not what&#x27;s shown in the item description. The file received is a cheap, stamped metal file that should sell for a dollar at most.</li>
            <li> Okay, was looking for something with the sharp pointy end, that was metal and would actually file.  This meets those requirements.  HOWEVER, it is LONG.  From the picture, I thought that it had a handle on part of it-- nope-- it is 8 solid inches long.  In other words-- HUGE for a nail file.  So, guess I won&#x27;t be going through any airport screening with this thing.  Strickly for home use!  Just wish this was a tad shorter.</li>
            <li> Still trying to find a decent triple cut nail file.  This one aint it.  It is just cheaply made junk.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this nail file, just what I wanted.  You can&#x27;t beat a triple cut and I definitely recommend this item.  Thank you Amazon for carrying the triple cut, they are hard to find.</li>
            <li> I did not receive the file advertised, but instead one similar to the picture included here.But adequate and fairly cheap.</li>
            <li> too rough  - doesn&#x27;t leave a smooth edge</li>
            <li> works just great, if you really need a good nail file, and sick and tired ... as me, with all these \\&quot;diamond\\&quot; nail files on the market...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it, and I&#x27;m sure, you&#x27;ll be glad, as me...</li>
            <li> This file is nice and long but the cross cut sucks, it would be perfect for preparing horse huffs before shoeing.</li>
            <li> Item was as advertised and pleased with product</li>
            <li> I was browsing for large &amp;#34;diamond&amp;#34; metal nail files, and this was in the search results.  I purchased it based on price, and didn&#x27;t realize until after I opened the package that it is an old-fashioned file with ridges instead of mineral dust.  I only use that kind of file on wood!  The only thing I use this for is poking holes in the top of bottle seals that I can&#x27;t grip well enough to open with their tabs, or for retrieving the last gummies in the vitamin bottle which tend to get stuck at the bottom of the jar.</li>
            <li> For the price, these are unbeatable.  Nicely cut, uniform, very fast cutting but controllable.  Very well pleased.  Recommend for man&#x27;s nails, not sure but what they may be a tad coarse for fine finishing ladies&#x27; nails.</li>
            <li> Not quite as large as I&#x27;d hoped but still, quite serviceable. I use it every day and it satisfies my need.</li>
            <li> a bit flimsy, and id like it if the tip were hooked a bit but what can you do its a dang nail file. it works fine, im a guy tho so i just wanted something to keep clean not do intense nail maintenence. this works nice both sides are the same though as far as rough/coarse</li>
            <li> Thing is huge!! Don&#x27;t try to carry in your bag ,girls. Cuts like a bastard file!</li>
            <li> This is really harsh but that is expected since it is metal. It seems very strong and durable.</li>
            <li> My new 8&amp;#34; triple cut nail file is the greatest. I looked at a lot of different nail files before deciding to buy this one. It was  the right decision, that&#x27;s for sure. It&#x27;s big, man sized and with that triple cut feature, it really files my nails in a hurry. Love it!! It&#x27;s definately a five star tool.</li>
            <li> I can see why these are so cheap.  Not worth much!  Very stiff and rough.  There is a reason they have been replaced in the stores with new and improved products.  May be OK for men&#x27;s toes!  But if you want a DOZEN cheap files, these are for you.</li>
            <li> I like this nail file. You don&#x27;t have to keep turning from side to side to get it to file your nails. Would like it better if I had got a 6\\&quot; instead of 8\\&quot; other than that no problem.</li>
            <li> It is ok and seems as though it will last awhile. I like the long length and prefer it to the large cardboard emory boards. Like others have mentioned the file I received was not the one pictured.... it is all silver and has a notch in the top. The brand stamped in the file is: BURMAX. So?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found it difficult to find adequate nail files at the stores where I shop, so when I searched on your site and found two I thought I&#x27;d like I bought both.  This is one of them and so far it is working fine.</li>
