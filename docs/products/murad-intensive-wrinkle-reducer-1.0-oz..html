            <li> but it is still too early to tell how this will help me.  </li>
            <li> I have not been using it long enough to see the wrinkle reduction yet.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, this product is easy to use, and if you use it carefully it can last about 3 months, so it&#x27;s not really all that expensive, for a product that works as well as this one does.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 4 months and have seen a slow, but steady change in my skin - smoother, tighter, softer.</li>
            <li> I started less than a month ago and only used it once at night time.  </li>
            <li> I know is: I&#x27;m over 60, and people constantly think I&#x27;m at least 10-15 years younger than I am.  </li>
            <li> The lip care you can&#x27;t beat by any other product.</li>
            <li> For me to keep buying such an expensive product, I obviously like it.</li>
            <li> I saw a little smoothing with this product, but it contains harsh parabens that are not good for the skin or your health.  </li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s impossible to go back over time and NOT use a product, and then compare the difference.  </li>
            <li> sorry Murad</li>
            <li> but it is too expensive...</li>

            <li> Very good products by Murad. It&#x27;s never too much. Not fancy. The lip care you can&#x27;t beat by any other product. The whole family uses it while skiing.</li>
            <li> Somehow, my wife heard ot Murad Intensive Wrinkle Reducer and asked me to go online and buy it.  I contacted Amazon. She tried it, and it worked.  Both of us are delighted with the results.  Her skin has greatly improved.  I have since ordered it four more times as she has been using it regularly.  It&#x27;s a great product.    Jerry</li>
            <li> Of all the product&#x27;s on today&#x27;s stores, this rate&#x27;s number one on out it help&#x27;s with the signs of OLD AGE</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 65 year-old mother. She loves it and is seeing results.</li>
            <li> nothing great about this product</li>
            <li> Great for reducing appearance of lines and wrinkles</li>
            <li> I am 72 years old and thought there was no help for my wrinkles except surgery.  I have used this product for almost a month now and my wrinkles are greatly diminished.  It is a wonderful product!!</li>
            <li> My sister recommended this product to me.  She saw great results after a couple months.  I started less than a month ago and only used it once at night time.  I use it together with the Murad C-toner and Hydro Dynamic moisturizer.  So far, I think it is good product but it is still too early to tell how this will help me.  I do not have deep wrinkles, only fine lines.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to be sure, but I keep on buying this because when I first started using it my friends said it really reduced wrinkles. For my age, my skin keeps on looking pretty good, and I think continued use of this product has helped that. Not miraculous but what is. For me to keep buying such an expensive product, I obviously like it.</li>
            <li> I could actually see no improvement...Used it exactly as suggested and every night faithfully...I would not recommend this product...sorry Murad</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Fast delivery!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many years and have always felt it helps with wrinkles</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s impossible to go back over time and NOT use a product, and then compare the difference.  OR, to know how darn wrinkled you&#x27;d be if you DIDN&#x27;T use the product.  All&#x27;s I know is: I&#x27;m over 60, and people constantly think I&#x27;m at least 10-15 years younger than I am.  I do look darn good -- and I&#x27;ve used Murad&#x27;s Intensive Wrinkle Reducer for at least 5 years.  It&#x27;s great to find it here at Amazon, because there&#x27;s a significant savings over ordering it from Murad or a beauty-products site.  Sure wish I&#x27;d found that out a lot sooner!&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this product is easy to use, and if you use it carefully it can last about 3 months, so it&#x27;s not really all that expensive, for a product that works as well as this one does.</li>
            <li> I love it  but to expensive.</li>
            <li> I like this product, at first there was a burning sensation around my eyes, then after about a week&#x27;s use it dissipated. It does make my skin feel toned. I have not been using it long enough to see the wrinkle reduction yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost a year now-I&#x27;ve noticed with my skin it&#x27;s gentle yet effective. I wake up to brighter, smoother looking skin and my large pores are more refined-I don&#x27;t really have wrinkles at 38 but do notice slight forehead lines and this seems to be helping keep those at bay-overall excellent product and will continue to use as long as its on the market.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 4 months and have seen a slow, but steady change in my skin - smoother, tighter, softer. Another one of Murad&#x27;s great products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this item for years and it is excellent.  This is the first time I&#x27;ve ordered it on Amazon and it is priced much better.</li>
            <li> I think it has softened my skin...I really like it and want to buy it again but it is too expensive...</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS ONE OF THE BEST MURAD PRODUCT&lt;br /&gt;AND WORTH THE MONEY.  DR MURAD IS A DERMATOLOGIST,&lt;br /&gt;HIS PRODUCTS ARE INCREDIBLE.  YOU WILL SEE A DIFFERENCE&lt;br /&gt;RIGHT AWAY.  -ALSO, AMAZON IS GREAT FOR MAKING MURAD&lt;br /&gt;AVAILABLE AT GREAT PRICES.  -I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS&lt;br /&gt;PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I saw a little smoothing with this product, but it contains harsh parabens that are not good for the skin or your health.  I won&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
