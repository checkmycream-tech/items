            <li>The pigment is just ok.</li>
            <li>Works much better with a primer.</li>
            <li>Hope that&#x27;s helpful :)</li>
            <li>I would love to know where/how to get refills for the pallet.</li>
            <li>I love the colors in this palette.  </li>
            <li>These shadows look just like they do in the picture, I love them.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely love this eyeshadow pallet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying more makeup products from Amazon again.</li>
            <li>I also noticed that the colors that look best together are in the same row.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it for anyone trying to start out in the makeup world. :)</li>
            <li>I love the colors and use all of them.</li>
            <li>I use eye shadow primer on my high end products as well as my inexpensive products and it works great for both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Beautiful and professional looking makeup.</li>
            <li>The colors are beautiful for an all year around natural look.</li>
            <li>I receive mine early and upon opening it I was happy to see the size of the pallets.</li>
            <li>EASY.</li>
            <li>Love the colors and shipped very fast!</li>
            <li>They are great, especially for the price</li>
            <li>They are not highly pigmented BUT with a eye primer you should be good for staying power!</li>
            <li>I am very fair skinned and these colors are the exact same color on my eye as they appear.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a purchase!</li>
            <li>I have strawberry blonde hair and lightly freckled fair skin.  </li>
            <li>Took forever to clean up.</li>
            <li>, I will NOT be ordering unless the company can make this right with me!</li>
            <li>Overall, good product.</li>
            <li>I love it more than any of my Sophora, Naked, etc.</li>
            <li>The colors in this pallet are also much bigger than I thought when I purchased which I was very pleased with.</li>
            <li>The colors are very pretty.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much!</li>
            <li>Color payoff excellent, large  pan of eyeshadow,, very little fall out.  </li>
            <li>I really recommend it for those who like smokey eye look!!</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, overall, I will keep it, as it has more colors that I would use than not!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Shany products combines high quality with unbelievable prices, perfect for anyone on a budget!</li>
            <li>The SHANY 12 COLOR Palette in Smokey Eyes is beautiful with rich pigments (a mixture of mostly matte and and a few shimmers) and the light to dark makes for an easy transition straight from work to play.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good deal when you look at how much you actually pay per color.</li>
            <li>Was worth the $.</li>
            <li>So if you highlight with the top left silver/white it will look best with the colors in the same row moving to the left.</li>
            <li>Nice and deep colors!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth every penny.</li>
            <li>right there speaks for itself.</li>
            <li>I still need a primer to make the colors pop and learn the proper technique of making the &#x27;smokey eye&#x27; but the makeup overall is beautiful.</li>
            <li>They were as big as the half dollar which is awesome because I dont have to worry about running out anytime</li>
            <li>With all the great reviews it was hard to let this pallet slip away.</li>
            <li>The colors aren&#x27;t exactly as shown, at lease not on my computer...</li>
            <li>Exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to be.</li>
            <li>Only gets 4 stars because the packaging could and should have been better.</li>
            <li>It is very vibrant and lasts all day...</li>
            <li>Will certainly order from their brand again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a guy that usually tends to dress up as female characters at conventions &amp; more recently i&#x27;ve been looking at ways that I might be able to make myself look even more convincing/ feminine with makeup.</li>
            <li>Really pigmented colors.  </li>
            <li>It really is a must have.</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to them too. ðŸ˜ž</li>
            <li>AND they are very</li>
            <li>Decided to initially buy this as some seemed to rave about how it does a pretty good job at brightening up their eyes while covering dark circles.</li>
            <li>My facial hair also tends to become faintly noticeable a day after shaving, and surprisingly the whiter eyeshadows did a great job of concealing up the minor stubble.</li>
            <li>but I would spend a little more money to get a higher quality product.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have high expectations as I&#x27;m a long-time MAC user and this product was really inexpensive.</li>
            <li>Size is good for price (a little bigger then a quarter).</li>
            <li>So much larger than I expected and in a nice case.</li>
            <li>Highly pigmented colors.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The colors were highly pigmented.</li>
            <li>High pigment..</li>
            <li>so from left top: matte white, pearl silver, shimmery bronze, matte dark brown, pearl white, pearl gray, matte olive, matte black, matte REALLY light gray (basically a cool white), pearl light gray, shimmer olive (shimmer is gold), and shimmer black</li>
            <li>I received it and opened it to find it completely destroyed.</li>
            <li>Finally, an affordable eye palette with highly pigmented and blendable colors!</li>
            <li>Now if I could only buy the time to do my eyes with this make up everyday :)</li>
            <li>I have several Shany palettes/products (concealer/blush palette&#x27;s, brush sets etc..) and all their products are long lasting, glide on smoothly, and have never irritated my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The palette is bigger than you would think (each eyeshadow is about the size of a quarter) and the colors are highly pigmented.</li>
            <li>I also have somewhat sensitive skin and was a bit worried at first about this irritating my face &amp; containing harsh chemicals in the ingredients, but fortunately it did no harm &amp; managed to remain in tact for the 8 hours I left it on my face.</li>

            <li> I have small eyes and cant really work with different colors</li>
            <li> Will last long time.  </li>
            <li> I still have an entirely long way to go before I master the art of makeup.</li>
            <li> /&gt;One suggestion, (for those not aware) use an eye shadow primer before applying eye shadow, this will make for a longer lasting look, no creasing on your eyelid, and this will also enhance your color, primer is always a must for me.</li>
            <li> I use this every single day.</li>
            <li> 3 of the 4 brown shadows were cracked and partially missing...there was powder residue on the outside of the case, and part of the shadows that were loose fell out when I opened the box!!</li>
            <li> THE COLORS THAT ARE NOT CHIPPED, BROKEN OR MISSING, ARE VERY PRETTY.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disapoint because they came all broken and there is no way that I can fix them.</li>
            <li> I wish they made their other eyeshadow palettes like this one.</li>
            <li> THe damage caused one of the eyeshadow colors to blend with other colors.</li>
            <li> I was thinking of purchasing the other color pallets After this mess</li>
            <li> To me, MAC like for waaay less.</li>
            <li> considering they are very dark colors.</li>
            <li> (shimmer is green).  </li>
            <li> Few clicks, check the mail, done.</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like, is that one of the colors was broken up upon arrival.</li>
            <li> What a mess!!</li>
            <li> Which is a complete disappointment!</li>
            <li> For me personally the pigment quality is awful and there is no blending potential for what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s ability to remain subtle, yet illuminating.</li>
            <li> Received pkg LATE!..</li>
            <li> The only downfall was that one of the colors was damaged :(</li>
            <li> All the pallets were broken and it spilled everywhere.</li>
            <li> try to apply the colors nothing stays, don&#x27;t order i have never ordered cosmetic so bad as this waste of money</li>
            <li> Unfortunately It arrived damaged, so some of the shadow pallets were broken.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, I would never pay for the drab greens, awful blacks and glitters that came with the product that I guess I just did not realize would be there.  </li>
            <li> Awful.  </li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>

            <li> So much larger than I expected and in a nice case. Highly pigmented colors. I will order this brand again.</li>
            <li> The size is accurate, the colors are great! Very pleased :)  I really recommend it for those who like smokey eye look!!</li>
            <li> The colors are wonderful and I love Love Love them. The colors in this pallet are also much bigger than I thought when I purchased which I was very pleased with.</li>
            <li> This eyeshadow palette is really nice. Way better than I thought for the price. The palette is bigger than you would think (each eyeshadow is about the size of a quarter) and the colors are highly pigmented. I wish they made their other eyeshadow palettes like this one. I use it almost every day and will buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li> For the amount that I paid for this product, I think it is really great and has great pigmentation for the price paid!</li>
            <li> Received pkg LATE!.. 3 of the 4 brown shadows were cracked and partially missing...there was powder residue on the outside of the case, and part of the shadows that were loose fell out when I opened the box!! What a mess!! I was thinking of purchasing the other color pallets After this mess, I will NOT be ordering unless the company can make this right with me! If I CAN GET A REFUND ON THIS PA;ETTE, I WILL ORDER AGAIN. THE COLORS THAT ARE NOT CHIPPED, BROKEN OR MISSING, ARE VERY PRETTY.</li>
            <li> With all the great reviews it was hard to let this pallet slip away. I receive mine early and upon opening it I was happy to see the size of the pallets. They were as big as the half dollar which is awesome because I dont have to worry about running out anytime soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors were highly pigmented. No complaints here. Great product</li>
            <li> I really love this palette. Really pigmented colors.  Ideal for a smokey look or a very natural look.  It includes primer shadow and 3 metallic. Palette is really bigger that it looks.  Great product for a great price.</li>
            <li> The pigment is just ok. Works much better with a primer.</li>
            <li> These colors are great for fair hair/skin.  I have strawberry blonde hair and lightly freckled fair skin.  Hope this is helpful.</li>
            <li> The colors are georgous and good quality. It&#x27;s a good deal when you look at how much you actually pay per color.</li>
            <li> I still have an entirely long way to go before I master the art of makeup. I still need a primer to make the colors pop and learn the proper technique of making the &#x27;smokey eye&#x27; but the makeup overall is beautiful. To me, MAC like for waaay less. The makeup is about the size of a quarter a piece, so that right there speaks for itself. Would buy again!</li>
            <li> Love the colors and shipped very fast!</li>
            <li> I completly LOVE this palette!! Use it almost every day. Perfect for smokey eyes. It really is a must have.</li>
            <li> These colors are one inch in diameter so the pallet is big: 4.25 by 5.75 inches.  The colors aren&#x27;t exactly as shown, at lease not on my computer...so from left top: matte white, pearl silver, shimmery bronze, matte dark brown, pearl white, pearl gray, matte olive, matte black, matte REALLY light gray (basically a cool white), pearl light gray, shimmer olive (shimmer is gold), and shimmer black (shimmer is green).  Hope that&#x27;s helpful :)</li>
            <li> This is a great product. she shadow stays put and blends perfectly. I love it more than any of my Sophora, Naked, etc. I would love to know where/how to get refills for the pallet.</li>
            <li> Awful.  Falls apart everywhere.  Took forever to clean up.</li>
            <li> I love the colors in this palette.  Very rich, and very easy to blend.  Would definately purchase this again.  Also, nice size.  Will last long time.  Delivery was speedy and productr was in perfect condition when it arrived.  Very satisfied with Shany products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy that usually tends to dress up as female characters at conventions &amp; more recently i&#x27;ve been looking at ways that I might be able to make myself look even more convincing/ feminine with makeup. Decided to initially buy this as some seemed to rave about how it does a pretty good job at brightening up their eyes while covering dark circles. This eyeshadow palette did that and more! My facial hair also tends to become faintly noticeable a day after shaving, and surprisingly the whiter eyeshadows did a great job of concealing up the minor stubble. I also have somewhat sensitive skin and was a bit worried at first about this irritating my face &amp; containing harsh chemicals in the ingredients, but fortunately it did no harm &amp; managed to remain in tact for the 8 hours I left it on my face. Definitely worth a purchase!</li>
            <li> These shadows look just like they do in the picture, I love them.  They are great, especially for the price</li>
            <li> I have small eyes and cant really work with different colors everytime i buy a pallette i use its colors for nail polish, lipstick, etc... however, with this pallette i dont see any color going to waist I &lt;3 d good quality and the color of this pallette. I recommend this pallette</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a devoted MAC and Make Up Forever girl.. For me personally the pigment quality is awful and there is no blending potential for what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Size is good for price (a little bigger then a quarter). They are not highly pigmented BUT with a eye primer you should be good for staying power!</li>
            <li> These eyeshadows are only so-so. I suppose for the money it&#x27;s a good deal with all of the colors you get but I would spend a little more money to get a higher quality product.</li>
            <li> I would NOT recommend this product. I received it and opened it to find it completely destroyed. All the pallets were broken and it spilled everywhere. Must have been how they shipped it. But I would advise you to just go to the mall or wal greens. Horrible.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disapoint because they came all broken and there is no way that I can fix them. I tried to return them but it was imposible.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this eyeshadow pallet. The colors are wonderful.</li>
            <li> Exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to be. Pricey, but what good quality makeup ain&#x27;t? Was worth the $. Got it for my teenage daughter and she loved it. EASY. Few clicks, check the mail, done. I&#x27;ll be buying more makeup products from Amazon again.</li>
            <li> The colors are very pretty. A lot of shimmer. The only downfall was that one of the colors was damaged :( because of the shipping.THe damage caused one of the eyeshadow colors to blend with other colors. Overall, good product.</li>
            <li> Beautiful and professional looking makeup. Perfect colors for smokey eyes for all eye colors as they have browns and blacks included and perfect white variations for a very dimensional look. Will certainly order from their brand again.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately It arrived damaged, so some of the shadow pallets were broken. Which is a complete disappointment! I was really looking forward to them too. ðŸ˜ž</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have high expectations as I&#x27;m a long-time MAC user and this product was really inexpensive. I bought the smokey eye colors. I am very fair skinned and these colors are the exact same color on my eye as they appear. I am very impressed with this eye shadow. It goes on really well and doesn&#x27;t leave a lot of flakes under the eye to clean up which is awesome considering they are very dark colors. I also noticed that the colors that look best together are in the same row. So if you highlight with the top left silver/white it will look best with the colors in the same row moving to the left.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful kit! Nice and deep colors! I wear them all the time with a lot of my clothes! Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> try to apply the colors nothing stays, don&#x27;t order i have never ordered cosmetic so bad as this waste of money</li>
            <li> Finally, an affordable eye palette with highly pigmented and blendable colors! A must have for your makeup collection. Keep them coming Shany!</li>
            <li> Great price.. High pigment.. Wonderful product! Now if I could only buy the time to do my eyes with this make up everyday :)</li>
            <li> Color payoff excellent, large  pan of eyeshadow,, very little fall out.  Very satisfied with quality. Received intact.  Only gets 4 stars because the packaging could and should have been better. Please work on the packaging I&#x27;m a bit hesitant to order again</li>
            <li> The color palette was very nice, and I often get compliments on my eyes. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like, is that one of the colors was broken up upon arrival. This must have happened during shipping. Otherwise, great product. Just gotta find a way to stop the shadows from breaking.</li>
            <li> The SHANY 12 COLOR Palette in Smokey Eyes is beautiful with rich pigments (a mixture of mostly matte and and a few shimmers) and the light to dark makes for an easy transition straight from work to play. I have several Shany palettes/products (concealer/blush palette&#x27;s, brush sets etc..) and all their products are long lasting, glide on smoothly, and have never irritated my sensitive skin AND they are very inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One suggestion, (for those not aware) use an eye shadow primer before applying eye shadow, this will make for a longer lasting look, no creasing on your eyelid, and this will also enhance your color, primer is always a must for me. I use eye shadow primer on my high end products as well as my inexpensive products and it works great for both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shany products combines high quality with unbelievable prices, perfect for anyone on a budget!</li>
            <li> I use this every single day. The colors are beautiful for an all year around natural look. Would love to purchase this product again!</li>
            <li> With the colors I do use, I am very impressed with it&#x27;s staying power and it&#x27;s ability to remain subtle, yet illuminating. On the other hand, I would never pay for the drab greens, awful blacks and glitters that came with the product that I guess I just did not realize would be there.  Nonetheless, overall, I will keep it, as it has more colors that I would use than not!  4/5</li>
            <li> This is an awesome palette for smokey eyes. It is very vibrant and lasts all day... I would recommend it for anyone trying to start out in the makeup world. :)</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone! I love the colors and use all of them. Definitely worth every penny. Great for a smokey eye.</li>
