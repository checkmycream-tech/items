            <li>I will be purchasing more</li>
            <li>You get what you paid for and then some with this set of lovely lashes.</li>
            <li>Because there are so many, I don’t baby them at all.</li>
            <li>If you do roll over lash hairs, it okay.</li>
            <li>Before leaving some snide comments for the seller, I read over some more of the reviews.</li>
            <li>i love my set of lashes.</li>
            <li>[...] ENJOY !</li>
            <li>Feel confident when ordering these lashed</li>
            <li>They are so easy to use</li>
            <li>/&gt;They came in great packaging and great variety, sucks i am allergic.</li>
            <li>They go on so easy.</li>
            <li>They were secured in a lot of bubblewrap and the boxes of these lashes are super cute as well.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with my purchase and the price was worth it for the amount your getting since now</li>
            <li>the price, they are really worth it whether you wear lashes every day or for special occasions.</li>
            <li>These are such an amazing deal.</li>
            <li>Great for work, dates, formal events or just to jazz up your everyday face.</li>
            <li>Well worth it.of</li>
            <li>Well worth it.</li>
            <li>Very nice for the price, a bit difficult to apply and stay applied, especially at the ends, overall great for a one time use/ night out!</li>
            <li>If you wear lashes often this is way better than buying them individually.</li>
            <li>Will purchase more in the future!!</li>
            <li>The lashes I received are exactly like the picture, except for one set.</li>
            <li>most people, I wigged out when I could only find 4 sets of lashes.</li>
            <li>I love these lashes they look full and pretty or you can wear the natural ones so many to pick from and they last for a long time</li>
            <li>Took a little while to arrive after my order was placed but other than the wait they are great!</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Thanks a bunch</li>
            <li>but I just wanted to warn the next possible buyer - BEWARE: there are much better products out there for a better price.. and the eyelashes don&#x27;t actually poke or hurt your eyes!!</li>
            <li>but i so far enjoy them i&#x27;ve tried two different pairs</li>
            <li>And guess what, there are two more sets of the missing lashes.</li>
            <li>I was bummed at first that I had received repeat styles but after further inspection I noticed that the description was correct.</li>
            <li>OMG I love these and BTW girls if you turn the box upside down and wiggle the edges the cardboard in the middle will pop out,</li>
            <li>Very neat and organized in 8 different styles.</li>
            <li>and they look and feel so natural</li>
            <li>and they are lighter then most lashes at least for me</li>
            <li>, so they asked for pictures- which is completely resonably.</li>
            <li>This process helps the lash follow the natural curve of the lash line.</li>
            <li>Some of the more natural styles have subtle differences.</li>
            <li>I’m pretty rough on them</li>
            <li>Such as heavy on the outside and fading to a more sparse look toward the inside.</li>
            <li>I found some random ones at the Dollar Tree for a dollar a pair and that was better, but these beat everyone out by far.</li>

            <li> I found some random ones at the Dollar Tree for a dollar a pair and that was better, but these beat everyone out by far.</li>
            <li> The problem is I only got 40 different pairs, I&#x27;m still waiting on my other 40😕</li>
            <li> Some were a little deformed, but it is nothing you cannot fixed.</li>
            <li> to long tho!</li>
            <li> Same goes for the other box.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The band is thick and if you have sensitive eyes, the band will start to itch by the middle of the day.</li>
            <li> They prompted me to lift the cardboard up from behind the first to sets of lashes.</li>
            <li> Is the band part a hard plasticy feeling or soft and bendy?</li>
            <li> These eyelashes are HARD, they do not feel natural and the hurt to wear throughout the day.</li>
            <li> They were wet and mildewed when I received them.</li>
            <li> However caused eye irritation and after a few hours i had itchy red</li>
            <li> Also there are enough to cut a few and create a custom look.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have sensitive eyes, or you have the time to wash and mess with the band to make it less stiff then</li>
            <li> Half of them are worthless, depending on what kind of look you&#x27;re going for.</li>
            <li> It was missing an eyelash but other than that</li>
            <li> Recieved half of what I was supposed to.</li>
            <li> Half of my eyelashes were deformed</li>
            <li> Very stiff and rough feeling against the lid</li>
            <li> I know some people are having trouble finding the rest of them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are on the stiff side, so before applying, wrap them around a lip or eyeliner pencil in a coil fashion.</li>
            <li> usually spend 4 or 5 bucks on one pair of lashes and maybe get 3 or 4 uses out of them.</li>
            <li> I wear them everyday !</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews</li>
            <li> I have tried at least four of the styles</li>
            <li> Not a good thing. :/</li>
            <li> So I sent pictures and they said they could see nothing wrong with them.</li>
            <li> so disappointed at this bcuz mine just came</li>
            <li> horrible lashes .</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Probably the best thing I have ever purchased on amazon!! They come in 2 cute boxes. Very neat and organized in 8 different styles. Absolutely love them.</li>
            <li> I bought this last year and I&#x27;m still using them today. If you wear lashes often this is way better than buying them individually. They are so easy to use and they look and feel so natural</li>
            <li> I Only Recieved 40 Pairs Instead Of 80...</li>
            <li> I love these lashes they look full and pretty or you can wear the natural ones so many to pick from and they last for a long time me and my friends had a ball with them :)</li>
            <li> Not as curled as I like them to be but they work!</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with my purchase and the price was worth it for the amount your getting since now lashes are running $1 something to almost $4 for just 1 pair.</li>
            <li> They were wet and mildewed when I received them.</li>
            <li> Lashes are great. Took a little while to arrive after my order was placed but other than the wait they are great!</li>
            <li> Took foreeeevverrr to get these but i so far enjoy them i&#x27;ve tried two different pairs and they are lighter then most lashes at least for me</li>
            <li> horrible lashes . blank</li>
            <li> I am always buying eyelashes for my daughters dance competitions and revue, this will be very nice to have on hand and not worry.</li>
            <li> Great price! However caused eye irritation and after a few hours i had itchy red eyes.&lt;br /&gt;They came in great packaging and great variety, sucks i am allergic.</li>
            <li> I didnt even get all of them plus it was only 3 different pair</li>
            <li> They ĺook grate! Unbelievably good deal!</li>
            <li> It was missing an eyelash but other than that i love the fact i dont have to trim the ends anymore :)</li>
            <li> These are such an amazing deal. I was bummed at first that I had received repeat styles but after further inspection I noticed that the description was correct. Some of the more natural styles have subtle differences. The packaging is nice and organized. Great for work, dates, formal events or just to jazz up your everyday face.</li>
            <li> I love them!!!!! They go on so easy. And look really good. I just got more. Can never have too many</li>
            <li> Love them, awesome deal</li>
            <li> Very nice . They do come from china so the shipping take a wait.  The lashes are nice. All the styles are  different .</li>
            <li> Do not order these eyelashes they cheat as hell I want my money back. Cheat ass hell.</li>
            <li> I am VERY pleased with my lashes!!!  Will purchase more in the future!!</li>
            <li> The band is thick and if you have sensitive eyes, the band will start to itch by the middle of the day. Its a great amount of eyelashes, at a great price, but you know what they say about things being too good to be true! If you don&#x27;t have sensitive eyes, or you have the time to wash and mess with the band to make it less stiff then its a good buy. I wear them, however, its every now and again. I would definitely try to find something similar elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Great eyelashes. Thanks</li>
            <li> Very nice for the price, a bit difficult to apply and stay applied, especially at the ends, overall great for a one time use/ night out!</li>
            <li> Eyelashes galore! You can&#x27;t beat this deal and there are so many choices to use. I have tried at least four of the styles and they all look and fit great. I use these for photo shoots so they are not on all day, which means I cannot vouch for their durability. After I use a pair I discard them.</li>
            <li> OMG I love these and BTW girls if you turn the box upside down and wiggle the edges the cardboard in the middle will pop out, I know some people are having trouble finding the rest of them. I hope this helps. :)</li>
            <li> TOOK A GOOD WHILE TO GET HERE BUT GOT HERE A WEEK BEFORE THE ESTIMATE IT COMES ORGANIZED I LOVE THEM!</li>
            <li> Recieved half of what I was supposed to. Says 80 pairs I got 40.</li>
            <li> Good deal for your money!</li>
            <li> I order them and I like how it fits. The problem is I only got 40 different pairs, I&#x27;m still waiting on my other 40😕</li>
            <li> Good price for 80 lashes. They look great. I will be purchasing more</li>
            <li> They look really nice...Im trying a pair on this weekend I hope theyll look as nice as they do in the box...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Took to long tho! Not a good thing. :/</li>
            <li> nice variety, able to reuse if taken care when removing.  Thanks a bunch</li>
            <li> Do not order from here. Half of my eyelashes were deformed so I sent in a request to have them replaced, so they asked for pictures- which is completely resonably. So I sent pictures and they said they could see nothing wrong with them. So I sent them more pictures with descriptions under each picture explaining what was wrong- I never heard back from them.</li>
            <li> You get what you paid for and then some with this set of lovely lashes. The lashes I received are exactly like the picture, except for one set. They are a bit thinner, but they will do. For the price, quality, and quantity these are the best deal I have come across.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually spend 4 or 5 bucks on one pair of lashes and maybe get 3 or 4 uses out of them. I found some random ones at the Dollar Tree for a dollar a pair and that was better, but these beat everyone out by far. The prices on amazon fluctuate, but what I paid comes out to 20 cents a pair. Because there are so many, I don’t baby them at all. I’m pretty rough on them and they are standing up to the abuse. I’m not a daily user of lashes but I think will be now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are on the stiff side, so before applying, wrap them around a lip or eyeliner pencil in a coil fashion. Meaning don’t let the lash overlap itself and roll the edges between your fingers to warm the lash band and get it to relax a bit. If you do roll over lash hairs, it okay. You can fix with a lash curler later. This process helps the lash follow the natural curve of the lash line. Remove from pencil and apply a lash glue of your choice and apply. If they look funky, go ahead and use a lash curler after the glue has dried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like most people, I wigged out when I could only find 4 sets of lashes. It would have been 40 cents a pair, but I still would have felt cheated. Before leaving some snide comments for the seller, I read over some more of the reviews. They prompted me to lift the cardboard up from behind the first to sets of lashes. And guess what, there are two more sets of the missing lashes. Same goes for the other box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, they are really worth it whether you wear lashes every day or for special occasions. Also there are enough to cut a few and create a custom look. Such as heavy on the outside and fading to a more sparse look toward the inside. Also doubling up different styles of the lashes gives you an unlimited amount of looks. Go ahead and buy these. Well worth it.of the lashes gives you an unlimited amount of looks.

            <li> i love my set of lashes. depending on which pair i choose, i style my makeup based on that. &amp;#60;33333</li>
            <li> Very stiff and rough feeling against the lid</li>
            <li> Just wondering before I buy these. Is the band part a hard plasticy feeling or soft and bendy?</li>
            <li> im so disappointed at this bcuz mine just came 2 different pairs insted of 8... &amp;#62;:/</li>
            <li> Great deal. Nice lashes.</li>
            <li> I ordered these lashes and loved them ! Here is a review I did of the shipping , packaging and lashes them selves on YouTube  ! I wear them everyday ! [...] ENJOY ! Feel confident when ordering these lashed I loved mine !</li>
            <li> The lashes are amazing, the packaging was great.  Some were a little deformed, but it is nothing you cannot fixed. They were secured in a lot of bubblewrap and the boxes of these lashes are super cute as well. Would definitely repurchase!!</li>
            <li> Incredible aweful. the propuct is compltetly different and only comes with 20pairs</li>
            <li> These eyelashes are HARD, they do not feel natural and the hurt to wear throughout the day. Half of them are worthless, depending on what kind of look you&#x27;re going for. I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but I just wanted to warn the next possible buyer - BEWARE: there are much better products out there for a better price.. and the eyelashes don&#x27;t actually poke or hurt your eyes!!</li>
