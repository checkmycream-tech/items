            <li> I was a fan of this spray back in the 80&#x27;s and had forgot about it until recently. I&#x27;m not a perfume wearer, but I really love this subtle scent.  It&#x27;s not overwhelming at all, not overpowering. Clean and fresh and I feel great when I wear it.</li>
            <li> I used to wear this all the time in high school. I still love it . Light and fresh  and fun Thanks</li>
            <li> Boyfriend loves this fragrance, thanks!</li>
            <li> I love this product! I was delivered on time and in great condition. I will order this again! I really like the scent of this!</li>
            <li> This is the perfume I have been filing for years.  No longer available for purchase in my local store, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Sand &amp; Sable&#x27;s scent is light with overtones of gardenia.  The scent doesn&#x27;t seem to change when sprayed on the skin.</li>
            <li> I expected to get the bottle that I seem on the picture but instead it was a totally different bottle right product but not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Cannot find in stores anymore so I have no choice but to buy online.  I&#x27;d rather buy from Amazon than an unknown.  I wish the price was better, but as for quality, it was just what I expected and received.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping. They always have what im looking for. Have bought from them several times. Would not hesitate to reccomend them for future purchases</li>
            <li> Arrived intact and when the confirmation said it would. Will reorder when I start getting low.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s my favorite and only fragrance &amp; getting hard to find in the stores.</li>
            <li> was looking for old jungle gardenia by tuvara or tuvace and this seemed to be the closest to that old and beautiful fragrance</li>

            <li> I had used this cologne many years ago and a friend gave me a bottle recently, which I dropped and broke. Could not find it locally,  I love the fragrance and definitely will order more when this is used up!!</li>
            <li> It is not made by Coty and is a knock off.  It smells nothing like the real thing. I have been wearing it for 40 years and know the difference.  The box is the same but not the contents. I was cheated out of $35.00.  I would think that Amazon would check out their recommendations.  Read the comments for this company.  Not one good one.  I am going to be more careful before I use Amazon again</li>
            <li> One of my favorite fragrances-great one for blondes, mild or light, not over powering.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite colognes. When I spot a good bargain, I go for it!! I use it daily!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this perfume and it is hard to find in my local stores. I am very happy to still be able to get it as a gift.</li>
            <li> This cologne is one of my favorites and I absolutely love it!  Will buy it again! I smell great!! Thanks!</li>
