            <li>Excellent product and Seller !</li>
            <li>Works great!  </li>
            <li>The gel is great.</li>
            <li>I had an amputation of my great toe which wouldn&#x27;t heal for months.</li>
            <li>Great for what I needed it for.</li>
            <li>This item works GREAT as stated on the tube...</li>
            <li>Good product works well</li>
            <li>Good buy.  </li>
            <li>and if he thought that it would be good for me.  </li>
            <li>The duoderm worked awesome and the wound healing speed increased fast.</li>
            <li>Effective, but after awhile I find myself scratching it off, and scratching is what I&#x27;m trying not to do.</li>
            <li>excellent product very well all</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;m a severe diabetic, I thought from the mostly glowing reviews that this would be good for me.  </li>
            <li>Quick shipping of undamaged product at a fair price.</li>
            <li>Web site sales are many times unclear.  </li>
            <li>Still not terrible</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re left with a plastic-y covering, perfect for rolling a sock over or</li>
            <li>just something to keep your pants from touching the wound.</li>
            <li>did order more Duoderm sheets as they will hold up to my ski boots but</li>
            <li>An excellent topical gel for healing wounds.</li>
            <li>and I was able to get 3 for $19.95.</li>
            <li>This is the second time I replied as to how I was happy about the delivery as well as the products./</li>
            <li>Nice filler for a deeper foot wound, really helps in healing.</li>
            <li>Inexpensive and very effective for class two or lesser decubitus.</li>
            <li>DuoDerm, is the related oinment, goes on clear and cool, and dires like water, and it works as great or greater than advertised.</li>
            <li>Just in case&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 5 stars to the seller who shipped it very quickly ;-)&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li>I was with a fresh wound.</li>
            <li>Be aware, also, that this product creates a too- moist environment where the edges of the cut will whiten</li>
            <li>I ended up getting a much cheaper prescription antibiotic ointment and that hasn&#x27;t worked, either, in terms of the wound closing/healing.  </li>
            <li>My doctor has now seen that nothing has worked, so he is researching further to see if there is anything else available that will meet my needs.</li>
            <li>Backstory:&lt;br /&gt;I had a pretty wicked burn (3x3&amp;#34;) right above my ankle</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>With the DouDerm you can use a new tube if you get another non healing wound ... and the expiration date was Feb. 2016</li>
            <li>A competitors product comes in 1 large tube for the same price</li>
            <li>So far this seems to be the case.</li>
            <li>Luckily I had a few sheets of Duoderm which unlike Tegaderm includes an absorbent.</li>
            <li>The gel goes on wet and depending on the thickness seems to dry quick</li>
            <li>Saved considerable money from local store purchase price.</li>
            <li>so far my initial thoughts are that this is a solid high-tech product that seems like the future.</li>

            <li> so far my initial thoughts are that this is a solid high-tech product that seems like the future.</li>
            <li> Healed a non healing toe wound (12 weeks with no prior improvement following Doctors instructions ) on a long term Type 1 Diabetic within 10 days !</li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend this product to anyone who may have a hard to heal wound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I ordered it thinking that I could just apply the gel and let it dry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been applying and letting it dry and then applying another layer, this seems to build it up</li>
            <li> but you have to discard it after it is open for 28 days which is a waste of money if you have a smaller wound.</li>
            <li> However, after a hard three consecutive days of skiing the wound did not like that and all the new skin</li>
            <li> It does what it says, which is to allow tissue to heal without drying out or getting soggy, while dissolving ONLY the dead tissue.</li>
            <li> This was a total waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Not very pliable and hard to apply.</li>
            <li> After a few days I will do a follow up review.</li>
            <li> not sure if it has any effect.</li>
            <li> This is usually purchased at the pharmacy for $30</li>
            <li> Not at all helpful in healing a small decubitus ulcer</li>
            <li> I got a small cut on the bottom of my foot over a month ago.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find.</li>
            <li> He thought that it would work and stated (as others have onsite) that it was a common product used at wound care centers.  </li>
            <li> just received the Duoderm gel and the directions vaguely touch on how it&#x27;s to be used and the internet is of little help.</li>
            <li> but it is still quite a thin layer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Too thin.  </li>
            <li> It is useless.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> I had ordered the duoderm pads to treat a pressure sore. They are a pain to use. They curl and come off. The gel is great. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Misleading information.  Web site sales are many times unclear.  Requested 1 tube, instead was sent three tubes packaged as one unit.  Instead of being charged for one tube was charged for three.  Will not deal with this company again.</li>
            <li> gelly. not sure if it has any effect. will update later</li>
            <li> Backstory:&lt;br /&gt;I had a pretty wicked burn (3x3&amp;#34;) right above my ankle and I had been using Tegaderm to dress the wound while it drained and healed which worked quite well. However, after using it for weeks on end, yes the dressing was changed, it started to irritate the skin around the wound from having something stuck to it. Also the ski season started which meant my boot would apply some pressure to the wound. Luckily I had a few sheets of Duoderm which unlike Tegaderm includes an absorbent. The duoderm worked awesome and the wound healing speed increased fast. However, after a hard three consecutive days of skiing the wound did not like that and all the new skin I that it had made was gone, left I was with a fresh wound. Still not terrible but I was out of duoderm so I searched my options on here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initial review:&lt;br /&gt;I just received the Duoderm gel and the directions vaguely touch on how it&#x27;s to be used and the internet is of little help. From my understanding you&#x27;re supposed to apply the Duoderm to the wound and use a traditional dressing over that but I ordered it thinking that I could just apply the gel and let it dry and I&#x27;d essentially have a lightweight dressing. So far this seems to be the case. The gel goes on wet and depending on the thickness seems to dry quick and you&#x27;re left with a plastic-y covering, perfect for rolling a sock over or just something to keep your pants from touching the wound. I&#x27;ve been applying and letting it dry and then applying another layer, this seems to build it up but it is still quite a thin layer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did order more Duoderm sheets as they will hold up to my ski boots but so far my initial thoughts are that this is a solid high-tech product that seems like the future. After a few days I will do a follow up review.</li>
            <li> An excellent topical gel for healing wounds. This is usually purchased at the pharmacy for $30 and I was able to get 3 for $19.95.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and very effective for class two or lesser decubitus. Quick shipping of undamaged product at a fair price.</li>
            <li> Healed a non healing toe wound (12 weeks with no prior improvement following Doctors instructions ) on a long term Type 1 Diabetic within 10 days ! I would certainly recommend this product to anyone who may have a hard to heal wound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I like is this comes in 3 smaller tubes so it keeps longer and stays sterile in the unopened tubes ... A competitors product comes in 1 large tube for the same price but you have to discard it after it is open for 28 days which is a waste of money if you have a smaller wound. With the DouDerm you can use a new tube if you get another non healing wound ... and the expiration date was Feb. 2016 an ENTIRE 2YEARS away !!!  Will always keep this product on hand from now on ... Just in case&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 5 stars to the seller who shipped it very quickly ;-)&lt;br /&gt; Excellent product and Seller !</li>
            <li> I am a retired physician. I had an amputation of my great toe which wouldn&#x27;t heal for months. After I started using this it healed progressively. It does what it says, which is to allow tissue to heal without drying out or getting soggy, while dissolving ONLY the dead tissue. It is one step short of miraculous.</li>
            <li> This was use for my dad who have non healing ulcer on his leg. It&#x27;s been a big help in his healing.&lt;br /&gt;The wound care nurse recommended to us at the hospital were I work.</li>
            <li> It is useless.  Too thin.  Does not protects the wound,</li>
            <li> Not at all helpful in healing a small decubitus ulcer</li>
            <li> Good product works well</li>
            <li> Product totally met my expectations.u</li>
            <li> Ive several wound ulcers that wound care wanted me to use hydrogel. No where in my area could I find it locally so ended up finding this here on amazon and I got 3 tubes for the price of one and it works.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I replied as to how I was happy about the delivery as well as the products./</li>
            <li> Not very pliable and hard to apply.</li>
            <li> Using the gel is like using a liquid bandaid.  Effective, but after awhile I find myself scratching it off, and scratching is what I&#x27;m trying not to do.</li>
            <li> Great for what I needed it for.</li>
            <li> excellent product very well all</li>
            <li> DuoDerm, is the related oinment, goes on clear and cool, and dires like water, and it works as great or greater than advertised.</li>
            <li> This item works GREAT as stated on the tube...</li>
            <li> Good buy.  Saved considerable money from local store purchase price.</li>
            <li> Works great!  Hard to find.</li>
            <li> This was a total waste of money.  I got a small cut on the bottom of my foot over a month ago.  Since I&#x27;m a severe diabetic, I thought from the mostly glowing reviews that this would be good for me.  Immediately after I received it, I contacted my doctor as to what he thought about the product and if he thought that it would be good for me.  He thought that it would work and stated (as others have onsite) that it was a common product used at wound care centers.  Well, I have used it and it has done nothing.  I ended up getting a much cheaper prescription antibiotic ointment and that hasn&#x27;t worked, either, in terms of the wound closing/healing.  In fact; after these weeks, it has opened up further.  Be aware, also, that this product creates a too- moist environment where the edges of the cut will whiten/macerate.  That does not contribute to healing.  My doctor has now seen that nothing has worked, so he is researching further to see if there is anything else available that will meet my needs.</li>
            <li> Excelent product.  Helps a lot!!</li>
            <li> Nice filler for a deeper foot wound, really helps in healing.</li>
            <li> duoderm healed my husband&#x27;s pressure sores in a matter of days. He is sedentary so we have continued using the ointment whenever his skin shows redness</li>
