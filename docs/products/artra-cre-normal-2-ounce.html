            <li>Works we&#x27;ll pleased buying again and again</li>
            <li>Love my cream will always use it.</li>
            <li>I have used this lotion for many years, and it truly works wonders on my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m okay with that</li>
            <li>She had the most beautiful skin even when she passed at 88 years old.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully this will be available online for many more years to come.</li>
            <li>This product made my skin smooth and mositerized with spf protection from the sun&#x27;s UV rays.</li>
            <li>I am wrinkle free and it helps my skin imperfections blend.  </li>
            <li>I only use my cleanser and this and it keeps away the acne and makes my face look great.  </li>
            <li>Thanks  Amazon for locating this product!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since the reviews are so good I will wait another month and report back.</li>
            <li>I used to use Atra years ago but haven&#x27;t been able to find it in my area very often.</li>
            <li>I gave it 2 stars because item came quickly and does look like image.  </li>
            <li>I love how this product keeps my skin clear of blemishes and keeps it even toned.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>WE REALLY LIKE THIS PRODUCT and will order more in the future.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to use this product and like it.</li>
            <li>Within one month of use, my acne marks have faded VERY well</li>
            <li>I used this product for 2 weeks straight.  </li>
            <li>My wife, teenaged daughters and I all use this product so much that I keep a tube in my luggage to avoid being without it.</li>
            <li>and I just have to remember to not put on too much at once.</li>
            <li>I have a spot by my nose that I accidentally scratched more than a year ago, and it always has stayed sensitive and different than the rest of my skin on my face.  </li>
            <li>I would really like to try this brand if they made with all natural SPF or even without the SPF.  </li>
            <li>Works very well for melasma sun spots and for such a reasonable price!</li>
            <li>turns out I am very sensitive to chemically made SPF.  </li>
            <li>I use the cream marked for normal skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive to new products, but Artra is gentle enough not to aggravate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t completely eliminate, though.</li>
            <li>Ambi and countless others did absolutely nothing for me.  </li>
            <li>and I predict that they will be completely faded in another month or two.  </li>
            <li>My face started to glow and somehow it helped with my Adult acne.</li>
            <li>Have been unable to find this product in stores, so I&#x27;m happy that I finally know where to go for future purchases.</li>
            <li>So I put a dab of this on it, and it seems to be getting it back to normal.  </li>
            <li>My skin is really neither oily nor dry.</li>
            <li>I find this to be a thick cream that doesn&#x27;t soak in very quickly.</li>
            <li>My skin only likes natural SPFs like titanium or zinc oxides.  </li>
            <li>THANK YOU so much to the other consumers that have written reviews, because I will never purchase another skin tone cream besides Artra.  </li>

            <li> THANK YOU so much to the other consumers that have written reviews, because I will never purchase another skin tone cream besides Artra.  </li>
            <li> So if your skin is sensitive, then I think this might be too harsh.</li>
            <li> My skin tone has already improved and I have been using it only less than a month.</li>
            <li> It caused my face to break out even more and irritate so bad.</li>
            <li> I would be curious to see if it did lighten skin.  </li>
            <li> But once I received the two bottles I purchased the more uncomfortable with the fact that these have serious carcinogens in them.  </li>
            <li> I wish it worked out for me because based on other reviews, it worked for some people.  </li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve only used it on my face and it works to fade blemishes and even out my skin tone.</li>
            <li> you suffer from dark marks due to acne, please give Artra a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also trying to use it to get rid of dark circles under my eyes and on either side of the bridge of my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For being 2 percent hydroquinone, this product is having some effect on lightening my dark spots.</li>
            <li> Instead of buying expensive products I would highly recommend trying this!</li>
            <li> My grandmother used this product when I was a little girl.  </li>
            <li> seems a little lighter.</li>
            <li> Cream is slow to work but definately seeing results and is affordable</li>
            <li> I have dealt with hyper-pigmentation for approximately 15 years and have tried just about every fade cream on the market.</li>
            <li> I have seen a bit of a difference after 1 month, but not terribly impressed.</li>
            <li> Idk if I am using it wrong</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hate that they stopped selling this product in store.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product made my skin smooth and mositerized with spf protection from the sun&#x27;s UV rays. Great product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this cream! My skin tone has already improved and I have been using it only less than a month.</li>
            <li> Used this product for years! Great Product !</li>
            <li> I wish I could have used this product. I gave it 2 stars because item came quickly and does look like image.  I could not use cream because it uses man-made SPFs....turns out I am very sensitive to chemically made SPF.  My skin only likes natural SPFs like titanium or zinc oxides.  I really wanted to use this product and like it. I wish it worked out for me because based on other reviews, it worked for some people.  I would really like to try this brand if they made with all natural SPF or even without the SPF.  I would be curious to see if it did lighten skin.  So if your skin is sensitive, then I think this might be too harsh.</li>
            <li> I love Artra but this appears to be old..should have checked date on box</li>
            <li> Great skin cream. Very pleased.  A friend lead me to this product and I am so very glad that she did</li>
            <li> I have seen a bit of a difference after 1 month, but not terribly impressed. I have pigmentation from acne. It might have lightened it a touch, but I also might be imagining it. I&#x27;m also trying to use it to get rid of dark circles under my eyes and on either side of the bridge of my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the reviews are so good I will wait another month and report back. However, I&#x27;m very fair and most of the reviews seem to come from people with darker skin tones. Will wait and see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works as a sunblock if nothing else.</li>
            <li> For being 2 percent hydroquinone, this product is having some effect on lightening my dark spots. It doesn&#x27;t completely eliminate, though.</li>
            <li> My grandmother used this product when I was a little girl.  She had the most beautiful skin even when she passed at 88 years old.  I can see a difference in my skin already!  I am wrinkle free and it helps my skin imperfections blend.  Thanks  Amazon for locating this product!!!</li>
            <li> I used this product years ago. Does the job without breaking the bank. My sister bought it by the case, used to cover whole body, and had the most beautiful even toned skin. Have been unable to find this product in stores, so I&#x27;m happy that I finally know where to go for future purchases. Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> I have dealt with hyper-pigmentation for approximately 15 years and have tried just about every fade cream on the market. Ambi and countless others did absolutely nothing for me.  I read the reviews for Artra here on amazon and figured...eh, what else have I got to lose? THANK YOU so much to the other consumers that have written reviews, because I will never purchase another skin tone cream besides Artra.  Within one month of use, my acne marks have faded VERY well and I predict that they will be completely faded in another month or two.  My skin is very sensitive to new products, but Artra is gentle enough not to aggravate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you suffer from dark marks due to acne, please give Artra a try. You will NOT regret it.</li>
            <li> Works we&#x27;ll pleased buying again and again</li>
            <li> When I bought this I must not have read enough about hydroquinone.  But once I received the two bottles I purchased the more uncomfortable with the fact that these have serious carcinogens in them.  I don&#x27;t need skin cancer and neither do you.</li>
            <li> Works very well for melasma sun spots and for such a reasonable price! Instead of buying expensive products I would highly recommend trying this!</li>
            <li> My sister recommended this to me.  I don&#x27;t know if I use it enough to tell&lt;br /&gt;any difference except for one spot on my chest seems a little lighter. I don&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;know how it works on acne like stated in some of the reviews but it hasn&#x27;t helped&lt;br /&gt;get rid of any of mine.</li>
            <li> Cream is slow to work but definately seeing results and is affordable so I ordered another tube. Would recommend for anyone with any skin discoloration including acne scars.</li>
            <li> Love my cream will always use it.</li>
            <li> I love how this product keeps my skin clear of blemishes and keeps it even toned. Thanks for a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I hate that they stopped selling this product in store. I have used this lotion for many years, and it truly works wonders on my skin. People always ask me what I use on my face and I do not hesitate to name this product. Hopefully this will be available online for many more years to come.</li>
            <li> Idk if I am using it wrong but, I exprienced no changes in my skin with this product.</li>
            <li> Good product! Speedy deliverance.</li>
            <li> I have a spot by my nose that I accidentally scratched more than a year ago, and it always has stayed sensitive and different than the rest of my skin on my face.  So I put a dab of this on it, and it seems to be getting it back to normal.  I am happy that I purchased this.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and product is perfect.</li>
            <li> I used this product for 2 weeks straight.  My face started to glow and somehow it helped with my Adult acne. I only use my cleanser and this and it keeps away the acne and makes my face look great.  I love the fact that its affordable too!</li>
            <li> This cream does not work. It caused my face to break out even more and irritate so bad. My face has red marks from using this cream and I&#x27;m really disappointed. Now I have to look for another cream that won&#x27;t damage my face.</li>
            <li> My wife, teenaged daughters and I all use this product so much that I keep a tube in my luggage to avoid being without it. WE REALLY LIKE THIS PRODUCT and will order more in the future. It clears up blemishes and discolorations without leaving our skin oily. BRAVO!!!</li>
            <li> The product arrived earlier than the estimated delivery dates and I got exactly what I ordered in perfect condition. I used to use Atra years ago but haven&#x27;t been able to find it in my area very often. I use the cream marked for normal skin. My skin is really neither oily nor dry. I find this to be a thick cream that doesn&#x27;t soak in very quickly. I&#x27;m okay with that and I just have to remember to not put on too much at once. In the past I&#x27;ve only used it on my face and it works to fade blemishes and even out my skin tone. Now, I&#x27;ll try it on my knees.</li>
