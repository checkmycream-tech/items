            <li>I am changing my rating to a \\&quot;3\\&quot; from a \\&quot;1\\&quot; until I have given this shampoo line a fair trial.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m one for a fair trial</li>
            <li>I had just assumed that you had to sacrifice good hair for the removal of chemicals and fragrances.  </li>
            <li>Paradise Island Shampoo Fragrance Free is perfect for me.</li>
            <li>and i loved it.</li>
            <li>It lathers well and makes me feel good</li>
            <li>The smell is very light and plesant but doesn&#x27;t stick around which is great if your not into fragrances.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very pleasant and clean-</li>
            <li>I used to have breaking off problems but my hair looks very healthy now.</li>
            <li>I can feel good about not poisoning myself using this organic product AND it sudses nicely, has a lovely scent, and leaves my hair feeling great.</li>

            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I found Paradise Island shampoo and that it brought him some relief!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I like the fact that this product does lather nicely.</li>
            <li>and I was looking for a sulfate-free shampoo with a nice fragrance.</li>
            <li>This is the best paraben free, sulfate free, and pthalate free shampoo that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Soon I&#x27;ll be sulfate and cone free!</li>
            <li>The company explained that their unscented shampoo tends to be drying and to try the coconut because it is more moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>more easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This shampoo causes my scalp to itch (not horribly so</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recommended to many others and they love it too.</li>
            <li>I ordered this shampoo after having many problems with an itchy scalp.</li>
            <li>This shampoo has made my curls much more manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I have NEVER been able to use a shampoo without also using a conditioner.</li>
            <li>I noticed that my hair was really nice and smooth even without the conditioner, though, so I did an experiment today.</li>
            <li>so &#x27;good hair days&#x27; are rare.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, I&#x27;m in love with this product now</li>
            <li>This shampoo is simply lovely.  </li>
            <li>I really love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>April 20, 2015 - I&#x27;m still using this shampoo and still love it.    </li>
            <li>I love the lather.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually kinda bizarre and makes me wonder what wonderful things are in this product and why no one else in the hair industry can seem to figure this out.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair very soft to the touch, no parabens and no sulfates, great buy.</li>
            <li>It is very silky, with a great lather and exotic, fresh scent.</li>
            <li>Good lather and moisturizing whule not irritating my head.</li>
            <li>I tried many fine products that were free of sulfate and parabens</li>
            <li>I am delighted to have found my new shampoo home in Paradise Island.</li>
            <li>But after I received the shampoo and read the fine print, I saw three ingredients: Aloe Barbabdensis Leaf Extract, Flax Extract, and Glyceryl Oleate (sunflower oil)</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that ranges from waves to corkscrews</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft and I love touching it!</li>
            <li>Then you&#x27;ll see some huge changes in your hair and skin.</li>
            <li>I plan on using sulfate free in the winter and then sulfate stuff I still have in the summer to use it up.</li>
            <li>Then when all the sulfate stuff is used up, I&#x27;ll be using these sulfate free shampoos.</li>
            <li>but the light smell of my conditioner covered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got the fragrance free type and it does have a smell</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not all that sensitive and need a light-duty shampoo, this may be a good choice.</li>
            <li>It was enjoyed so much that we have since placed an order for two more coconut and two of the tropical scent.</li>
            <li>The lather is rich and creamy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy or heavy, I&#x27;m sure it would be good for most hair types.</li>
            <li>I like a shampoo that lathers as it just makes my hair feel clean.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clean all that well, leaves a residue on my scalp, and causes scalp irritation.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for colored or bleached hair as well, because it doesn&#x27;t contain any of the detergents that pull the color out, or dry it out.</li>
            <li>During a search for a healthy, safe and natural alternative to store bought shampoo, we took a chance and ordered Paradise Island Shampoo in coconut scent.</li>
            <li>Hoping that prolonged use of a natural shampoo will regulate my oil production on the scalp, back to how it used to be in youth, which was nothing like it is now.&lt;br /&gt;A+ product that we are very happy with.</li>
            <li>This shampoo leaves my hair feeling clean and does not bother me allergy-wise.</li>
            <li>I saw all the positive reviews for this shampoo so took a risk one more time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to purchase another right now!</li>
            <li>final thoughts after a fair trial:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you can see, I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li>vegetable glycerin mild preservative from plant</li>
            <li>I normally buy (and love)</li>
            <li>And I also love soap nut shampoo, but right now I am using it for coloring my hair, and I do the rinse and repeat so its more drying, when I use it regularly</li>
            <li>actually looks nice.  </li>
            <li>I checked the ingredients on the bottle and sure enough it is not sulfate free.  </li>
            <li>That being said, if you are sensitive to many products, this may not be the one for you.</li>
            <li>My favorite shampoo so far.</li>
            <li>It ended my itchy scalp problems right away.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Moisture: Coconut formula maintains a good amount of scalp moisture after shampooing but even with my regular conditioner, my hair was more dry and tangled</li>
            <li>thing is that these shampoos don&#x27;t really leave your hair feeling clean and you end up feeling like you need to wash twice.</li>
            <li>So when I read that Paradise Island Shampoo, was Sulfate Free, High Lathering, No Parabens, Phthalates, Dyes, Endocrine Disruptors, SLS Free, Vegan, Natural (Unscented 16 oz), I thought that the makers of Paradis Island Shampoo had gotten on-aboard to produce and sell a non-endocrine disruptor shampoo.</li>
            <li>I like this shampoo very much.</li>
            <li>those with mobile apps that sometimes omit the \\&quot;Important Information,\\&quot; which is where this product&#x27;s ingredients are listed, I am providing the ingredients and directions directly from the label.</li>
            <li>I noticed that I had more scalp build-up than with my regular shampoo and my hair was visibly oily after a couple of days.</li>
            <li>After I first used Paradise Island, I stopped looking.</li>
            <li>Exactly what i was looking for.</li>
            <li>The first couple of times I used it, I also used the &#x27;SexyHair&#x27; leave-in conditioner (also sulfate-free) afterwards because I assumed I needed it.  </li>
            <li>I can wash one day and then skip the next at the most with this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I originally had the tropical scent and got a really old, funky pina colada puke smell from mine.</li>
            <li>It has been a real challenge trying to find a shampoo that is free of (natural or engineered) xenoestrogen, phytoestrogens or are progesterone blockers  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair clean, soft &amp; shiny.  </li>
            <li>Paradise Island leaves the white hair sparkling, but makes comb out as easy as if I had used a separate conditioner.    </li>
            <li>After only one shampoo I loved it so much that I bought it for my daughter, whom has very long hair, and she loves it too.</li>
            <li>I find the scent very pleasing as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I really like the coconut scent.</li>
            <li>Also, you really must buy a shower filter to remove the hardness and chlorines from your water.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>but my scalp would still break out in a very sore rash.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, straight, long hair and scalp often itchy.  </li>
            <li>hair is soft, clean, not greasy (like some other chemical free brands), and manageable.</li>
            <li>I did try using only one shampooing for a couple of weeks (per label instructions) but my hair never felt or looked clean.</li>
            <li>Better, the super thick lather lets me massage my scalp and work the lather through my hair to get it clean in only one washing.</li>
            <li>but certainly a fiberglass insulation-like feeling on my skin), as well as mild itching on my face, ears, neck, &amp; upper torso--basically any area that receives a high concentration of run-off.</li>
            <li>I had been looking for a sulfate free shampoo for a long time.</li>
            <li>I want simply shampoo, and I finally found it. :)</li>
            <li>that lather does not mean a shampoo is working, which is true.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair shiny and soft and very manageable.</li>
            <li>The unscented version smells kind of tart and not nice at all</li>
            <li>Using this unscented shampoo helped my husband&#x27;s scalp to feel normal again instead of itchy.</li>
            <li>I blow-dried and styled my hair like normal and was amazed that it is actually smoother and more natural - but with the same amount of control - as I would normally get with conditioner, moose, and hairspray.  </li>
            <li>As described seems to be fragrance free and gentle as was the previous version of the product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying all kinds of natural and low or no irritant products for my hair and skin that is super sensitive.</li>
            <li>I get compliments constantly on how pretty the color is.</li>
            <li>This is the first shampoo that I purchased a second time.</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>After several weeks, my hair is still clean after several days.</li>
            <li>I have super, super thick hair with lots of fly-always</li>
            <li>for mild every day or every other day use.</li>
            <li>I am an old fashioned girl.</li>
            <li>(The company said this was to prevent removing too much naturally occurring scalp oils.)</li>
            <li>They just smell like two day old cocktails or that pina colada car freshener from the car wash.</li>
            <li>Just a heads up to those who may be sensitive to this ingredient.</li>
            <li>Which totally surprised me.</li>
            <li>knowing I&#x27;m not putting harmful chemicals on my sensitive skin and scalp.</li>
            <li>After my original scathing review, I received an informative email from the company with an offer to try one of their more moisturizing shampoos.</li>
            <li>I will only be using certain shampoos so my hair doesn&#x27;t get used to the same one over and over again.</li>
            <li>been using for three months now, it will probably last at least 2 more months.</li>
            <li>Despite this shampoo&#x27;s great lather, it did not clean dirty, sweat-laden hair very well at all.</li>
            <li>It leaves my pretty, dark colored hair just as it is without stripping.</li>
            <li>and I color it because of the grey, normally I need conditioner</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not sure if this is true.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why most other shampoo makers feel the need to add dyes and perfumes to their product.</li>
            <li>Ten days later, my hair is getting back to normal, but my scalp is still irritated.</li>
            <li>/&gt;2A type hair, highlights, super thick, shoulder length.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> you can see, I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li> vegetable glycerin mild preservative from plant</li>
            <li> I normally buy (and love)</li>
            <li> And I also love soap nut shampoo, but right now I am using it for coloring my hair, and I do the rinse and repeat so its more drying, when I use it regularly</li>
            <li> actually looks nice.  </li>
            <li> I checked the ingredients on the bottle and sure enough it is not sulfate free.  </li>
            <li> That being said, if you are sensitive to many products, this may not be the one for you.</li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo so far.</li>
            <li> It ended my itchy scalp problems right away.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Moisture: Coconut formula maintains a good amount of scalp moisture after shampooing but even with my regular conditioner, my hair was more dry and tangled</li>
            <li> thing is that these shampoos don&#x27;t really leave your hair feeling clean and you end up feeling like you need to wash twice.</li>
            <li> So when I read that Paradise Island Shampoo, was Sulfate Free, High Lathering, No Parabens, Phthalates, Dyes, Endocrine Disruptors, SLS Free, Vegan, Natural (Unscented 16 oz), I thought that the makers of Paradis Island Shampoo had gotten on-aboard to produce and sell a non-endocrine disruptor shampoo.</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo very much.</li>
            <li> those with mobile apps that sometimes omit the \\&quot;Important Information,\\&quot; which is where this product&#x27;s ingredients are listed, I am providing the ingredients and directions directly from the label.</li>
            <li> I noticed that I had more scalp build-up than with my regular shampoo and my hair was visibly oily after a couple of days.</li>
            <li> After I first used Paradise Island, I stopped looking.</li>
            <li> Exactly what i was looking for.</li>
            <li> The first couple of times I used it, I also used the &#x27;SexyHair&#x27; leave-in conditioner (also sulfate-free) afterwards because I assumed I needed it.  </li>
            <li> I can wash one day and then skip the next at the most with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I originally had the tropical scent and got a really old, funky pina colada puke smell from mine.</li>
            <li> It has been a real challenge trying to find a shampoo that is free of (natural or engineered) xenoestrogen, phytoestrogens or are progesterone blockers  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair clean, soft &amp; shiny.  </li>
            <li> Paradise Island leaves the white hair sparkling, but makes comb out as easy as if I had used a separate conditioner.    </li>
            <li> After only one shampoo I loved it so much that I bought it for my daughter, whom has very long hair, and she loves it too.</li>
            <li> I find the scent very pleasing as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I really like the coconut scent.</li>
            <li> Also, you really must buy a shower filter to remove the hardness and chlorines from your water.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> but my scalp would still break out in a very sore rash.  </li>
            <li> I have fine, straight, long hair and scalp often itchy.  </li>
            <li> hair is soft, clean, not greasy (like some other chemical free brands), and manageable.</li>
            <li> I did try using only one shampooing for a couple of weeks (per label instructions) but my hair never felt or looked clean.</li>
            <li> Better, the super thick lather lets me massage my scalp and work the lather through my hair to get it clean in only one washing.</li>
            <li> but certainly a fiberglass insulation-like feeling on my skin), as well as mild itching on my face, ears, neck, &amp; upper torso--basically any area that receives a high concentration of run-off.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a sulfate free shampoo for a long time.</li>
            <li> I want simply shampoo, and I finally found it. :)</li>
            <li> that lather does not mean a shampoo is working, which is true.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair shiny and soft and very manageable.</li>
            <li> The unscented version smells kind of tart and not nice at all</li>
            <li> Using this unscented shampoo helped my husband&#x27;s scalp to feel normal again instead of itchy.</li>
            <li> I blow-dried and styled my hair like normal and was amazed that it is actually smoother and more natural - but with the same amount of control - as I would normally get with conditioner, moose, and hairspray.  </li>
            <li> As described seems to be fragrance free and gentle as was the previous version of the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying all kinds of natural and low or no irritant products for my hair and skin that is super sensitive.</li>
            <li> I get compliments constantly on how pretty the color is.</li>
            <li> This is the first shampoo that I purchased a second time.</li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> After several weeks, my hair is still clean after several days.</li>
            <li> I have super, super thick hair with lots of fly-always</li>
            <li> for mild every day or every other day use.</li>
            <li> I am an old fashioned girl.</li>
            <li> (The company said this was to prevent removing too much naturally occurring scalp oils.)</li>
            <li> They just smell like two day old cocktails or that pina colada car freshener from the car wash.</li>
            <li> Just a heads up to those who may be sensitive to this ingredient.</li>
            <li> Which totally surprised me.</li>
            <li> knowing I&#x27;m not putting harmful chemicals on my sensitive skin and scalp.</li>
            <li> After my original scathing review, I received an informative email from the company with an offer to try one of their more moisturizing shampoos.</li>
            <li> I will only be using certain shampoos so my hair doesn&#x27;t get used to the same one over and over again.</li>
            <li> been using for three months now, it will probably last at least 2 more months.</li>
            <li> Despite this shampoo&#x27;s great lather, it did not clean dirty, sweat-laden hair very well at all.</li>
            <li> It leaves my pretty, dark colored hair just as it is without stripping.</li>
            <li> and I color it because of the grey, normally I need conditioner</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure if this is true.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why most other shampoo makers feel the need to add dyes and perfumes to their product.</li>
            <li> Ten days later, my hair is getting back to normal, but my scalp is still irritated.</li>
            <li> /&gt;2A type hair, highlights, super thick, shoulder length.</li>
            <li> I have less breakage and fewer split ends despite the fact that I use a high heat curling iron.    </li>
            <li> On the other hand, when I&#x27;ve used it daily because I was that active or got that much dust in it, it still doesn&#x27;t dry my scalp and make it itchy.    </li>
            <li> I feel better about using products when they are free from terrible chemicals.</li>
            <li> A few years ago my scalp became very sensitive to shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;Water, Sodium Methyl-w Sulfolaurate (saponified coconut oil fatty acid ester),  Disodium 2-Sulfolaurate (saponified coconut oil fatty acid salt), Cetyl Betaine (sugar beet), Lauryl Ethyl Lactate (new natural surfactant derived from coconut and/or palm oil), Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate (sugar and palm kernel), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice Extract, Linum Usitatissimum (Flax) Extract, Panthenol (Pro-vitamin B5), Glycol Distearate (vegetable oils), Coco-glucoside (coconut oil and fruit sugar),  Glyceryl Oleate (sunflower oil), Ethlhexyloxyglycerin (</li>
            <li> I originally ordered this shampoo because I got tired of standing around in the local drug store reading shampoo labels, looking for a product that would give me some volume without weigjing down my hair, which is medium length.</li>
            <li> Rinse &amp; For long hair also use a leave-in, spray-in detangler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is long -- below my shoulder blades -- and it has always been wavy.</li>
            <li> When I returned to my former shampoo, which has half the ingredients and no additives, it went away after a couples of uses (using the same conditioner I&#x27;ve been using all</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this if you, like me has been doctor placed on a zero xonestrogens tolerance in all personal beauty products (in other words any product that comes in contact with my hair or skin).  </li>
            <li> The shampoo lasts quite awhile, even between two people using it, so we imagine the other four bottles will last us until June or July at least.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t dry, or splitting, or breaking.</li>
            <li> This shampoo made my hair dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> where inside air this time of year is really dry</li>
            <li> My hair is very dry</li>
            <li> Two shampoos was better for moderate to very dirty hair.  </li>
            <li> It also dried and irritated my scalp, causing it to turn red.</li>
            <li> I did not need conditioner, detangling spray or anything else to comb out my wet hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve also tried using it as the first shampoo on very dirty hair to remove the surface grunge and ease the spreading of my regular shampoo on the second shampooing but the irritation still occurred and the scalp build-up was worse than if I do two shampoos with my regular shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Value: despite its cost, this specialty shampoo is highly concentrated and a little of this goes a lot farther than an equal amount of a cheaper shampoo.</li>
            <li> At first, I chalked the itching up to other things, like being ill, or dry skin, or other temporary issues.</li>
            <li> My old favorite was L&#x27;Occtaine for Shiny Hair but that was discontinued and then even the tiny bottles were impossible to find so the expensive search again was on.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times in the past week and have been really surprised at how well it works.  </li>
            <li> Plus, a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> However, if i shampoo every day, hair is dry mess.  </li>
            <li> 2- You may not find this, but I&#x27;m astonished to find that, depending on how active I&#x27;ve been, I can sometimes go longer between washings.</li>
            <li> I left a review and the owner sent me an email and asked if I would try some other formulas if I would remove my negative review.</li>
            <li> Other ones I have tried make my hair less than manageable, but not this one.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I wish they also made a conditioner.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the cost, but I&#x27;ll pay it to get the results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it on my hair when it has been mildly dirty with a small amount of scalp oil/dirt/hairspray to very grungy, after a day outside hiking or working with kids and horses in subtropical heat &amp; humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The coconut version is much less drying</li>
            <li> I typically wash my hair every 2-3 days.</li>
            <li> lathers up great but makes my head break out like crazy :(</li>
            <li> I have also stopped using conditioner altogether and just apply a little morrocan oil to the ends.</li>
            <li> The amount you have to use per shower is so small compared to other brands.</li>
            <li> I take showers everyday, but I usually wash my hair every other day, sometimes every 2 days, depends on how greasy my hair gets and where I&#x27;m going.</li>
            <li> I have had oily hair my whole life; if I didn&#x27;t wash it every day it was visibly dirty and greasy looking.</li>
            <li> This shampoo throws in two bonuses: no tangles and conditioning that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair limp.    </li>
            <li> Just a few notes:    </li>
            <li> After using this shampoo for a few days, I noticed my hair wasn&#x27;t getting as dirty as fast.</li>
            <li> Ill try to get it next time.</li>
            <li> Those nasty things will never allow your hair or your skin to feel healthy.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable.  </li>
            <li> No more.  </li>
            <li> I needed to switch to a sulfate-free and fragrance-free shampoo due to skin irritation (itchy skin after showering) and had tried some natural shampoos but was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I tried everything from soap only unscented and salicylic acid dandruff shampoos to an expensive thick conditioner shampoo.</li>
            <li> Like it&#x27;s leaving some residue on my hair, and leaving it looking dull and unclean.</li>
            <li> The cookie scented one smelled the least rancid to me of the scented and the unscented was just that-unscented.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought into the whole \\&quot;Wen\\&quot; Chaz Dean thing, and hated their products.</li>
            <li> I use approximately one teaspoon.</li>
            <li> Once when my hair felt very dirty, I did rinse and repeat the lather with no adverse result.</li>
            <li> I have the worst hair to have.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is my 3rd order of this shampoo.  I am allergic to almost every preservative known to the shampoo manufacturing world, and I can use this, I am not allergic to ANY of the ingredients and my hair actually looks nice.  Other ones I have tried make my hair less than manageable, but not this one. I have to use the unscented because I&#x27;m also allergic to &amp;#34;fragrance mix&amp;#34;, whatever that is.  This is a keeper!!!</li>
            <li> I checked the ingredients on the bottle and sure enough it is not sulfate free.  Buyer beware.  I dont no why their isnt trutth in advertising anymore.</li>
            <li> Soon I&#x27;ll be sulfate and cone free! I will only be using certain shampoos so my hair doesn&#x27;t get used to the same one over and over again. I will continue with this one for sure! And I also love soap nut shampoo, but right now I am using it for coloring my hair, and I do the rinse and repeat so its more drying, when I use it regularly and it is that drying then I&#x27;ll have to use a conditioner or leave in with it. With this I don&#x27;t have to use conditioner or leave in, and my hair has a lot of body which is really nice!!! I got the coconut one, I will be wanting to try others. I plan on using sulfate free in the winter and then sulfate stuff I still have in the summer to use it up. Then when all the sulfate stuff is used up, I&#x27;ll be using these sulfate free shampoos. I take showers everyday, but I usually wash my hair every other day, sometimes every 2 days, depends on how greasy my hair gets and where I&#x27;m going. My hair is so soft and I love touching it! I&#x27;m wanting to try out all the shampoos to see if I get the same results!</li>
            <li> Great shampoo - I was looking for a shampoo that would not give me allergy problems</li>
            <li> You guessed it - I have the worst hair to have. I originally ordered this shampoo because I got tired of standing around in the local drug store reading shampoo labels, looking for a product that would give me some volume without weigjing down my hair, which is medium length. I finally googled &amp;#34;sulphate free&amp;#34; and eventually lucked into Paradise Island shampoo. It cleans my hair at the scalp without drying the ends and my hair is actually shiny now. I have also stopped using conditioner altogether and just apply a little morrocan oil to the ends. I used to have breaking off problems but my hair looks very healthy now. Its a pain to have to order online so I tried going back to a drug store shampoo and immediately saw a difference and gave it to my husband then reordered Paradise Island. I wanted to try one of the scented ones (coconut) but could only find the unscented on Amazon. Ill try to get it next time.</li>
            <li> Love this! I feel better about using products when they are free from terrible chemicals. This hits the spot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is soft, clean, not greasy (like some other chemical free brands), and manageable. Will be buying forever!!! Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2A type hair, highlights, super thick, shoulder length.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a sulfate free shampoo for a long time. I bought into the whole \\&quot;Wen\\&quot; Chaz Dean thing, and hated their products. I like this shampoo very much. It leaves my pretty, dark colored hair just as it is without stripping. I get compliments constantly on how pretty the color is. I am an old fashioned girl. I like a shampoo that lathers as it just makes my hair feel clean. I like the fact that this product does lather nicely. My hair isn&#x27;t dry, or splitting, or breaking. I think it is a very good product for those of us who are looking for an alternative to chemical laden shampoos. I find the scent very pleasing as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brittany&lt;br /&gt;Magnolia, TX</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s everything I want, and nothing I don&#x27;t. I&#x27;m not sure why most other shampoo makers feel the need to add dyes and perfumes to their product. I want simply shampoo, and I finally found it. :)</li>
            <li> After my original scathing review, I received an informative email from the company with an offer to try one of their more moisturizing shampoos. I am changing my rating to a \\&quot;3\\&quot; from a \\&quot;1\\&quot; until I have given this shampoo line a fair trial. Then, I will give my final rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this shampoo  about four or five times. It doesn&#x27;t clean all that well, leaves a residue on my scalp, and causes scalp irritation. It strips the oils from my scalp and my skin overcompensates to replace it, which makes my already dull-looking hair look oily, not to mention the pimples that have started to pop up along my hairline. The company explained that their unscented shampoo tends to be drying and to try the coconut because it is more moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those with mobile apps that sometimes omit the \\&quot;Important Information,\\&quot; which is where this product&#x27;s ingredients are listed, I am providing the ingredients and directions directly from the label. This is for the unscented formula:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Natural Plant Based Ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;Water, Sodium Methyl-w Sulfolaurate (saponified coconut oil fatty acid ester),  Disodium 2-Sulfolaurate (saponified coconut oil fatty acid salt), Cetyl Betaine (sugar beet), Lauryl Ethyl Lactate (new natural surfactant derived from coconut and/or palm oil), Sodium Lauroyl Lactylate (sugar and palm kernel), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice Extract, Linum Usitatissimum (Flax) Extract, Panthenol (Pro-vitamin B5), Glycol Distearate (vegetable oils), Coco-glucoside (coconut oil and fruit sugar),  Glyceryl Oleate (sunflower oil), Ethlhexyloxyglycerin (vegetable glycerin mild preservative from plant sources).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Available Formulas [sic] have all been tested and enthusiastically approved by Cosmetologists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wash hair ONLY once. (The company said this was to prevent removing too much naturally occurring scalp oils.) Rinse. Apply conditioner. Rinse &amp; For long hair also use a leave-in, spray-in detangler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FOLLOW-UP:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I almost gave this product four stars because this company has EXCELLENT customer service. However, the product does not earn a five or even four star rating. I found the unscented version quite drying. The coconut version is much less drying and I really like the coconut scent. I&#x27;ve used it on my hair when it has been mildly dirty with a small amount of scalp oil/dirt/hairspray to very grungy, after a day outside hiking or working with kids and horses in subtropical heat &amp; humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My final thoughts after a fair trial:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moisture: Coconut formula maintains a good amount of scalp moisture after shampooing but even with my regular conditioner, my hair was more dry and tangled more easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning capability: not so great, even after repeating the shampooing process. I did try using only one shampooing for a couple of weeks (per label instructions) but my hair never felt or looked clean. Two shampoos was better for moderate to very dirty hair.  It&#x27;s o.k. for mild every day or every other day use. I typically wash my hair every 2-3 days. I noticed that I had more scalp build-up than with my regular shampoo and my hair was visibly oily after a couple of days. Despite this shampoo&#x27;s great lather, it did not clean dirty, sweat-laden hair very well at all. (I once read that lather does not mean a shampoo is working, which is true.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent: great coconut scent in the coconut formula; it&#x27;s not overpowering and very pleasant. The unscented version smells kind of tart and not nice at all but the light smell of my conditioner covered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sensitivity: the \\&quot;sulfolaurates\\&quot; and \\&quot;lauroyl lactylates\\&quot; are supposed to be kinder on the skin than the \\&quot;-sulfates,\\&quot; but I&#x27;m not sure if this is true. This shampoo causes my scalp to itch (not horribly so but certainly a fiberglass insulation-like feeling on my skin), as well as mild itching on my face, ears, neck, &amp; upper torso--basically any area that receives a high concentration of run-off. At first, I chalked the itching up to other things, like being ill, or dry skin, or other temporary issues. When I returned to my former shampoo, which has half the ingredients and no additives, it went away after a couples of uses (using the same conditioner I&#x27;ve been using all along).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also tried using it as the first shampoo on very dirty hair to remove the surface grunge and ease the spreading of my regular shampoo on the second shampooing but the irritation still occurred and the scalp build-up was worse than if I do two shampoos with my regular shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Value: despite its cost, this specialty shampoo is highly concentrated and a little of this goes a lot farther than an equal amount of a cheaper shampoo. If you like a thinner consistency, add water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like any product, people will have various sensitivities and results. That being said, if you are sensitive to many products, this may not be the one for you. If you&#x27;re not all that sensitive and need a light-duty shampoo, this may be a good choice.</li>
            <li> I originally had the tropical scent and got a really old, funky pina colada puke smell from mine. It was gross. I left a review and the owner sent me an email and asked if I would try some other formulas if I would remove my negative review. I&#x27;m one for a fair trial so I gave it a shot. She sent me unscented, pear and something cookie scented. The cookie scented one smelled the least rancid to me of the scented and the unscented was just that-unscented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing is that these shampoos don&#x27;t really leave your hair feeling clean and you end up feeling like you need to wash twice. I don&#x27;t want to wash my hair twice and I definitely don&#x27;t want to wash it with something that smells like a Tijuana bathroom on Cinco de Mayo. There is nothing islandy or paradise like about these shampoos in my opinion. They just smell like two day old cocktails or that pina colada car freshener from the car wash.</li>
            <li> Contains known allergen--ethylhexylglycerin.  Included in the patch test for contact dermatitis.  Just a heads up to those who may be sensitive to this ingredient.</li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo so far. It smells awesome, and lathers beautifully. Plus, a little bit goes a long way. I use approximately one teaspoon. The lather is rich and creamy. Which totally surprised me. After only one shampoo I loved it so much that I bought it for my daughter, whom has very long hair, and she loves it too. It&#x27;s great for colored or bleached hair as well, because it doesn&#x27;t contain any of the detergents that pull the color out, or dry it out. Also, you really must buy a shower filter to remove the hardness and chlorines from your water. Those nasty things will never allow your hair or your skin to feel healthy. Then you&#x27;ll see some huge changes in your hair and skin. I totally recommend this stuff!</li>
            <li> Update: November 8, 2014: I had been jumping from shampoo to shampoo for years before I found Paradise Island Unscented.     I tried everything from soap only unscented and salicylic acid dandruff shampoos to an expensive thick conditioner shampoo. After I first used Paradise Island, I stopped looking. It ended my itchy scalp problems right away. Better, the super thick lather lets me massage my scalp and work the lather through my hair to get it clean in only one washing. This shampoo throws in two bonuses: no tangles and conditioning that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair limp.    Just a few notes:    1- Don&#x27;t let the fact that it feels like a conditioner in your hands worry you. Lather up and, instead of washing twice, massage your scalp and work the lather through your hair thoroughly as if washing lingerie before rinsing. Once when my hair felt very dirty, I did rinse and repeat the lather with no adverse result. I applaud Paradise Island for not encouraging product wastage in order to increase sales.    2- You may not find this, but I&#x27;m astonished to find that, depending on how active I&#x27;ve been, I can sometimes go longer between washings. Sometimes twice a week is enough. On the other hand, when I&#x27;ve used it daily because I was that active or got that much dust in it, it still doesn&#x27;t dry my scalp and make it itchy.    3- I have been using Paradise Island for over three months now, at the November update. It seems to act as a conditioner aw well as a shampoo. I have less breakage and fewer split ends despite the fact that I use a high heat curling iron.    4- I like the availability of the unscented version as I have allergies. Others may like it to avoid a clash with their chosen perfume.    My hair is long -- below my shoulder blades -- and it has always been wavy. Comb out after washing was always a chore. As God&#x27;s gift of a natural white streak and tip job began to arrive, comb out got harder because the white hair is wavier. Paradise Island leaves the white hair sparkling, but makes comb out as easy as if I had used a separate conditioner.    I am delighted to have found my new shampoo home in Paradise Island. It meets my all of my needs in a shampoo. I wish I&#x27;d found it sooner.</li>
            <li> I am happy with the product.  As described seems to be fragrance free and gentle as was the previous version of the product.</li>
            <li> The amount you have to use per shower is so small compared to other brands. The smell is very light and plesant but doesn&#x27;t stick around which is great if your not into fragrances.  It will make your hair feel nicer.</li>
            <li> been using for three months now, it will probably last at least 2 more months. It leaves my hair very soft to the touch, no parabens and no sulfates, great buy.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this if you, like me has been doctor placed on a zero xonestrogens tolerance in all personal beauty products (in other words any product that comes in contact with my hair or skin).  It has been a real challenge trying to find a shampoo that is free of (natural or engineered) xenoestrogen, phytoestrogens or are progesterone blockers  So when I read that Paradise Island Shampoo, was Sulfate Free, High Lathering, No Parabens, Phthalates, Dyes, Endocrine Disruptors, SLS Free, Vegan, Natural (Unscented 16 oz), I thought that the makers of Paradis Island Shampoo had gotten on-aboard to produce and sell a non-endocrine disruptor shampoo. Based on their advertisement &amp;#34;they knew what ingredients NOT to use.&amp;#34;  But after I received the shampoo and read the fine print, I saw three ingredients: Aloe Barbabdensis Leaf Extract, Flax Extract, and Glyceryl Oleate (sunflower oil) that according to Dr. Paul Eckart are all endocrine disruptors, because they are either xenoestrogens, phytoestrogens and/or block progesterone that can result in estrogen dominance in humans.  So now I&#x27;m stuck with a $20 of shampoo I cannot use and cannot return!</li>
            <li> Using this unscented shampoo helped my husband&#x27;s scalp to feel normal again instead of itchy. After several OTC shampoos, two dermatologists, several prescription shampoos plus steroids, with no improvement . .  I&#x27;m glad I found Paradise Island shampoo and that it brought him some relief!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shampoo.  I&#x27;ve recommended to many others and they love it too.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that ranges from waves to corkscrews and I was looking for a sulfate-free shampoo with a nice fragrance. This shampoo made my hair dry and brittle. It also dried and irritated my scalp, causing it to turn red. Ten days later, my hair is getting back to normal, but my scalp is still irritated.</li>
            <li> I ordered this shampoo after having many problems with an itchy scalp. Not knowing which ingredient/ingredients were causing the problem, I decided to try this shampoo in the unscented version. I love it! I have had oily hair my whole life; if I didn&#x27;t wash it every day it was visibly dirty and greasy looking. After using this shampoo for a few days, I noticed my hair wasn&#x27;t getting as dirty as fast. After several weeks, my hair is still clean after several days. It is also must softer and shinier! My hair is of medium thickness and curly. This shampoo has made my curls much more manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can see, I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product. I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I normally buy (and love) the Paradise Island baby shampoo for my kids and decided to give this a try. It&#x27;s great and leaves my hair smelling awesome. My only complaint is that I wish they also made a conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying all kinds of natural and low or no irritant products for my hair and skin that is super sensitive. This is the first shampoo that I purchased a second time. Good lather and moisturizing whule not irritating my head. My only complaint is the cost, but I&#x27;ll pay it to get the results.</li>
            <li> Exactly what i was looking for. I can feel good about not poisoning myself using this organic product AND it sudses nicely, has a lovely scent, and leaves my hair feeling great.</li>
            <li> I needed to switch to a sulfate-free and fragrance-free shampoo due to skin irritation (itchy skin after showering) and had tried some natural shampoos but was disappointed. I had just assumed that you had to sacrifice good hair for the removal of chemicals and fragrances.  I saw all the positive reviews for this shampoo so took a risk one more time.  I&#x27;ve used it a few times in the past week and have been really surprised at how well it works.  I have super, super thick hair with lots of fly-always and I have NEVER been able to use a shampoo without also using a conditioner. The first couple of times I used it, I also used the &#x27;SexyHair&#x27; leave-in conditioner (also sulfate-free) afterwards because I assumed I needed it.  I noticed that my hair was really nice and smooth even without the conditioner, though, so I did an experiment today. I just used the Paradise Island shampoo alone with NO additional hair products.  I blow-dried and styled my hair like normal and was amazed that it is actually smoother and more natural - but with the same amount of control - as I would normally get with conditioner, moose, and hairspray.  I should also note that this is in the middle of winter and I&#x27;m in Canada where inside air this time of year is really dry so &#x27;good hair days&#x27; are rare.  It&#x27;s actually kinda bizarre and makes me wonder what wonderful things are in this product and why no one else in the hair industry can seem to figure this out.  Anyway, I&#x27;m in love with this product now and I&#x27;ll be stocking up!</li>
            <li> During a search for a healthy, safe and natural alternative to store bought shampoo, we took a chance and ordered Paradise Island Shampoo in coconut scent. It is very silky, with a great lather and exotic, fresh scent. It was enjoyed so much that we have since placed an order for two more coconut and two of the tropical scent. The shampoo lasts quite awhile, even between two people using it, so we imagine the other four bottles will last us until June or July at least.&lt;br /&gt;On a note, we use a vinegar rinse twice a week to refresh hair, along side using this shampoo. I can wash one day and then skip the next at the most with this shampoo. Hoping that prolonged use of a natural shampoo will regulate my oil production on the scalp, back to how it used to be in youth, which was nothing like it is now.&lt;br /&gt;A+ product that we are very happy with.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a shampoo with no perfume, no sulfates and no parabens.  This shampoo leaves my hair feeling clean and does not bother me allergy-wise.</li>
            <li> A few years ago my scalp became very sensitive to shampoo.  I tried many fine products that were free of sulfate and parabens but my scalp would still break out in a very sore rash.  Then I tried this.  WOW!  Eureka, I found it!  This shampoo is simply lovely.  Without getting out my thesaurus I&#x27;ll say, this shampoo thoroughly cleans my hair leaving it shiny and silky.  Yes, I have silky hair, and a happy scalp.  And I don&#x27;t have to use a conditioner.  Paradise found.</li>
            <li> I really love this shampoo. I think I&#x27;ve tried every shampoo on the planet and this is really great stuff! My hair is very dry and I color it because of the grey, normally I need conditioner and sometimes I even use leave in conditioner spray- I didn&#x27;t use conditioner with this shampoo at all and my hair felt and looked great. It&#x27;s not greasy or heavy, I&#x27;m sure it would be good for most hair types. I got the fragrance free type and it does have a smell but it&#x27;s very pleasant and clean- the smell does not stay in your hair though. I&#x27;m going to purchase another right now!</li>
            <li> April 20, 2015 - I&#x27;m still using this shampoo and still love it.    When I emailed owner with question, she immediately responded and offered a sample which i received.  I have fine, straight, long hair and scalp often itchy.  She recommended the unscented.  I&#x27;ve now used it twice; four days apart.  Unbelievable.  I did not need conditioner, detangling spray or anything else to comb out my wet hair.  Yes, I&#x27;ve tried an enormous variety of shampoos for my hair that begins to look greasy two days after shampooing.  However, if i shampoo every day, hair is dry mess.  My old favorite was L&#x27;Occtaine for Shiny Hair but that was discontinued and then even the tiny bottles were impossible to find so the expensive search again was on.  No more.  I would like one of the lovely-sounding scents but will continue to use the recommended unscented.  Will definitely buy again and as another reviewer said, am looking forward to the conditioner to see how that works.  BTW, the itchiness is almost gone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to the perfume in shampoos and conditions. Paradise Island Shampoo Fragrance Free is perfect for me. It leaves my hair shiny and soft and very manageable. I love the lather.</li>
            <li> lathers up great but makes my head break out like crazy :(</li>
            <li> I was using the Paradise Island baby shampoo and i loved it. When i ran out i bought this because it said it was the same formula. It just can&#x27;t be because my hair since using this bottle has just not been the same. Like it&#x27;s leaving some residue on my hair, and leaving it looking dull and unclean. Will not be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> This is the best paraben free, sulfate free, and pthalate free shampoo that I&#x27;ve tried. It lathers well and makes me feel good knowing I&#x27;m not putting harmful chemicals on my sensitive skin and scalp. It leaves my hair clean, soft &amp; shiny.  We use the baby shampoo as well and the coconut smells wonderful!</li>
