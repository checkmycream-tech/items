            <li>really cheap and amazing color!!</li>
            <li>I am very fair skinned and was looking for a light bronzer for the spring/summer.</li>
            <li>A bit warm to use for contour for my taste but good product.</li>
            <li>My favorite make up brand!</li>
            <li>So I bought it, and love it!</li>
            <li>I am very fair, and I watched YouTube reviews on it and learned that it was not only good for fair girls, but that it was great for beginners in bronzing or makeup all together.</li>
            <li>but the price was amazing</li>
            <li>The pigmentation is amazing, though.</li>
            <li>Nice Bronzer.</li>
            <li>and I have found this to be a nice one.  </li>
            <li>Nice price also.</li>
            <li>I think a brush would be better or get a good makeup sponge if you wish.</li>
            <li>I have read so many good reviews on this bronzer</li>
            <li>Sunny is affordable and will look nice on my skin tone</li>
            <li>, this just gives a nice sun kissed look.</li>
            <li>Sunny is affordable and will look nice on any skin tone.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just that this is a bronzer, to warm up your skin, rather than a contour shade.</li>
            <li>And a nice color.</li>
            <li>Nice price point too.</li>
            <li>I would call my skin tone neutral to slightly warm.  </li>
            <li>Nice color.  </li>
            <li>Love , cheap but great product</li>
            <li>Good pigment and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It leaves a perfect bronze color, like a very natural sun kiss.</li>
            <li>i love the way the color looks its perfect and it lasts a very long time it a good bronzee i love it</li>
            <li>This product is very cheap looking.  </li>
            <li>Probably one of my favorite bronzers.</li>
            <li>I love this bronzer.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s what I love about it</li>
            <li>This bronzer is great works good with my skin tone and last me all day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d give it a C+ or B- definitely not terrible.</li>
            <li>(Shout out to Emily Noel from Beauty Broadcast - love her!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>use it mostly so that I don&#x27;t get that washed out,</li>
            <li>love it , hope to deal with you again</li>
            <li>Not shimmery which i love and stays on all day.</li>
            <li>I am enjoying to contour my face.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li>i love this bronzer</li>

            <li>it&#x27;s okay,</li>
            <li>A must have no sparkle love the matte finish.</li>
            <li>I do agree with people saying it would fit with any skin color!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok for the price.</li>
            <li>Definitely not the best quality, but gets the job done.</li>
            <li>Really nice tone and smooth application.</li>
            <li>and while I am fair with freckles, my skin hue is really more beige than actual fair.  </li>
            <li>Came quickly and nice</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a nice, normal pressed powder formula, no smell, goes on nicely and is super affordable!</li>
            <li>This is my daughter&#x27;s review: \\&quot;such a good bronzer!</li>
            <li>very blend able, very natural looking, and a very good buy.</li>
            <li>I love the color ,easy to apply ,not shiny ,i use it everyday instead of blush in the day , its perfect !</li>
            <li>The shipping and Packaging was good, and the product was new and not used</li>
            <li>it gives me a nice summer glow when i apply with a large brush.</li>
            <li>so i decided to try it since it was so cheap.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s too cheap.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice bronzer to start off with, but it does have a bit of an orange hue, which can look very unflattering at times.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t go on orange at all its like a good natural bronze &amp; it&#x27;s also matte</li>
            <li>/&gt;-This has a nice color that isn&#x27;t too dark or orangey on my fair skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using it on my full face, and have relatively light skin.  </li>
            <li>monochromatic look from using only foundation on my face and to give my skin a nice \\&quot;sunny\\&quot;, healthy glow.</li>
            <li>Great bronzer for my pale skin :)</li>
            <li>Before purchasing this bronzer, I was looking for something that I could wear on a daily basis that would give some warmth to my fair skin.</li>
            <li>Yeah, nyc came up with a nice natural looking bronzer.</li>
            <li>It is just enough bronzing coverage for my fair skin color.  </li>
            <li>A good color that you can use a little or more depending on the time of year.  </li>
            <li>Besides that, I would really recommend this to anyone starting out in makeup who wants a cheap, great quality, affordable bronzer.</li>
            <li>Such a great product, the color is comparable to some high end brands on the market.</li>
            <li>my first ever bronzer!</li>
            <li>looks natural and matte, 2 favorite things</li>
            <li>but it is worth it.</li>
            <li>I think it looks much more natural that way.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using to add color and some contouring, love it so far.</li>
            <li>My skin complexion is darker and I had to mix another product with it to make it just right.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s just the right amount of color.  </li>
            <li>This is great to wear everyday or even when I&#x27;m just around the house/running errands, but don&#x27;t want to look like death and need a lil color!  </li>
            <li>really like it!</li>
            <li>It is pretty pigmented, so it could probably work with tan skin and</li>
            <li>The color is really pretty when it goes on although with in an hour of wearing it</li>
            <li>, it becomes very blotchy and does not look smoooth at all!</li>
            <li>This product is exactly what it says:  BRONZER&lt;</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used bronzer at all.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, my mom asked how my face got such a healthy glow.  </li>
            <li>This powder is great because it has just enough color to give a touch of sun without being overwhelmingly dark or orange.</li>
            <li>Just check out your makeup in natural light and blend a little more if you need to.</li>
            <li>Will still use but very sporadically.</li>
            <li>I have light to medium Asian skin.</li>
            <li>heard so much about it</li>
            <li>and there&#x27;s really nothing I&#x27;d change about it.</li>
            <li>think with enough blending, anyone with light skin could pull this off.</li>
            <li>I really like this bronzer.  </li>
            <li>Very well pressed.</li>
            <li>I really like this bronzer.</li>
            <li>, it did not blend very well with the included applicator sponge.  </li>
            <li>this product is really affordable.</li>
            <li>Fab item fast shipping ty</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t like it that much</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>It comes with a mirror and a flat, spongey applicator, which works fine.</li>
            <li>I have usually been weary of the bargain brand bronzers because I find that they can be kind of blotchy and inconsistent, but this one is quite the exception.</li>
            <li>This might seem like a minor thing, but I tend to apply blush and bronzer outside, so I really appreciate the built-in mirror. :)</li>
            <li>I heard a ton of youtubers rave about this stuff, even youtubers who use high end beauty products as well.</li>
            <li>so I am sure it will last me a long time.  </li>
            <li>It is a little darker than I would like but seems ok so far.</li>
            <li>It is nice and dark but it has a little red tint to it that I don&#x27;t enjoy.</li>
            <li>I use it to contour my face and it looks very natural.</li>
            <li>Very pigmented only need a little to do the job I love it</li>
            <li>NYC usually has better deals than this</li>
            <li>product is all right to use, but the color is a little more reddish than I expected.  </li>
            <li>Well if you are looking for a bronzer that can define your facial structure really well, this is not the product you may look for, but it&#x27;s a light contour which helps to build the shade if you dont like it too dark</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a light-skinned African-American and this Bronzer does ok giving me that little bit of extra shine.</li>
            <li>I still like this though, since it&#x27;s the only real bronzing powder I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t have shimmer or glitter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t show up much and I have to apply it several times and it looks orange.</li>
            <li>Not terrible, not amazing.</li>
            <li>I like it &amp;#34;almost&amp;#34; as much as my bare minerals</li>
            <li>This way if I don&#x27;t come home with it, I&#x27;m not having sticker shock because it was my bare minerals.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s tried some brands and said they don&#x27;t blend in well enough or look natural.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty pale and use this to bronze and contour.</li>
            <li>Finally a decent priced bronzer that doesn&#x27;t turn orange and isn&#x27;t loaded down with shimmer</li>
            <li>so it cost a little more but at least i&#x27;m not having to run all over town to find nothing.</li>

            <li> The shipping and Packaging was good, and the product was new and not used</li>
            <li> it gives me a nice summer glow when i apply with a large brush.</li>
            <li> so i decided to try it since it was so cheap.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too cheap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice bronzer to start off with, but it does have a bit of an orange hue, which can look very unflattering at times.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t go on orange at all its like a good natural bronze &amp; it&#x27;s also matte</li>
            <li> /&gt;-This has a nice color that isn&#x27;t too dark or orangey on my fair skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it on my full face, and have relatively light skin.  </li>
            <li> monochromatic look from using only foundation on my face and to give my skin a nice \\&quot;sunny\\&quot;, healthy glow.</li>
            <li> Great bronzer for my pale skin :)</li>
            <li> Before purchasing this bronzer, I was looking for something that I could wear on a daily basis that would give some warmth to my fair skin.</li>
            <li> Yeah, nyc came up with a nice natural looking bronzer.</li>
            <li> It is just enough bronzing coverage for my fair skin color.  </li>
            <li> A good color that you can use a little or more depending on the time of year.  </li>
            <li> Besides that, I would really recommend this to anyone starting out in makeup who wants a cheap, great quality, affordable bronzer.</li>
            <li> Such a great product, the color is comparable to some high end brands on the market.</li>
            <li> my first ever bronzer!</li>
            <li> looks natural and matte, 2 favorite things</li>
            <li> but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> I think it looks much more natural that way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using to add color and some contouring, love it so far.</li>
            <li> My skin complexion is darker and I had to mix another product with it to make it just right.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just the right amount of color.  </li>
            <li> This is great to wear everyday or even when I&#x27;m just around the house/running errands, but don&#x27;t want to look like death and need a lil color!  </li>
            <li> really like it!</li>
            <li> It is pretty pigmented, so it could probably work with tan skin and</li>
            <li> The color is really pretty when it goes on although with in an hour of wearing it</li>
            <li> , it becomes very blotchy and does not look smoooth at all!</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what it says:  BRONZER&lt;</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used bronzer at all.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, my mom asked how my face got such a healthy glow.  </li>
            <li> This powder is great because it has just enough color to give a touch of sun without being overwhelmingly dark or orange.</li>
            <li> Just check out your makeup in natural light and blend a little more if you need to.</li>
            <li> Will still use but very sporadically.</li>
            <li> I have light to medium Asian skin.</li>
            <li> heard so much about it</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s really nothing I&#x27;d change about it.</li>
            <li> think with enough blending, anyone with light skin could pull this off.</li>
            <li> I really like this bronzer.  </li>
            <li> Very well pressed.</li>
            <li> I really like this bronzer.</li>
            <li> , it did not blend very well with the included applicator sponge.  </li>
            <li> this product is really affordable.</li>
            <li> Fab item fast shipping ty</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t like it that much</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> It comes with a mirror and a flat, spongey applicator, which works fine.</li>
            <li> I have usually been weary of the bargain brand bronzers because I find that they can be kind of blotchy and inconsistent, but this one is quite the exception.</li>
            <li> This might seem like a minor thing, but I tend to apply blush and bronzer outside, so I really appreciate the built-in mirror. :)</li>
            <li> I heard a ton of youtubers rave about this stuff, even youtubers who use high end beauty products as well.</li>
            <li> so I am sure it will last me a long time.  </li>
            <li> It is a little darker than I would like but seems ok so far.</li>
            <li> It is nice and dark but it has a little red tint to it that I don&#x27;t enjoy.</li>
            <li> I use it to contour my face and it looks very natural.</li>
            <li> Very pigmented only need a little to do the job I love it</li>
            <li> NYC usually has better deals than this</li>
            <li> product is all right to use, but the color is a little more reddish than I expected.  </li>
            <li> Well if you are looking for a bronzer that can define your facial structure really well, this is not the product you may look for, but it&#x27;s a light contour which helps to build the shade if you dont like it too dark</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a light-skinned African-American and this Bronzer does ok giving me that little bit of extra shine.</li>
            <li> I still like this though, since it&#x27;s the only real bronzing powder I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t have shimmer or glitter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t show up much and I have to apply it several times and it looks orange.</li>
            <li> Not terrible, not amazing.</li>
            <li> I like it &amp;#34;almost&amp;#34; as much as my bare minerals</li>
            <li> This way if I don&#x27;t come home with it, I&#x27;m not having sticker shock because it was my bare minerals.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s tried some brands and said they don&#x27;t blend in well enough or look natural.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty pale and use this to bronze and contour.</li>
            <li> Finally a decent priced bronzer that doesn&#x27;t turn orange and isn&#x27;t loaded down with shimmer</li>
            <li> so it cost a little more but at least i&#x27;m not having to run all over town to find nothing.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and you can certainly build it up.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way, on my skin it seems very orange had to bled it in a lot.</li>
            <li> this product will last me a long time b/c a lil goes a long way, but it is not orange like some bronzers can be.</li>
            <li> I use it for cheeks and anywhere I want to add a little soft color.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-It is wearable on an everyday basis, but it can also be built up for a more dramatic, contoured look if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re going</li>
            <li> I use it on an everyday basis and it looks natural.</li>
            <li> No shimmer or sparkle, completely matte, and not easily over-done.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li> on all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;-It can leave harsh lines if you don&#x27;t blend it out well, but it&#x27;s not such a problem that I would take away a star.</li>
            <li> I had to order it because every time I went to buy it, the sunny bronzer spot was empty.</li>
            <li> Difficult to blend but pretty color for already tan people.</li>
            <li> I like the color, the texture and the fact that I don&#x27;t lose a lot down the drain when I put it on.  </li>
            <li> and it cost a lot less.  </li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;sponge&amp;#34;, which some are calling it, is NOT a true sponge.</li>
            <li> and it does not fit all skin.</li>
            <li> I have fairly pale skin and blending this stuff is a nightmare</li>
            <li> but unfortunately the bronzer has no pigmentation what so ever..have to really keep building it until the face looks muddy but not good at a swipe for contouring at all.&lt;br /&gt;Had</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m lazy or in a bind, I&#x27;ll use this.</li>
            <li> Lasts all day with setting spray, not sure how well without it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 30&#x27;s and didn&#x27;t want anything with shimmer/ glitter.  </li>
            <li> but it ended up coming in a couple of days late.</li>
            <li> Not enough contour but leaves my face dirty.</li>
            <li> Omg obsessed with this bronzor , i use it like everyday</li>
            <li> The one that came with thgis is too thin and too &amp;#34;stiff&amp;#34; to apply the power evenly.  </li>
            <li> but unfortunately its not good at all.</li>
            <li> I never used to wear if because I was afraid it would make me look orange.</li>
            <li> &amp; it&#x27;s almost done :(</li>
            <li> I hate orange</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> A bit warm to use for contour for my taste but good product. Good pigment and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I love this!! I am fair skin and it doesn&#x27;t make me look orange it gives me a nice summer glow when i apply with a large brush. Probably one of my favorite bronzers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this bronzer. It has a beautiful color and it blends nicely. I do use a makeup brush to apply it. I did not like the applicator that it comes with.</li>
            <li> Difficult to blend but pretty color for already tan people. I have fairly pale skin and blending this stuff is a nightmare</li>
            <li> I love this bronzer. It leaves a perfect bronze color, like a very natural sun kiss.</li>
            <li> I loveeeeee this product, ever since I got it I haven&#x27;t stopped using it &amp; it&#x27;s almost done :( but it doesn&#x27;t go on orange at all its like a good natural bronze &amp; it&#x27;s also matte that&#x27;s what I love about it</li>
            <li> This is my daughter&#x27;s review: \\&quot;such a good bronzer! really cheap and amazing color!! such a steal\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Omg obsessed with this bronzor , i use it like everyday</li>
            <li> This bronzer is great works good with my skin tone and last me all day. I recommend it for everyone. Plus the price is good as well</li>
            <li> Awesome and great shipping</li>
            <li> This is a great matte bronzer.  I have fair skin with freckles, brown hair &amp; eyes.  I&#x27;m in my late 30&#x27;s and didn&#x27;t want anything with shimmer/ glitter.  This is great to wear everyday or even when I&#x27;m just around the house/running errands, but don&#x27;t want to look like death and need a lil color!  I have a feeling this product will last me a long time b/c a lil goes a long way, but it is not orange like some bronzers can be.</li>
            <li> Nice Bronzer. Fairly Priced. Just a tad bit too orangy for my liking. Will still use but very sporadically.</li>
            <li> I use bronzer all year around and I have found this to be a nice one.  I have dry skin and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  A good color that you can use a little or more depending on the time of year.  I prefer this powder to those bronzing lotions for the face that seem to break me out. Nice price also.</li>
            <li> It is a little darker than I would like but seems ok so far. The &amp;#34;sponge&amp;#34;, which some are calling it, is NOT a true sponge. The one that came with thgis is too thin and too &amp;#34;stiff&amp;#34; to apply the power evenly.  It seems to me that it is a protective item to keep the pressed power from cracking during shipping. I think a brush would be better or get a good makeup sponge if you wish. I will be using a brush that came with another bronzer I had.</li>
            <li> Came quickly and nice</li>
            <li> Too orange for me....</li>
            <li> This is just sooooo awesomely awesome!</li>
            <li> Perfect color  and good product!</li>
            <li> I bought this product a while back and have been using it every day ever since. I heard a ton of youtubers rave about this stuff, even youtubers who use high end beauty products as well. So I decided to give it a try and as I said, very very happy with the product itself. The only downside was the fact that it was supposed to be garunteed two day shipping but it ended up coming in a couple of days late. Besides that, I would really recommend this to anyone starting out in makeup who wants a cheap, great quality, affordable bronzer.</li>
            <li> Not terrible, not amazing. I have light to medium Asian skin. It is nice and dark but it has a little red tint to it that I don&#x27;t enjoy. But, I still use it on occasion. I&#x27;d give it a C+ or B- definitely not terrible. I prefer a bronzer that is strictly brown/tan and then putting blush on the apples of my cheeks. If I&#x27;m lazy or in a bind, I&#x27;ll use this.</li>
            <li> The shipping and Packaging was good, and the product was new and not used but unfortunately the bronzer has no pigmentation what so ever..have to really keep building it until the face looks muddy but not good at a swipe for contouring at all.&lt;br /&gt;Had heard so much about it but unfortunately its not good at all.</li>
            <li> After seeing this product being recommended on various beauty blogs and by different people in Youtube videos, I finally decided to acquire it - my first ever bronzer! (Shout out to Emily Noel from Beauty Broadcast - love her!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like it! It&#x27;s got a nice, normal pressed powder formula, no smell, goes on nicely and is super affordable! I think this shade works well with a variety of skin tones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it mostly so that I don&#x27;t get that washed out, monochromatic look from using only foundation on my face and to give my skin a nice \\&quot;sunny\\&quot;, healthy glow. It&#x27;s also a really good product for contouring!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is NOT a shimmery powder, which is a big plus for me. It comes with a mirror and a flat, spongey applicator, which works fine. However, my personal preference is to apply it using a bronzer brush or a foundation brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s everything that I hoped for and there&#x27;s really nothing I&#x27;d change about it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not the biggest fan of bronzer, but when I do wear it, this does the trick for me.</li>
            <li> looks natural and matte, 2 favorite things</li>
            <li> I like the color, the texture and the fact that I don&#x27;t lose a lot down the drain when I put it on.  I like it &amp;#34;almost&amp;#34; as much as my bare minerals and it cost a lot less.  I use it for my travel bag.  This way if I don&#x27;t come home with it, I&#x27;m not having sticker shock because it was my bare minerals.</li>
            <li> It completes my look! I don&#x27;t go out without this! It&#x27;s very beautiful. Makes me feel beautiful.</li>
            <li> Before purchasing this bronzer, I was looking for something that I could wear on a daily basis that would give some warmth to my fair skin. This product is raved about on Pinterest and Youtube, so I thought I would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;-This has a nice color that isn&#x27;t too dark or orangey on my fair skin.&lt;br /&gt;-It is wearable on an everyday basis, but it can also be built up for a more dramatic, contoured look if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re going for.&lt;br /&gt;-It has a mirror inside! This might seem like a minor thing, but I tend to apply blush and bronzer outside, so I really appreciate the built-in mirror. :)&lt;br /&gt;-Stays on all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;-It can leave harsh lines if you don&#x27;t blend it out well, but it&#x27;s not such a problem that I would take away a star. Just check out your makeup in natural light and blend a little more if you need to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty pale and use this to bronze and contour. I do have to blend really well to keep it from looking too harsh though. If I don&#x27;t blend well enough, I do look a bit orange. I still like this though, since it&#x27;s the only real bronzing powder I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t have shimmer or glitter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think with enough blending, anyone with light skin could pull this off. It is pretty pigmented, so it could probably work with tan skin and maybe darker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re like me, and searching for looking for a bronzer that doesn&#x27;t cost $50 bucks and doesn&#x27;t have any sparkles in it, I say go for this one until you find your HG.</li>
            <li> I love the color ,easy to apply ,not shiny ,i use it everyday instead of blush in the day , its perfect !</li>
            <li> It comes with a sponge but I you will find it is easier to apply contour with a brush</li>
            <li> I have read so many good reviews on this bronzer so i decided to try it since it was so cheap. This product is very cheap looking.  The color is really pretty when it goes on although with in an hour of wearing it, it becomes very blotchy and does not look smoooth at all! I have tried it for four days now and nothing has changed. I will not continue using this product. I should have known you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what it says:  BRONZER&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is all right to use, but the color is a little more reddish than I expected.  My skin complexion is darker and I had to mix another product with it to make it just right.</li>
            <li> love it , hope to deal with you again</li>
            <li> I really like this bronzer.  It applies easily and it is a very good color.  I use it for cheeks and anywhere I want to add a little soft color.  Would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Such a great product, the color is comparable to some high end brands on the market. It has no shimmer which is great since shimmer bronzers don&#x27;t work well for contours. I use it on an everyday basis and it looks natural.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best bronzers I&#x27;ve used. The only thing i don&#x27;t like about it is the price. NYC usually has better deals than this but it is worth it. It works as good as any name brand bronzer. Not shimmery which i love and stays on all day. Its an amazing product!</li>
            <li> Very well pressed. I am enjoying to contour my face.</li>
            <li> Sunny is affordable and will look nice on my skin tone i love the way the color looks its perfect and it lasts a very long time it a good bronzee i love it</li>
            <li> its safe to say that this is the best bronzer I&#x27;ve ever used. it is the perfect color for almost all skin types, because of its pigment and build ability. very blend able, very natural looking, and a very good buy.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat this bronzer for the price. I like it because it is matte, no sparkle!!!! I think it looks much more natural that way. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this bronzer!! It&#x27;s matte and the color is not too orange and not too brown, its just in between. I use it to contour my face and it looks very natural. Plus, the price is unbeatable!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT THIS WAS A RE PURCHASE (:</li>
            <li> Finally a decent priced bronzer that doesn&#x27;t turn orange and isn&#x27;t loaded down with shimmer, this just gives a nice sun kissed look. I had to order it because every time I went to buy it, the sunny bronzer spot was empty. so it cost a little more but at least i&#x27;m not having to run all over town to find nothing.</li>
            <li> My favorite make up brand! Best bronzer ever!</li>
            <li> Awesome inexpensive bronzer to use for contouring!</li>
            <li> I really like this bronzer. I never used to wear if because I was afraid it would make me look orange. I was terrified of bronzer a before. I am very fair, and I watched YouTube reviews on it and learned that it was not only good for fair girls, but that it was great for beginners in bronzing or makeup all together. So I bought it, and love it! It&#x27;s the perfect color. No shimmer or sparkle, completely matte, and not easily over-done. It&#x27;s not too orangey and doesn&#x27;t make me look muddy or rusty. I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> i love this bronzer but if you wear foundation with it it can make you look orange but the price was amazing i would recommend this bronzer</li>
            <li> I use this for contour.  It is matte and works well if it&#x27;s not over applied.  Great product for the price!</li>
            <li> Yeah, nyc came up with a nice natural looking bronzer. Sunny is affordable and will look nice on any skin tone.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way, on my skin it seems very orange had to bled it in a lot.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use this product specifically for contouring because there is a lot of orange pigment in it. The pigmentation is amazing, though. It&#x27;s just that this is a bronzer, to warm up your skin, rather than a contour shade. A little goes a long way, and you can certainly build it up. I use this just below my cheekbones, in the hollows of my cheeks, on my jawline, and temples.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using to add color and some contouring, love it so far.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used bronzer at all.  I&#x27;m using it on my full face, and have relatively light skin.  Anyway, my mom asked how my face got such a healthy glow.  I told her I bought bronzer and she was amazed.  She&#x27;s tried some brands and said they don&#x27;t blend in well enough or look natural.  I gave her the name of this so she could buy some herself.  I do have one thing to say though, it did not blend very well with the included applicator sponge.  So I tried a foundation blush and got it blended perfectly!</li>
            <li> Matte! And a nice color.</li>
            <li> An excellent bronzer because it covers well and NO SPARKLES</li>
            <li> Great product awesome for contouring and using as a blush bronzer as well. Matte finish with zero shimmer. Nice price point too.</li>
            <li> I am very fair skinned and was looking for a light bronzer for the spring/summer. This powder is great because it has just enough color to give a touch of sun without being overwhelmingly dark or orange.</li>
            <li> this product is really affordable. Truth speaking it&#x27;s too cheap. It doesn&#x27;t show up much and I have to apply it several times and it looks orange. Not enough contour but leaves my face dirty.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice bronzer to start off with, but it does have a bit of an orange hue, which can look very unflattering at times.</li>
            <li> Fab item fast shipping ty</li>
            <li> This bronzer is so awesome !!! I will buy more</li>
            <li> Lasts all day with setting spray, not sure how well without it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay, don&#x27;t like it that much and it does not fit all skin. i have fair skin, makes me looking a bit &amp;#34;orangie&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This is a really great bronzer for the price! It goes on well and is not an orange color that you may experience from some bronzing products.</li>
            <li> Love , cheap but great product and it&#x27;s just the right amount of color.  A must have no sparkle love the matte finish.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It goes on well.  it comes with a sponge, but I use a brush to apply.  It is just enough bronzing coverage for my fair skin color.  I like the shade, it works perfectly for me.  I only use this 4 out of the 7 days a week approx. so I am sure it will last me a long time.  Very nice product.</li>
            <li> This gets touted as the go to bronzer for lots on you tube, ect.  Dang its just orange on me and while I am fair with freckles, my skin hue is really more beige than actual fair.  I would call my skin tone neutral to slightly warm.  I hate orange and this just doesn&#x27;t work well on me.</li>
            <li> Great bronzer for my pale skin :)</li>
            <li> For the price, this is just amazing! I do agree with people saying it would fit with any skin color!</li>
            <li> Very pigmented only need a little to do the job I love it</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because it was recommended by a Hollywood make up artist.  I prefer to use it as a rouge.  Nice color.  You don&#x27;t need to spend a lot of money to look good!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok for the price. Definitely not the best quality, but gets the job done. I&#x27;m a light-skinned African-American and this Bronzer does ok giving me that little bit of extra shine.</li>
            <li> Really nice tone and smooth application. I have usually been weary of the bargain brand bronzers because I find that they can be kind of blotchy and inconsistent, but this one is quite the exception.</li>
            <li> Best bronzer I have encountered.</li>
            <li> Well if you are looking for a bronzer that can define your facial structure really well, this is not the product you may look for, but it&#x27;s a light contour which helps to build the shade if you dont like it too dark</li>
