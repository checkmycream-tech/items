            <li>My boys love these toothbrushes (Mario and Princess peach) and its a good incentive to get them to brush their teeth easier.</li>
            <li>and it works better</li>
            <li>I wish they sold these in stores and had more charactors.</li>
            <li>Getting your kids to brush their teeth can always be an interesting endeavor but the Spinbrush helps motivate our children to brush their teeth.  </li>
            <li>Most people that buy Super Mario toothbrushes are wanting Mario, not Princess  Peach.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t always work but compared to not having these bedtime routine was a huge pain.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy for a toddler to use and it did meet my expectations</li>
            <li>This toothbrush doesn&#x27;t seem to clean that well.</li>
            <li>not a bad price for a Nintendo product but don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy them again</li>

            <li>i love the fact that it spins and not just move up and down.</li>
            <li>making me feel a little better about his brushing.</li>
            <li>but the third brush is pretty much unacceptable.</li>
            <li>my 4 year old son and me.</li>
            <li>But since he is still very young, he didn&#x27;t find anything wrong with the princess designs, but still, it bothered me that more people seem to be getting the unpictured design instead of the pictured one.</li>

            <li> then i expected it to for a kids tooth brush.</li>
            <li> We expected a Mario toothbrush.</li>

            <li> Disappointed that you are not able to select the character.  </li>
            <li> Somewhat disappointed, perform the purchase by the brush mario and princess get one.</li>
            <li> my son didn&#x27;t want to use it at all! :(</li>

            <li> My son loves it !! It&#x27;s super easy for a toddler to use and it did meet my expectations</li>
            <li> Very cute.  My daughter loves the &amp;#34;jewel&amp;#34; to push it on and off.</li>
            <li> It stopped working after a week.</li>
            <li> my sons loves it. and it works better then i expected it to for a kids tooth brush. i love the fact that it spins and not just move up and down. making me feel a little better about his brushing.</li>
            <li> I wish they sold these in stores and had more charactors. My boys love these toothbrushes (Mario and Princess peach) and its a good incentive to get them to brush their teeth easier. The first one that goes to brush their teeth at bedtime gets to choose which to use. They both always choose Mario but it still helps a lot. I tell them that the Princess Peach will be saved when they use that one and they can be the hero just like Mario, he he! Doesn&#x27;t always work but compared to not having these bedtime routine was a huge pain.</li>
            <li> My son LOVES this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Still working well after a few months. My son loved this as a gift and I will replace it soon with the same brand. Good product for the price, no issues.</li>
            <li> Somewhat disappointed, perform the purchase by the brush mario and princess get one. So my son did not like</li>
            <li> This toothbrush doesn&#x27;t seem to clean that well. not a bad price for a Nintendo product but don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy them again, I think I&#x27;m going to just buy rechargeable toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d get better reviews if you let us choose!!! Most people that buy Super Mario toothbrushes are wanting Mario, not Princess  Peach. You&#x27;re doing your business a disservice by not letting your customers choose. My boys don&#x27;t want Princess Peach. Fail.</li>
            <li> I ordered this with every expectation that I would receive either three Mario brushes, or three Peaches, leading to the possible disappointment of one of my three kids (two boys, one girl, all with very strong opinions on Mario Kart and their characters). I took that risk on knowingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I did not expect to receive two Peach toohbrushes, and one... random, non spin brush. You press a button, and it &amp;#34;sings&amp;#34; the ABCs, rather poorly. Now, this would have been acceptable (albeit, not what I ordered) option for my youngest child, but... it&#x27;s not a spinbrush. It&#x27;s a regular ol&#x27; singing toothbrush. My kids were able to happily cope with two Peach toothbrushes (though, obviously, they&#x27;re both swapping brushes constantly, so I may rue letting them do this once school (*cough* germ) season starts, but the third brush is pretty much unacceptable.</li>
            <li> I order MarioBros tooth brush and I received Princess Peach tooth brush.</li>
            <li> I ordered a super mario spinbrush but instead I received princess peach&#x27;s. Very disappointed for both of us: my 4 year old son and me. Next time please allow customers to pick the desired character.</li>
            <li> I was also deceived by the advertising. I wished I had read the reviews first (which I normally do but skipped for this one).  I got the Princess character instead, and it was for my son!  It was so girly my son didn&#x27;t want to use it at all! :(</li>
            <li> Only disappointment for me was it arrived and was more for a girl (received the princess Mario one). Under assumption the one I ordered was Mario.</li>
            <li> Aw snap!  I ordered a &amp;#34;Super Mario&amp;#34; toothbrush, assuming Mario would be on it, like the default picture, and instead I got Princess Peach!  I will be returning it.</li>
            <li> I bought this tooth brush for my son being that it has Mario on the picture and I received the princess! Seriously guys!</li>
            <li> Another customer who got a Princess Peach toothbrush. I specifically ordered this design because it was for my son! But since he is still very young, he didn&#x27;t find anything wrong with the princess designs, but still, it bothered me that more people seem to be getting the unpictured design instead of the pictured one.</li>
            <li> My son likes that you can use the on button to spin while the button is depressed or slide the button so that it spins continuously. A great toothbrush!</li>
            <li> The advertising was misleading. We expected a Mario toothbrush. A princess brush from the game characters came instead. We reluctantly kept it.</li>
            <li> Great brush but when I ordered 2 mario for my boys I only got 1 mario and a princess peach which won&#x27;t work for my boys.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush.  Helps our six year old brush much better than he was doing alone.</li>
            <li> Ordered 2. They work great. Gave 3 stars due to I have two boys and one came as Mario but the second one was the princess.</li>
            <li> Not Super Mario. It is the princess from the game and it is pink. Yea, not the one pictured. Rip off.</li>
            <li> Sent Peach not Mario for boy - not good.  10 yr old special needs child wanted Marion....Peach is awful.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Getting your kids to brush their teeth can always be an interesting endeavor but the Spinbrush helps motivate our children to brush their teeth.  Nothing fancy about the product but it does the job and keeps the kids happy.</li>
            <li> Disappointed that you are not able to select the character.  We were hoping for Mario but received Peach.</li>
