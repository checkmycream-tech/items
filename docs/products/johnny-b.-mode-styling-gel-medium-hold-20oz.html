            <li>My favorite styling gel!</li>
            <li>very pleased with this hair gel, it doesn&#x27;t flake and is very easy to rinse out,</li>
            <li>it makes your hair very easy to comb in whatever style you wish without leaving your hair greasy.  </li>
            <li>My barber introduced it to me many years ago.</li>
            <li>Love this gel.</li>
            <li>I love the Johnny b gel</li>
            <li>very well leaves a great shine and is washable.</li>
            <li>This will be my go to hair gel until I find something better</li>
            <li>My sons love this gel,....</li>
            <li>My kids and I love using this product.</li>
            <li>so glad I could find it on amazon.  </li>
            <li>Gives a nice clean and semi shine to our hair, but most importantly, stays in place, even through theme park rides, haha.</li>
            <li>Received the item and it&#x27;s wasn&#x27;t filled all the way.</li>
            <li>Johnny b is super strong.</li>
            <li>I recommend this gel to anyone who wants to try something better that won&#x27;t turn white after a while and smells great.</li>
            <li>Holds strong and washes right out.</li>
            <li>I want to say about 60% full.</li>
            <li>It makes your hair stiff GREAT if you want it to stick up.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Exactly what my son wanted without too much goop...</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, a tiny bit is all I need to spike all my hair, no build up, no alcohol smell.</li>
            <li>me.&lt;br /&gt;It works pretty good on my thick wavy hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried dozens of different gels for the last 25 years, and this is hands down the best one.</li>
            <li>This is strong enough to deal with them but light enough that it doesn&#x27;t feel crunchy.</li>
            <li>My son has two very stubborn cowlicks in his hair.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve been wanting to grow my hair out for some time, but then it gets to that &amp;#34;uncontrollable&amp;#34; length, and i head straight to the stylist or barber and have it all cut off.</li>
            <li>If you use it on damp hair it gives your hair some shine and holds it very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>only thing is that it is a bit sweet smelling which some may like.</li>
            <li>Finally the real thing so read reviews because some of the suppliers have knock offs but not these guys</li>
            <li>Hair stays in place, but it is not hard like other gels.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Finally the real thing so read reviews because some of the suppliers have knock offs but not these guys</li>
            <li> This gel is probably the best gel in the world. I Will never go back to using anything else. The smell this gel puts out too is amazing! I recommend this gel to anyone who wants to try something better that won&#x27;t turn white after a while and smells great.</li>

            <li> i&#x27;ve been wanting to grow my hair out for some time, but then it gets to that &amp;#34;uncontrollable&amp;#34; length, and i head straight to the stylist or barber and have it all cut off. Well I got the urge to grow my hair out again, the last hair stylist recommended this gel to me.&lt;br /&gt;It works pretty good on my thick wavy hair. If you use it on damp hair it gives your hair some shine and holds it very well.&lt;br /&gt;If you use it on dry hair it works also but keeps the thick puffy attribute you might want still :D.&lt;br /&gt;Im very pleased with this hair gel, it doesn&#x27;t flake and is very easy to rinse out, probably don&#x27;t even need to shampoo it to get it all out. This will be my go to hair gel until I find something better</li>
            <li> My sons love this gel,....so i rate this with 5 stars!!!!</li>
            <li> My kids and I love using this product. Gives a nice clean and semi shine to our hair, but most importantly, stays in place, even through theme park rides, haha.</li>
            <li> No flakes makes my hair look and smell good. Excellent product!!</li>
            <li> My husband loves Johnny B Gel he&#x27;s been using it for years! It smells nice works great the only downside is this seller is way expensive. I will def by Johnny b gel again but from another seller.</li>
            <li> Holds all day, smells great.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. My husband &amp; son use it daily. Our salon quit selling it, so glad I could find it on amazon.  Hair stays in place, but it is not hard like other gels.</li>
            <li> Does its job, smells good, no flakes. My go to hair gel.</li>
