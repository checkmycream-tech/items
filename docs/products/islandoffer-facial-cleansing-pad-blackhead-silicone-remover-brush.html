            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>Its a very nice product.</li>
            <li>good result</li>
            <li>This product reminds me of why the good ol USA has oversight programs like the FDA.</li>
            <li>These things are amazing.  </li>
            <li>This product is so amazing.</li>
            <li>Really nice, I like it</li>
            <li>It kind of feels like a massage on your face.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a nice product.</li>
            <li>I liked the product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just not as good as others that are about 2 dollars more.</li>
            <li>I love this item and recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>but the item was still okay</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve started using it to apply my Vitamin C serum, and it&#x27;s not awful for that.</li>
            <li>but I really love using this when washing my face.</li>
            <li>and I would recommend it to anyone!:)</li>
            <li>It works ok, no problems with it.  </li>
            <li>I guess its ok</li>
            <li>but I would hold out for something better.</li>
            <li>Not a bad product to own</li>
            <li>BOTH ARE AWESOME, THIS ONE HAS THICKER BRISTLES WHICH KEEP ME FROM GETTING DRY SKIN OR TO CAUSE RASH.</li>
            <li>Great exfoliation with the most basic of cleaners.</li>
            <li>easy and fun to use...yet most important of all is does it work.</li>
            <li>Ok so This thing looks just like cheap rubber,but its a really good deep cleaner</li>
            <li>I do this morning and night and so far so good</li>
            <li>The main item works well and exfoliates nicely.</li>
            <li>Works as intended: really does exfoliate your t zone better than anything I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It was good enough for a gift to my mother.</li>
            <li>but there are ones at Sephora with much much softer and more pronounced bristles, and after feeling them compared to this one I knew I should&#x27;ve just bought from Sephora.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super gentle, and there&#x27;s isn&#x27;t anything to complain about, I love this product</li>
            <li>BUT it is gentle yet leaves your face quite smooth.</li>
            <li>eh, didn&#x27;t do a thing for what it was supposed to do, but i find it nice for cleaning make-up brushes oddly enough.</li>
            <li>The only thing this is nice for is traveling since it doesn&#x27;t absorb water.</li>
            <li>its a really nice and simple face scrubber</li>
            <li>My blackheads disappeared right after I used this cleansing pad.</li>
            <li>I feel like it really helps opening my pores and getting the soap in them and clean them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was also effective clearing away the dry flakes</li>
            <li>This is rougher on my face than I expected and it doesn&#x27;t really remove blackheads, it just kind of massages your face, which I guess is pretty cool.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It seems to work fine with natural soaps</li>
            <li>I PURCHASED 4 OF THESE ALONG WITH THE OTHER KIND SOLD HERE WITH AMAZON.</li>
            <li>It gives me a soft and clean feeling as well.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel like a scrubber, more like a vaguely textured surface that I can&#x27;t get a good grip on.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery didnt expect that just tried it first time</li>
            <li>very cheaply made in china and not really a scrubber in the first place</li>
            <li>I regret it so much.</li>
            <li>Very plasticky and rubbery.</li>
            <li>The packaging was cheap and torn apart and entirely in Chinese.</li>
            <li>When I got it, really had my doubts</li>
            <li>can really feel in the pores of the silicone rubber.</li>
            <li>I understand that as a beautician and skin young and healthy skin is the key to deep clean</li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and leaves it feeling soft, and it really gives me the deep clean without hurting my skin!</li>
            <li>and I do feel it deep clean my face.</li>
            <li>When I do, this one will become my back up because it&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li>In the past, I never felt my skin just my hands, beads detergent to clean my face, but still clean 100%.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE PRODUCT AND SELLER.</li>
            <li>I washed my face like I normally do, just with the aid of this</li>
            <li>This product not only lacks any redeeming values it is actually harmful to the health of those with sensitive skin and an auto immune disorder like myself!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The price was right, so if it doesn&#x27;t last, I&#x27;m not too worried.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been having issues with dry flaky skin and thought this might help me exfoliate more gently as I fear I am too rough otherwise.</li>
            <li>So I bought this as a light exfoliate to help me clean that area without irritating it.</li>
            <li>I was surpised by how well it works to clear my pores.  </li>
            <li>So naturally i thought I&#x27;d get the blue one, but really the color doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li>I will update this review after a while once I c clear result.</li>
            <li>If you have blackheads use natural products.</li>
            <li>I RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE WHO HAS SENSITIVE SKIN, OR PREFERS SOMETHING SOFTER.</li>
            <li>I use it with Equate sensitive skin acne wash.</li>
            <li>So far I like it.</li>
            <li>suggest this if you&#x27;re looking for something gentle to help you with your facial cleansing routine!</li>
            <li>After you use it, you can be ranked near the sink in the bathroom tiles.</li>
            <li>The scrubber barely does anything at all.</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s gentle on my skin</li>
            <li>This is so cheap, seriously.</li>
            <li>I used this on my face around my chin, at first I noticed all this dead skin peeling but as soon as I washed my face it started to burn.</li>
            <li>This things helps out a little bit for those who want to scrub without really scrubbing to the point of peeling/drying out skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and regular facial cleansers irritate my skin, as well as other exfoliating tools.</li>

            <li> but this is really cheap and useless stuff, dont even spend a penny for this.</li>
            <li> I did get a pink one when the image was blue.</li>
            <li> I ordered blue and received a pink one.</li>
            <li> Slow shipping and product is very flimsy</li>
            <li> The only negative I could find is that everything written on the packaging was in Chinese.</li>
            <li> It does seem to work well, I&#x27;m just not sure how long it will last.  </li>
            <li> I just received this thing, and it was not worth waiting for over month, the end of the item is damaged or was chewed by the animal, the finger holder is so small, that my small hands and short fingers hardly fit in them, poor quality product.</li>
            <li> This tool is neat but the extra little piece that comes with is fell down my drain.  </li>
            <li> THE OTHER ONE:</li>
            <li> I have also noticed that my nose started to exfoliate which is weird for the first time</li>
            <li> and I simply wet it and run it along the bar of soap a bit till it lathers and scrub my face for about a minute and a half in circles.</li>
            <li> For the small  round tiny piece-no comment.</li>
            <li> but after I used it it calmed down a lil bit</li>
            <li> It sad that this is better then other expensive iteams</li>
            <li> cheap quality, disappointed</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t absorb it, and it probably gets it a little deeper than just my fingertips.</li>
            <li> , I use it every day, feeling the soft skin and regions with a small brush and difficult to achieve.</li>
            <li> /&gt;By day three there were half dozen big angry looking (and feeling)</li>
            <li> The exfoliator is dull and seems like it is work down as if it has already been used.</li>
            <li> I have crazy sensitive skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s relatively small</li>
            <li> immediately broke out with a rash of small bumps on my nose and chin.</li>
            <li> of.&lt;br /&gt;All together it ended up being almost two weeks of looking like a monster and knowing how monsters must feel for most of their horrible lives.&lt;br /&gt;Please</li>
            <li> The only problem &#x27;and that the package&#x27; are very poor</li>
            <li> I constantly get dead skin cells around my noes that make my face look dirty and make my blackheads on my nose stand out.</li>
            <li> Little weird using but seems to do the trick.</li>
            <li> A rip off, waste of money, is a fake version of what you see in the picture.</li>
            <li> The packaging was just broken...</li>
            <li> This is a must have for everyone who suffers from blackheads.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money or risk your health with this craptastically awful product!</li>

            <li> It sad that this is better then other expensive iteams</li>
            <li> These things are amazing.  Great exfoliation with the most basic of cleaners.</li>
            <li> I was surpised by how well it works to clear my pores.  It was also effective clearing away the dry flakes I from using my acne cream.  The only negative I could find is that everything written on the packaging was in Chinese.</li>
            <li> I used this on my face around my chin, at first I noticed all this dead skin peeling but as soon as I washed my face it started to burn. It burned my face! I don&#x27;t recommend this. If you have blackheads use natural products. You will ruin your face. I regret it so much.</li>
            <li> Very plasticky and rubbery. I used it only in the morning to freshen up.</li>
            <li> This product actually made me break out. I washed my face like I normally do, just with the aid of this and it&#x27;s almost as though it clogged my pores.</li>
            <li> very cheaply made in china and not really a scrubber in the first place</li>
            <li> I have a feeling that it works. Tried it once, will try again.</li>
            <li> I like this product. It was good enough for a gift to my mother. She had assked for it. Well, I bought it for myself also</li>
            <li> The packaging was just broken... but the item was still okay</li>
            <li> My blackheads disappeared right after I used this cleansing pad. This is a must have for everyone who suffers from blackheads.</li>
            <li> easy and fun to use...yet most important of all is does it work. Yes, it does!</li>
            <li> I PURCHASED 4 OF THESE ALONG WITH THE OTHER KIND SOLD HERE WITH AMAZON. BOTH ARE AWESOME, THIS ONE HAS THICKER BRISTLES WHICH KEEP ME FROM GETTING DRY SKIN OR TO CAUSE RASH. THE OTHER ONE: BRISTLES ARE THINNER AND  SHORTER. BOTH WORK PERFECT. I RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE WHO HAS SENSITIVE SKIN, OR PREFERS SOMETHING SOFTER. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE PRODUCT AND SELLER.</li>
            <li> Really nice, I like it</li>
            <li> Slow shipping and product is very flimsy</li>
            <li> I just received this thing, and it was not worth waiting for over month, the end of the item is damaged or was chewed by the animal, the finger holder is so small, that my small hands and short fingers hardly fit in them, poor quality product. For the small  round tiny piece-no comment.</li>
            <li> Ok so This thing looks just like cheap rubber,but its a really good deep cleaner,I use it every day and have noticed a reduction in blemishes of all sorts.&lt;br /&gt;It seems to work fine with natural soaps and I simply wet it and run it along the bar of soap a bit till it lathers and scrub my face for about a minute and a half in circles.I do this morning and night and so far so good had this about a month now.</li>
            <li> Great product! I have crazy sensitive skin and I can use this without my face looking red afterwards! It gives me a soft and clean feeling as well. (: I use it with Equate sensitive skin acne wash.</li>
            <li> Does not do what I wanted it to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a bit now. Wanted to test the waters on this before I typed a review. So far I like it. It kind of feels like a massage on your face. It doesn&#x27;t scratch the skin either. I did get a pink one when the image was blue. So naturally i thought I&#x27;d get the blue one, but really the color doesn&#x27;t matter. It works for me and it&#x27;s a nice product.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery didnt expect that just tried it first time good result deep cleansing I have 2 itchy canes now but after I used it it calmed down a lil bit I have also noticed that my nose started to exfoliate which is weird for the first time I will update this review after a while once I c clear result.</li>
            <li> Not a bad product to own</li>
            <li> This is so cheap, seriously. The packaging was cheap and torn apart and entirely in Chinese. The scrubber barely does anything at all. It doesn&#x27;t feel like a scrubber, more like a vaguely textured surface that I can&#x27;t get a good grip on. I definitely should have gone for the Sephora one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say this though: I&#x27;ve started using it to apply my Vitamin C serum, and it&#x27;s not awful for that. It doesn&#x27;t absorb it, and it probably gets it a little deeper than just my fingertips.</li>
            <li> Product came on time, packaged well and is as described by the seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s relatively small and the bristles are nubby and short, but I really love using this when washing my face. I feel like it really helps opening my pores and getting the soap in them and clean them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest this if you&#x27;re looking for something gentle to help you with your facial cleansing routine!</li>
            <li> I ordered this based on recommendation from a skin care website.  I could not find anything like it locally.  When I got it, really had my doubts BUT it is gentle yet leaves your face quite smooth.</li>
            <li> eh, didn&#x27;t do a thing for what it was supposed to do, but i find it nice for cleaning make-up brushes oddly enough.</li>
            <li> This is a flimsy piece of silicone.  It does seem to work well, I&#x27;m just not sure how long it will last.  The price was right, so if it doesn&#x27;t last, I&#x27;m not too worried.</li>
            <li> A rip off, waste of money, is a fake version of what you see in the picture.</li>
            <li> In the past, I never felt my skin just my hands, beads detergent to clean my face, but still clean 100%.&lt;br /&gt;You can really feel in the pores of the silicone rubber. I understand that as a beautician and skin young and healthy skin is the key to deep clean, I use it every day, feeling the soft skin and regions with a small brush and difficult to achieve. After you use it, you can be ranked near the sink in the bathroom tiles.</li>
            <li> bought it thinking it would work &amp; turns out i just ended up throwing it in the trash... Does NOT work.</li>
            <li> This is rougher on my face than I expected and it doesn&#x27;t really remove blackheads, it just kind of massages your face, which I guess is pretty cool. I think I&#x27;ll stick with sponges though. The only thing this is nice for is traveling since it doesn&#x27;t absorb water.</li>
            <li> This product reminds me of why the good ol USA has oversight programs like the FDA. This product not only lacks any redeeming values it is actually harmful to the health of those with sensitive skin and an auto immune disorder like myself!&lt;br /&gt;I immediately broke out with a rash of small bumps on my nose and chin. This was followed the next morning by larger pimple type bumps in the same areas along with the rash on my forehead.&lt;br /&gt;By day three there were half dozen big angry looking (and feeling) white heads that I finally couldn&#x27;t keep my hands off of.&lt;br /&gt;All together it ended up being almost two weeks of looking like a monster and knowing how monsters must feel for most of their horrible lives.&lt;br /&gt;Please don&#x27;t waste your money or risk your health with this craptastically awful product!</li>
            <li> This product is so amazing. I have very sensitive skin, and regular facial cleansers irritate my skin, as well as other exfoliating tools. This product doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and leaves it feeling soft, and it really gives me the deep clean without hurting my skin! It&#x27;s super gentle, and there&#x27;s isn&#x27;t anything to complain about, I love this product and I would recommend it to anyone!:)</li>
            <li> I like it as a facial scrubber, I wish it were a wee big bigger. Other than that it&#x27;s gentle on my skin and I do feel it deep clean my face.</li>
            <li> its a really nice and simple face scrubber</li>
            <li> Its a very nice product. But the pacagen is so big. I liked the product. The only problem &#x27;and that the package&#x27; are very poor</li>
            <li> Do NOT buy this product. The package was not even in english and was already opened when I received it. The exfoliator is dull and seems like it is work down as if it has already been used.</li>
            <li> This tool is neat but the extra little piece that comes with is fell down my drain.  I should have just tossed it when I got it but I didn&#x27;t think it through.  The main item works well and exfoliates nicely.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no suction cup for the wall and the silicone bumps aren&#x27;t very big at all. I&#x27;d get a different silicone scrubber.</li>
            <li> This things helps out a little bit for those who want to scrub without really scrubbing to the point of peeling/drying out skin. I constantly get dead skin cells around my noes that make my face look dirty and make my blackheads on my nose stand out. So I bought this as a light exfoliate to help me clean that area without irritating it. It does the job but there are ones at Sephora with much much softer and more pronounced bristles, and after feeling them compared to this one I knew I should&#x27;ve just bought from Sephora. When I do, this one will become my back up because it&#x27;s not bad it&#x27;s just not as good as others that are about 2 dollars more.</li>
            <li> my cousin have something similar this stuff, she bought it from somewhere else, than i wanted to get same thing or similar and bought this. but this is really cheap and useless stuff, dont even spend a penny for this.</li>
            <li> It works ok, no problems with it.  Little weird using but seems to do the trick.</li>
            <li> I ordered blue and received a pink one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having issues with dry flaky skin and thought this might help me exfoliate more gently as I fear I am too rough otherwise. I guess its ok but I would hold out for something better. I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience in this department anyway.</li>
