            <li>B0002Z8GEK Healthy Hoof Lacquer 1/2oz]]</li>
            <li>One post mentioned this is a top coat.</li>
            <li>Healthy Hoof Lacquer .5 Oz</li>
            <li>I wear it over my polish as a top coat.  </li>
            <li>This is a fabulous product!</li>
            <li>This has become my favorite fast-dry top coat of them all.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this product too.  </li>
            <li>It works fantastic!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products that claimed they hardened the nail, but I&#x27;ve never had any luck.</li>
            <li>GENA Hoof Lacquer really does harden my nail, and I haven&#x27;t experienced any breakage since I&#x27;ve started using it.</li>
            <li>and then as a top coat with two coats of color between the two layers of this polish.</li>
            <li>then this as a top coat.</li>
            <li>So I was hoping for something that works but at a much better price.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t applied it over polish yet, maybe it will work better.</li>
            <li>I like to make sure that products I buy don&#x27;t contain that ingredient.  </li>
            <li>\\&quot;Healthy</li>
            <li>I love this polish.</li>
            <li>But glad to find it cheaper</li>
            <li>nd I rave on it to my friends nd family nd facebook. :)</li>
            <li>love it .My</li>
            <li>Putting a coat of this product on top of two layers of polish extends the life</li>
            <li>The best thing about this product is how long it wears.  </li>
            <li>I put it on clean nails and within a day, it was peeling off like celophane!</li>
            <li>Off the bat I will say that this should be used as a top coat and not base coat.</li>
            <li>I had really hoped this would be good from reading the reviews.  </li>
            <li>Nails do not break easily.  </li>
            <li>Keeps nails strong and they do not break.</li>
            <li>It was strong without the threat of breaking your nails.</li>
            <li>Looks nice without polish,or you can put it on first and then your polish.</li>
            <li>Really like this top coat!</li>
            <li>This is absolutely the best stuff ever to keep a manicure/pedicure looking new &amp; fresh.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly to anyone who wants beautiful nails.</li>
            <li>We haven&#x27;t been able to find it ANYWHERE in stores anymore, so I am super excited to have found it here on Amazon:</li>
            <li>It is cheap in price....</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s made to be used as a topcoat, not a base coat.</li>
            <li>Goes on shiny and light and stays that way.</li>
            <li>I have had success with this product along with the Healthy Hoof cream.  </li>
            <li>Just what I needed to help with my nails that tend to split during the winter months.&lt;br /&gt;Bought two more of these later to give to a cousin and a friend.&lt;br /&gt;Fairly good price.  </li>
            <li>I like that the polish comes off easily and you can reapply quickly.</li>
            <li>and I have nails for the first time in my many years.</li>
            <li>I use Healthy Hoof Laquer as a top coat since a lot of folks find that it peels off on the natural nail.  </li>
            <li>I thought it was something special since it was used on horse.  </li>
            <li>Right on time!</li>
            <li>I was looking for a product to truely harden my nails.</li>
            <li>My nail polish lasted so much longer than it did prior to my using this wonderful product which also prevented as much peeling on my nail tips.</li>
            <li>Very good quality and long lasting top coat.</li>
            <li>This product peals off your nails every quickly</li>
            <li>I have tried several top coats, including Seche Vite, Out the Door, Sally Hansen, Revlon, Nuance, and more...</li>
            <li>Overall,  the results are much better after using Healthy Hoof then before</li>
            <li>The two together have helped my nails tremendously.</li>
            <li>Good, safe packaging kept the small glass bottles from breaking in transit.  </li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t want it to chip off in the first week!  </li>
            <li>Healty Hoof is excellent, makes your nails tough you can feel it working as soon as you put it on.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth your money.</li>
            <li>I rarely use a pick.</li>
            <li>The polish seems to be absorbed.  </li>
            <li>I have always had soft nails and haven&#x27;t been able to grow nails that don&#x27;t break.  </li>
            <li>This product will make your nails grow long and strong and healthy.  </li>
            <li>Did not do exactly what is claimed; It peels away from the nail quickly.</li>
            <li>and my nails were long &amp; healthy!</li>
            <li>She told me this product had every vitamin in the world to make nails stronger..and she was right.</li>
            <li>Maybe I didn&#x27;t buy the right product.</li>
            <li>All have beautiful HARD</li>
            <li>Inexpensive, actually really does dry in a good time and NO CHIP</li>
            <li>I have my own long nails and it helped keep the polish intact.  </li>
            <li>It makes your nails incredibly strong and completely non-chipible.  </li>
            <li>For harder nails, It is the best product I have ever used to make my nails harder, bar none.</li>
            <li>I thought, wow, this is really strong.</li>
            <li>I was weirded out at first because it said it was for horse hooves, but after they put it in, it&#x27;s the only top coat I&#x27;m willing to use now!</li>
            <li>It works very well as a high gloss top coat and prolongs my manicure very well.  </li>
            <li>Price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>I bought for the first time and used it yesterday.</li>
            <li>I will give it one more try as a topcoat only and see what happens.</li>
            <li>It peels off within the first day, it does not help your nails in any way.</li>
            <li>I bought Healthy Hoof just out of curiosity from a local drug store.  </li>
            <li>When I stay consistent and take my biotin and lots of water this product does work.</li>
            <li>Works the same as any top coat nail polish.</li>
            <li>The smell is reasonable and the results are worth the effort.</li>
            <li>and you may find yourself adding another coat of this to your nails to revive the shine or using a different top coat all together.</li>
            <li>It looks really good when you first apply but within a few hours it has already started flaking off your nail tips.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I might like is a bit more shine.  </li>
            <li>plus it made my regular nails shine more if i did not want any finger nail polish on them</li>
            <li>A waste of good money.</li>
            <li>this stuff works very well on top of any kind of polish but on my dry nails, it was peeling by the middle of the day whether or not my hands were in water.</li>
            <li>Clearly defective!!!!</li>
            <li>It dries quickly, keeps my nails from splitting, and for the first time in years I have long, strong fingernails.  </li>
            <li>If you really want to keep your polish lasting longer, you can add this as a top coat every 3 days or so.</li>
            <li>(The salon told me that it was \\&quot;very expensive\\&quot; when I went back this week for more.</li>
            <li>It keeps the nail polish on longer, strengthens the nails, is very shiny and very reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>My nails are much healthier and they&#x27;re getting so much longer!</li>
            <li>I have been using it for a long time and am glad I found it online since I can&#x27;t get it in the drug store anymore.  </li>
            <li>This dries to a pretty good hard surface on your nails and it&#x27;s shiny.</li>
            <li>I got excellent elasticity when I used Sally Hanson Triple Strong as a base, added two coats of color,</li>
            <li>It is better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried, at a much lower cost!  </li>
            <li>I mainly just get my toes done, and it will keep my polish on for over 3 weeks!</li>
            <li>then it wouldn&#x27;t do much as a strengthener.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really affordable and</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>What this really means is that I use my nails.</li>
            <li>On tonails it lasts much longer.  </li>
            <li>I reccomend this product to anyone who wants to extend the life of their manicure.</li>
            <li>Do people really use this on their horses.</li>
            <li>This is the stuff you need when you&#x27;ve just paid WAY too much for a mani/pedi</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>After using the lacquer, my nails did not need as much care.</li>
            <li>It really works.  </li>
            <li>It does harden your nails but maybe harden too much.</li>
            <li>This is really helping my nails to grow after removing the acrylic nails.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t think it is helping my nails much.  </li>
            <li>The company I purchased this item from was very prompt and professional ; the product not so much!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok not really worth spending the money.</li>
            <li>The product is OK but the bottle was only half full.</li>
            <li>Only OPI for colors and only Hoof Lacquer for top coat.</li>
            <li>It has amazing shine but over time the shine does dull</li>
            <li>A fresh coat of this every 2 days over the same polish</li>
            <li>It left a streaky finish and peeled right off.  </li>
            <li>There are other nail protectors available without it.</li>
            <li>/look of my polish for 3-4 days, and keeps the color shiny and new looking.</li>
            <li>I bought several and gave them as gifts and stocking stuffers!~ Very very inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>This product is not any different from any other top coat out there.  </li>
            <li>I like that it doesn&#x27;t make the polish on my nails crack like some other regular top coats from drug stores.</li>
            <li>I tried this polish consistently and it still won&#x27;t last!!!</li>
            <li>At first it seemed like regular nail polish.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this to anyone who works on computers and keeps their nails moderately short but still wants a bit of \\&quot;finish\\&quot; to their nails.</li>
            <li>The brush is soft enough not to streak my nail art, it is very fast-drying and shiny!</li>
            <li>I have tried a number of nail strengthers, with great disappointment.  </li>
            <li>It is just like clear fingernail hardener.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using this product for soft, brittle nails.  </li>
            <li>I use it as a top coat after every pedi, &amp; I don&#x27;t have to re-do it for at least a month.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;who has problem grow soft nail OR growing them.  </li>
            <li>They are always surprised</li>
            <li>Old school product  </li>
            <li>and you get almost two weeks of wear on natural nails</li>
            <li>Within a couple of days you can just peel the whole thing, or what&#x27;s left, off at once.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anybody who wants their manicure to last.  </li>
            <li>My 17 year old daughter nd</li>
            <li>Even though it was inexpensive, I guess it is worth the money spent.</li>
            <li>Manicures last days longer than normal!</li>
            <li>The bottle I had was very old, but this new bottle didn&#x27;t seem the same.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend the product and would definitely use this seller again.</li>
            <li>This stuff is crazy amazing!</li>
            <li>This is the only clear polish that has ever kept my nails in tact and helped my polish on my natural nails not to chip.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly, and has no strong odor.</li>
            <li>Fabulous shine, hard coating.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for a long time but lately have not been able to find it anywhere but online.  </li>
            <li>I had thought this was a nail strengthener/hardener, and those are used on the bare nail.</li>
            <li>If this doesn&#x27;t adhere to the bare nail</li>
            <li>My nails got worse instead of better.  </li>
            <li>on top of one coat of clear polish and washing my hands at least 10 times since putting it on, and the polish hasn&#x27;t chipped, peeled or had any other problem.  </li>
            <li>My nails are damaged and weak, and they split easily.  </li>
            <li>I first ran into this product a few weeks ago when a nail salon put it on my nails after a manicure.</li>
            <li>Peels after 1day, very thin, smells very strong.</li>
            <li>I was first introduced to this product a few years ago at a local nail salon.</li>
            <li>My nail grows thin &amp; brittle but this makes them strong.</li>
            <li>You can apply the lacquer with a little brush attached to the lid and keep your hands free of waste.  </li>
            <li>I have been using a product I order from QVC which is a good product for bad nails</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m so pleased!</li>
            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> The o lu top coat I use!</li>
            <li> I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> The amount ordered came quickly and was in very good shape.</li>
            <li> My nails were very shiny and supple, and looked great after application!</li>
            <li> nails haven&#x27;t been this nice since I started using Gena hoof lacquer</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat for your nails, it really keeps them strong and looking great.</li>
            <li> It makes them very strong and shiny.  </li>
            <li> By far the best coat we have ever found!  </li>
            <li> I apply my own polish at home, and use this as my top coat.  </li>
            <li> B0002Z8GEK Healthy Hoof Lacquer 1/2oz]]</li>
            <li> One post mentioned this is a top coat.</li>
            <li> Healthy Hoof Lacquer .5 Oz</li>
            <li> I wear it over my polish as a top coat.  </li>
            <li> This is a fabulous product!</li>
            <li> This has become my favorite fast-dry top coat of them all.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love this product too.  </li>
            <li> It works fantastic!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products that claimed they hardened the nail, but I&#x27;ve never had any luck.</li>
            <li> GENA Hoof Lacquer really does harden my nail, and I haven&#x27;t experienced any breakage since I&#x27;ve started using it.</li>
            <li> and then as a top coat with two coats of color between the two layers of this polish.</li>
            <li> then this as a top coat.</li>
            <li> So I was hoping for something that works but at a much better price.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t applied it over polish yet, maybe it will work better.</li>
            <li> I like to make sure that products I buy don&#x27;t contain that ingredient.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;Healthy</li>
            <li> I love this polish.</li>
            <li> But glad to find it cheaper</li>
            <li> nd I rave on it to my friends nd family nd facebook. :)</li>
            <li> love it .My</li>
            <li> Putting a coat of this product on top of two layers of polish extends the life</li>
            <li> The best thing about this product is how long it wears.  </li>
            <li> I put it on clean nails and within a day, it was peeling off like celophane!</li>
            <li> Off the bat I will say that this should be used as a top coat and not base coat.</li>
            <li> I had really hoped this would be good from reading the reviews.  </li>
            <li> Nails do not break easily.  </li>
            <li> Keeps nails strong and they do not break.</li>
            <li> It was strong without the threat of breaking your nails.</li>
            <li> Looks nice without polish,or you can put it on first and then your polish.</li>
            <li> Really like this top coat!</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best stuff ever to keep a manicure/pedicure looking new &amp; fresh.</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly to anyone who wants beautiful nails.</li>
            <li> We haven&#x27;t been able to find it ANYWHERE in stores anymore, so I am super excited to have found it here on Amazon:</li>
            <li> It is cheap in price....</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s made to be used as a topcoat, not a base coat.</li>
            <li> Goes on shiny and light and stays that way.</li>
            <li> I have had success with this product along with the Healthy Hoof cream.  </li>
            <li> Just what I needed to help with my nails that tend to split during the winter months.&lt;br /&gt;Bought two more of these later to give to a cousin and a friend.&lt;br /&gt;Fairly good price.  </li>
            <li> I like that the polish comes off easily and you can reapply quickly.</li>
            <li> and I have nails for the first time in my many years.</li>
            <li> I use Healthy Hoof Laquer as a top coat since a lot of folks find that it peels off on the natural nail.  </li>
            <li> I thought it was something special since it was used on horse.  </li>
            <li> Right on time!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product to truely harden my nails.</li>
            <li> My nail polish lasted so much longer than it did prior to my using this wonderful product which also prevented as much peeling on my nail tips.</li>
            <li> Very good quality and long lasting top coat.</li>
            <li> This product peals off your nails every quickly</li>
            <li> I have tried several top coats, including Seche Vite, Out the Door, Sally Hansen, Revlon, Nuance, and more...</li>
            <li> Overall,  the results are much better after using Healthy Hoof then before</li>
            <li> The two together have helped my nails tremendously.</li>
            <li> Good, safe packaging kept the small glass bottles from breaking in transit.  </li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t want it to chip off in the first week!  </li>
            <li> Healty Hoof is excellent, makes your nails tough you can feel it working as soon as you put it on.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth your money.</li>
            <li> I rarely use a pick.</li>
            <li> The polish seems to be absorbed.  </li>
            <li> I have always had soft nails and haven&#x27;t been able to grow nails that don&#x27;t break.  </li>
            <li> This product will make your nails grow long and strong and healthy.  </li>
            <li> Did not do exactly what is claimed; It peels away from the nail quickly.</li>
            <li> and my nails were long &amp; healthy!</li>
            <li> She told me this product had every vitamin in the world to make nails stronger..and she was right.</li>
            <li> Maybe I didn&#x27;t buy the right product.</li>
            <li> All have beautiful HARD</li>
            <li> Inexpensive, actually really does dry in a good time and NO CHIP</li>
            <li> I have my own long nails and it helped keep the polish intact.  </li>
            <li> It makes your nails incredibly strong and completely non-chipible.  </li>
            <li> For harder nails, It is the best product I have ever used to make my nails harder, bar none.</li>
            <li> I thought, wow, this is really strong.</li>
            <li> I was weirded out at first because it said it was for horse hooves, but after they put it in, it&#x27;s the only top coat I&#x27;m willing to use now!</li>
            <li> It works very well as a high gloss top coat and prolongs my manicure very well.  </li>
            <li> Price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I bought for the first time and used it yesterday.</li>
            <li> I will give it one more try as a topcoat only and see what happens.</li>
            <li> It peels off within the first day, it does not help your nails in any way.</li>
            <li> I bought Healthy Hoof just out of curiosity from a local drug store.  </li>
            <li> When I stay consistent and take my biotin and lots of water this product does work.</li>
            <li> Works the same as any top coat nail polish.</li>
            <li> The smell is reasonable and the results are worth the effort.</li>
            <li> and you may find yourself adding another coat of this to your nails to revive the shine or using a different top coat all together.</li>
            <li> It looks really good when you first apply but within a few hours it has already started flaking off your nail tips.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I might like is a bit more shine.  </li>
            <li> plus it made my regular nails shine more if i did not want any finger nail polish on them</li>
            <li> A waste of good money.</li>
            <li> this stuff works very well on top of any kind of polish but on my dry nails, it was peeling by the middle of the day whether or not my hands were in water.</li>
            <li> Clearly defective!!!!</li>
            <li> It dries quickly, keeps my nails from splitting, and for the first time in years I have long, strong fingernails.  </li>
            <li> If you really want to keep your polish lasting longer, you can add this as a top coat every 3 days or so.</li>
            <li> (The salon told me that it was \\&quot;very expensive\\&quot; when I went back this week for more.</li>
            <li> It keeps the nail polish on longer, strengthens the nails, is very shiny and very reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> My nails are much healthier and they&#x27;re getting so much longer!</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a long time and am glad I found it online since I can&#x27;t get it in the drug store anymore.  </li>
            <li> This dries to a pretty good hard surface on your nails and it&#x27;s shiny.</li>
            <li> I got excellent elasticity when I used Sally Hanson Triple Strong as a base, added two coats of color,</li>
            <li> It is better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried, at a much lower cost!  </li>
            <li> I mainly just get my toes done, and it will keep my polish on for over 3 weeks!</li>
            <li> then it wouldn&#x27;t do much as a strengthener.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really affordable and</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> What this really means is that I use my nails.</li>
            <li> On tonails it lasts much longer.  </li>
            <li> I reccomend this product to anyone who wants to extend the life of their manicure.</li>
            <li> Do people really use this on their horses.</li>
            <li> This is the stuff you need when you&#x27;ve just paid WAY too much for a mani/pedi</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> After using the lacquer, my nails did not need as much care.</li>
            <li> It really works.  </li>
            <li> It does harden your nails but maybe harden too much.</li>
            <li> This is really helping my nails to grow after removing the acrylic nails.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think it is helping my nails much.  </li>
            <li> The company I purchased this item from was very prompt and professional ; the product not so much!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok not really worth spending the money.</li>
            <li> The product is OK but the bottle was only half full.</li>
            <li> Only OPI for colors and only Hoof Lacquer for top coat.</li>
            <li> It has amazing shine but over time the shine does dull</li>
            <li> A fresh coat of this every 2 days over the same polish</li>
            <li> It left a streaky finish and peeled right off.  </li>
            <li> There are other nail protectors available without it.</li>
            <li> /look of my polish for 3-4 days, and keeps the color shiny and new looking.</li>
            <li> I bought several and gave them as gifts and stocking stuffers!~ Very very inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> This product is not any different from any other top coat out there.  </li>
            <li> I like that it doesn&#x27;t make the polish on my nails crack like some other regular top coats from drug stores.</li>
            <li> I tried this polish consistently and it still won&#x27;t last!!!</li>
            <li> At first it seemed like regular nail polish.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend this to anyone who works on computers and keeps their nails moderately short but still wants a bit of \\&quot;finish\\&quot; to their nails.</li>
            <li> The brush is soft enough not to streak my nail art, it is very fast-drying and shiny!</li>
            <li> I have tried a number of nail strengthers, with great disappointment.  </li>
            <li> It is just like clear fingernail hardener.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this product for soft, brittle nails.  </li>
            <li> I use it as a top coat after every pedi, &amp; I don&#x27;t have to re-do it for at least a month.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;who has problem grow soft nail OR growing them.  </li>
            <li> They are always surprised</li>
            <li> Old school product  </li>
            <li> and you get almost two weeks of wear on natural nails</li>
            <li> Within a couple of days you can just peel the whole thing, or what&#x27;s left, off at once.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anybody who wants their manicure to last.  </li>
            <li> My 17 year old daughter nd</li>
            <li> Even though it was inexpensive, I guess it is worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> Manicures last days longer than normal!</li>
            <li> The bottle I had was very old, but this new bottle didn&#x27;t seem the same.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend the product and would definitely use this seller again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is crazy amazing!</li>
            <li> This is the only clear polish that has ever kept my nails in tact and helped my polish on my natural nails not to chip.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly, and has no strong odor.</li>
            <li> Fabulous shine, hard coating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a long time but lately have not been able to find it anywhere but online.  </li>
            <li> I had thought this was a nail strengthener/hardener, and those are used on the bare nail.</li>
            <li> If this doesn&#x27;t adhere to the bare nail</li>
            <li> My nails got worse instead of better.  </li>
            <li> on top of one coat of clear polish and washing my hands at least 10 times since putting it on, and the polish hasn&#x27;t chipped, peeled or had any other problem.  </li>
            <li> My nails are damaged and weak, and they split easily.  </li>
            <li> I first ran into this product a few weeks ago when a nail salon put it on my nails after a manicure.</li>
            <li> Peels after 1day, very thin, smells very strong.</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to this product a few years ago at a local nail salon.</li>
            <li> My nail grows thin &amp; brittle but this makes them strong.</li>
            <li> You can apply the lacquer with a little brush attached to the lid and keep your hands free of waste.  </li>
            <li> I have been using a product I order from QVC which is a good product for bad nails</li>
            <li> on my dry unvarnished nails, I tried 1 coat, tried 2 and 3 coats and tried waiting 8 hours between coats all to no avail on bare nails.</li>
            <li> I am hard on my hands and when I apply this over my manicure (when I get them) it really lasts!</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve gone as long as 6 wks, and then I only had the tiniest chips...mainly from my nails growing</li>
            <li> this is the same company strange.</li>
            <li> My mom and I found this several years back and were shocked to find such an strong polish!  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t leave the bottle open very long a</li>
            <li> It gets thicker and harder to use after use.&lt;br /&gt;I returned the Hoof Lacquer back to Beauty Deals for a refund</li>
            <li> Was hoping on pretty nails but was not successful in having some.</li>
            <li> My fingernails, toe nails were brittle, ridged, dry as the Sahara Desert.</li>
            <li> Of course you have to wait for all coats to fully dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had trouble with my nails breaking and becoming very weak and brittle.</li>
            <li> I wash my hands, do dishes, and take a shower - just like any human, and probably less than any horse -</li>
            <li> I have been using it for roughly 15 years now.  </li>
            <li> Your nail polish will shine like when was wet.</li>
            <li> I use it with Pink Armor.</li>
            <li> If you want longer and harder nails this is&lt;br /&gt;the product that you must try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;My are longer and harder.</li>
            <li> Just try and be careful that you are using this with something else as well.</li>
            <li> I tried the Gena Hoof Lacquer hoping for my nails to start growing without breaking and getting harder.  </li>
            <li> (I know that top coats and base coats are different).</li>
            <li> Works well when it stays on, but needs to be re-applied every other day or so.  </li>
            <li> thick, ridged, yellow</li>
            <li> Try putting a base coat underneath the Hoof Lacquer &amp; you&#x27;ll probably have better results.</li>
            <li> It was suggested to me by a church pianist/organist (from a place I have yet to set foot in), as I was crying about the quality of all those other nail strengthening products on the market.</li>
            <li> Then this smells toxic and stays on less than one day.</li>
            <li> and by the end of the day, half my nail was unpolished.  </li>
            <li> My nails are a mess from swimming.</li>
            <li> You want your nails to have a little bit of elasticity on your nails just in case, say, you bump your nail on a door or table.</li>
            <li> it made my nails look a little healtyer</li>
            <li> It does not prevent chipping any longer than a few hours.  </li>
            <li> If applying over colored nail polish, wait until that polish has dried thoroughly before applying the horse hoof lacquer.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not comfortable with the fact that it contains Formaldehyde listed in its ingredients.  </li>
            <li> It takes a few days to see how it works.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this as a top coat only and use a different base coat under nail polish or just as a base for this product.  </li>
            <li> It does seem to make nails stronger but it does not stay on long and starts flaking off so nails look worse.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> Not sure will use this product again.</li>
            <li> I used it as a base coat the first time I got it</li>
            <li> My nails must be hard.</li>
            <li> Hard to find anywhere.</li>
            <li> it looks dull but it hasn&#x27;t worn off, it just seems to sink in.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores</li>
            <li> The next day after applying it, it peels like crazy.</li>
            <li> What I mean by that is</li>
            <li> Yellow aging ugly nails.</li>
            <li> This is not good.</li>
            <li> It also dries quickly to a very hard finish.  </li>
            <li> I decided to buy this product because I had the worse nails for years.</li>
            <li> My toe nails were worse..</li>
            <li> My nails were always thin</li>
            <li> I use Orly Bonder only for base coat.  </li>
            <li> I found it to be not matte enough to maintain nail color stability if used as a base.</li>
            <li> my nail are so thin.</li>
            <li> I am not impressed at this point.</li>
            <li> Sad product.</li>
            <li> but it is rather expensive.  </li>
            <li> Not impressed and will not buy again.</li>
            <li> and I had the bad habit of biting.</li>
            <li> Has the formula changed or did I get one from a bad batch?  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do a bad job in protecting nails</li>
            <li> However, after reading the ingredients, I was shocked to see that Formaldehyde  is listed.</li>
            <li> I used 2 coats as a base, then 2 coats of an Orly polish and one coat as a topcoat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I had a horrible vitamin deficiency in my fingernails and toenails.</li>
            <li> Awful!</li>
            <li> when it&#x27;s the worst I&#x27;ve ever put on.  </li>
            <li> Horrible..</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> This is my third time buying this nail polish. Strengthens my nails and it leaves then shinny. Definitely worth your money.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this product because I had the worse nails for years. My fingernails, toe nails were brittle, ridged, dry as the Sahara Desert. No amount of nail polish could hide what was underneath. Yellow aging ugly nails. My toe nails were worse..thick, ridged, yellow, I had double toe nails fighting for domination. It was just horrid to look at. I had a horrible vitamin deficiency in my fingernails and toenails. I couldn&#x27;t afford monthly pedicures at the time so I asked the beautician who cuts my husbands hair. I asked her \\&quot;What do you recommend to make finger nails stronger?\\&quot; She crypticly said \\&quot;You know anyone with horses?\\&quot; I was amused..\\&quot;Horses?\\&quot; and she told me about \\&quot;Hoof Lacquer\\&quot;. It was a done deal, i went on the internet and found this product. She told me this product had every vitamin in the world to make nails stronger..and she was right. My fingernails are 90% corrected now I&#x27;m working on my toenails. I saw a difference with my hands in a matter of two weeks..my feet are taking a bit longer..but it&#x27;s getting there.

            <li> I bought for the first time and used it yesterday. I am not impressed at this point. I had 3 chipped nails this morning. I hadn&#x27;t done anything except wash my hair. One post mentioned this is a top coat. (I know that top coats and base coats are different). I used 2 coats as a base, then 2 coats of an Orly polish and one coat as a topcoat. I will give it one more try as a topcoat only and see what happens. I had thought this was a nail strengthener/hardener, and those are used on the bare nail. If this doesn&#x27;t adhere to the bare nail then it wouldn&#x27;t do much as a strengthener.</li>
            <li> This product is not any different from any other top coat out there.  It does not prevent chipping any longer than a few hours.  I used it and the same day my nail polish chipped.  Awful!</li>
            <li> This stuff is crazy amazing! My mom and I found this several years back and were shocked to find such an strong polish!  By far the best coat we have ever found!  It makes your nails incredibly strong and completely non-chipible.  We haven&#x27;t been able to find it ANYWHERE in stores anymore, so I am super excited to have found it here on Amazon:D  I cannot wait to buy it:D</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stay on at all. It peels off the same day. How can it strengthen your nails, if it doesn&#x27;t even stay on? I&#x27;m very disappointed. Waste of money!</li>
            <li> It is cheap in price....so you get what you pay for. It peels off within the first day, it does not help your nails in any way. I was looking for a product to truely harden my nails.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this product for soft, brittle nails.  It makes them very strong and shiny.  I recommend it highly to anyone who wants beautiful nails.</li>
            <li> Did not do exactly what is claimed; It peels away from the nail quickly.</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to this product a few years ago at a local nail salon. I was weirded out at first because it said it was for horse hooves, but after they put it in, it&#x27;s the only top coat I&#x27;m willing to use now! It works great and keeps my nails from chipping (fingers and toes). If you really want to keep your polish lasting longer, you can add this as a top coat every 3 days or so. I mainly just get my toes done, and it will keep my polish on for over 3 weeks! The only part that chips is when my nail starts to grow out. It&#x27;s really affordable and I like that it doesn&#x27;t make the polish on my nails crack like some other regular top coats from drug stores. I highly recommend it! This 0.5oz size has lasted me over two years, so I think it&#x27;s a great deal!</li>
            <li> This product peals off your nails every quickly and I was looking for something to strength my nails.  Maybe I didn&#x27;t buy the right product. Can you let me know.</li>
            <li> I was so impressed when I received this &amp; promptly used it as a top coat with fantastic results. However, after reading the ingredients, I was shocked to see that Formaldehyde  is listed. I can&#x27;t support a product that has carcinogens in it and nor should anyone else.</li>
            <li> I thought it was something special since it was used on horse.  It is just like clear fingernail hardener.  Even though it was inexpensive, I guess it is worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> I am a guitarist. I rarely use a pick. Over 97% of the time it is all fingers. What this really means is that I use my nails. My nails must be hard. Healthy Hoof (lacquer) is the best product I have found to strengthen my nails. I have been using it for roughly 15 years now.  It was suggested to me by a church pianist/organist (from a place I have yet to set foot in), as I was crying about the quality of all those other nail strengthening products on the market. For harder nails, It is the best product I have ever used to make my nails harder, bar none.</li>
            <li> I used another similar product for 6 months with no problem. As soon as I began using this product I got white lines and white blotches on my nails. Also, this product is not that shiny.</li>
            <li> Great top coat.....Healthy Hoof Lacquer .5 Oz....I bought several and gave them as gifts and stocking stuffers!~ Very very inexpensive.  I would recommend this product!~</li>
            <li> I put this stuff on and 4 nails broke the next day.  My nails got worse instead of better.  Will not use it ever again.  Waste of money!</li>
            <li> The Healthy Hoof Lacquer is the best top-coat I have ever used.  I put 2 coats on over my nail polish and it lasts for a good week.  On tonails it lasts much longer.  It also dries quickly to a very hard finish.  Your nail polish will shine like when was wet.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best stuff ever to keep a manicure/pedicure looking new &amp; fresh. I use it as a top coat after every pedi, &amp; I don&#x27;t have to re-do it for at least a month. (I&#x27;ve gone as long as 6 wks, and then I only had the tiniest chips...mainly from my nails growing out)&lt;br /&gt;Those that aren&#x27;t having good results...it&#x27;s made to be used as a topcoat, not a base coat. Try putting a base coat underneath the Hoof Lacquer &amp; you&#x27;ll probably have better results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Seche Vite, OPI and Essie, but for the money this is the best topcoat I&#x27;ve ever used. Goes on shiny and light and stays that way. I reccomend this product to anyone who wants to extend the life of their manicure.</li>
            <li> Peels after 1day, very thin, smells very strong. It is not as good as any Sally Hansen product. I&#x27;d never recommend or buy again. They have good hand cream though.</li>
            <li> The company I purchased this item from was very prompt and professional ; the product not so much! My nails are a mess from swimming. Then this smells toxic and stays on less than one day. Why even bother!</li>
            <li> This product is really great your nails are healtier and stronger I have brittle nails and what a difference it makes</li>
            <li> Will not stay on my wife&#x27;s nails. She no like..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok not really worth spending the money. Would not want anyone to buy this product. A waste of good money.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because I used it years ago and my nails were long &amp; healthy! The polish used to stay on for weeks!! This product is nothing like the polish I used before!!! This polish chips off the very same day!!!! I tried this polish consistently and it still won&#x27;t last!!! Clearly defective!!!!</li>
            <li> This product is good but I wished it would stay on my nails longer than 3 days. It gets thicker and harder to use after use.&lt;br /&gt;I returned the Hoof Lacquer back to Beauty Deals for a refund and they did not do it.  They kept my money, I had&lt;br /&gt;purchased 3 bottles.</li>
            <li> Really like this top coat! Inexpensive, actually really does dry in a good time and NO CHIP AT ALL. Of course you have to wait for all coats to fully dry. My nails don&#x27;t chip for maybe... 5-6 days depending on what I do with my hands though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product !</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed. Do people really use this on their horses. I put it on clean nails and within a day, it was peeling off like celophane! I wash my hands, do dishes, and take a shower - just like any human, and probably less than any horse - but the stuff did not last. Sad product. I did get a refund though.</li>
            <li> My nails are now healthier than they have been for years.  I wear it over my polish as a top coat.  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> My nails have never been stronger. I use it with Pink Armor. I redo my nails every Sunday and I have nails for the first time in my many years.</li>
            <li> I first ran into this product a few weeks ago when a nail salon put it on my nails after a manicure. My nails were very shiny and supple, and looked great after application! Then, as the days went by and I waited for the polish to wear off, it didn&#x27;t. It lasted almost 2 weeks. I was floored. This is a fabulous product! (The salon told me that it was \\&quot;very expensive\\&quot; when I went back this week for more. Uh huh.... thanks.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this to anyone who works on computers and keeps their nails moderately short but still wants a bit of \\&quot;finish\\&quot; to their nails. It&#x27;s great stuff!</li>
            <li> I have tried a number of nail strengthers, with great disappointment.  I bought Healthy Hoof just out of curiosity from a local drug store.  It is better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried, at a much lower cost!  It dries quickly, keeps my nails from splitting, and for the first time in years I have long, strong fingernails.  I use it under and over my nail polish, or alone.  Since I already had a 1/2 oz. bottle, I bought the 4 oz size for refills.  Definitely 5 star on my list.</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat I have ever used. I&#x27;ve used it for years. It keeps your polish from chipping for a week. I know people who have to reapply their polish every couple days and mine lasts for about 6-7 days. If applying over colored nail polish, wait until that polish has dried thoroughly before applying the horse hoof lacquer. You only need one coat!</li>
            <li> The product is OK but the bottle was only half full.</li>
            <li> This is the stuff you need when you&#x27;ve just paid WAY too much for a mani/pedi and you don&#x27;t want it to chip off in the first week!  I am hard on my hands and when I apply this over my manicure (when I get them) it really lasts!</li>
            <li> When I stay consistent and take my biotin and lots of water this product does work. My nail grows thin &amp; brittle but this makes them strong.</li>
            <li> I bought this in conjunction with the nail cream. This didn&#x27;t last a day after I put it on my nails. I polished in the evening, then put on the nail cream and after 1 shower, it was already chipping off. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This item is GREAT...  Even my Mom and Aunt have been using it. All have beautiful HARD Nails.&lt;br /&gt;If one breaks, this stuff help the nail to grow back faster. I would recommend this to anyone&lt;br /&gt;who has problem grow soft nail OR growing them.  If you want longer and harder nails this is&lt;br /&gt;the product that you must try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My are longer and harder. They last through what my daily chored are. This includes outside&lt;br /&gt;animal care. I have been using it for atleast 10years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TRY IT,,,,,,,</li>
            <li> I used this for my dog. He runs 30 miles/week with me on the cement &amp; his nails were starting to bleed. This stuff protects his nails.</li>
            <li> This product did not meet my expectations.  I had read that it would make a great top coat but it peeled off the same day I put it on!</li>
            <li> My nail polish stays on for an extra 5 days or so.</li>
            <li> It does seem to make nails stronger but it does not stay on long and starts flaking off so nails look worse.  Not sure will use this product again.</li>
            <li> I have tried several top coats, including Seche Vite, Out the Door, Sally Hansen, Revlon, Nuance, and more... This has become my favorite fast-dry top coat of them all.  The brush is soft enough not to streak my nail art, it is very fast-drying and shiny! My polish does not &#x27;shrink&#x27; at the tips when this dries, and the manicure lasts longer without chipping.  I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Finally something that works!! My nails were always thin and I had the bad habit of biting. This stuff is a miracle for me. Keeps nails strong and they do not break. Wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  My manicures last 8-10 days.  I take this with me when I get my nails done.  They are always surprised but it works like nothing else I can find.  I use Orly Bonder only for base coat.  Only OPI for colors and only Hoof Lacquer for top coat.</li>
            <li> Old school product  but, the best top coat ever. Fabulous shine, hard coating. The fancier, pricier topcoats cannot compare.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed to help with my nails that tend to split during the winter months.&lt;br /&gt;Bought two more of these later to give to a cousin and a friend.&lt;br /&gt;Fairly good price.  Would like to see it sold; buy one get one free.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is the only clear polish that has ever kept my nails in tact and helped my polish on my natural nails not to chip. A fresh coat of this every 2 days over the same polish and you get almost two weeks of wear on natural nails</li>
            <li> my nails have never been this long.love it</li>
            <li> This dries to a pretty good hard surface on your nails and it&#x27;s shiny. I try to put on a coat every 2 days. Then at the end of the week, I start again. It helps to keep my nails from splitting and peeling all the time.</li>
            <li> The bottle I had was very old, but this new bottle didn&#x27;t seem the same.  I used it as polish and it doesn&#x27;t stay on.</li>
            <li> Excellent !!My nail polish lasted so much longer than it did prior to my using this wonderful product which also prevented as much peeling on my nail tips.</li>
            <li> The best top coat for nails ever invented. You must try it.</li>
            <li> Works the same as any top coat nail polish.</li>
            <li> This is the only lacquer that has repaired my nails. I sent a friend a bottle and she said it worked great. My nails were pealing and hers were splitting. After using the lacquer, my nails did not need as much care. I like that the polish comes off easily and you can reapply quickly.</li>
            <li> Good quality and works.  You can apply the lacquer with a little brush attached to the lid and keep your hands free of waste.  The smell is reasonable and the results are worth the effort.</li>
            <li> I use Healthy Hoof Laquer as a top coat since a lot of folks find that it peels off on the natural nail.  It works very well as a high gloss top coat and prolongs my manicure very well.  I would recommend this as a top coat only and use a different base coat under nail polish or just as a base for this product.  Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> Works well when it stays on, but needs to be re-applied every other day or so.  Probably would not recommend.</li>
            <li> It really works.  My nails are stronger and longer than they they have ever been.  It was a great buy.</li>
            <li> Price is very reasonable. Very good quality and long lasting top coat. Prefer the 0.5 instead of the 4 Oz bottle as the latter dries up before it&#x27;s all used.</li>
            <li> I love this product too.  This product will make your nails grow long and strong and healthy.  Nails do not break easily.  I will keep on using this product on my nails.</li>
            <li> I heard about this product from friends, so I thought I would try it out. Guess what? It works fantastic! I&#x27;ve always had trouble with my nails breaking and becoming very weak and brittle. I&#x27;ve tried many products that claimed they hardened the nail, but I&#x27;ve never had any luck. Until now! GENA Hoof Lacquer really does harden my nail, and I haven&#x27;t experienced any breakage since I&#x27;ve started using it. My nails are much healthier and they&#x27;re getting so much longer! I&#x27;m so pleased! Delivery was great too! Right on time!</li>
            <li> I made this purchase from a recommendation and out of curiosity. I had been looking at it for a while and finally made the splurge. Off the bat I will say that this should be used as a top coat and not base coat. I found it to be not matte enough to maintain nail color stability if used as a base. It has amazing shine but over time the shine does dull and you may find yourself adding another coat of this to your nails to revive the shine or using a different top coat all together. It does harden your nails but maybe harden too much. What I mean by that is I used it as a base coat the first time I got it and then as a top coat with two coats of color between the two layers of this polish. I thought, wow, this is really strong. My nails aren&#x27;t even bending. This is not good. You want your nails to have a little bit of elasticity on your nails just in case, say, you bump your nail on a door or table. If your nails are not flexible it will break, just snap off. This happened to me when I used just this product and nothing else. I got excellent elasticity when I used Sally Hanson Triple Strong as a base, added two coats of color, then this as a top coat. It was strong without the threat of breaking your nails. Because of that caveat I knocked a star off but it does do what it says, it hardens. Just try and be careful that you are using this with something else as well.</li>
            <li> I had really hoped this would be good from reading the reviews.  I have been using a product I order from QVC which is a good product for bad nails but it is rather expensive.  So I was hoping for something that works but at a much better price.  Well, this ain&#x27;t it!  It looks really good when you first apply but within a few hours it has already started flaking off your nail tips.  Within a couple of days you can just peel the whole thing, or what&#x27;s left, off at once.  I can&#x27;t believe the good reviews I read on here when it&#x27;s the worst I&#x27;ve ever put on.  Has the formula changed or did I get one from a bad batch?  I don&#x27;t know.....</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t make a huge difference in my nail strength, and the SMELL!!... Horrible.. Didn&#x27;t finish product and would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I have used Hoof Lacquer for several years and it has definitely helped strengthen my nails.  Don&#x27;t leave the bottle open very long a it thickens after a while.</li>
            <li> Fairly good.&lt;br /&gt;It did make my nails stronger, but I still see that my nails are splitting. Overall,  the results are much better after using Healthy Hoof then before</li>
            <li> Healty Hoof is excellent, makes your nails tough you can feel it working as soon as you put it on.  Looks nice without polish,or you can put it on first and then your polish.</li>
            <li> This product strengthens your nails, but only when it stay on. The next day after applying it, it peels like crazy. Even with 2 coats, it won&#x27;t stay on. I haven&#x27;t applied it over polish yet, maybe it will work better.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do a bad job in protecting nails but I&#x27;m not comfortable with the fact that it contains Formaldehyde listed in its ingredients.  I like to make sure that products I buy don&#x27;t contain that ingredient.  There are other nail protectors available without it.</li>
            <li> This lacquer does what it says according to my wife. I would recommend this to anyone with issues of frail nails.</li>
            <li> this is good for strengthening one&#x27;s nails.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anybody who wants their manicure to last.  I have my own long nails and it helped keep the polish intact.  It is not only for horses, works on us too.</li>
            <li> This came off in about an hour. Added another coat. Same story. Don&#x27;t bother with this. Save your money honey.</li>
            <li> This is the best top coat for your nails, it really keeps them strong and looking great. Hard to find anywhere.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful!  It keeps the nail polish on longer, strengthens the nails, is very shiny and very reasonably priced.  I love it!!  I have been using it for a long time and am glad I found it online since I can&#x27;t get it in the drug store anymore.  The seller is wonderful.  The amount ordered came quickly and was in very good shape. Good, safe packaging kept the small glass bottles from breaking in transit.  I highly recommend the product and would definitely use this seller again.</li>
            <li> This did not harden or protect my nails.  It left a streaky finish and peeled right off.  Not impressed and will not buy again.</li>
            <li> It takes a few days to see how it works.  At first it seemed like regular nail polish.  However, after about a week I noticed a difference.  The polish seems to be absorbed.  One layer is enough and after a day it looks dull but it hasn&#x27;t worn off, it just seems to sink in.  A coat a day works well.  My nails are no longer splitting or breaking.</li>
            <li> I once saw this in some drug store and was intrigued with the product name...\\&quot;Healthy Hoof\\&quot;  It&#x27;s the best nail hardener out there.  Hard to find in stores - Thank you Amazon...and at a great price.</li>
            <li> on top of one coat of clear polish and washing my hands at least 10 times since putting it on, and the polish hasn&#x27;t chipped, peeled or had any other problem.  will continue to use over another coat of polish only.  this stuff works very well on top of any kind of polish but on my dry nails, it was peeling by the middle of the day whether or not my hands were in water. and by the end of the day, half my nail was unpolished.  on my dry unvarnished nails, I tried 1 coat, tried 2 and 3 coats and tried waiting 8 hours between coats all to no avail on bare nails.</li>
            <li> The best thing about this product is how long it wears.  I&#x27;m not a manicure person, but this is great for those of us who don&#x27;t give ourselves manicures, but love to have a finished look.  The only thing I might like is a bit more shine.  I would order this again, no doubt about it.</li>
            <li> I have had success with this product along with the Healthy Hoof cream.  The two together have helped my nails tremendously.</li>
            <li> This is really helping my nails to grow after removing the acrylic nails.  I can already see a difference in the length of my nails.</li>
            <li> My 17 year old daughter nd I love this polish. Finally found something that makes our nails grow longer. I bought my 1st bottle for $5.00 frm this same company thn I looked on amazon nd found it for $1.98 nd this is the same company strange. But glad to find it cheaper I order 6 bottles nd I rave on it to my friends nd family nd facebook. :)</li>
            <li> love it .My nails haven&#x27;t been this nice since I started using Gena hoof lacquer</li>
            <li> Manicured that last up to 10 days even with a beach vacation in the middle. Love this!</li>
            <li> I have always had soft nails and haven&#x27;t been able to grow nails that don&#x27;t break.  I tried the Gena Hoof Lacquer hoping for my nails to start growing without breaking and getting harder.  Was hoping on pretty nails but was not successful in having some.</li>
            <li> My nails are damaged and weak, and they split easily.  I also wash my hands and use hand disinfectant A LOT.  Putting a coat of this product on top of two layers of polish extends the life/look of my polish for 3-4 days, and keeps the color shiny and new looking. ( no fading or chipping).  I apply my own polish at home, and use this as my top coat.  It dries quickly, and has no strong odor.</li>
            <li> The o lu top coat I use! Manicures last days longer than normal!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a long time but lately have not been able to find it anywhere but online.  (I use it for my nail --- NOT my horses!!!)</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think it is helping my nails much.  I took my gel nails off ( I wore them since Oct.) and my nail are so thin. I will keep trying it, maybe it takes a while.</li>
            <li> A girl I work with got me some of this a year ago. I LOVE it! It makes your polish look like gel polish without going to the salon!</li>
            <li> it made my nails look a little healtyer plus it made my regular nails shine more if i did not want any finger nail polish on them</li>
