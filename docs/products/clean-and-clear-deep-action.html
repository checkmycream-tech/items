            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for 4 years and still love using it!</li>
            <li>The tingly feel is amazing but is just a sign of your skin being irritated.</li>
            <li>But it keeps my hair nice.</li>
            <li>Smells nice.  </li>
            <li>Good product at a better price than discount stores unless you have a coupon and they have a sale.</li>
            <li>this was a nice deal – I think I remember this being around eight or nine dollars as an add-on</li>
            <li>The tingly feeling it leaves is quite nice as well.</li>
            <li>My face already looks more clear and feels great when you put the cleanser on; it tingles on your skin!</li>
            <li>I used to love using this scrub, it made my skin very clean and smooth - but have since learned it was causing me more problems than good.</li>
            <li>My face is almost acne free!</li>
            <li>This is my all time favorite scrub.</li>
            <li>I love this cleanser</li>
            <li>The best facial cleanser I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I tried many products to no avail.</li>
            <li>It has a nice mint tingle, not too abrasive and light scent.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s refreshing.</li>
            <li>Tingly and satisfying.  </li>
            <li>love it, ordered at 1am</li>
            <li>It might just end up your signature scrub? :)</li>
            <li>I love this face wash.  </li>
            <li>I love how this scrub feels on my face.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s better products out there.</li>
            <li>and I love that it exfoliates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it was about what I would pay at Ralph&#x27;s may be a dollar more ourselves for not having to leave the house – and</li>
            <li>We love it.</li>
            <li>Love this face scrub been using it for years</li>
            <li>Highly Highly RECOMMEND this product!!!!!</li>
            <li>This gives my skin a very clean and cool feeling as it foams!</li>
            <li>The scent is nice and I feel this product is worth the money.</li>
            <li>Face feels very fresh after washing and tingling feeling which feels refreshing.</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li>&quot; feeling as it works, which makes me feel like my face is more clean.  </li>
            <li>It smells a bit strong, but the smell washes away when the soap does and doesn&#x27;t sink into your skin.</li>
            <li>Ive used scrubs that state they are fine, but no, they are just like a face wash and do not exfoliate.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Since im 26yrsold and see some fine lines around my eyes and light ones on my forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This used to be my very favorite face wash, but since they had to change the formula to be more environmentally friendly, there is really nothing in there that exfoliates the skin the way it used to -- it also just doesn&#x27;t feel as cool and clean when you&#x27;re through.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin cool and clean!</li>
            <li>Overall, great exfoliating scrub.</li>
            <li>Fantastic stuff.</li>
            <li>My daughters love this scrub and it seems to help them maintain a clear complexion which is nice.  </li>
            <li>Been using this for about a week now and is keeping my face clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>It gives you that nice, cool tingle that really feels like it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels clean.  </li>
            <li>Great for oily skin and doesn&#x27;t dry.</li>
            <li>Love the tingly minty feeling and cream seems to absorb better after cleansing with clean and clear.</li>
            <li>face stays clean and gives me no problems when i stay using that combo.</li>
            <li>Makes your face feel really clean afterwards.</li>
            <li>Cleans the pores and keeps it clean.</li>
            <li>It removes all of my makeup and my face always feels so clean after I use it.</li>
            <li>Clean and Clear makes amazing products.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my face feeling super clean and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li>Its super faithful to me in getting the job done.</li>
            <li>Quick face scrub before showing and before bed and problem solved.</li>
            <li>They actually require you to use the product more often so that you spend more money.</li>
            <li>For example like the exfoliating scrub clinique sells is extra fine but not harsh and it does a great job....</li>
            <li>/&gt;The grains on this scrub is fine, It is not extra fine where its harsh on your skin, for me its quite perfect.</li>
            <li>I love how it makes your face feel super fresh after you wash your face, the only thing that I don&#x27;t love is that it drys out my face after</li>
            <li>May work for more normal skin types but it just didn&#x27;t work for my skin type.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite Clean &amp; Clear face wash.</li>
            <li>Works great as i can feel it scrubbing down at my face.</li>
            <li>It is much better than clean and clear&#x27;s blackhead scrub and cream cleanser.</li>
            <li>When I first starting using this exfoliator, I loved the way it felt on my face.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the exfoliating scrubbers in this face wash and the smell is very intoxicating, sort of wakes you up.  </li>
            <li>Made my skin look hella fresh and haven&#x27;t broke out in weeks.</li>
            <li>Look for a more natural scrub.</li>
            <li>My face really feels clean when using this scrub....</li>
            <li>It is very scrubby and leaves your face feeling tingly and clean.</li>
            <li>Then scrub with more water and bare hands.  </li>
            <li>Then add more scrub stuff in bare hands and</li>
            <li>This product has my face very clear and smooth.</li>
            <li>I use the deep action cream cleanser which I love because it gives you that tingle feeling and just makes your face feel so fresh and clean and would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased this scrub in hopes to better my complexion.</li>
            <li>My daughter and I love this facial scrub.</li>
            <li>so I try to use it pretty regularily.</li>
            <li>Love this facial scrub.</li>
            <li>what so ever, it actually dryed out my face even more than what it is now.(yes</li>
            <li>I have purchased products from Origins, Aveeno, Clearasil, and Oil of Olay, and I am pleased to report that this product satisfies just as any that I have used from the aforementioned brands.</li>
            <li>really good for destroying dirt and oil</li>
            <li>product achieves exactly what I had hoped - clean, clear skin!</li>
            <li>This is the only face wash I have found that really scrubs my face and makes my face feel clean and smooth after.........  </li>
            <li>dry with a clean towel and then enjoy and don&#x27;t rouch your face for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li>It actually makes my face feel super cleansed and clean, and it seems to work well.</li>
            <li>Companies put plastic microbeads in products like this because they are less effective than mineral abrasives.</li>
            <li>But like i said they are not extra fine grains.</li>
            <li>it just helps clean oily skin and prevents any new blemishes.so far I like this product .</li>
            <li>My whole family now uses it.</li>
            <li>It really cleans our skin and leaves</li>
            <li>After a while, I noticed that my face was much clearer than it had ever been before.</li>
            <li>I really like this</li>
            <li>(makes it easier to travel with)- I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Now,  Im just looking for a good moisturizer to fight wrinkles and keep my skin firm and young looking.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been able to clear up 6 ingrown hairs simply by exfoliating.</li>
            <li>It is effective at getting rid of acne as well as dead skin.</li>
            <li>But, I like to put it on my cheeks and chin daily, and this makes them super smooth and reduces redness/ generally bumpy areas!</li>
            <li>Although my face is left feeling clean and fresh, it still wasn&#x27;t clear.</li>
            <li>So deep it&#x27;ll clean your bones.</li>
            <li>I primarily use this for my nose, which can get down right grimmey at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin though and certain make-up and</li>
            <li>Decided to try a new face cleanser, and this product did justice!</li>
            <li>I began to get pimples on my face in my older years.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Leaves your face feeling crazy clean - I use this every few days and I am very happy with how it has cleared up my skin.</li>
            <li>My new way to wash my face.</li>
            <li>, thought I was going to die but left my face incredibly smooth 10/10 would still recommend despite the pain and will continue using daily</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have used this product (Clean &amp; Clear Deep Action Exfoliating Scrub) for at least 5 years now, and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m young (not saying my age) and I&#x27;m already breaking out!</li>
            <li>, I have used several other scrubs which where OK</li>
            <li>I could feel the icy cool exfoliant working when I rubbed it in.</li>
            <li>first then proceeded to use this deep action scrub.</li>
            <li>Ive tried st ives, loreal scrubs, mint julep, and other clean and clear newer products.</li>
            <li>I remember it was a very decent deal financially</li>
            <li>It keeps my face soft and removes all impurities.</li>
            <li>I also have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Happy with it so far.</li>
            <li>I use this product quite frequently.</li>
            <li>Really like the feeling I get from the scrub.....will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li>I am 19 years old and have suffered from acne since I was 12.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried various products, from cheap to expensive, and this is by far my favorite scrub.</li>
            <li>Really cleans out my pores especially my problem area around my nose.</li>
            <li>It really makes it feel like your skin is getting a deep cleaning.</li>
            <li>I have pretty dry skin near my nose/forehead(general t-zone area), so I can&#x27;t apply it there.</li>
            <li>this does a great job of really getting your face Gradien clean and helping with the ugly situation – I don&#x27;t know if it works for people with serious problems but for me</li>
            <li>After a while, you get kind of tired of paying $11 for face wash, so I decided to finally make the switch.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t dry up my face and it helps with any new blemishes.but it doesn&#x27;t take away old acne</li>
            <li>Clean and clear not only works on teens but also works on adults with excessively oily skin.</li>
            <li>use cetaphil face wash 10oz for Oily skin and this product and for occasional acne break outs Stride X pads for sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>With the deep action exfoliating scrub, I never have to worry about that.</li>
            <li>If your skin is sensitive only use it 1-2x&#x27;s a week.</li>
            <li>I am super disappointed that I didn&#x27;t stock up on more of the old formula before they changed it.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and the deep action bead, ill be buying this again.</li>
            <li>He has a naturally oily face so this doesn&#x27;t dry his skin out.</li>

            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li> &quot; feeling as it works, which makes me feel like my face is more clean.  </li>
            <li> It smells a bit strong, but the smell washes away when the soap does and doesn&#x27;t sink into your skin.</li>
            <li> Ive used scrubs that state they are fine, but no, they are just like a face wash and do not exfoliate.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Since im 26yrsold and see some fine lines around my eyes and light ones on my forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This used to be my very favorite face wash, but since they had to change the formula to be more environmentally friendly, there is really nothing in there that exfoliates the skin the way it used to -- it also just doesn&#x27;t feel as cool and clean when you&#x27;re through.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin cool and clean!</li>
            <li> Overall, great exfoliating scrub.</li>
            <li> Fantastic stuff.</li>
            <li> My daughters love this scrub and it seems to help them maintain a clear complexion which is nice.  </li>
            <li> Been using this for about a week now and is keeping my face clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> It gives you that nice, cool tingle that really feels like it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels clean.  </li>
            <li> Great for oily skin and doesn&#x27;t dry.</li>
            <li> Love the tingly minty feeling and cream seems to absorb better after cleansing with clean and clear.</li>
            <li> face stays clean and gives me no problems when i stay using that combo.</li>
            <li> Makes your face feel really clean afterwards.</li>
            <li> Cleans the pores and keeps it clean.</li>
            <li> It removes all of my makeup and my face always feels so clean after I use it.</li>
            <li> Clean and Clear makes amazing products.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling super clean and refreshed.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li> Its super faithful to me in getting the job done.</li>
            <li> Quick face scrub before showing and before bed and problem solved.</li>
            <li> They actually require you to use the product more often so that you spend more money.</li>
            <li> For example like the exfoliating scrub clinique sells is extra fine but not harsh and it does a great job....</li>
            <li> /&gt;The grains on this scrub is fine, It is not extra fine where its harsh on your skin, for me its quite perfect.</li>
            <li> I love how it makes your face feel super fresh after you wash your face, the only thing that I don&#x27;t love is that it drys out my face after</li>
            <li> May work for more normal skin types but it just didn&#x27;t work for my skin type.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite Clean &amp; Clear face wash.</li>
            <li> Works great as i can feel it scrubbing down at my face.</li>
            <li> It is much better than clean and clear&#x27;s blackhead scrub and cream cleanser.</li>
            <li> When I first starting using this exfoliator, I loved the way it felt on my face.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the exfoliating scrubbers in this face wash and the smell is very intoxicating, sort of wakes you up.  </li>
            <li> Made my skin look hella fresh and haven&#x27;t broke out in weeks.</li>
            <li> Look for a more natural scrub.</li>
            <li> My face really feels clean when using this scrub....</li>
            <li> It is very scrubby and leaves your face feeling tingly and clean.</li>
            <li> Then scrub with more water and bare hands.  </li>
            <li> Then add more scrub stuff in bare hands and</li>
            <li> This product has my face very clear and smooth.</li>
            <li> I use the deep action cream cleanser which I love because it gives you that tingle feeling and just makes your face feel so fresh and clean and would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this scrub in hopes to better my complexion.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I love this facial scrub.</li>
            <li> so I try to use it pretty regularily.</li>
            <li> Love this facial scrub.</li>
            <li> what so ever, it actually dryed out my face even more than what it is now.(yes</li>
            <li> I have purchased products from Origins, Aveeno, Clearasil, and Oil of Olay, and I am pleased to report that this product satisfies just as any that I have used from the aforementioned brands.</li>
            <li> really good for destroying dirt and oil</li>
            <li> product achieves exactly what I had hoped - clean, clear skin!</li>
            <li> This is the only face wash I have found that really scrubs my face and makes my face feel clean and smooth after.........  </li>
            <li> dry with a clean towel and then enjoy and don&#x27;t rouch your face for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> It actually makes my face feel super cleansed and clean, and it seems to work well.</li>
            <li> Companies put plastic microbeads in products like this because they are less effective than mineral abrasives.</li>
            <li> But like i said they are not extra fine grains.</li>
            <li> it just helps clean oily skin and prevents any new blemishes.so far I like this product .</li>
            <li> My whole family now uses it.</li>
            <li> It really cleans our skin and leaves</li>
            <li> After a while, I noticed that my face was much clearer than it had ever been before.</li>
            <li> I really like this</li>
            <li> (makes it easier to travel with)- I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Now,  Im just looking for a good moisturizer to fight wrinkles and keep my skin firm and young looking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been able to clear up 6 ingrown hairs simply by exfoliating.</li>
            <li> It is effective at getting rid of acne as well as dead skin.</li>
            <li> But, I like to put it on my cheeks and chin daily, and this makes them super smooth and reduces redness/ generally bumpy areas!</li>
            <li> Although my face is left feeling clean and fresh, it still wasn&#x27;t clear.</li>
            <li> So deep it&#x27;ll clean your bones.</li>
            <li> I primarily use this for my nose, which can get down right grimmey at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin though and certain make-up and</li>
            <li> Decided to try a new face cleanser, and this product did justice!</li>
            <li> I began to get pimples on my face in my older years.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Leaves your face feeling crazy clean - I use this every few days and I am very happy with how it has cleared up my skin.</li>
            <li> My new way to wash my face.</li>
            <li> , thought I was going to die but left my face incredibly smooth 10/10 would still recommend despite the pain and will continue using daily</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have used this product (Clean &amp; Clear Deep Action Exfoliating Scrub) for at least 5 years now, and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m young (not saying my age) and I&#x27;m already breaking out!</li>
            <li> , I have used several other scrubs which where OK</li>
            <li> I could feel the icy cool exfoliant working when I rubbed it in.</li>
            <li> first then proceeded to use this deep action scrub.</li>
            <li> Ive tried st ives, loreal scrubs, mint julep, and other clean and clear newer products.</li>
            <li> I remember it was a very decent deal financially</li>
            <li> It keeps my face soft and removes all impurities.</li>
            <li> I also have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> I use this product quite frequently.</li>
            <li> Really like the feeling I get from the scrub.....will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I am 19 years old and have suffered from acne since I was 12.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried various products, from cheap to expensive, and this is by far my favorite scrub.</li>
            <li> Really cleans out my pores especially my problem area around my nose.</li>
            <li> It really makes it feel like your skin is getting a deep cleaning.</li>
            <li> I have pretty dry skin near my nose/forehead(general t-zone area), so I can&#x27;t apply it there.</li>
            <li> this does a great job of really getting your face Gradien clean and helping with the ugly situation – I don&#x27;t know if it works for people with serious problems but for me</li>
            <li> After a while, you get kind of tired of paying $11 for face wash, so I decided to finally make the switch.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t dry up my face and it helps with any new blemishes.but it doesn&#x27;t take away old acne</li>
            <li> Clean and clear not only works on teens but also works on adults with excessively oily skin.</li>
            <li> use cetaphil face wash 10oz for Oily skin and this product and for occasional acne break outs Stride X pads for sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> With the deep action exfoliating scrub, I never have to worry about that.</li>
            <li> If your skin is sensitive only use it 1-2x&#x27;s a week.</li>
            <li> I am super disappointed that I didn&#x27;t stock up on more of the old formula before they changed it.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the deep action bead, ill be buying this again.</li>
            <li> He has a naturally oily face so this doesn&#x27;t dry his skin out.</li>
            <li> It has that cool, tingly feeling that assures you it&#x27;s doing at least something!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it that long, so will need to see how my face reacts to using it regularly.</li>
            <li> My skin is smoother and I have far less breakouts.</li>
            <li> Use your bare hands and scrub this stuff into your facial skin with a little water.  </li>
            <li> I have tried ALL kinds of face wash from cheap stuff to expensive stuff like proactive.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> The only thing you need to be careful of is using it too often.</li>
            <li> Finally, uses lots of water and a wet wash cloth to remove all the junk.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other brands, but I always go back to this one.</li>
            <li> I have tried using other products off and on, but always end up coming back to this exfoliating scrub.</li>
            <li> Mine is not oily so if I use this too often it will dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry</li>
            <li> We use moisturizer afterwards because it may leave our skin dry at times.</li>
            <li> This stuff works wonders on the face; I have a dry skin problem on the forehead and this takes care of that.</li>
            <li> When I have to buy something else, I notice my face gets dry all the time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got irritating ingredients such as menthol, which can make acne worse instead of better.</li>
            <li> $6 / bottle at my local chain-grocery, buying a 2-pack here for less than $10 was a no-brainer.  </li>
            <li> It helps with black heads and white heads.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend says this one does not dry his face out like the green bottle does.</li>
            <li> Those plastic microbeads are terrible for the environment and are causing a lot of problems in the Great Lakes.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend uses it every day while I can only use it every few days.</li>
            <li> After being on Accutane a few years ago, I&#x27;ve always stuck to Cetaphil as it was the only thing that didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at the time.</li>
            <li> As expected and on time.</li>
            <li> Love this product and how simple it has made the exfoliating process that prevents the annoying and itchy ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> Just be VERY careful you don&#x27;t get the little tiny scrub particles in your eyes.    </li>
            <li> The only bad thing I have to say is don&#x27;t apply it to freshly shaved legs!</li>
            <li> I found that you could use crushed Tylenol mixed with a little water to make an exfoliating paste (sounds odd, but it works, Google it).</li>
            <li> It also does not leave a film on your skin like other cleansers do.</li>
            <li> I need my other 1 please.</li>
            <li> It also leave your face felling cold and fresh after your done washing your face.</li>
            <li> Not sure how long product will be in stores since environmentalists  want all products with the &amp;#34;cleansing beads&amp;#34; off the market.</li>
            <li> and it just goes down the drain</li>
            <li> This was odd, since I never had pimples during my lifetime.</li>
            <li> i did notice a slight film on my face.</li>
            <li> certainly less hassle to buy</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wanna say oily, but not really clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had dark blemishes on my cheek for over a year now and after using this for not even a week, they are already going away!</li>
            <li> The little exfoliating beads in the scrub work wonders on my acne-prone skin.  </li>
            <li> Almost all of my acne was cured within a little over a week.</li>
            <li> After I dried my face off</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased these a few times.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday</li>
            <li> It removes black heads and makeup!</li>
            <li> Blackheads are a thing of the past.</li>
            <li> I usually have problems</li>
            <li> It has small beads in it to help exfoliate and leaves a \\&quot;tingly\\</li>
            <li> I have always had at least some issues with acne at all times.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s not very convenient and it would get expensive</li>
            <li> Still struggling with acne in my late 20s</li>
            <li> Lately they had gotten worse and I started searching for a way to prevent them.</li>
            <li> If you have really sensitive skin like mine and hate Benzoyl Peroxide (screw you, ProActiv), then try this face wash.</li>
            <li> The new formula is really terrible.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday, and I don&#x27;t get any bad reactions.</li>
            <li> It also has microbeads which are horrible for the environment as they are tiny pieces of plastic that end up in the ocean, and in turn are ingested by the fish that we eat.  </li>
            <li> I feel awkward talking about face wash</li>
            <li> Sad day :(</li>
            <li> They say the beads are bad for ecosystem.</li>

            <li> Decided to try a new face cleanser, and this product did justice! I&#x27;ve had dark blemishes on my cheek for over a year now and after using this for not even a week, they are already going away! My face is almost acne free!</li>

            <li> Made my skin look hella fresh and haven&#x27;t broke out in weeks.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser it doesn&#x27;t dry up my face and it helps with any new blemishes.but it doesn&#x27;t take away old acne it just helps clean oily skin and prevents any new blemishes.so far I like this product . Great for oily skin and doesn&#x27;t dry.</li>
            <li> The best facial cleanser I have ever used. I began to get pimples on my face in my older years. This was odd, since I never had pimples during my lifetime. I tried many products to no avail. I also have sensitive skin. This product has my face very clear and smooth. My whole family now uses it.</li>
            <li> Leaves your face feeling crazy clean - I use this every few days and I am very happy with how it has cleared up my skin.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite Clean &amp; Clear face wash. It smells great and works wonderfully. The only thing you need to be careful of is using it too often. My boyfriend uses it every day while I can only use it every few days. He has a naturally oily face so this doesn&#x27;t dry his skin out. Mine is not oily so if I use this too often it will dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> It feels very refreshing on my face! Totally loved it!</li>
            <li> This is our go to daily scrub. It has a nice mint tingle, not too abrasive and light scent.</li>
            <li> I have used this product (Clean &amp; Clear Deep Action Exfoliating Scrub) for at least 5 years now, and I love it.  The little exfoliating beads in the scrub work wonders on my acne-prone skin.  It&#x27;s a great way to wake up in the morning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At $6 / bottle at my local chain-grocery, buying a 2-pack here for less than $10 was a no-brainer.  Looks like the price has changed since I ordered it, so buyer-beware, but I love!</li>
            <li> I got this on a whim buy and I&#x27;m so glad I did! It immediately started clearing up my skin on my chest, shoulders, and back. I could feel the icy cool exfoliant working when I rubbed it in. The only bad thing I have to say is don&#x27;t apply it to freshly shaved legs! Owch! Other than that it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this scrub in hopes to better my complexion. I have to say I am very pleased with the results I am getting three weeks into using it. My skin is smoother and I have far less breakouts. Blackheads are a thing of the past. VERY PLEASED!</li>
            <li> This gives my skin a very clean and cool feeling as it foams!</li>
            <li> Works great. Doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry and it&#x27;s refreshing.</li>
            <li> It works and feels good when used.  Tingly and satisfying.  Just be VERY careful you don&#x27;t get the little tiny scrub particles in your eyes.    Try this...  Use your bare hands and scrub this stuff into your facial skin with a little water.  Then scrub with more water and bare hands.  Then add more scrub stuff in bare hands and then a tiny bit of water in hands to activate.  Finally, uses lots of water and a wet wash cloth to remove all the junk.  Afterwards blot your face and neck ( yeah, use it on your neck!) dry with a clean towel and then enjoy and don&#x27;t rouch your face for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> I have tried ALL kinds of face wash from cheap stuff to expensive stuff like proactive.&lt;br /&gt;This is the only face wash that has worked for me. It leaves my skin cool and clean! It also does not leave a film on your skin like other cleansers do. Highly Highly RECOMMEND this product!!!!!</li>
            <li> love it, ordered at 1am arrived at 130pm.such a good deal</li>
            <li> Unbearable pain, thought I was going to die but left my face incredibly smooth 10/10 would still recommend despite the pain and will continue using daily</li>
            <li> Works great as i can feel it scrubbing down at my face. It also leave your face felling cold and fresh after your done washing your face.</li>
            <li> Been using this for about a week now and is keeping my face clean and smooth. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Although my face is left feeling clean and fresh, it still wasn&#x27;t clear.</li>
            <li> After being on Accutane a few years ago, I&#x27;ve always stuck to Cetaphil as it was the only thing that didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at the time. Out of habit, I just stayed on Cetaphil. After a while, you get kind of tired of paying $11 for face wash, so I decided to finally make the switch. I tried Morning Burst, but it left my face too... I don&#x27;t wanna say oily, but not really clean. This face wash isn&#x27;t the case. It gives you that nice, cool tingle that really feels like it&#x27;s working. My skin&#x27;s actually probably improved since the switch *knock on wood*.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy with it so far. If you have really sensitive skin like mine and hate Benzoyl Peroxide (screw you, ProActiv), then try this face wash.</li>
            <li> I bought the pack of 2 of this product and only received 1. I need my other 1 please.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I love this facial scrub. It really cleans our skin and leaves it refreshed in the morning and night. We use moisturizer afterwards because it may leave our skin dry at times. Otherwise, a great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m young (not saying my age) and I&#x27;m already breaking out! But I&#x27;m to embarrass to admit it and  so I couldn&#x27;t ask my mom for stuff so I&#x27;m here on amizon getting face wash.😂🙌.  And I Hurd this is AMAZING! So imma try it</li>
            <li> Good value for a two pack and cheaper then buying it in the store. Face feels very fresh after washing and tingling feeling which feels refreshing.</li>
            <li> This stuff works wonders on the face; I have a dry skin problem on the forehead and this takes care of that. And I didn&#x27;t even know I would recieve two; added bonus, will buy again!</li>
            <li> As expected and on time. No complaints.</li>
            <li> This is my favourite scrub. It removes black heads and makeup! I have tried other brands, but I always go back to this one.</li>
            <li> Clean and Clear makes amazing products.  Clean and clear not only works on teens but also works on adults with excessively oily skin.</li>
            <li> This just didn&#x27;t cut it for my skin. I use the deep action cream cleanser which I love because it gives you that tingle feeling and just makes your face feel so fresh and clean and would recommend to anyone. So i used my cream cleanser first then proceeded to use this deep action scrub. The scrub does give you that tingle feeling but I feel like this product didn&#x27;t exfoliate my oily acne prone skin enough. After I dried my face off i did notice a slight film on my face. May work for more normal skin types but it just didn&#x27;t work for my skin type. Such a bummer!</li>
            <li> Have been using this cleanser for years. I&#x27;m a fan. Leaves my face feeling super clean and refreshed.  Love the tingly minty feeling and cream seems to absorb better after cleansing with clean and clear.</li>
            <li> My favorite face wash!!</li>
            <li> The new formula is really terrible. This used to be my very favorite face wash, but since they had to change the formula to be more environmentally friendly, there is really nothing in there that exfoliates the skin the way it used to -- it also just doesn&#x27;t feel as cool and clean when you&#x27;re through. I am super disappointed that I didn&#x27;t stock up on more of the old formula before they changed it. Sad day :(</li>
            <li> My daughters love this scrub and it seems to help them maintain a clear complexion which is nice.  I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> this scrub just refreshes your skin and senses and exfoliates so well. I havent recieved my order yet. But i always buy this scrub and come back to it. Its super faithful to me in getting the job done. Ive tried st ives, loreal scrubs, mint julep, and other clean and clear newer products. They all make me break out and make my skin feel unbalanced. This scrub never does that.&lt;br /&gt;I use cetaphil face wash 10oz for Oily skin and this product and for occasional acne break outs Stride X pads for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;My face stays clean and gives me no problems when i stay using that combo. So, this works for me and i will stick to it. Now,  Im just looking for a good moisturizer to fight wrinkles and keep my skin firm and young looking. Since im 26yrsold and see some fine lines around my eyes and light ones on my forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The grains on this scrub is fine, It is not extra fine where its harsh on your skin, for me its quite perfect. Ive used scrubs that state they are fine, but no, they are just like a face wash and do not exfoliate.&lt;br /&gt;This one gets the job done. But like i said they are not extra fine grains. For example like the exfoliating scrub clinique sells is extra fine but not harsh and it does a great job....but compare this to clinques price? And this one is just as good and is in the budget lol.&lt;br /&gt;So, try it. It might just end up your signature scrub? :)</li>
            <li> Great product! I&#x27;ve purchased these a few times. Use every time in the shower. Makes your face feel really clean afterwards. I have very sensitive skin and this doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li> I have always had at least some issues with acne at all times. When I first starting using this exfoliator, I loved the way it felt on my face. After a while, I noticed that my face was much clearer than it had ever been before. Now, the only time I don&#x27;t use it is when I can&#x27;t find it at the grocery store. When I have to buy something else, I notice my face gets dry all the time. With the deep action exfoliating scrub, I never have to worry about that. This is the only product I want to use on my face. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li> love the post-wash tingle!</li>
            <li> I primarily use this for my nose, which can get down right grimmey at the end of the day. Cleans the pores and keeps it clean.</li>
            <li> After using this product for about a week my skin was noticeably a lot softer and smoother. Almost all of my acne was cured within a little over a week. I will definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> So deep it&#x27;ll clean your bones.</li>
            <li> I love this face wash.  Use it everyday and I swear by it.  This is the only face wash I have found that really scrubs my face and makes my face feel clean and smooth after.........  I feel awkward talking about face wash this must but this stuff works!!  Buy it, use it, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> I use this product quite frequently. It seems to work. When I stop using it I usually have problems so I try to use it pretty regularily.</li>
            <li> Really like the feeling I get from the scrub.....will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> My face really feels clean when using this scrub....and I love the tingly feeling it gives you! Haven&#x27;t used it that long, so will need to see how my face reacts to using it regularly.</li>
            <li> I love how this scrub feels on my face. It does leave a tingling feeling on your face after you washes it. It helps with black heads and white heads. I will definitely purchased again.</li>
            <li> Good product at a better price than discount stores unless you have a coupon and they have a sale. Not sure how long product will be in stores since environmentalists  want all products with the &amp;#34;cleansing beads&amp;#34; off the market. They say the beads are bad for ecosystem. Whatever..</li>
            <li> Great non-prescription product.</li>
            <li> I am 19 years old and have suffered from acne since I was 12. I&#x27;ve tried various products, from cheap to expensive, and this is by far my favorite scrub. I use it everyday, and I don&#x27;t get any bad reactions. It removes all of my makeup and my face always feels so clean after I use it. It is much better than clean and clear&#x27;s blackhead scrub and cream cleanser. The best part is that it does not even contain salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide and it still gets the job done. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this face wash for years. It is very scrubby and leaves your face feeling tingly and clean. I have tried using other products off and on, but always end up coming back to this exfoliating scrub. The scent is nice and I feel this product is worth the money.</li>
            <li> I love how it makes your face feel super fresh after you wash your face, the only thing that I don&#x27;t love is that it drys out my face after</li>
            <li> Love this facial scrub. Really cleans out my pores especially my problem area around my nose.</li>
            <li> This is a good face scrub.  I have been using it for years with good results.  It has small beads in it to help exfoliate and leaves a \\&quot;tingly\\&quot; feeling as it works, which makes me feel like my face is more clean.  It smells a bit strong, but the smell washes away when the soap does and doesn&#x27;t sink into your skin.</li>
            <li> I used to love using this scrub, it made my skin very clean and smooth - but have since learned it was causing me more problems than good. It&#x27;s got irritating ingredients such as menthol, which can make acne worse instead of better. The tingly feel is amazing but is just a sign of your skin being irritated. It also has microbeads which are horrible for the environment as they are tiny pieces of plastic that end up in the ocean, and in turn are ingested by the fish that we eat.  There&#x27;s better products out there.</li>
            <li> Fantastic stuff. I&#x27;ve suffered with ingrown hairs on my face for years. Lately they had gotten worse and I started searching for a way to prevent them. After some Google searching I found out that exfoliating is the best defense against ingrown hairs. I found that you could use crushed Tylenol mixed with a little water to make an exfoliating paste (sounds odd, but it works, Google it). That worked wonders in only 2 days (twice a day and using deep hydrating soap after to wash face). However, it&#x27;s not very convenient and it would get expensive lol. I found this and figured I&#x27;d give it a try. It&#x27;s worked perfectly, in fact, better than the Tylenol. I&#x27;ve been able to clear up 6 ingrown hairs simply by exfoliating. As of now, about 5 days in, I have no ingrown hairs that I can see or that are itchy and red. Quick face scrub before showing and before bed and problem solved. Wish I would have researched this years ago now. Love this product and how simple it has made the exfoliating process that prevents the annoying and itchy ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> a cheaper alternative to Proactiv face cleaner and certainly less hassle to buy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try this one time and see if you do not agree</li>
            <li> I really like this, I have used several other scrubs which where OK but this one works for my type of skin.  Everyone has different skin so give it a try it may or may not work for you.  I do recommend you give it a try.</li>
            <li> The only cleanser that gets all of my makeup off with one cleaning. I&#x27;ve tried LOTS of brands but this one is the best.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product on Amazon and have not tried is before.  I really enjoy the exfoliating scrubbers in this face wash and the smell is very intoxicating, sort of wakes you up.  It&#x27;s a great buy and good product to purchase.</li>
            <li> Companies put plastic microbeads in products like this because they are less effective than mineral abrasives. They actually require you to use the product more often so that you spend more money. Those plastic microbeads are terrible for the environment and are causing a lot of problems in the Great Lakes. Look for a more natural scrub. Also, the companies mightwrite that their product is biodegradable, but apparently it is only biodegradable if it gets heated in a compost pile. Not going to happen when we use a scrub and it just goes down the drain an out to sea.&lt;br /&gt;http://usresponserestoration.wordpress.com/2012/03/30/what-is-plastic-doing-in-my-face-scrub/&lt;br /&gt;https://news.vice.com/article/plastic-microbeads-from-body-wash-are-contaminating-the-great-lakes?utm_source&#x3D;vicenewsfb</li>
            <li> I get a bump every now and then when I&#x27;m stressed. I have very sensitive skin though and certain make-up and cleansers make my skin break out in a rash. This product has been very good to my skin and I love that it exfoliates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the description it read that it gives a tingling feel which I love! It really makes it feel like your skin is getting a deep cleaning. I also like that the packaging isn&#x27;t a pump (makes it easier to travel with)- I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> this was a nice deal – I think I remember this being around eight or nine dollars as an add-on – I&#x27;m remembering here – either way I remember it was a very decent deal financially it was about what I would pay at Ralph&#x27;s may be a dollar more ourselves for not having to leave the house – and this does a great job of really getting your face Gradien clean and helping with the ugly situation – I don&#x27;t know if it works for people with serious problems but for me if I use it to three times a week</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product! I just saw no difference with my face what so ever, it actually dryed out my face even more than what it is now.(yes, I moisturize too) you can always find something else, but this just did not work for me</li>
            <li> Works great to wash your face with! My face already looks more clear and feels great when you put the cleanser on; it tingles on your skin!</li>
            <li> Great face wash! I&#x27;ve been using it for 4 years and still love using it!</li>
            <li> My wife and I both use this product ever day or two. I use is on my neck and face and my wife uses it on her face and legs. Once we got into the routine we&#x27;ve forgotten what pimples look like and a drastiv improvement in acne. We&#x27;ve been using this product for several years.</li>
            <li> This is a great scrub. It has that cool, tingly feeling that assures you it&#x27;s doing at least something! I have pretty dry skin near my nose/forehead(general t-zone area), so I can&#x27;t apply it there. But, I like to put it on my cheeks and chin daily, and this makes them super smooth and reduces redness/ generally bumpy areas! This product is for anyone who has normal/oily skin!</li>
            <li> This is a staple for my husband and I and it is the only face wash we will use. It is effective at getting rid of acne as well as dead skin. If your skin is sensitive only use it 1-2x&#x27;s a week. We love it.</li>
            <li> Love this face scrub been using it for years</li>
            <li> Very refreshing menthol scent. Great for waking up in the morning. Gives you that tingly feeling(refreshing). Has a ton of the exfoliating beads in it. My boyfriend says this one does not dry his face out like the green bottle does.</li>
            <li> Still struggling with acne in my late 20s but this stuff keeps it at bay. Exfoliates and gets out the grime.</li>
            <li> I have run the gamut on self-care products. I have purchased products from Origins, Aveeno, Clearasil, and Oil of Olay, and I am pleased to report that this product satisfies just as any that I have used from the aforementioned brands. This exfoliating scrub penetrates all makeup, dirt and oils on my face, only requires one application, and even removes the vast majority of my mascara. The tingly feeling it leaves is quite nice as well. For best results, I use astringent to finish the job (and remove any remaining mascara), and then moisturize my face afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product achieves exactly what I had hoped - clean, clear skin!</li>
