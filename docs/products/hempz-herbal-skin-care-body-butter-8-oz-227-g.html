            <li>a nice girl at the Body Shop in Lisbon</li>
            <li>the smell of the Hempz product is just as nice.</li>
            <li>This is a good product but the hemp butter made by Moist &amp; sold by Sally Beauty Products was much better.</li>
            <li>I used it on my face and am thrilled with it.</li>
            <li>--it has a nice scent and consistency.  </li>
            <li>but it is a nice change.</li>
            <li>Great scent plus rich and creamy texture.  </li>
            <li>Great product, as is the original hemp lotion.</li>
            <li>love the Hempz Herbal Body butter gives your body a very smooth texture, loved it&lt;br /&gt;RECOMMEND</li>
            <li>It has a light, pleasant fragrance that can be worn with just about any perfume.  </li>
            <li>Great smell, and super moisturizing.</li>
            <li>but the smell is very strong and the smell does not seem to fade.  </li>
            <li>rich and creamy and love the scent light but very pleasant.  </li>
            <li>I liked them more then</li>
            <li>I used, and loved, the original lotion, so I thought I would give this a try.</li>
            <li>I am a guy and just wanted a nice strong lotion</li>
            <li>It absorbs easily and smells so nice  - at work</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful and the nice scent lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li>This a great product and provides great moisturizing to hands and feet in the dry winter months.  </li>

            <li>I love this stuff.</li>

            <li>Love this lotion and have already ordered another bottle.  </li>
            <li>I absolutly love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>My favorite body butter - I use it every day.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been in love with it ever since.  </li>
            <li>My feet love it, as it seems to absorb well and not leave a greasy feeling, but does feel moisturized.</li>
            <li>i wash my hands 10 or more times per day, and take up to 5 showers in a day.</li>
            <li>I shower at night ,put my body better on , in the morning</li>
            <li>Palmers Shea Butter from Walmart works better than this lotion.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this product as there are better alternatives.</li>
            <li>We have tried many products...</li>
            <li>We might end this problem...  :)</li>
            <li>I have given this as gifts many times and everyone loves it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite moisturizer to use on my cheeks/neck after a shave/shower.</li>
            <li>i didn&#x27;t know where to find more</li>
            <li>same great product!!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I believe this body butter is better than any I have tried.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it - it&#x27;s not cloying at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She enjoyed the Hempz foot products as well.</li>
            <li>I have used this for yrs and love how it makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li>This was one of the better body butters I have used.</li>
            <li>I love this body butter....</li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t do any better than this product line...</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Does not leave a greasy residue like most.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Most lotions have petroleum in them.</li>
            <li>It is rich, smells nice, but does not have SPF protection.  </li>
            <li>The butter seems very cheap, the smell is so strong and overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>I loved it very much</li>
            <li>It is super effective.  </li>
            <li>I was beyond impressed since my skin is normally so dry that I need to keep moisturizer on me and reapply throughout the day in order to avoid flaky skin on my face.</li>
            <li>very soft and smells great</li>
            <li>Smells good, really feels wonderful on dry skin.  </li>
            <li>This is easily one of the best products to use on dry hands.  </li>
            <li>It does have a lovely, light scent.  </li>
            <li>At 62 years old, I look great.</li>
            <li>I love how rich it is without being greasy.</li>
            <li>Hempz body butter is more like a rich body cream, with a lighter whipped feeling.</li>
            <li>I use the original body lotion by Hempz and love it.</li>
            <li>While some men might be scared off by anything with jasmine in it, I wouldn&#x27;t classify it as a floral scent at all and could easily be considered unisex.</li>
            <li>Read some reviews that  indicated this product had a strong smell.  </li>
            <li>But I do know some women prefer strongly scented body moisturizers in lieu of perfume, so this probably wouldn&#x27;t work for them.</li>
            <li>This body butter also has very good long term moisturizing capabilities, keeping my skin feeling moisturized all day.</li>
            <li>10 days later, my heels were perfectly beautiful.  </li>
            <li>I also noticed that it&#x27;s very good at repairing dry, cracked skin on my feet.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and blends in easily.</li>
            <li>Great price for the size and would definitely buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li>My wife likes the butter go on smooth and not too greasy.</li>
            <li>I have been buying this wonderful lotion for a few years.</li>
            <li>Wish the scent was more powerful.</li>
            <li>enjoy the fragrance of this product.</li>
            <li>Smells light and never greasy.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t mind the wax and enjoy the result of it</li>
            <li>The second one I have purchased, a great skin reconditioning cream.....</li>
            <li>It smells cheap fruity.</li>
            <li>However I enjoy the smell when I wake up in the morning.</li>
            <li>but it is lightly scented.</li>
            <li>All good, I like her soft.</li>
            <li>It does still have a light scent, but nothing like the original body lotion.</li>
            <li>I love this body butter and only wish it came in the jasmine, peach &amp; wild rose!!</li>
            <li>The cover of the container was cracked, however I was able to salvage the contents which I like very much</li>
            <li>Light, non greasy, absorbed easily.</li>
            <li>I need the extra moisture in the winter months and the body butter works amazing!</li>
            <li>I have used this product over and over again and never disappointed.</li>
            <li>and now it&#x27;s nice and smooth, soft and hydrated!</li>
            <li>I am so excited to find it at this price.  </li>
            <li>When I saw they had the original in body butter</li>
            <li>When it arrived the first thing I noticed is that it didn&#x27;t have that light sweet smell as the original lotion, it had more like a Crisco smell to it.</li>
            <li>super fantastic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great for dry skin and hangnails.</li>
            <li>pleasant, light scent, non-greasy and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>It goes on easily, isn&#x27;t greasy and soaks right in.  </li>
            <li>This is great stuff for very dry skin.  </li>
            <li>This is so great for very dry skin.</li>
            <li>And it smells wonderful, light and subtle, but still fragrant.</li>
            <li>Gave several as gifts.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone who received this product loved it, too.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about their products.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin soft and smell nice.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and I love the product.  </li>
            <li>The scent is mild and clean.</li>
            <li>Not bad at all, just not my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fresh light scent and it absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and leaves the skin feeling soft and silky, with a nice dewy glow to it.</li>
            <li>This stuff is lightly scented, non-greasy and just a good general all-around goop.</li>
            <li>I love the body butter especially after a nice hot shower.</li>
            <li>that dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li>I love this body butter, mainly use on my feet and hands.  </li>
            <li>Quick Ship.  </li>
            <li>The fact that it absorbs in quickly and isn&#x27;t greasy is also a plus.</li>
            <li>Lid came cracked on my last order, but otherwise I love this product!</li>
            <li>I  thought how wonderful to have this for my extra dry skin in the winter.</li>
            <li>It smells like cheap perfume so you have to use it very sparingly if at all.</li>
            <li>Makes skin feel very moisturized and has a light scent, almost fruity</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how good my skin looked, it was moisturized and sorta glowing with absolutely no signs of irritation.</li>
            <li>I immediately ordered my own cream so that I can use it regularly.</li>
            <li>My favorite hand cream; it makes my skin feel soft, without being greasy.</li>
            <li>The scent is fantastically fresh and your skin feels silky.</li>
            <li>soft.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy it again and again worth every penny.</li>
            <li>The Hempz Herbal actually smells nice.</li>
            <li>I love how soft it makes my skin.</li>
            <li>If you want your skin to look soft and glowing and smell good, I totally recommend this!</li>
            <li>should i buy the Body Shop&#x27;s Hemp Body Butter, or is this basically just as good at half the price?</li>
            <li>so, the answer is: this is just as good as the Body Shop&#x27;s product, at half the price.</li>
            <li>As we all know dry winter time skin is on the way this product soothed my skin nicely.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it, specially in the winter months.</li>
            <li>My wife has used a similar product for many years and her skin is very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>This product has always done me good for especially dry skin, which doesn&#x27;t happen very often.</li>
            <li>The product was exactly as described by the seller.</li>
            <li>SO I bought this and WONDERFUL no more itch!!!!</li>
            <li>Personal favorite.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t last and leaves your skin with a healthy glow.  </li>
            <li>Remoisturized and keeps skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Ehh I find the smell to be horrid after the first couple of minutes</li>
            <li>I love the butter especially --</li>
            <li>It is non-greasy and makes your skin feel soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was the jars were all dented on the top and the liners were smashed it.  </li>
            <li>My hands were much softer and had more moisture in them for being the back side of my hands...  </li>
            <li>After only one use, my feet are soft &amp; smell quite nice.</li>
            <li>Overall just a good smelling lotion that you can use on a daily bases.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the scent lingers for a long time.  </li>
            <li>First up, I love hemp products, I have use their body moisturiser for years, its is rich without being greasy and smells great, this is the first time I&#x27;ve use the body butter, so for winter when the cold climate is drying out your skin just that little bit more than normal, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>helps his dry skin better than anything he&#x27;s tried.</li>
            <li>It certainly doesn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li>It is wonderful for regular dry skin,  but really doesn&#x27;t make a difference for extremely dry skin like mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I tried using it several times just to be sure I didn&#x27;t like it - it certainly doesn&#x27;t make my skin soft.  </li>
            <li>I really like the cream.</li>
            <li>yet it is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>The price is so reasonable and I have given as gifts to friends.  </li>
            <li>I tried all types of oils and shea butter to try and moisturize but nothing really worked.</li>
            <li>Also the lotion doesn&#x27;t really moisturize that well.  </li>
            <li>Sits on skin for a while, doesn&#x27;t absorb too fast.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery...</li>
            <li>My  Wife&#x27;s the real reason I bought this... &#x27;</li>
            <li>Coated them generously and covered with light white socks...</li>
            <li>Comes HIGHLY recommended!</li>
            <li>Was shipped extremely fast and works wonders for my skin.</li>
            <li>Item moisturizers very well.</li>
            <li>Minus 2 stars for its overwhelming smell.</li>
            <li>It really helps moisturize my skin.  </li>
            <li>The body butter has a nice \\&quot;organic\\&quot; scent, consisting of some green notes accented by just a hint of floral in the background.</li>
            <li>It has a fresh clean scent that is subtle enough not to interfere with cologne but strong enough to stand on its own.  </li>
            <li>This product along with the original herbal body lotion is the ONLY thing that will help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use about every other day and it keeps my skin healthy.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this product based on other reviews.  </li>
            <li>I just wish it smelled the same as the original.</li>
            <li>I actually feel that it is quite fresh smell when you first put it on</li>
            <li>This product works well on very dry skin &amp; is absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li>so rich, makes my dry, rough skin feel very smooth.  </li>
            <li>I use this on my hands after a rough day and they magically feel brand new.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really care in this case as I normally use fragrance anyhow.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend the true blue spa line by bath and body works.</li>
            <li>I have dry skin, and have used many very expensive products, but I have to say this one is my favorite right now!!!</li>
            <li>the packaging is better with the Hempz (if you remove the body shop logo and put both side-by-side, and were asked to pick the most expensive looking tub, you&#x27;d pick Hempz) .</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is not as long lasting as some of my favorite body butters and doesn&#x27;t seem as intense once I apply it.</li>
            <li>This is nice and thick but not greasy.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this stuff (and HHP if you&#x27;re SUPER dry and chapped).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although this product is rich in moisturizers, the consistency was not quite what I expected.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used lots of other lotions and most you have to reapply shortly after.  </li>
            <li>so it does initially feel a bit oily at first</li>
            <li>I was given a small jar by a friend and once I tried it I had to have more.</li>
            <li>This was my first purchase ever made on Amazon and I will continue to search and purchase items i am looking for in the future.</li>
            <li>The difference was amazing in just one application her skin was almost totally moisturized and very little could be seen of the cracks..  </li>
            <li>Frankly, it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m lazy and didn&#x27;t want to go to the Body Shop at the mall, plus Prime shipping is fast and free.  </li>
            <li>product has no odor and is good for delicate and dry</li>
            <li>I prefer the original since it has less fragrance.  </li>
            <li>It smells good, in an almond-y way, and it is super rich and moisturizing without being terribly greasy.  </li>
            <li>I bought some while travelling home to PA, as a gift for ms 85 year old mother.  </li>
            <li>, you need to reply after washing your hands to stay soft.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have a sore on my leg, and I use this skin care body butter on the sore every night, and the store has improved 50% so far, and I&#x27;m going to keep using it until the sore is gone.  </li>
            <li>It is NOT all natural as some people assume.</li>
            <li>it makes my skin so soft and shiny thank you to the creators of hempz butter</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft.  </li>
            <li>She is the only reason that I pay so much for a jar of lotion.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin so soft without feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li>Has natural healing ingredients, and has no scented oils in it.</li>
            <li>I use it on my whole body, but especially my face and neck.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this product hasn&#x27;t caused any problems for me.</li>
            <li>It is not heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li>It absorbed quite well for a body butter, really wasn&#x27;t too heavy.</li>
            <li>A few days later, my heels looked significantly better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m male and have some minor vascular dermatitis issues and this stuff helps tremendously when combined with the steroid cream I have.</li>
            <li>Note: I live in West Texas where it is really dry and sometimes this product burns when my hands are really in need.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure for people who mildly dry skin it might be enough, but I have VERY dry skin</li>
            <li>It has a subtle but lovely smell to it.</li>
            <li>It is more subtle.</li>
            <li>My older teen son loves this stuff!</li>
            <li>Because of the overwhelming smell I don&#x27;t like to apply it anywhere except my legs and even the only in small amounts.</li>
            <li>I was afraid because it was a good price, that it may be old, but it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>a positive note, it is definitely hydrating for dry skin.</li>
            <li>I generally dont like cream or lotions</li>
            <li>Without the wax this Hempz product would be pretty useless and cheap garbage in my opinion.</li>
            <li>My face in particular was so dry that it was peeling and cracked</li>
            <li>Recently let my my young nephew use it for his eczema, and it healed it almost over night.</li>
            <li>It definitely does the job as far as moisturizing is concerned, and it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, but I&#x27;m just not fond of the smell at all.</li>
            <li>I tried using it several times and was just completely turned off by the scent.</li>
            <li>My skin has NEVER bounced back so quickly and with so little damage from a sunburn.</li>
            <li>I went back to my mother&#x27;s house and tried this cream in combination with Christopher&#x27;s Beauty Facial Cream and after 2 days of applying this my skin went back to normal!</li>
            <li>Definitely makes them soft and I&#x27;ve been told look younger.</li>
            <li>I got this mainly to salvage my heels, which were really dry and gross---</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like it when I can smell what other people are wearing because I don&#x27;t think they take into consideration that not everyone will necessarily like what they are wearing.</li>
            <li>After I use up this jar, I will go back to using The Body Shop body butter - worth the extra few dollars.</li>
            <li>my sister gave me my first jar of hempz body butter a few years ago</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also reasonably priced compared to other body butters!</li>
            <li>My bad for assuming Body lotion original and body butter original would smell the same.</li>
            <li>Good for anyone that suffers from dry skin.</li>
            <li>half the body in the Body Shope&#x27;s Sweet Chestnut, and half in Hempz Herbal Skin Care Butter.</li>
            <li>This lotion all it takes is a little bit and your hands get so soft and they stay soft.  </li>

            <li> a nice girl at the Body Shop in Lisbon</li>
            <li> the smell of the Hempz product is just as nice.</li>
            <li> This is a good product but the hemp butter made by Moist &amp; sold by Sally Beauty Products was much better.</li>
            <li> I used it on my face and am thrilled with it.</li>
            <li> --it has a nice scent and consistency.  </li>
            <li> but it is a nice change.</li>
            <li> Great scent plus rich and creamy texture.  </li>

            <li> love the Hempz Herbal Body butter gives your body a very smooth texture, loved it&lt;br /&gt;RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> It has a light, pleasant fragrance that can be worn with just about any perfume.  </li>
            <li> Great smell, and super moisturizing.</li>
            <li> but the smell is very strong and the smell does not seem to fade.  </li>
            <li> rich and creamy and love the scent light but very pleasant.  </li>
            <li> I liked them more then</li>
            <li> I used, and loved, the original lotion, so I thought I would give this a try.</li>

            <li> Love this stuff</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been in love with it ever since.  </li>
            <li> My feet love it, as it seems to absorb well and not leave a greasy feeling, but does feel moisturized.</li>
            <li> i wash my hands 10 or more times per day, and take up to 5 showers in a day.</li>
            <li> I shower at night ,put my body better on , in the morning</li>
            <li> Palmers Shea Butter from Walmart works better than this lotion.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product as there are better alternatives.</li>
            <li> We have tried many products...</li>
            <li> We might end this problem...  :)</li>
            <li> I have given this as gifts many times and everyone loves it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite moisturizer to use on my cheeks/neck after a shave/shower.</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t know where to find more</li>
            <li> same great product!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I believe this body butter is better than any I have tried.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it - it&#x27;s not cloying at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She enjoyed the Hempz foot products as well.</li>
            <li> I have used this for yrs and love how it makes my skin feel.  </li>
            <li> This was one of the better body butters I have used.</li>
            <li> I love this body butter....</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t do any better than this product line...</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Does not leave a greasy residue like most.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Most lotions have petroleum in them.</li>
            <li> It is rich, smells nice, but does not have SPF protection.  </li>
            <li> The butter seems very cheap, the smell is so strong and overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> I loved it very much</li>
            <li> It is super effective.  </li>
            <li> I was beyond impressed since my skin is normally so dry that I need to keep moisturizer on me and reapply throughout the day in order to avoid flaky skin on my face.</li>
            <li> very soft and smells great</li>
            <li> Smells good, really feels wonderful on dry skin.  </li>
            <li> This is easily one of the best products to use on dry hands.  </li>
            <li> It does have a lovely, light scent.  </li>
            <li> At 62 years old, I look great.</li>
            <li> I love how rich it is without being greasy.</li>
            <li> Hempz body butter is more like a rich body cream, with a lighter whipped feeling.</li>
            <li> I use the original body lotion by Hempz and love it.</li>
            <li> While some men might be scared off by anything with jasmine in it, I wouldn&#x27;t classify it as a floral scent at all and could easily be considered unisex.</li>
            <li> Read some reviews that  indicated this product had a strong smell.  </li>
            <li> But I do know some women prefer strongly scented body moisturizers in lieu of perfume, so this probably wouldn&#x27;t work for them.</li>
            <li> This body butter also has very good long term moisturizing capabilities, keeping my skin feeling moisturized all day.</li>
            <li> 10 days later, my heels were perfectly beautiful.  </li>
            <li> I also noticed that it&#x27;s very good at repairing dry, cracked skin on my feet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and blends in easily.</li>
            <li> Great price for the size and would definitely buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> My wife likes the butter go on smooth and not too greasy.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this wonderful lotion for a few years.</li>
            <li> Wish the scent was more powerful.</li>
            <li> enjoy the fragrance of this product.</li>
            <li> Smells light and never greasy.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind the wax and enjoy the result of it</li>
            <li> The second one I have purchased, a great skin reconditioning cream.....</li>
            <li> It smells cheap fruity.</li>
            <li> However I enjoy the smell when I wake up in the morning.</li>
            <li> but it is lightly scented.</li>
            <li> All good, I like her soft.</li>
            <li> It does still have a light scent, but nothing like the original body lotion.</li>
            <li> I love this body butter and only wish it came in the jasmine, peach &amp; wild rose!!</li>
            <li> The cover of the container was cracked, however I was able to salvage the contents which I like very much</li>
            <li> Light, non greasy, absorbed easily.</li>
            <li> I need the extra moisture in the winter months and the body butter works amazing!</li>
            <li> I have used this product over and over again and never disappointed.</li>
            <li> and now it&#x27;s nice and smooth, soft and hydrated!</li>
            <li> I am so excited to find it at this price.  </li>
            <li> When I saw they had the original in body butter</li>
            <li> When it arrived the first thing I noticed is that it didn&#x27;t have that light sweet smell as the original lotion, it had more like a Crisco smell to it.</li>
            <li> super fantastic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also great for dry skin and hangnails.</li>
            <li> pleasant, light scent, non-greasy and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> It goes on easily, isn&#x27;t greasy and soaks right in.  </li>
            <li> This is great stuff for very dry skin.  </li>
            <li> This is so great for very dry skin.</li>
            <li> And it smells wonderful, light and subtle, but still fragrant.</li>
            <li> Gave several as gifts.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone who received this product loved it, too.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about their products.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin soft and smell nice.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and I love the product.  </li>
            <li> The scent is mild and clean.</li>
            <li> Not bad at all, just not my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fresh light scent and it absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and leaves the skin feeling soft and silky, with a nice dewy glow to it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is lightly scented, non-greasy and just a good general all-around goop.</li>
            <li> I love the body butter especially after a nice hot shower.</li>
            <li> that dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> I love this body butter, mainly use on my feet and hands.  </li>
            <li> Quick Ship.  </li>
            <li> The fact that it absorbs in quickly and isn&#x27;t greasy is also a plus.</li>
            <li> Lid came cracked on my last order, but otherwise I love this product!</li>
            <li> I  thought how wonderful to have this for my extra dry skin in the winter.</li>
            <li> It smells like cheap perfume so you have to use it very sparingly if at all.</li>
            <li> Makes skin feel very moisturized and has a light scent, almost fruity</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how good my skin looked, it was moisturized and sorta glowing with absolutely no signs of irritation.</li>
            <li> I immediately ordered my own cream so that I can use it regularly.</li>
            <li> My favorite hand cream; it makes my skin feel soft, without being greasy.</li>
            <li> The scent is fantastically fresh and your skin feels silky.</li>
            <li> soft.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy it again and again worth every penny.</li>
            <li> The Hempz Herbal actually smells nice.</li>
            <li> I love how soft it makes my skin.</li>
            <li> If you want your skin to look soft and glowing and smell good, I totally recommend this!</li>
            <li> should i buy the Body Shop&#x27;s Hemp Body Butter, or is this basically just as good at half the price?</li>
            <li> so, the answer is: this is just as good as the Body Shop&#x27;s product, at half the price.</li>
            <li> As we all know dry winter time skin is on the way this product soothed my skin nicely.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it, specially in the winter months.</li>
            <li> My wife has used a similar product for many years and her skin is very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This product has always done me good for especially dry skin, which doesn&#x27;t happen very often.</li>
            <li> The product was exactly as described by the seller.</li>
            <li> SO I bought this and WONDERFUL no more itch!!!!</li>
            <li> Personal favorite.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t last and leaves your skin with a healthy glow.  </li>
            <li> Remoisturized and keeps skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Ehh I find the smell to be horrid after the first couple of minutes</li>
            <li> I love the butter especially --</li>
            <li> It is non-greasy and makes your skin feel soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was the jars were all dented on the top and the liners were smashed it.  </li>
            <li> My hands were much softer and had more moisture in them for being the back side of my hands...  </li>
            <li> After only one use, my feet are soft &amp; smell quite nice.</li>
            <li> Overall just a good smelling lotion that you can use on a daily bases.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the scent lingers for a long time.  </li>
            <li> First up, I love hemp products, I have use their body moisturiser for years, its is rich without being greasy and smells great, this is the first time I&#x27;ve use the body butter, so for winter when the cold climate is drying out your skin just that little bit more than normal, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> helps his dry skin better than anything he&#x27;s tried.</li>
            <li> It certainly doesn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li> It is wonderful for regular dry skin,  but really doesn&#x27;t make a difference for extremely dry skin like mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I tried using it several times just to be sure I didn&#x27;t like it - it certainly doesn&#x27;t make my skin soft.  </li>
            <li> I really like the cream.</li>
            <li> yet it is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> The price is so reasonable and I have given as gifts to friends.  </li>
            <li> I tried all types of oils and shea butter to try and moisturize but nothing really worked.</li>
            <li> Also the lotion doesn&#x27;t really moisturize that well.  </li>
            <li> Sits on skin for a while, doesn&#x27;t absorb too fast.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery...</li>
            <li> My  Wife&#x27;s the real reason I bought this... &#x27;</li>
            <li> Coated them generously and covered with light white socks...</li>
            <li> Comes HIGHLY recommended!</li>
            <li> Was shipped extremely fast and works wonders for my skin.</li>
            <li> Item moisturizers very well.</li>
            <li> Minus 2 stars for its overwhelming smell.</li>
            <li> It really helps moisturize my skin.  </li>
            <li> The body butter has a nice \\&quot;organic\\&quot; scent, consisting of some green notes accented by just a hint of floral in the background.</li>
            <li> It has a fresh clean scent that is subtle enough not to interfere with cologne but strong enough to stand on its own.  </li>
            <li> This product along with the original herbal body lotion is the ONLY thing that will help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use about every other day and it keeps my skin healthy.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this product based on other reviews.  </li>
            <li> I just wish it smelled the same as the original.</li>
            <li> I actually feel that it is quite fresh smell when you first put it on</li>
            <li> This product works well on very dry skin &amp; is absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li> so rich, makes my dry, rough skin feel very smooth.  </li>
            <li> I use this on my hands after a rough day and they magically feel brand new.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care in this case as I normally use fragrance anyhow.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend the true blue spa line by bath and body works.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, and have used many very expensive products, but I have to say this one is my favorite right now!!!</li>
            <li> the packaging is better with the Hempz (if you remove the body shop logo and put both side-by-side, and were asked to pick the most expensive looking tub, you&#x27;d pick Hempz) .</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent is not as long lasting as some of my favorite body butters and doesn&#x27;t seem as intense once I apply it.</li>
            <li> This is nice and thick but not greasy.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this stuff (and HHP if you&#x27;re SUPER dry and chapped).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although this product is rich in moisturizers, the consistency was not quite what I expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used lots of other lotions and most you have to reapply shortly after.  </li>
            <li> so it does initially feel a bit oily at first</li>
            <li> I was given a small jar by a friend and once I tried it I had to have more.</li>
            <li> This was my first purchase ever made on Amazon and I will continue to search and purchase items i am looking for in the future.</li>
            <li> The difference was amazing in just one application her skin was almost totally moisturized and very little could be seen of the cracks..  </li>
            <li> Frankly, it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m lazy and didn&#x27;t want to go to the Body Shop at the mall, plus Prime shipping is fast and free.  </li>
            <li> product has no odor and is good for delicate and dry</li>
            <li> I prefer the original since it has less fragrance.  </li>
            <li> It smells good, in an almond-y way, and it is super rich and moisturizing without being terribly greasy.  </li>
            <li> I bought some while travelling home to PA, as a gift for ms 85 year old mother.  </li>
            <li> , you need to reply after washing your hands to stay soft.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have a sore on my leg, and I use this skin care body butter on the sore every night, and the store has improved 50% so far, and I&#x27;m going to keep using it until the sore is gone.  </li>
            <li> It is NOT all natural as some people assume.</li>
            <li> it makes my skin so soft and shiny thank you to the creators of hempz butter</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft.  </li>
            <li> She is the only reason that I pay so much for a jar of lotion.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin so soft without feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li> Has natural healing ingredients, and has no scented oils in it.</li>
            <li> I use it on my whole body, but especially my face and neck.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this product hasn&#x27;t caused any problems for me.</li>
            <li> It is not heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> It absorbed quite well for a body butter, really wasn&#x27;t too heavy.</li>
            <li> A few days later, my heels looked significantly better.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m male and have some minor vascular dermatitis issues and this stuff helps tremendously when combined with the steroid cream I have.</li>
            <li> Note: I live in West Texas where it is really dry and sometimes this product burns when my hands are really in need.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure for people who mildly dry skin it might be enough, but I have VERY dry skin</li>
            <li> It has a subtle but lovely smell to it.</li>
            <li> It is more subtle.</li>
            <li> My older teen son loves this stuff!</li>
            <li> Because of the overwhelming smell I don&#x27;t like to apply it anywhere except my legs and even the only in small amounts.</li>
            <li> I was afraid because it was a good price, that it may be old, but it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> a positive note, it is definitely hydrating for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I generally dont like cream or lotions</li>
            <li> Without the wax this Hempz product would be pretty useless and cheap garbage in my opinion.</li>
            <li> My face in particular was so dry that it was peeling and cracked</li>
            <li> Recently let my my young nephew use it for his eczema, and it healed it almost over night.</li>
            <li> It definitely does the job as far as moisturizing is concerned, and it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, but I&#x27;m just not fond of the smell at all.</li>
            <li> I tried using it several times and was just completely turned off by the scent.</li>
            <li> My skin has NEVER bounced back so quickly and with so little damage from a sunburn.</li>
            <li> I went back to my mother&#x27;s house and tried this cream in combination with Christopher&#x27;s Beauty Facial Cream and after 2 days of applying this my skin went back to normal!</li>
            <li> Definitely makes them soft and I&#x27;ve been told look younger.</li>
            <li> I got this mainly to salvage my heels, which were really dry and gross---</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like it when I can smell what other people are wearing because I don&#x27;t think they take into consideration that not everyone will necessarily like what they are wearing.</li>
            <li> After I use up this jar, I will go back to using The Body Shop body butter - worth the extra few dollars.</li>
            <li> my sister gave me my first jar of hempz body butter a few years ago</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also reasonably priced compared to other body butters!</li>
            <li> My bad for assuming Body lotion original and body butter original would smell the same.</li>
            <li> Good for anyone that suffers from dry skin.</li>
            <li> half the body in the Body Shope&#x27;s Sweet Chestnut, and half in Hempz Herbal Skin Care Butter.</li>
            <li> This lotion all it takes is a little bit and your hands get so soft and they stay soft.  </li>
            <li> Within 24 hours, the less affected areas looked normal.</li>
            <li> I had a small jar given to me as a gift one year and just recently found on Amazon to purchase and at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> I have used a lot of body butters and my favorites are always super thick, just like butter!</li>
            <li> I have chronically dry skin, especially in winter.</li>
            <li> I use it on the extra dry areas like feet and legs.</li>
            <li> This 8 oz jar will last you awhile because it is thick and you do not need much to cover areas.</li>
            <li> Been using a small quarter-sized amount almost daily for the last year and have seen a noticeable reduction in razor burn and general facial skin health.</li>
            <li> I am outside in my garden daily,my skin gets very dry ,not with this.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin, especially in the winter.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s softer to the touch and is not nearly as dense as say, The Body Shop Body Butters.</li>
            <li> The true test came after I developed a bad reaction to some face wipes due to my sensitive skin and the skin around my eyes</li>
            <li> especially my eyelids got extremely irritated.</li>
            <li> Other similar body butter products caused breakout (and I am 60!)</li>
            <li> We have used so many expensive creams and prescription creams and nothing has worked as well as this hemp lotion!</li>
            <li> but it has been a blessing to my extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> Plus hemp was recommended to be for extremely dry skin.  </li>
            <li> have hand/foot syndrome from chemo medication and the skin on my hands and feet can become so dry they will crack.  </li>
            <li> she has MS and her feet are really dry and crack and bleed.  </li>
            <li> If you have dry skin, and who doesn&#x27;t in the winter, this body butter helps a lot.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, Moisturizing lotion for my face didn&#x27;t even work anymore,</li>
            <li> you have REALLY dry skin</li>
            <li> That aside, I still use it and it works wonders on my dry elbows, shins, etc.</li>
            <li> I use Hempz from head to toe and even use it on my face in this single digit temperature.</li>
            <li> It has very little smell which I like as I am sensitive to smell.</li>
            <li> This product burned when applied, and my skin was completely dry again less than 20 minutes later.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and there are very few creams and lotions that I can use without my skin</li>
            <li> I received it as a Christmas present and have only used it in very dire situations due to how expensive it is for just 8oz.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this and used it on my very dry flaky legs.  </li>
            <li> I bought the original Hempz body butter since it was a lot less expensive than The Body Shop brand.  </li>
            <li> so I have to be careful with lotions and creams as they make me break out in a rash.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use this, but careful if out in the sun.</li>
            <li> I know this may not work for everyone, especially those with oily skin since this may be too heavy</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and not greasy at all despite its thick creamy texture.  </li>
            <li> The more heavily burned areas were less red and weren&#x27;t as painful.</li>
            <li> Should last a few months!  </li>
            <li> but after 2 years of $20.00 a tub, i began experimenting with other butters, hoping for a cheaper price.</li>
            <li> This product requires only a small amount to be used for skin care.  </li>
            <li> Aloe and other sprays cannot compare to this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is what I expected!</li>
            <li> Yeah, crazy right?  </li>
            <li> After 48 hours, most of the redness is gone, and only the worst areas still hurt.</li>
            <li> This product is half the cost of what she has been using and works as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a real stickler about stuff like that usually.</li>
            <li> Its a thick body butter (as it should be), but doesn&#x27;t take very long to absorb.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion, it is a little greasy feeling, even after you rubbed it in.  </li>
            <li> This body butter does a fantastic job of moisturizing but unfortunately the scent is so overpowering it&#x27;s basically useless to me.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried HEMPZ herbal skin care, you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re missing.  </li>
            <li> have been using Hempz Herbal Skin Care Body Butter for a few years and will continue.</li>
            <li> I can apply this a few days and it clears up.</li>
            <li> I live in a very cold and dry climate over the winter and my skin was suffering and based on the other reviews of customers</li>
            <li> A friend gave me a small jar of this.</li>
            <li> The scent is not overwhelming and after a while I can&#x27;t even smell it which says a lot.</li>
            <li> of course i checked on amazon and found it for half the price my sister paid two years ago!!</li>
            <li> even with expensive lotions like Oil of Olay and Neutrogena, my face was so dry, it was embarrassing.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in retail stores.</li>
            <li> at least 8</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really thick and has a delicate fragrance, and it works.</li>
            <li> Thick.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s frustrating is that I bought this because some body butter that I got from Bath and Body Works was also too heavily scented.</li>
            <li> This body butter will soften the driest skin, with a very small amount and  was inexpensive compared to purchasing it at department stores.</li>
            <li> My mother had this cream and with this crazy winter my skin is extremely dry, I decided to try it out.</li>
            <li> I got a pretty nasty sunburn one weekend mowing the lawn and smeared it with hempz.</li>
            <li> My eyelids were so dry the skin was painful and peeling.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes deeply and NO perfumey smell, which I hate.</li>
            <li> Even my husband has become addicted to this product.  </li>
            <li> My wife is addicted.</li>
            <li> Intense and terrible artificial fragrance.</li>
            <li> I think that if it can treat a nasty sunburn with such efficiency, it can help with any severity of dry/irritated skin.</li>
            <li> I buy a body butter from a spa in Portland, OR - but it&#x27;s incredibly expensive.  </li>
            <li> Though be warned, that lotion smells like dirty hippy.</li>
            <li> the cracks were painful too.  </li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> (i hate using lotion</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m shocked!</li>
            <li> and its not greasy and disgusting</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> this is the best stuff for elbows and feet,im sold</li>
            <li> I have used this product over and over again and never disappointed. I use this on my hands after a rough day and they magically feel brand new. Great price for the size and would definitely buy from this seller again. This 8 oz jar will last you awhile because it is thick and you do not need much to cover areas. The smell is wonderful and it surely does hydrate my hands. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried HEMPZ herbal skin care, you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re missing.  Its unabashedly the best skin cream ever.&lt;br /&gt;Feels like silk, not greasy.  Softens skin on contact.</li>

            <li> This is great stuff for very dry skin.  I bought some while travelling home to PA, as a gift for ms 85 year old mother.  She loves the stuff too.  I have since purchased several big jars for others.  This is the best price for the amount of product you get.  Should last a few months!  E. Stephenson</li>
            <li> Great product. Personal favorite. A+++++++ Transaction.</li>
            <li> My wife likes the butter go on smooth and not too greasy. I did not find it to work too well, you need to reply after washing your hands to stay soft.</li>
            <li> Great, light cream and it doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky feel after applying.  I have sensitive skin so I have to be careful with lotions and creams as they make me break out in a rash.  Not so with Hempz Body butter.  I love the feel and for me it works better than advertised.</li>
            <li> As described. Worked good.</li>
            <li> Smells good, really feels wonderful on dry skin.  Here in the desert, I use GALLONS of it!!</li>
            <li> This body butter is great. I used, and loved, the original lotion, so I thought I would give this a try. It certainly doesn&#x27;t disappoint. It&#x27;s smooth and creamy and smells wonderful. I would buy it again, and recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> My older teen son loves this stuff!</li>
            <li> OMG. I started using this product after seeing it at my mother&#x27;s house. This product is the best. So moisturizing. I use it on my face and body without any breakouts. I highly recommend it, specially in the winter months. I will see if it gets too heavy/greasy for summer weather.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this wonderful lotion for a few years. Using the product mostly on my face.  It is rich, smells nice, but does not have SPF protection.  The price is so reasonable and I have given as gifts to friends.  I will continue to use this, but careful if out in the sun.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion and have already ordered another bottle.  Great moisturizer that lasts all day and I have seen visible results in just a couple of weeks of use.  Read some reviews that  indicated this product had a strong smell.  I have not found this to be so.  I actually feel that it is quite fresh smell when you first put it on that dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> Been a Hempz Supporter for 10 years and have loved everything of theirs that I have tried. definitely a great product</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and it&#x27;s great for my eczema.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and there are very few creams and lotions that I can use without my skin being irritated. My mother had this cream and with this crazy winter my skin is extremely dry, I decided to try it out. My face in particular was so dry that it was peeling and cracked and I decided to try this on my face even though is a body cream. I put some on before leaving my mother&#x27;s house and when I got home and looked in the mirror I was amazed at how good my skin looked, it was moisturized and sorta glowing with absolutely no signs of irritation. I was beyond impressed since my skin is normally so dry that I need to keep moisturizer on me and reapply throughout the day in order to avoid flaky skin on my face. The true test came after I developed a bad reaction to some face wipes due to my sensitive skin and the skin around my eyes especially my eyelids got extremely irritated. My eyelids were so dry the skin was painful and peeling. I tried all types of oils and shea butter to try and moisturize but nothing really worked. I went back to my mother&#x27;s house and tried this cream in combination with Christopher&#x27;s Beauty Facial Cream and after 2 days of applying this my skin went back to normal! I immediately ordered my own cream so that I can use it regularly. I know this may not work for everyone, especially those with oily skin since this may be too heavy but it has been a blessing to my extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> I absolutly love this stuff.  I&#x27;ve used lots of other lotions and most you have to reapply shortly after.  This lotion all it takes is a little bit and your hands get so soft and they stay soft.  Excellent product.  I would definetly recommend!</li>
            <li> I use this on body after swimming. Very deep moisturizing that&lt;br /&gt;lasts at least 8 hours.&lt;br /&gt;The product has no odor and is good for delicate and dry&lt;br /&gt;skin.&lt;br /&gt;I will reorder soon.</li>
            <li> I love this body butter, mainly use on my feet and hands.  It&#x27;s really thick and has a delicate fragrance, and it works.</li>
            <li> My favorite body butter - I use it every day.</li>
            <li> The butter seems very cheap, the smell is so strong and overwhelming.  I am a guy and just wanted a nice strong lotion but the smell is very strong and the smell does not seem to fade.  Also the lotion doesn&#x27;t really moisturize that well.  I think I will send it back.</li>
            <li> Good scent. Thick. Sits on skin for a while, doesn&#x27;t absorb too fast. Wish the scent was more powerful.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff it&#x27;s so moisturizing and lasts all day. After pregnancy my skin was just sooooo Sry and now it&#x27;s nice and smooth, soft and hydrated!</li>
            <li> Hempz is the best moisturizer I have used.  It stays with you all day without feeling greasy, and it smells terrific.  It has a fresh clean scent that is subtle enough not to interfere with cologne but strong enough to stand on its own.  I use Hempz from head to toe and even use it on my face in this single digit temperature.</li>
            <li> this is the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used, and smells great too! it has the perfect texture, doesn&#x27;t leave skin feeling oily.</li>
            <li> I have chronically dry skin, especially in winter. This product along with the original herbal body lotion is the ONLY thing that will help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoy the fragrance of this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is lightly scented, non-greasy and just a good general all-around goop. My wife has recently discovered it (and my Body Butter stash) and caused the monthly goop bill to go up. All good, I like her soft.</li>
            <li> Quick Ship.  Smells awesome and works well!</li>
            <li> My friend bought me Hempz Body Butter as part of a gift set for my birthday in January and I&#x27;ve been in love with it ever since.  It smells good, in an almond-y way, and it is super rich and moisturizing without being terribly greasy.  Granted, it is a \\&quot;butter\\&quot; so it does initially feel a bit oily at first but it doesn&#x27;t last and leaves your skin with a healthy glow.  If you want your skin to look soft and glowing and smell good, I totally recommend this!</li>
            <li> this is our 2 purchase and let me tell you...its Awesome! I generally dont like cream or lotions but this product is great!</li>
            <li> I live in a very cold and dry climate over the winter and my skin was suffering and based on the other reviews of customers I gave this product a try and love it!! I use about every other day and it keeps my skin healthy.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, and have used many very expensive products, but I have to say this one is my favorite right now!!! It smells wonderful and the nice scent lasts a very long time. For moisturizing, I&#x27;d give it six stars if that were possible. My feet love it, as it seems to absorb well and not leave a greasy feeling, but does feel moisturized. Some moisturizers wear off. This one lasts!!</li>
            <li> I love the body butter especially after a nice hot shower. Remoisturized and keeps skin smooth and soft. Nice smell, too!</li>
            <li> I have a sore on my leg, and I use this skin care body butter on the sore every night, and the store has improved 50% so far, and I&#x27;m going to keep using it until the sore is gone.  It&#x27;s not an open sore, but it was big and puffy, and now the puffiness is gone, and it is much smaller.  Even my doctor said it looks much better.!  This is a great product, with a lovely fragrance!</li>
            <li> everyone who views this product has one question in mind: should i buy the Body Shop&#x27;s Hemp Body Butter, or is this basically just as good at half the price? that was my question, also. i wash my hands 10 or more times per day, and take up to 5 showers in a day. also, daily workouts and or tennis don&#x27;t help the skin dryness. lotions were not working. even with expensive lotions like Oil of Olay and Neutrogena, my face was so dry, it was embarrassing. a nice girl at the Body Shop in Lisbon, Portugal recommended i try the Body Shop&#x27;s Body Butter, and this product was a revelation! but after 2 years of $20.00 a tub, i began experimenting with other butters, hoping for a cheaper price. Delon, and others. well, this Hempz arrived yesterday, and i did an experiment. half the body in the Body Shope&#x27;s Sweet Chestnut, and half in Hempz Herbal Skin Care Butter. after 10 hours, there was no difference. the smell of the Hempz product is just as nice. the packaging is better with the Hempz (if you remove the body shop logo and put both side-by-side, and were asked to pick the most expensive looking tub, you&#x27;d pick Hempz) . and Hemps gives you 8 ounces as opposed to the Body Shop&#x27;s 6.9 or 6.7 ounces. so, the answer is: this is just as good as the Body Shop&#x27;s product, at half the price. no kidding. i&#x27;m shocked! 5 stars. it should be in the bathroom of every cost-conscious OCD hand-washer!</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this product based on other reviews.  Plus hemp was recommended to be for extremely dry skin.  It does have a lovely, light scent.  It is wonderful for regular dry skin,  but really doesn&#x27;t make a difference for extremely dry skin like mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have hand/foot syndrome from chemo medication and the skin on my hands and feet can become so dry they will crack.  I have to keep moisturizer on them constantly.  Since I&#x27;ve been battling this side effect for over a year, I have tried everything!  I will add this to list of items that I will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Hempz Body Butter Cream was \\&quot;creamy\\&quot; like it should be.  I was afraid because it was a good price, that it may be old, but it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This lotion is the best hempz. Smells awesome 2!!</li>
            <li> Best lotion we&#x27;ve ever had, keeps my husband and I well moisturized and it helps that it smells delicious too!</li>
            <li> very soft and smells great</li>
            <li> Fast delivery...great product</li>
            <li> Wonderful moisturizer, helps dry skin with just one use, just think it is an awesome line!  Smells light and never greasy.</li>
            <li> Hempz body butter is wonderful.I love how rich it is without being greasy. I am outside in my garden daily,my skin gets very dry ,not with this.I shower at night ,put my body better on , in the morning I&#x27;m still moisturized.</li>
            <li> Everyone is always telling me how great Hempz products are. It is NOT all natural as some people assume. It&#x27;s claim to fan is the Paraffin wax. If you don&#x27;t mind the wax and enjoy the result of it I would highly recommend the true blue spa line by bath and body works. Those lotions are a bit more expensive but they advertise the wax and those lotions are thicker. I liked them more then Hempz and their effects lasted a lot longer (as did the bottle of lotion). Without the wax this Hempz product would be pretty useless and cheap garbage in my opinion. Palmers Shea Butter from Walmart works better than this lotion. Save your money. I would not recommend this product as there are better alternatives. Note: I live in West Texas where it is really dry and sometimes this product burns when my hands are really in need.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer. Fresh light scent and it absorbs quickly.  Keeps my skin supple during the winter.  In the warmer months I prefer the Hempz lotion in Citrus Blossom.</li>
            <li> We have just gotten this product... I used it on the backs of my hands where the dermatologist have been taking off pre cancers on me.  Made a difference in my skin with one use... My hands were much softer and had more moisture in them for being the back side of my hands...  My  Wife&#x27;s the real reason I bought this... &#x27;she has MS and her feet are really dry and crack and bleed.  We have tried many products... So we gave this a whirl on here feet last night...  Coated them generously and covered with light white socks... The difference was amazing in just one application her skin was almost totally moisturized and very little could be seen of the cracks..  Now if she will only continue to use it daily... We might end this problem...  :)</li>
            <li> Ehh I find the smell to be horrid after the first couple of minutes</li>
            <li> I have been using Hempz body butter and lotion for years.  I love the butter especially -- so rich, makes my dry, rough skin feel very smooth.  And it has a wonderful, light fragrance.  I have given this as gifts many times and everyone loves it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff. Hard to find in retail stores. Use it everywhere. Other similar body butter products caused breakout (and I am 60!) but this does not. Moisturizes deeply and NO perfumey smell, which I hate.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin, and who doesn&#x27;t in the winter, this body butter helps a lot. A regular cream just doesn&#x27;t cut it here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Hempz Herbal Skin Care Body Butter for a few years and will continue.</li>
            <li> This body butter was recommended by my Nail Technician. She keeps this product on her shelves and goes thru quite a lot in her profession. The butter can be used anywhere and I like to use it on my feet. After only one use, my feet are soft &amp; smell quite nice.</li>
            <li> Great for after tanning to relax your skin. Overall just a good smelling lotion that you can use on a daily bases.</li>
            <li> I bought the original Hempz body butter since it was a lot less expensive than The Body Shop brand.  In my opinion, it is a little greasy feeling, even after you rubbed it in.  After I use up this jar, I will go back to using The Body Shop body butter - worth the extra few dollars.</li>
            <li> the butter was so beautiful I loved it very much it makes my skin so soft and shiny thank you to the creators of hempz butter</li>
            <li> This product requires only a small amount to be used for skin care.  It goes on smoothly and blends in easily.</li>
            <li> I would give this 5 stars, but it does not have the same scent as the lotion/moisturizer.  This is a keeper.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Best moisturizer I have ever used! Gave several as gifts.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone who received this product loved it, too.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite moisturizer to use on my cheeks/neck after a shave/shower. Been using a small quarter-sized amount almost daily for the last year and have seen a noticeable reduction in razor burn and general facial skin health.</li>
            <li> This is nice and thick but not greasy. It has a subtle but lovely smell to it. I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
            <li> This is my second time placing an order for the Hempz Herbal Skin Care Body Butter.  It continues to soften my skin.  At 62 years old, I look great.</li>
            <li> Love this myself, but my husband asked me to order it for him! helps his dry skin better than anything he&#x27;s tried.</li>
            <li> I like how creamy it feels. I use it on the extra dry areas like feet and legs. It makes them visually softer.</li>
            <li> Miracle lotion!! I&#x27;ve used to forever and loved it. Recently let my my young nephew use it for his eczema, and it healed it almost over night. We have used so many expensive creams and prescription creams and nothing has worked as well as this hemp lotion! I recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li> Love it!  My skin feels so soft.  I need the extra moisture in the winter months and the body butter works amazing!</li>
            <li> This is the best &amp;#34;body butter&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve ever used.  It goes on easily, isn&#x27;t greasy and soaks right in.  I got all my &amp;#34;girls&amp;#34;  one as a stocking stuffer.</li>
            <li> This product has always done me good for especially dry skin, which doesn&#x27;t happen very often. I received it as a Christmas present and have only used it in very dire situations due to how expensive it is for just 8oz. I got a pretty nasty sunburn one weekend mowing the lawn and smeared it with hempz. My skin has NEVER bounced back so quickly and with so little damage from a sunburn. Within 24 hours, the less affected areas looked normal. The more heavily burned areas were less red and weren&#x27;t as painful. After 48 hours, most of the redness is gone, and only the worst areas still hurt. Aloe and other sprays cannot compare to this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I think that if it can treat a nasty sunburn with such efficiency, it can help with any severity of dry/irritated skin. Comes HIGHLY recommended!</li>
            <li> Best body cream ever and will continue using it and recommending it to my friends.&lt;br /&gt;The best what else can I say when I say it is the best</li>
            <li> This is a good product but the hemp butter made by Moist &amp; sold by Sally Beauty Products was much better. Sally Beauty discontinued that product.  This product works well on very dry skin &amp; is absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li> This is easily one of the best products to use on dry hands.  It is non-greasy and makes your skin feel soft and smooth.  Even my husband has become addicted to this product.  I keep one on my desk at work and a lot of my staff (especially the men) stop by to use it.  Great product for both men and women.</li>
            <li> My wife is addicted. She is the only reason that I pay so much for a jar of lotion.</li>
            <li> my sister gave me my first jar of hempz body butter a few years ago and i finally used it up (i hate using lotion but this stuff is great) i didn&#x27;t know where to find more so of course i checked on amazon and found it for half the price my sister paid two years ago!! same great product!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It makes your skin so soft without feeling greasy.  It has a light, pleasant fragrance that can be worn with just about any perfume.  Good for anyone that suffers from dry skin.</li>
            <li> i love this brand and lotion!! smells good and moisturizes well</li>
            <li> Great scent plus rich and creamy texture.  I have very dry skin and this product seems to meet my needs.  I believe this body butter is better than any I have tried.</li>
            <li> my favorite body butter for over 10 years!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using hempz lotions for years. I swear by it for my eczema flare ups. I can apply this a few days and it clears up. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about their products.</li>
            <li> This is the best body butter around</li>
            <li> Hempz products are the best.</li>
            <li> I have been using this wonderful skin moisturizer for years.  Purchased several jars to give as gifts this holiday season.&lt;br /&gt;Very pleasant, light scent, non-greasy and lasts a long time.  It&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li> The second one I have purchased, a great skin reconditioning cream.....Has natural healing ingredients, and has no scented oils in it. I love it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  I used it on my face and am thrilled with it.</li>
            <li> I buy a body butter from a spa in Portland, OR - but it&#x27;s incredibly expensive.  I thought I&#x27;d try this instead - but it didn&#x27;t work out.  This product burned when applied, and my skin was completely dry again less than 20 minutes later.  I tried using it several times just to be sure I didn&#x27;t like it - it certainly doesn&#x27;t make my skin soft.  I&#x27;m sure for people who mildly dry skin it might be enough, but I have VERY dry skin and this did nothing to help that.</li>
            <li> super fantastic. Light, non greasy, absorbed easily. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> This body butter does a fantastic job of moisturizing but unfortunately the scent is so overpowering it&#x27;s basically useless to me. It smells like cheap perfume so you have to use it very sparingly if at all. I&#x27;m a man so I especially don&#x27;t want to smell like perfume but I can&#x27;t imagine women liking this scent either. Because of the overwhelming smell I don&#x27;t like to apply it anywhere except my legs and even the only in small amounts. Applied too close to my face it becomes distracting. What&#x27;s frustrating is that I bought this because some body butter that I got from Bath and Body Works was also too heavily scented. The quest to find unscented body butter continues.</li>
            <li> Was shipped extremely fast and works wonders for my skin. Great choice of lotion, doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy and the smell isn&#x27;t overpowering</li>
            <li> I love this body butter and only wish it came in the jasmine, peach &amp; wild rose!! hint hint to manufacuturer</li>
            <li> I was given a small jar by a friend and once I tried it I had to have more. It absorbs easily and smells so nice  - at work everyone wanted some so I ordered some for all of us...I just love it!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing moisturizer. And it smells great. I use it on my whole body, but especially my face and neck. Definitely makes them soft and I&#x27;ve been told look younger.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin, especially in the winter. Recently, I ran out of Olive Body Butter from The Body Shop, so I decided to try this instead.  Frankly, it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m lazy and didn&#x27;t want to go to the Body Shop at the mall, plus Prime shipping is fast and free.  I got this mainly to salvage my heels, which were really dry and gross--- the cracks were painful too.  I exfoliated with pumice stone in the shower and put my Hempz body butter on.  It absorbed quite well for a body butter, really wasn&#x27;t too heavy. A few days later, my heels looked significantly better.  10 days later, my heels were perfectly beautiful.  Yeah, crazy right?  So glad I got this!</li>
            <li> The cover of the container was cracked, however I was able to salvage the contents which I like very much</li>
            <li> This body butter will soften the driest skin, with a very small amount and  was inexpensive compared to purchasing it at department stores.</li>
            <li> My favorite hand cream; it makes my skin feel soft, without being greasy. And it smells wonderful, light and subtle, but still fragrant.</li>
            <li> The body butter has a nice \\&quot;organic\\&quot; scent, consisting of some green notes accented by just a hint of floral in the background. I noted that it contains jasmine and cucumber, so that would definitely explain the freshness of this scent. While some men might be scared off by anything with jasmine in it, I wouldn&#x27;t classify it as a floral scent at all and could easily be considered unisex. I absolutely love it - it&#x27;s not cloying at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this product is rich in moisturizers, the consistency was not quite what I expected. I have used a lot of body butters and my favorites are always super thick, just like butter! Hempz body butter is more like a rich body cream, with a lighter whipped feeling. It&#x27;s softer to the touch and is not nearly as dense as say, The Body Shop Body Butters. Nonetheless, it is a great moisturizer. It absorbs quickly and leaves the skin feeling soft and silky, with a nice dewy glow to it. This body butter also has very good long term moisturizing capabilities, keeping my skin feeling moisturized all day. I also noticed that it&#x27;s very good at repairing dry, cracked skin on my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is not as long lasting as some of my favorite body butters and doesn&#x27;t seem as intense once I apply it. I don&#x27;t really care in this case as I normally use fragrance anyhow. But I do know some women prefer strongly scented body moisturizers in lieu of perfume, so this probably wouldn&#x27;t work for them.</li>
            <li> love the Hempz Herbal Body butter gives your body a very smooth texture, loved it&lt;br /&gt;RECOMMEND YOU PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT ITS GREAT</li>
            <li> As I have said before, Hempz has wonderful products!  I bought this for my sister as one of her Christmas presents.  She enjoyed the Hempz foot products as well.</li>
            <li> I adore the Hempz Body Butter! It moisturizes wonderfully and doesn&#x27;t leave a film on my skin after it is absorbed. I have sensitive skin and this product hasn&#x27;t caused any problems for me. It&#x27;s also reasonably priced compared to other body butters! No complaints!</li>
            <li> This is so great for very dry skin. It absorbs well and I even use it on my face daily.</li>
            <li> My wife has used a similar product for many years and her skin is very soft and smooth. This product is half the cost of what she has been using and works as well.</li>
            <li> Its a thick body butter (as it should be), but doesn&#x27;t take very long to absorb.  Makes my feet &amp; arms feel smother &amp; softer after applied.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for the scent. They have another scent called Citrus Blossom which has the best scent. Wish I got that one instead. It smells like cucumber-ish. Not bad at all, just not my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a positive note, it is definitely hydrating for dry skin. I will re-purchase in the Citrus Blossom next time.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product! I order 3 of these at a time every year for her Christmas.</li>
            <li> I have used this for yrs and love how it makes my skin feel.  It has very little smell which I like as I am sensitive to smell. I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Item moisturizers very well.</li>
            <li> I love this product! The scent is fantastically fresh and your skin feels silky. It is not heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin soft and smell nice.</li>
            <li> This was one of the better body butters I have used. I prefer the original since it has less fragrance.  I would purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the scent lingers for a long time.  I also recommend the cucumber &amp; Jasmine too.</li>
            <li> I love this body butter....best smell in the world...you can&#x27;t do any better than this product line...I  recommend this product</li>
            <li> It does its job of moisterizing my skin. My skin feels soft and not greasy at all despite its thick creamy texture.  Minus 2 stars for its overwhelming smell. It smells cheap fruity. However I enjoy the smell when I wake up in the morning. It is more subtle.</li>
            <li> It definitely does the job as far as moisturizing is concerned, and it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, but I&#x27;m just not fond of the smell at all. I tried using it several times and was just completely turned off by the scent. I&#x27;d definitely sample it before buying if at all possible.</li>
            <li> Love this. Great product!</li>
            <li> This is what I expected!</li>
            <li> Love this product. I have dry skin, Moisturizing lotion for my face didn&#x27;t even work anymore, Every time I would wash my face with water, my skin would still flake, with this product, I dont have that problem anymore!! AMAZINGGGG</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this and used it on my very dry flaky legs.  I loved it but when I went to replace it it was $19. Because it was the best I have ever used on my legs, I bought it.  I am so excited to find it at this price.  My legs no longer flake or itch.  It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> Was expecting a novelty item but is a wonderful product. As we all know dry winter time skin is on the way this product soothed my skin nicely. Would recommend to all.</li>
            <li> I love it!!  I had a small jar given to me as a gift one year and just recently found on Amazon to purchase and at a reasonable price.  This was my first purchase ever made on Amazon and I will continue to search and purchase items i am looking for in the future.</li>
            <li> Was looking all over for this after a friend gave me a sample. Definitely a good buy. Great smell, and super moisturizing. Does not leave a greasy residue like most.</li>
            <li> This a great product and provides great moisturizing to hands and feet in the dry winter months.  I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone in low humidity climates.</li>
            <li> rich and creamy and love the scent light but very pleasant.  my skin felt so nourished and soft.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy it again and again worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and I love the product.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was the jars were all dented on the top and the liners were smashed it.  It doesn&#x27;t effect the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m male and have some minor vascular dermatitis issues and this stuff helps tremendously when combined with the steroid cream I have. It doesn&#x27;t smell too feminine, and the smell diminishes after 10 minutes or so. It&#x27;s also great for dry skin and hangnails. This stuff doesn&#x27;t leave you oily and dries nice.&lt;br /&gt;If you have REALLY dry skin you might also want to consider Hemp Hand Protector by The Body Shop. That stuff is also great, but leaves you a bit oily. Though be warned, that lotion smells like dirty hippy. The Hempz Herbal actually smells nice. I highly recommend this stuff (and HHP if you&#x27;re SUPER dry and chapped).</li>
            <li> Lid came cracked on my last order, but otherwise I love this product! It smells so good and feels wonderful (not greasy!) on my skin. The scent is mild and clean.</li>
            <li> Love this! Makes skin feel very moisturized and has a light scent, almost fruity</li>
            <li> I love this product. I get severe migraines and have a sensitivity to scents. A friend gave me a small jar of this. I love how soft it makes my skin. The scent is not overwhelming and after a while I can&#x27;t even smell it which says a lot. I don&#x27;t like scents that linger because it&#x27;s just a matter of not if but when I&#x27;ll get a migraine. The smell is not over powering either. I really don&#x27;t like it when I can smell what other people are wearing because I don&#x27;t think they take into consideration that not everyone will necessarily like what they are wearing. So, if I can&#x27;t smell what I&#x27;m wearing after about an hour then I know there&#x27;s no way anyone else can either. Plus there&#x27;s no petroleum in this product. I&#x27;m not a real stickler about stuff like that usually. But I have severe dermatitis and my doctor told me to stay away from lotions with petroleum and perfume. Most lotions have petroleum in them. I&#x27;m sold on Hempz and will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> Intense and terrible artificial fragrance. Intolerable.</li>
            <li> Like the body butter.  Wish it had a nicer smell.</li>
            <li> I use the original body lotion by Hempz and love it. The smell is light and wonderful. The fact that it absorbs in quickly and isn&#x27;t greasy is also a plus. When I saw they had the original in body butter I  thought how wonderful to have this for my extra dry skin in the winter. When it arrived the first thing I noticed is that it didn&#x27;t have that light sweet smell as the original lotion, it had more like a Crisco smell to it. It does still have a light scent, but nothing like the original body lotion. That aside, I still use it and it works wonders on my dry elbows, shins, etc. I just wish it smelled the same as the original. My bad for assuming Body lotion original and body butter original would smell the same.</li>
            <li> Great product, as is the original hemp lotion. Not flowery no perfume scent but it is lightly scented. Packs well for the gym, no leaks.</li>
            <li> I have used the hemp hand lotion for years and was given a trial size of the body butter.  I like it a lot--it has a nice scent and consistency.  It really helps moisturize my skin.  My only issue would be that it goes quick--8 oz last about a month.  I was really happy to purchase it at a reduced price on Amazon.  This is not my only lotion for the winter but it is a nice change.</li>
            <li> First up, I love hemp products, I have use their body moisturiser for years, its is rich without being greasy and smells great, this is the first time I&#x27;ve use the body butter, so for winter when the cold climate is drying out your skin just that little bit more than normal, I highly recommend it.</li>
