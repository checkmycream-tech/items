            <li>Wolfthorn is much better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells a bit more like classic old spice or cologne, sharper and less floral than the deodorant.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Twilight Saga: New Moon]] crowd.  </li>
            <li>It definitely has a more masculine scent than some of the other new ones, like Fiji for instance.</li>
            <li>Old Spice has always been my go to brand because they offer classic masculine scents that are not overtly obnoxious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Old Spice also has a new line called [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Clearly this product is aimed at [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t always buy Old Spice,</li>
            <li>But when I do I buy Old Spice Wild Collection.</li>
            <li>It has a definite manly wolf-like scent to it, much richer in fragrance.</li>
            <li>I do not know if I received an old product</li>
            <li>the Belize is much longer lasting [</li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B003KWOOMK Old Spice Fiji]] is still our fave body spray.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Old Spice after shave for decades.</li>
            <li>I may life Old Spice Aqua Reef, Hawkridge, and Swagger</li>
            <li>I would call the smell slightly more sour than the other 2 forms.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a subtle, mossy/soapy-type of fresh scent which is not too powerful therefore is not likely to clash with your cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ok, I&#x27;ve been married for 25 years, but we can still prowl each other here at home.  </li>
            <li>Old Spice Wild Collection&#x27;s Wolfthorn Scent Body Spray is another totally different scent breaking from the line of Old Spice traditional scent.</li>
            <li>-- I don&#x27;t really understand why they felt the need to include this in the first place because as I said, it&#x27;s hard enough to spray this when you really want to.., so accidents are not that likely -- all in all, it&#x27;s form over function to me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s subtle, clean and pleasing to the snout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> -- I don&#x27;t really understand why they felt the need to include this in the first place because as I said, it&#x27;s hard enough to spray this when you really want to.., so accidents are not that likely -- all in all, it&#x27;s form over function to me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s subtle, clean and pleasing to the snout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It still foams up quite well and the scent is in long lasting.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t overbearing, or arrive in the room 10 minutes before you do, and linger long after you&#x27;ve left.  </li>
            <li> but the smell does not last very long.</li>
            <li> It is getting harder to find locally.</li>
            <li> But for an everyday body spray, I like Wolfthorn and will likely buy again at my local Targ&amp;eacute;.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It smells fresh, a little woodsy (duh!)</li>
            <li> it closed so it doesnt spray when you are transporting it.</li>
            <li> I gotta say, it lasts a long for someone who uses it almost everyday.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t compare it to any other body spray.</li>
            <li> am giving it three stars because the new mechanism of the spray cap is poorly designed and doesn&#x27;t always work as it should, also the twisting part that&#x27;s used to toggle on/off</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use aerosol deodorants everyday, however for occasions that I do (before going to the gym, etc)</li>
            <li> What a waste!</li>
            <li> Which seemed kinda silly, but at least it shows they care about getting the stuff there without harm, eh?</li>
            <li> which is bad.</li>
            <li> but that one smelled terrible.  </li>

            <li> Love the new scents by old spice. No complaints. Took awhile to get here, but still. Came with a big package and all kinds of packing peanuts. Which seemed kinda silly, but at least it shows they care about getting the stuff there without harm, eh?</li>
            <li> Smells great. This is my favorite scent from old spice at the moment. Chicks dig it and it won&#x27;t leave you smelling like a french whore. I don&#x27;t always buy Old Spice, But when I do I buy Old Spice Wild Collection. -Simple Man</li>
            <li> Old Spice Wild Collection&#x27;s Wolfthorn Scent Body Spray is another totally different scent breaking from the line of Old Spice traditional scent. I like this one. It definitely has a more masculine scent than some of the other new ones, like Fiji for instance. It has a definite manly wolf-like scent to it, much richer in fragrance. It still foams up quite well and the scent is in long lasting. It did leave me feeling refreshed and invigorated enough to write about it! The Howling!</li>
            <li> This is definently one of my favorite smells from Old Spice. I will be buying more of these for the rest of the men in my family.</li>
            <li> I love wolfthorn. After I smelled the deodorant, I bought it immediately, along with the body wash. However, the spray is slightly different. I would call the smell slightly more sour than the other 2 forms. It smells a bit more like classic old spice or cologne, sharper and less floral than the deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the design of the container, it lets you lock it closed so it doesnt spray when you are transporting it. I recommend this.</li>
            <li> Smells great.. but it literally last for like 93 seconds. What a waste! I do not know if I received an old product but I wouldn&#x27;t ever pay to get this one again.. the Belize is much longer lasting [[ASIN:B0071CRJDQ Old Spice Fresh Collection Belize]]</li>
            <li> Has a unique scent but in a good way. Doesn&#x27;t smell cheap. I like it but these things should be tested in person before they are bought online. Wolf pack fo life g</li>
            <li> My boyfriend wore this before and its my favorite from old spice. I&#x27;ve smelled all of them and this one and fiji are my favorites. Wolfthorn is like a spicy orange. Like a blood orange. I like that it smells fruity but not girly. Perfect for my man.</li>
            <li> We do medieval role playing and for some reason- this stuff makes my husband smell like my knight in shining armor! (before the fighting and getting all sweaty)</li>
            <li> I gotta say, it lasts a long for someone who uses it almost everyday. And it smells awesome. You really get a lot for what you pay.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use aerosol deodorants everyday, however for occasions that I do (before going to the gym, etc) Old Spice has always been my go to brand because they offer classic masculine scents that are not overtly obnoxious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a subtle, mossy/soapy-type of fresh scent which is not too powerful therefore is not likely to clash with your cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am giving it three stars because the new mechanism of the spray cap is poorly designed and doesn&#x27;t always work as it should, also the twisting part that&#x27;s used to toggle on/off feels very flimsy and made of cheap plastic -- I don&#x27;t really understand why they felt the need to include this in the first place because as I said, it&#x27;s hard enough to spray this when you really want to.., so accidents are not that likely -- all in all, it&#x27;s form over function to me.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this series especially wolfthorn but the smell does not last very long. It is getting harder to find locally.</li>
            <li> I used to like this but later I realize it smells like a litter box...</li>
            <li> smells heavennnnnnn........... &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I learned pretty quickly that you don&#x27;t buy this at the store. If you get any on you get ready for some ladies all up in your face. I say subscribe and stop smelling like you do now. which is bad.</li>
            <li> It smells great and everyone else thinks so too! I can&#x27;t compare it to any other body spray. It is superior.</li>
            <li> Have you seen the commercial?  Clearly this product is aimed at [[ASIN:B0035KMSQQ The Twilight Saga: New Moon]] crowd.  Personally, I&#x27;m more partial to MJ&#x27;s [[ASIN:B0013D6QP6 Thriller]].  Either way, this stuff smells great and will turn you into a foxy wolf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lichen It A Lot&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells fresh, a little woodsy (duh!) and after-hours chic.  It isn&#x27;t overbearing, or arrive in the room 10 minutes before you do, and linger long after you&#x27;ve left.  It&#x27;s subtle, clean and pleasing to the snout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On The Prowl&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, I&#x27;ve been married for 25 years, but we can still prowl each other here at home.  Hubby loves it.  Says it makes me smell sexy and mysterious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New Scents&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wolfthorn is available as a deoderant and shower gel too.  I may try them.  Old Spice also has a new line called [[ASIN:B00B30SHU6 Hawkridge]] but that one smelled terrible.  Wolfthorn is much better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line - [[ASIN:B003KWOOMK Old Spice Fiji]] is still our fave body spray.  And as far as fine parfum, MJs [[ASIN:B000VONA52 Bal A Versailles]] is sublime.  But for an everyday body spray, I like Wolfthorn and will likely buy again at my local Targ&amp;eacute;.</li>
            <li> I like this scent and got it for cheap with coupon. Check for coupons on amazon.com/coupons. If I see another coupon for this item and get it cheap as before I would certainly buy more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Old Spice after shave for decades. Love the scent. I use their deodorant. Great protection. Just started with the body spray. Not the same scent as the after shave or cologne, but nice.</li>
            <li> Smells great! So many girls compliment the way I smell when I wear it!</li>
            <li> I may life Old Spice Aqua Reef, Hawkridge, and Swagger but  when I see Wolfthorn, I buy it without a second thought.</li>
