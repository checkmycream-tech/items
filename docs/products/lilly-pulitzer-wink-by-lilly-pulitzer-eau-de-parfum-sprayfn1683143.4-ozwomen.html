            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s my favorite one out of the collection.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li>Beachy is my favorite, squeeze is citrus scent.</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance and do not see it anywhere</li>
            <li>I love this perfume and get serveral compliments everytime I wear it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the scent of this summery, flirty, light fragrance.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing, so light so fresh .</li>
            <li>Very good as expected</li>
            <li>It is a fresh floral: refreshing, never cloying or overpowering.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a floral mix- very fresh, and smells like spring.  </li>
            <li>It is a very light fragrance, and the pretty scent soon disappears and requires another application.</li>
            <li>It has become my new favorite :)</li>
            <li>its a unique fruity-floral combination that is unlike anything else I have ever worn.  </li>
            <li>I also love the great deal I found on Amazon--I paid half of its retail value!</li>
            <li>Floral, fresh, light but noticeable.</li>
            <li>THEY DO NOT PACKAGE THE PRODUCT ADEQUATELY</li>
            <li>This is definitely the most sophisticated of the Lilly Pulitzer fragrances.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a unique and light floral smell and it lasts throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite perfume of all time, and I can only find it on Amazon!  </li>
            <li>It makes your feel pretty and feminine.</li>
            <li>Faster than fast and faster than est ship and deliver date.</li>
            <li>price too, fast delivery.</li>
            <li>You can smell the lilies in the scent, it&#x27;s very over powering.</li>
            <li>Purchased this without smelling due to I have \\&quot;Beachy\\&quot; and love it.</li>
            <li>would ONLY buy from Amazon as all 3 bottles came in their original box sealed and while manufacturer sealed cellophane.</li>
            <li>The perfume is a light scent and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a new summer perfume, make this the one!</li>
            <li>I was expecting to smell young and vibrant.</li>
            <li>This fragrance comes in a pretty pink bottle, and it&#x27;s a very \\&quot;pink\\&quot; scent.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really pick out any individual notes; I think there might be some lily notes, but that may just be because there&#x27;s a stargazer lily on the bottle.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s weak but strong.</li>
            <li>Look behind you while wearing it, and you will see this huge line of enchanted followers...  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m always stocking up and keep a few reserves!</li>
            <li> NOR DO THEY ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY FOR BREAKAGE THAT RESULTS FROM THE POOR PACKAGING.    </li>
            <li> Someone asked me if i fake tanned</li>
            <li> It sounds crazy but to me</li>
            <li> So i was humiliated Badly.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Smells really horrible...</li>

            <li> Thrilled to be able to find this perfume again. I got one for my daughter and one for me. The sent is lovely</li>
            <li> Purchased this without smelling due to I have \\&quot;Beachy\\&quot; and love it. Am not as thrilled with this one. I like more of a floral note and this one is more citrusy floral. I&#x27;ll wear it but not my favorite!</li>
            <li> The product is wonderful and I highly recommend.    DO NOT BUY FROM AAA MERCHANTS. THEY DO NOT PACKAGE THE PRODUCT ADEQUATELY NOR DO THEY ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY FOR BREAKAGE THAT RESULTS FROM THE POOR PACKAGING.    If you purchase will be waste your money as you will have a charge but no useable product.</li>
            <li> I get compliments all the time and have had people specifically call me and ask me to remind them what I wear when they&#x27;re going to purchase perfume. It&#x27;s such a unique and light floral smell and it lasts throughout the day.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Smells fabulous and you can&#x27;t beat the cost! I get compliments all thevtime!</li>
            <li> After receiving compliments on this fragrance from men and women alike, I&#x27;ve adopted it as my go-to scent. I&#x27;m not a \\&quot;pink\\&quot; girl or a girly-girl, so the cutesy slogan of the scent \\&quot;wear pink and make the boys wink\\&quot; almost kept me from trying it, but so glad I did.  It is a fresh floral: refreshing, never cloying or overpowering.  If you&#x27;re looking for a new summer perfume, make this the one!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the scent of this summery, flirty, light fragrance. I also love the great deal I found on Amazon--I paid half of its retail value! The bottle is ultra-feminine and girly (which, surprisingly, I like! It looks rather playful among my other perfumes.) The volume is generous--and necessary. It is a very light fragrance, and the pretty scent soon disappears and requires another application.</li>
            <li> This is an absolutely delightful cologne, with this clean, fresh, breezy, breathtaking and more than inspiring scent! Look behind you while wearing it, and you will see this huge line of enchanted followers...  As for its delivery service provided by Amazon, indeed impeccable!</li>
            <li> Faster than fast and faster than est ship and deliver date. There were no additional days needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfume is amazing my favorite all year scent. People tell me all the time and stop to ask what I&#x27;m wearing. My family and friends love the way I smell. While this scent is not for everyone I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would ONLY buy from Amazon as all 3 bottles came in their original box sealed and while manufacturer sealed cellophane.</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift for my mother in law. She&#x27;s so happy and loves it. She&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy :)</li>
            <li> This is definitely the most sophisticated of the Lilly Pulitzer fragrances.  It&#x27;s a floral mix- very fresh, and smells like spring.  I can&#x27;t really pick out any individual notes; I think there might be some lily notes, but that may just be because there&#x27;s a stargazer lily on the bottle.  This fragrance comes in a pretty pink bottle, and it&#x27;s a very \\&quot;pink\\&quot; scent.  This is the sort of fragrance to wear on a sunny day when you&#x27;re out in the sunshine.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume of all time, and I can only find it on Amazon!  I always get compliments when wearing this scent...its a unique fruity-floral combination that is unlike anything else I have ever worn.  The perfume lasts all day on me, from 6:30 AM until 10 PM.  Love it!</li>
            <li> This is a nice, springy, summery fragrance!  Was hesitant to buy it but decided to anyway and I&#x27;m glad I did!  Stays on all day!</li>
            <li> Loved this product. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.  Such a perfume for such an affordable cost! Will def buy again in the future!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!!!!!  Smells great and great size for the price.....  I&#x27;ve had it for over 6 months and I still have over half a bottle, in which I use it almost daily.</li>
            <li> Great for summer. Have received several compliments.</li>
            <li> Very good as expected</li>
            <li> Floral, fresh, light but noticeable. I love this sent.</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast and service was great.  The perfume is a light scent and lasts a long time.  If you or someone you know though has allergies, don&#x27;t get it.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, so light so fresh . I&#x27;m in love</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. The package took a long time to get to me and went all around the country before it got to me but it was an honest mistake.</li>
            <li> Smells really horrible... Someone asked me if i fake tanned I said no.. So i was humiliated Badly. Bummed</li>
            <li> Love it it&#x27;s my favorite one out of the collection.&lt;br /&gt;Great price too, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased the other two perfumes by Lilly Pulitzer (Beachy &amp; Squeeze) Beachy is my favorite, squeeze is citrus scent. I&#x27;ve waited over a year to try Wink only because the price of it was ridiculous. As soon as I saw it fulfilled by amazon I had to get it. I was expecting to smell young and vibrant. It sounds crazy but to me it&#x27;s weak but strong. It has a powdery floral smell. You can smell the lilies in the scent, it&#x27;s very over powering. I&#x27;m going to try and use this after I shower and see if it&#x27;s reacts differently to my body because I had sprayed it on my wrist to try it out.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what all the fuss is all about, but I don&#x27;t like how it smells on me.  Maybe it just does not work with my body chemistry, all I know is that I just don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume! Always get so many compliments on it! Didn&#x27;t want to wrote a review because  I don&#x27;t want anyone else buying it! Can&#x27;t believe  Lilly stopped making it! I&#x27;m always stocking up and keep a few reserves!</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance and do not see it anywhere but, here on Amazon!  It smells so heavenly.  It makes your feel pretty and feminine.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume and get serveral compliments everytime I wear it. It has become my new favorite :)</li>
            <li> My favorite, always wear it and sometimes is difficult to find</li>
