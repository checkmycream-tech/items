            <li>Enjoy!!!</li>
            <li>Proactiv is amazing!</li>
            <li>This product is totally amazing!</li>
            <li>I have used many brands of skin care products and proactive is the best.</li>
            <li>I will be a repeat customer for sure!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>My order came very quickly and I was very satisfied with my product.</li>
            <li>this medication isn&#x27;t quite as effective as the original proactive benzo wash, however I was able to afford this one when I couldn&#x27;t afford the original wash seen in the 3 step system, so it was a great substitute.</li>
            <li>It definitely is much more potent than just something you&#x27;d buy over the counter at the drugstore.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s fine with me, but I needed it for my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had huge pimples there  </li>
            <li>The smell is so good and so different.</li>
            <li>I do have big pores so this product is def showing me that it&#x27;s great with reducing the size of them and also leaving my face without acne and very soft after every wash!</li>
            <li>I have used Proactive for years but this new cleanser is so much better than before.</li>
            <li>It does a great job at sloughing off the dead skin and shrinking pores on my face though.</li>
            <li>Clearing it right up  </li>
            <li>Thanks a lot...great service!</li>
            <li>My son takes a shower every day and after the first year he threw this product away because he stated the acne didn&#x27;t go away.  </li>
            <li>thought it would clear up with more consistent usage, but really hasnt done much.</li>
            <li>Shipped quick new and all works</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels so much smoother.</li>
            <li>So, I went straight for this product.</li>
            <li>I really need this in my life</li>
            <li>it works very well.</li>
            <li>and I love ordering it on Amazon and not having to go thru the other web site.</li>
            <li>In the past I&#x27;ve experienced dryness and irritation from other products. .</li>
            <li>My neck looks clear now!  </li>
            <li>so I have to be VERY careful what I use to clean it with.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>completely gone or nearly gone.</li>
            <li>Just dab a little bit over a forming pimple, allow to dry before bed, and wake to clear or nearly clean skin!</li>
            <li>I love it and even though it is expensive, you don&#x27;t have to use very much of it, so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I have not really seen much from this product yet</li>
            <li>well i use for my back as it breaks out from working out and does miracles for the size cannot go wrong with the price overall good product</li>
            <li>product does not dry my skin at all!</li>

            <li> product does not dry my skin at all!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the Deep Cleansing Wash, and usually meant for the entire body.</li>
            <li> regular Proactiv Cleansing Wash dried out my skin within a day.</li>
            <li> I had a few spots on my back</li>
            <li> This one, however, is a thick blue lotion like substance with tiny little granules that exfoliate your skin.</li>
            <li> I used proactiv products in the past and when my teenager started having breakouts on his back</li>
            <li> Still breaking out and previous breakout have yet to disappear.</li>
            <li> I dab a little on the blemish, go to bed and wake up with it</li>
            <li> Upon entering my 30&#x27;s, I noticed a few blemishes that I thought were gone forever.</li>
            <li> used everyday, sometimes 2x a day, for over a month, didnt make any difference</li>
            <li> This seems to be the only product my skin doesn&#x27;t have a bad reaction too.</li>
            <li> Very sorry but probably was my mistake</li>
            <li> Wrong!!!</li>
            <li> My neck was just horrible!  </li>

            <li> I have used many brands of skin care products and proactive is the best. My skin looks and feels so much smoother. I would recommend this to anyone who has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have not really seen much from this product yet but I have only had it a short time. I am still breaking out on my shoulder which just seems like the oddest place.</li>
            <li> This product definitely lives up to its expectation. I have been using this product for last than a week and I can already see a difference in my skin. In the past I&#x27;ve experienced dryness and irritation from other products. . .this product does not dry my skin at all! As a matter of fact I can see the appearance of my pores gradually transforming after each application. Also, I recommend that you try the &amp;#34;repairing treatment&amp;#34; as the combo works wonders together. Enjoy!!!</li>
            <li> this medication isn&#x27;t quite as effective as the original proactive benzo wash, however I was able to afford this one when I couldn&#x27;t afford the original wash seen in the 3 step system, so it was a great substitute.</li>
            <li> I have used Proactive for years but this new cleanser is so much better than before. The smell is so good and so different. I will never use another cleanser again.</li>
            <li> This seems to be the only product my skin doesn&#x27;t have a bad reaction too. I have combination/oily skin &amp; it helps with any break outs I have. Proactiv is amazing! I&#x27;ve used this stuff for years!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my brother who lives with us (18) who was experiencing troublesome acne. It has done wonders clearing up his face! It definitely is much more potent than just something you&#x27;d buy over the counter at the drugstore.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as the facial cleanser. Still breaking out and previous breakout have yet to disappear. Back to the regular facial cleanser I go, that worked wonders for me.</li>
            <li> Very sorry but probably was my mistake but this is not what i wanted to order. I had assumed that cleansing wash was for the face, nope.</li>
            <li> Bought this for when I travel or needed for overnight stays. Just the perfect size for my purse. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I have combination oily/sensitive skin so I have to be VERY careful what I use to clean it with. Upon entering my 30&#x27;s, I noticed a few blemishes that I thought were gone forever. Wrong!!! So, I went straight for this product. It&#x27;s the Deep Cleansing Wash, and usually meant for the entire body. That&#x27;s fine with me, but I needed it for my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The regular Proactiv Cleansing Wash dried out my skin within a day. This one, however, is a thick blue lotion like substance with tiny little granules that exfoliate your skin. I use it twice per day, and my skin never dries out. My blemishes stay gone and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll use another over the counter product. I will be purchasing the deep cleaning mask next. It works as a great spot treatment! Just dab a little bit over a forming pimple, allow to dry before bed, and wake to clear or nearly clean skin! Perfect. If a blemish makes a sudden unwanted appearance, I use the PROACTIV MASK as a spot treatment. I dab a little on the blemish, go to bed and wake up with it completely gone or nearly gone. Yay!</li>
            <li> My order came very quickly and I was very satisfied with my product. I will be a repeat customer for sure! Thanks a lot...great service!</li>
            <li> Shipped quick new and all works well i use for my back as it breaks out from working out and does miracles for the size cannot go wrong with the price overall good product</li>
            <li> used everyday, sometimes 2x a day, for over a month, didnt make any difference</li>
            <li> Thank you for this item. I really need this in my life it works very well. I will purchase again</li>
            <li> This product is totally amazing! I had a few spots on my back so I used it for about 2 weeks and it did wonders.  I love it!</li>
            <li> The proactiv cleansing wash is what I always use, and I would recommend this product to anyone. It is a really great face wash!</li>
            <li> I do have big pores so this product is def showing me that it&#x27;s great with reducing the size of them and also leaving my face without acne and very soft after every wash!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my son to use because he had acne all over his body.  He used to this product for over a year and didn&#x27;t see any difference.  My son takes a shower every day and after the first year he threw this product away because he stated the acne didn&#x27;t go away.  I tried using this product several times myself when I took a shower and the cleaning wash broke me out.  I got a rash all over my body and I had to take benedryl to stop itching.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I used proactiv products in the past and when my teenager started having breakouts on his back I got this from him.  Clearing it right up  and I love ordering it on Amazon and not having to go thru the other web site.</li>
            <li> At the 1st sign of acne, my daughter insisted on the Proactiv.  Works great for her. She loves it alot.</li>
            <li> thought it would clear up with more consistent usage, but really hasnt done much. It does a great job at sloughing off the dead skin and shrinking pores on my face though.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my face,  It didn&#x27;t go too well At all,  it left cystic acne. Although!  My neck was just horrible!  I had huge pimples there  I used this prouduct in the shower for my neck and! My neck looks clear now!  It didn&#x27;t&#x27;t work for my body acne. But worked well for neck.  Just try it out and see. Proactive is a no no for my face.</li>
            <li> I have never had acne or zits my entire life until I turned 30 I started getting some acne on my neck. Nothing would take it away, no cleansers or soap, nothing. I bought this and it was gone in a couple of weeks. I love it and even though it is expensive, you don&#x27;t have to use very much of it, so it lasts a long time.</li>
