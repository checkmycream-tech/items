            <li>It&#x27;s very beautiful.</li>
            <li>Nothing i don&#x27;t LOVE about this product!!! :) UPDATE!!!  </li>
            <li>I am very appreciative of their efforts to make me a happy customer once again!</li>
            <li>was how beautiful it is.</li>
            <li>For my family, it&#x27;s been a great addition to our health regimen.</li>
            <li>It works with USB power, which provides a great deal of operational flexibility, and it doesn&#x27;t look like just another piece of plastic junk.</li>
            <li>Its USB-based plug is a very nice feature so I can use my laptop or USB charger to power it, when the plug is not nearby.</li>
            <li>Puts out a good amount of scent.</li>
            <li>Loved it while it worked.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this purchase and would highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li>I love this EO diffuser!</li>
            <li>I love my Trillia diffuser!</li>
            <li>I wish I had bought more than one!</li>
            <li>Hope I get more than 3 months out of the replacement because I LOVE this beautiful and functional oil dispenser.</li>
            <li>Looks nice too.  </li>
            <li>The motor works well and the look of it is nice.</li>
            <li>I think it would be a nice addition to any decor.</li>
            <li>EXCELLENT high quaility diffuser.</li>
            <li>Easy, No Fuss Nebulizer that works great and creates an even more lovely ambiance for you to unwind throughout the day.</li>
            <li>but this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>Wish it still worked because it was wonderful for dispensing across a broad area.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Other than that, the diffuser is beautiful and a very well crafted piece.</li>
            <li>While there are a lot of great diffusers available, a true nebulizer (such as this) will always give you the best therapeutic experience.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more like a  $20 diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed.</li>
            <li>I would suggest you make sure the tip piece of the glass nebulizer is pointing downward inside the glass nebulizer.</li>
            <li>You can put some healing oils and help get rid of that stuffy feeling:)</li>
            <li>I have tried the ultrasonic diffusers and they are ok</li>
            <li>It arrived safely also.</li>
            <li>Glad for the auto turn off.  </li>
            <li>and I am so glad I choose to buy it.</li>
            <li>I am glad that it shuts off after two hours instead of having a device that hooks to the bottle.</li>
            <li>and I wish I had a lot more money</li>
            <li>I have noticed when I used oils from a business who cares about the quality and purity of the EOs that my experience was much better than when I used an inexpensive oil which I don&#x27;t think was pure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is very nice looking and is made with high quality materials!</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t as strong, and it takes a lot more oil to operate.</li>
            <li>-Quiet, most nebulizers are incredibly noisy.</li>
            <li>Very easy to clean and operate.</li>
            <li>, I love the unique wood texture.</li>
            <li>-Easy</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of clean up,  the glass is very easy to clean by using alcohol.</li>
            <li>Just a pleasant soft humming noise.  </li>
            <li>I love this diffuser and very high quality for my good pure oils.</li>
            <li>The pump makes a humming sound</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Great for smaller rooms.</li>
            <li>Cheap product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rare these days to find a company that will jump through so many hoops to resolve an issue.</li>
            <li>It runs for two hours and then the motor shuts off but the light stays on.</li>
            <li>/&gt;During operation, it buzzes, but the sound is unobtrusive and not bothersome.</li>
            <li>The sound neither keeps me from falling asleep nor wakes me up.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I got the spare top for it right before it broke, so I invested a lot into something that worked for a month.</li>
            <li>After originally giving this diffuser 5 stars, I have to downgrade to 1.</li>
            <li>worth the price!</li>
            <li>I will post another update once it has been resolved, but so far, they are very concerned with ensuring I am happy with the product, which is quite reassuring.  </li>
            <li>I did clean it as per instructions, one day I plugged it in and it just wouldn&#x27;t start.</li>
            <li>Its just a cheap machine with a very pretty shell.</li>
            <li>By dispensing pure oil, it does cover  more area.  </li>
            <li>I love the clean lines of the diffuser and it works really well.</li>
            <li>I was extremely gentle with it -- and now it looks like the rubber part that holds the top in has torn.</li>
            <li>It really puts out the oils into the air and will fill most of my rooms on the highest setting.</li>
            <li>The tip portion of the glass nebulizer was broken but Ron with the company was excellent to work with me and got it taken care of very quickly.</li>
            <li>Seriously, as a guy who loves nature, this item fits perfectly.     </li>
            <li>I have found it works best when you turn the dial all the way up because it will leave left over oil on low.</li>
            <li>I realize that LED lights last forever, but sometimes when you leave for work in the morning it&#x27;s nice to know the light isn&#x27;t going to be on all day (or longer).      </li>
            <li>I use a lot of different essential oils and this is perfect for them, since EO&#x27;s can degrade plastics.</li>
            <li>I returned it for a second one since I was so excited about this product, and I also bought 2 of the handblown glass tops since I read a review that said it&#x27;s handy to have 2 for the stronger scents.</li>
            <li>Literally after the first minute, the fragrance of my EOs filled my room with the aroma.</li>
            <li>and it tackles the job with tremendous success.    </li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t take up much room and it was easy to find a place for it.</li>
            <li>Even more amazing is that I can also smell the aroma around the corner and down the stairs!</li>
            <li>It really diffused the oil immediately and the whole room smelled lovely.</li>
            <li>This diffuser paired with 4 thieves oil did spare my son a visit to a doctor and allowed me to work instead of taking care of him at home, so I suppose it&#x27;s still worth it, even if it breaks soon.</li>
            <li>The only quibbles thus far are the two-hour cycle time and the fact that you need to manually turn the LED light off using the front knob, but other than those, this thing is nearly perfect for home use.  </li>
            <li>This is a fantastic way to enjoy your essential oils for aromatherapy!</li>
            <li>No water is used so the essential oils used are more concentrated in the air.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind that it does not dispense thick oils like sandalwood; but there are plenty of great oils.  </li>
            <li>The first one I got did not work.</li>
            <li>Trillia sent me the newest model and also reimbursed my shipping from returning the first one.</li>
            <li>first thought when I found this diffuser</li>
            <li>It is simple and elegant.</li>
            <li>I first used the diffuser</li>
            <li>and I was able to sleep just fine with the nebulizer a few feet from my head.</li>
            <li>So far this little nebulizer has worked great for us.</li>
            <li>I also am happy with the light as I didn&#x27;t want something that was flashy with color options.</li>
            <li>l (I use doTERRA and Native American Nutrionals, but there are tons of great companies such as Young Living, Rocky Mountain, and a bunch of others.</li>
            <li>I was surprised how quickly it worked.</li>
            <li>when not in use, it looks like a pretty decent decoration in the room.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately you can&#x27;t turn the light of but it is suprisingly not too bright.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this diffuser as I wanted something without using water and without plastic parts.</li>
            <li>-Migraine relief, and real health benefits from the air</li>
            <li>and it really does</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take up much space and diffuses very well.</li>
            <li>It is quiet, unobtrusive, and effective, filling an entire room with scent within minutes.</li>
            <li>It ran fine for 6 months and for no apparent reason, the motor stopped running.</li>
            <li>I was not sure how effective it is since there is no water involved.</li>
            <li>Sent back for full refund.</li>
            <li>Like many of the previous reviewers, I didn&#x27;t want to mix my oils with water or have them contact plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one is definitely one of the most quiet.</li>
            <li>I particularly like the high quality look and feel -</li>
            <li>I received my Mina III yesterday, and it seems to work very well so far!</li>
            <li>I will highly recommend it to those who want a diffuser that has both functionality and aesthetics.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li>This little unit is outstanding.</li>
            <li>I can take the little glass piece off the top that regulates the output.</li>
            <li>I feel a little more in control of the output this way.</li>
            <li>I like that this product is made of glass, but it doesn&#x27;t cover as much area as my young living diffuser does.</li>
            <li>Love this little handmade diffuser!</li>
            <li>I was interested but nervous because it appeared to be a newer product as I only had 2 reviews.</li>
            <li>-Power down, while it does shut off after an hour, the led light stays on.</li>
            <li>packaging and the videos indicate that only pure EOs should be used in the diffuser.</li>
            <li>The little light at the bottom turns on and the motor makes noise but nothing happens.</li>
            <li>I had a hard time finding one I wanted to order because all of the ones I looked at on Amazon had mixed reviews with either some people loving them and some people saying that they didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>However I was surprised that the diffuser works out very well and lasts much longer than expected.</li>
            <li>but I did not find it to be too loud.</li>
            <li>I especially like to use this diffuser when I am relaxing or getting ready for bed.</li>
            <li>With my regular humidifier/water based diffuser, it was a regular occurrence as the combination of water renders the diffuser&#x27;s essential oil slightly less effective.</li>
            <li>to clean, just a few drops of isopropyl alcohol does the trick.  </li>
            <li>I have looked high and low for a diffuser that had a non plastic reservoir and could not find one anywhere!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nuts to me that people out drops of high end essential oil into plastic containers to diffuse.</li>
            <li>Although the unit is apparently designed to fill spaces up to a large bedroom, I have it sitting in a room that is roughly 800 square feet</li>
            <li>-Elegant, I mean look at it!</li>
            <li>High ceilings or larger rooms need something a bit bigger.</li>
            <li>This product is also very well made and works extremely well.</li>
            <li>If I really want the oils to be put into the air thick and fast</li>
            <li>Having gone through the endless pile of diffusers on Amazon, I wanted to really put my essential oils to work.</li>
            <li>After all, if you spend a lot on high quality oil, why would you want them to be watered down and ineffective?</li>

            <li> I particularly like the high quality look and feel -</li>
            <li> I received my Mina III yesterday, and it seems to work very well so far!</li>
            <li> I will highly recommend it to those who want a diffuser that has both functionality and aesthetics.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> This little unit is outstanding.</li>
            <li> I can take the little glass piece off the top that regulates the output.</li>
            <li> I feel a little more in control of the output this way.</li>
            <li> I like that this product is made of glass, but it doesn&#x27;t cover as much area as my young living diffuser does.</li>
            <li> Love this little handmade diffuser!</li>
            <li> I was interested but nervous because it appeared to be a newer product as I only had 2 reviews.</li>
            <li> -Power down, while it does shut off after an hour, the led light stays on.</li>
            <li> packaging and the videos indicate that only pure EOs should be used in the diffuser.</li>
            <li> The little light at the bottom turns on and the motor makes noise but nothing happens.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time finding one I wanted to order because all of the ones I looked at on Amazon had mixed reviews with either some people loving them and some people saying that they didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> However I was surprised that the diffuser works out very well and lasts much longer than expected.</li>
            <li> but I did not find it to be too loud.</li>
            <li> I especially like to use this diffuser when I am relaxing or getting ready for bed.</li>
            <li> With my regular humidifier/water based diffuser, it was a regular occurrence as the combination of water renders the diffuser&#x27;s essential oil slightly less effective.</li>
            <li> to clean, just a few drops of isopropyl alcohol does the trick.  </li>
            <li> I have looked high and low for a diffuser that had a non plastic reservoir and could not find one anywhere!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nuts to me that people out drops of high end essential oil into plastic containers to diffuse.</li>
            <li> Although the unit is apparently designed to fill spaces up to a large bedroom, I have it sitting in a room that is roughly 800 square feet</li>
            <li> -Elegant, I mean look at it!</li>
            <li> High ceilings or larger rooms need something a bit bigger.</li>
            <li> This product is also very well made and works extremely well.</li>
            <li> If I really want the oils to be put into the air thick and fast</li>
            <li> Having gone through the endless pile of diffusers on Amazon, I wanted to really put my essential oils to work.</li>
            <li> After all, if you spend a lot on high quality oil, why would you want them to be watered down and ineffective?</li>
            <li> -Powerful, it throws out some serious oil that stays in the air for hours.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s because a regular diffuser really doesn&#x27;t have the ability to soak the air with negative ions, which are so critical to the therapeutic experience found with essential oils.</li>
            <li> I looked a long time before choosing the Trillia because I did not want to use one where the oils were in contact with any type of plastics to avoid any chemical reaction.</li>
            <li> I spent hours reading about and looking at all of the different options.</li>
            <li> I looked around for a diffuser for a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not clear to me how I return or if I can.</li>
            <li> The essential oils do not touch anything other than glass.</li>
            <li> Overall, I would have to say I&#x27;m extremely please with this unit.</li>
            <li> I just swish some around,  pour it out, and let it dry.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve literally not woken up with one single migraine.</li>
            <li> It feels like a quality piece until you start using it and realize its the internal parts (that you can&#x27;t see) that break down.</li>
            <li> One of my concerns is that they were all either made out of plastic materials and people claimed they broke fast or didn&#x27;t work well, or they were pretty ugly.</li>
            <li> I can really only see myself using orange or lemon in this diffuser or something else less costly.</li>
            <li> It sometimes seems a little short</li>
            <li> Was carefully maintained, cleaned after each use.</li>
            <li> Only used a couple times a week for slightly over 5 months and now completely dead.</li>
            <li> While one is drying, I use the other.</li>
            <li> Broke down a month ago, and before I got into trying to return it, the return window expired.</li>
            <li> No heat that might affect the delicate essential oils, and no water to mess with either.</li>
            <li> If I had one complaint it would be that I wish the cord design was a little different.</li>
            <li> I am terribly disappointed, and I hope this review can prevent other people from experiencing this tremendous let down.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for the past 5 months and had to exchange it twice due to it breaking down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update my review after a few months of use.  </li>
            <li> *Update: Even with infrequent use, this item is already dead.</li>
            <li> Also great if your sick or have sick kids..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a quality little diffuser!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for an aroma dispenser that does not use water, this one has worked well for me over the past week.  </li>
            <li> What a waste!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want something sitting out in my small house that I didn&#x27;t like the look of.</li>
            <li> I am not impressed with this item - the instructions are in broken english, the diffuser is not worth the price...</li>
            <li> Unacceptable longevity for something so pricey and delicate.</li>
            <li> Will NOT purchase anything else manufactured by this company in the future.  :(</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I got the diffuser based on my friend’s recommendation. I was not sure how effective it is since there is no water involved. However I was surprised that the diffuser works out very well and lasts much longer than expected. I particularly like the high quality look and feel - when not in use, it looks like a pretty decent decoration in the room. Its USB-based plug is a very nice feature so I can use my laptop or USB charger to power it, when the plug is not nearby. I will highly recommend it to those who want a diffuser that has both functionality and aesthetics.</li>
            <li> I am really disappointed in this product.  I have used it for a week and the knob no longer works.  I have to remove the decorative silver piece and underneath there is a plastic knob.  I have to turn that to get it to work.  For the price, I don&#x27;t think it should be necessary for me to find a work around for it to work properly.  I can&#x27;t imagine what else will break on this thing.  I am returning.</li>
            <li> I like that this product is made of glass, but it doesn&#x27;t cover as much area as my young living diffuser does. The smell isn&#x27;t as strong, and it takes a lot more oil to operate. I can really only see myself using orange or lemon in this diffuser or something else less costly. When you use expensive oils, you don&#x27;t want to pour them out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, the diffuser is beautiful and a very well crafted piece. Packaging was perfect.</li>
            <li> This nebulizer is a wonderfully made piece of craftsmanship. I have looked high and low for a diffuser that had a non plastic reservoir and could not find one anywhere! A nebulizer seemed to be my only choice. The essential oils do not touch anything other than glass. No water is used so the essential oils used are more concentrated in the air. The pump makes a humming sound but I did not find it to be too loud. I have only used it on the lowest setting and I was able to sleep just fine with the nebulizer a few feet from my head. Unfortunately you can&#x27;t turn the light of but it is suprisingly not too bright. It did not keep me up at night. I just wish it could run for longer than 2 hours.</li>
            <li> I love the clean lines of the diffuser and it works really well. Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> So far so good. It&#x27;s a quality little diffuser! I have found it works best when you turn the dial all the way up because it will leave left over oil on low. I&#x27;ll update my review after a few months of use.  UPDATE... After originally giving this diffuser 5 stars, I have to downgrade to 1. I have been using it for the past 5 months and had to exchange it twice due to it breaking down. It feels like a quality piece until you start using it and realize its the internal parts (that you can&#x27;t see) that break down. I really wanted to like this diffuser as I wanted something without using water and without plastic parts. Its just a cheap machine with a very pretty shell. Search continues... sigh</li>
            <li> Nothing i don&#x27;t LOVE about this product!!! :) UPDATE!!!  Not even one year later and the motor stopped running, so now VERY unhappy with the price i paid for this product!!! Will NOT purchase anything else manufactured by this company in the future.  :(</li>
            <li> This little unit is outstanding. Having gone through the endless pile of diffusers on Amazon, I wanted to really put my essential oils to work. After all, if you spend a lot on high quality oil, why would you want them to be watered down and ineffective? l (I use doTERRA and Native American Nutrionals, but there are tons of great companies such as Young Living, Rocky Mountain, and a bunch of others. So look around and find one that works for you). While there are a lot of great diffusers available, a true nebulizer (such as this) will always give you the best therapeutic experience. That&#x27;s because a regular diffuser really doesn&#x27;t have the ability to soak the air with negative ions, which are so critical to the therapeutic experience found with essential oils. Although the unit is apparently designed to fill spaces up to a large bedroom, I have it sitting in a room that is roughly 800 square feet and it tackles the job with tremendous success.    That said, here are the highlights:    Pros:  -Glass!!! It&#x27;s nuts to me that people out drops of high end essential oil into plastic containers to diffuse. EO&#x27;s eat away at plastic, making the air semi-toxic. While the science is out on a verdict about how dangerous plastic is for your lungs, why risk your families health when you can use glass?  -Migraine relief, and real health benefits from the air - While I know one could argue that a regular diffusers could help me with this, they just didn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;ve been using peppermint and lavender before bed and I&#x27;ve literally not woken up with one single migraine. With my regular humidifier/water based diffuser, it was a regular occurrence as the combination of water renders the diffuser&#x27;s essential oil slightly less effective. This does not use any water...it&#x27;s essential oil only.   -Elegant, I mean look at it! It&#x27;s a piece of art that fits into our decor perfectly!  -Powerful, it throws out some serious oil that stays in the air for hours. HOURS......Awesome!  -Quiet, most nebulizers are incredibly noisy. This one is definitely one of the most quiet. Just a pleasant soft humming noise.  -Easy to clean, just a few drops of isopropyl alcohol does the trick.  -Handmade, I love the unique wood texture. Seriously, as a guy who loves nature, this item fits perfectly.     Cons:    -Power down, while it does shut off after an hour, the led light stays on. I realize that LED lights last forever, but sometimes when you leave for work in the morning it&#x27;s nice to know the light isn&#x27;t going to be on all day (or longer).      Overall, I would have to say I&#x27;m extremely please with this unit. For my family, it&#x27;s been a great addition to our health regimen.</li>
            <li> Despite the somewhat cheesy promotional videos, this is an outstanding product. It has helped those dealing with seasonal allergies to breathe well within just twenty minutes of use. It is quiet, unobtrusive, and effective, filling an entire room with scent within minutes. It works with USB power, which provides a great deal of operational flexibility, and it doesn&#x27;t look like just another piece of plastic junk. No heat that might affect the delicate essential oils, and no water to mess with either. The only quibbles thus far are the two-hour cycle time and the fact that you need to manually turn the LED light off using the front knob, but other than those, this thing is nearly perfect for home use.  ***Update: Even with infrequent use, this item is already dead. Unacceptable longevity for something so pricey and delicate.</li>
            <li> Love this little handmade diffuser! Puts out a good amount of scent. Great for smaller rooms. High ceilings or larger rooms need something a bit bigger. I highly recommend this to anyone. Item came in perfect condition too.</li>
            <li> Really, very disappointed. I bought this so that I could have lavendar and bergamot essential oils diffused in the air for my anxiety that has been outrageous lately. I set it up and did everything according to the directions, but it doesn&#x27;t diffuse. The little light at the bottom turns on and the motor makes noise but nothing happens. Returning it for a refund. So bummed.</li>
            <li> Easy, No Fuss Nebulizer that works great and creates an even more lovely ambiance for you to unwind throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I am not impressed with this item - the instructions are in broken english, the diffuser is not worth the price...it&#x27;s more like a  $20 diffuser.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed. Way over priced.</li>
            <li> Cheap product. Was carefully maintained, cleaned after each use. Only used a couple times a week for slightly over 5 months and now completely dead. Motor wont run.</li>
            <li> I love this EO diffuser! It is very nice looking and is made with high quality materials! I looked a long time before choosing the Trillia because I did not want to use one where the oils were in contact with any type of plastics to avoid any chemical reaction. I viewed a demo on You Tube as well which was also helpful.  The tip portion of the glass nebulizer was broken but Ron with the company was excellent to work with me and got it taken care of very quickly. I am very happy with this purchase and would highly recommend it!!! I would suggest you make sure the tip piece of the glass nebulizer is pointing downward inside the glass nebulizer.</li>
            <li> Great product! Use it all the time and it really does work:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After turning it on the room starts to smell in a matter of minutes. Also great if your sick or have sick kids.. You can put some healing oils and help get rid of that stuffy feeling:)</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic way to enjoy your essential oils for aromatherapy! I have tried the ultrasonic diffusers and they are ok but this is by far the best. It really diffused the oil immediately and the whole room smelled lovely. This product is also very well made and works extremely well. Very happy!</li>
            <li> Stopped diffusing about a month after I got it. Sent back for full refund.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT high quaility diffuser. Whished they made a bigger one for me. IF they do please let me knowl and I will purchase another one. I love this diffuser and very high quality for my good pure oils. It fills the entire room and use it when I sleep all the time. Please let me know if they make a bigger model. It arrived safely also. Thank you.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for an aroma dispenser that does not use water, this one has worked well for me over the past week.  Keep in mind that it does not dispense thick oils like sandalwood; but there are plenty of great oils.  Looks nice too.  Glad for the auto turn off.  I have two others, both that use water, and I like them for various reasons. By dispensing pure oil, it does cover  more area.  I use it in my dinning room (since that is where I stand to work several hours daily), but the aroma does spread further through the house.  UPDATED: Loved it while it worked. It ran fine for 6 months and for no apparent reason, the motor stopped running. It&#x27;s not clear to me how I return or if I can. Wish it still worked because it was wonderful for dispensing across a broad area.  Revised UPDATED: Well, after letting the company know the short lifespan, they allowed me to ship it back so they could verify if the problem was mechanical. Since it was, they replaced it. Hope I get more than 3 months out of the replacement because I LOVE this beautiful and functional oil dispenser.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this diffuser for about 3 months and have used it only about 10-15 times. The first one I got did not work. I returned it for a second one since I was so excited about this product, and I also bought 2 of the handblown glass tops since I read a review that said it&#x27;s handy to have 2 for the stronger scents. I have only switched the tops out once -- I was extremely gentle with it -- and now it looks like the rubber part that holds the top in has torn. It no longer works at all so I now I am outside of the return window and have a $150 piece of handmade trash that I hate to throw away. What a waste! I am terribly disappointed, and I hope this review can prevent other people from experiencing this tremendous let down.  UPDATE 8/11/15: I contacted Trillia via their website and have been in communication with the company. They are working to resolve the issue. I will post another update once it has been resolved, but so far, they are very concerned with ensuring I am happy with the product, which is quite reassuring.  UPDATE 10/27/15: Trillia sent me the newest model and also reimbursed my shipping from returning the first one. It&#x27;s rare these days to find a company that will jump through so many hoops to resolve an issue. I received my Mina III yesterday, and it seems to work very well so far! I am very appreciative of their efforts to make me a happy customer once again!</li>
            <li> So far this little nebulizer has worked great for us. I had a hard time finding one I wanted to order because all of the ones I looked at on Amazon had mixed reviews with either some people loving them and some people saying that they didn&#x27;t work. I spent hours reading about and looking at all of the different options. One of my concerns is that they were all either made out of plastic materials and people claimed they broke fast or didn&#x27;t work well, or they were pretty ugly. I didn&#x27;t want something sitting out in my small house that I didn&#x27;t like the look of. When I found this Trillia wooden and glass nebulizer I was interested but nervous because it appeared to be a newer product as I only had 2 reviews. I decided that I would try it out and I am so glad I choose to buy it. The motor works well and the look of it is nice. I like the quality materials as well. When I turn it on it has four adjustable settings for output and it lights up. It runs for two hours and then the motor shuts off but the light stays on. It really puts out the oils into the air and will fill most of my rooms on the highest setting. If I really want the oils to be put into the air thick and fast I can take the little glass piece off the top that regulates the output. I am glad that it shuts off after two hours instead of having a device that hooks to the bottle. I feel a little more in control of the output this way. I also am happy with the light as I didn&#x27;t want something that was flashy with color options. If I had one complaint it would be that I wish the cord design was a little different. It sometimes seems a little short and I wish it detached from the body so It would be easier to move around for cleaning and putting the oils in. I have had mine for two weeks at the time that I am writing this review and I wish I had a lot more money so I could buy one for every room of my house!</li>
            <li> This is def. worth the price! I use a lot of different essential oils and this is perfect for them, since EO&#x27;s can degrade plastics. It doesn&#x27;t take up much space and diffuses very well. Very easy to clean and operate. All around great product!</li>
            <li> Updated... Broke down a month ago, and before I got into trying to return it, the return window expired. I got the spare top for it right before it broke, so I invested a lot into something that worked for a month. I did clean it as per instructions, one day I plugged it in and it just wouldn&#x27;t start. having said that... This diffuser paired with 4 thieves oil did spare my son a visit to a doctor and allowed me to work instead of taking care of him at home, so I suppose it&#x27;s still worth it, even if it breaks soon. Hence two stars. What else.... Well, it is a work of art. It&#x27;s very beautiful. Maybe I should rate it three stars just for that.</li>
            <li> I love my Trillia diffuser! I looked around for a diffuser for a long time. Like many of the previous reviewers, I didn&#x27;t want to mix my oils with water or have them contact plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first thought when I found this diffuser was how beautiful it is. I think it would be a nice addition to any decor. It is simple and elegant. It also doesn&#x27;t take up much room and it was easy to find a place for it. I have it in my bedroom. I also like that I have the option to plug it into a USB port.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first used the diffuser I was surprised how quickly it worked. Literally after the first minute, the fragrance of my EOs filled my room with the aroma. Even more amazing is that I can also smell the aroma around the corner and down the stairs! Even after it done cycling, the fragrance lingers, sometimes up to days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During operation, it buzzes, but the sound is unobtrusive and not bothersome. I especially like to use this diffuser when I am relaxing or getting ready for bed. The sound neither keeps me from falling asleep nor wakes me up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of clean up,  the glass is very easy to clean by using alcohol. I just swish some around,  pour it out, and let it dry. I bought a replacement glass too, this makes it easier to switch EOs. While one is drying, I use the other. There are some videos on YouTube showing how to care for the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging and the videos indicate that only pure EOs should be used in the diffuser. I have noticed when I used oils from a business who cares about the quality and purity of the EOs that my experience was much better than when I used an inexpensive oil which I don&#x27;t think was pure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely purchase this again and again! I wish I had bought more than one!</li>
