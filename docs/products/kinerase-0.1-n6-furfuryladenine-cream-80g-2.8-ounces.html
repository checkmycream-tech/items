            <li>This is a good product for smoothing out fine lines.</li>
            <li>, IM ORDERING SOME MORE TODAY...</li>
            <li>I have used Kinerace cream for many years.  </li>
            <li>I have also used in more humid climates and it soaks into my skin immediately, never giving me that greasy, oily feel.</li>
            <li>Love Kinerase products.</li>
            <li>--I dont think its authentic.</li>
            <li>I plan to buy more.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>This is the best over-the-counter facial cream I have used</li>
            <li>and I have tried many.</li>
            <li>but I sure wish it was cheaper</li>
            <li>We have purchased on more than one occasion and will continue to.</li>
            <li>more try.  </li>
            <li>and I waited until now to rate it to know for sure</li>
            <li>At first I couldn&#x27;t figure out what was making my skin look so good (sans wrinkles)</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the cost!!</li>
            <li>I could not live without it and Amazon has the BEST price.</li>
            <li>It minimizes fine lines and keeps skin healthy looking.</li>
            <li>I moved to Denver where the climate is VERY dry and this cream is just perfect.</li>
            <li>and I, like many others found I could go without makeup, but use it anyway and look fantastic.  </li>
            <li>The price was the best I found, $30+ less than most sellers.</li>
            <li>Well, I am living proof that this is definitely true!</li>
            <li>I like it, my face easy oily in daytime.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>It is not greasy, has no odor and goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>Skin feels refreshed and smooth.</li>
            <li>My foundation goes on smoothly over it.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for many years and my skin proves it.</li>
            <li>The formula they used 10 years ago has changed and I liked the old one better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Kinerase Cream with SPF15 for the past 5 years or so, and must say it&#x27;s been wonderful.  </li>
            <li>but Amazon.com usually has the best price for this product name.</li>
            <li>I have been using the ROC deep wrinkle night cream and wanted to try this since it has a better score on the hazardous cosmetics rating</li>
            <li>You should apply to clean skin and let it soak in and then follow with moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It does a good job of moisturizing but not as well as the Ultimate day moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how it smooths the skin so quickly</li>
            <li>Ships quickly.</li>
            <li>I could tell a difference right away.  </li>
            <li>The fine lines and freckle-like sun damaged areas have minimally improved but the overall texture of my skin has improved greatly and it also seems to have minimized the pores around my nose.  </li>
            <li>this is the only cream i have been able to use without my skin breaking out and the results are tremendous.  </li>
            <li>hope, I will see more improvement over the next month.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel that the lotion was quite moisturizing enough for my neck and chest area, but it was appropriate for my face which is prone to breakouts.</li>
            <li>This product was originally recommended as an alternative for retinol products for use on sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>My skin is absolutely wonderful and I am always guessed to be in my mid to late 30&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely gentle and nourishing on the skin.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts yet moisturizes my skin very well.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say that its a miracle cream that makes you look longer or helps wrinkles</li>
            <li>64 year old woman - used Kinerase for several years - love it.  </li>
            <li>Either it was too drying or didnt clean well enough or the worst....too greasy!!  </li>
            <li>I was never sure about Kinerase&#x27;s results, I didn&#x27;t see anything amazing to warrant the price.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t seem to live without this product!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many, many others including some expensive name brands, and nothing has come close to Kinerase.  </li>
            <li>As I enter the end of the \\&quot;panic decade\\&quot; for women--the 50s, I am staying with this one as I accept the realities of being that older woman.</li>
            <li>and my skin is very soft!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended..</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>PRICE TOO HIGH FOR PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive to most other products, but never breaks out from this.  </li>
            <li>I have very very sensitive skin/mild rosacea and have been using this product for about a year.</li>
            <li>As for diminishing fine lines or wrinkles I have not noticed a difference as I have dry skin and my main concern is to keep my skin from drying out especially during the winter months.  </li>
            <li>Sinks in quickly.</li>
            <li>I have a sprinkling of sun damage on my cheek bones and a few fine lines around my eyes</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin clear and hydrated without leaving a greasy feel.  </li>
            <li>but I decided to try the cream version in early March.  </li>
            <li>but it definitely does moisturize very well</li>
            <li>I tried this product last year for a few months and it was OK.  </li>
            <li>I have used Kinerase Ultimate Day moisturizer in the past and found this one when looking to reorder.&lt;br /&gt;It had more of the ingredients I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>I definitely feel that this product is priced way too high for what it delivers.</li>
            <li>in night time, I need more hydrating or moisture.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not good writer.</li>
            <li>As for the cream, it has only been a month since I started using it, but I really haven&#x27;t seen any noticable improvement in the lines that I&#x27;m starting to get on my neck and chest.</li>
            <li>I am 35 with very sensitive, dry, and acne prone skin and this is the ONLY product that really works.</li>
            <li>merry go round, this one is worth  one</li>
            <li>So much so, I had to use it only every other day.</li>

            <li> merry go round, this one is worth  one</li>

            <li> The price may seem steep at first but this size will last at least 2 months using it</li>
            <li> but it is the only moisturizer that will get me through the winter and keep my skin from getting too dry.</li>
            <li> It also somehow made my breakouts MUCH less frequent.</li>
            <li> Moving from FL to AZ (frying pan to fire), this product has been a godsend for my skin - especially in the dry Arizona dessert area.</li>
            <li> Yes it is pricey, and I normally do not spend a lot of money on facial products, but this is the exception.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say I went right back on my regime with Kinerase!  </li>
            <li> but while I can&#x27;t resoundingly recommend it, I would say that it is above average for its retexturizing ability.</li>
            <li> I suppose I expected a lot out of the product for the price</li>
            <li> This product is expensive, but it spread really well, so a tube lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> have wrinkling around the eyes and mouth, have spent a small fortune on this entire regime, and have zero results.  </li>
            <li> She loves how it goes on and that a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It does improve the appearance of the skin even diminishing existing minor skin lesions in very little time.</li>
            <li> I have used Kinerese since I was approximately 30 years old.</li>
            <li> I am 55 years old, and my age spots have slowly disappeared over the years since I started using this product, and I have very few wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> Kinerase has not let me down.</li>
            <li> My complaint is that for this price, you should be moisturized all day long (like my unrefined shea butter does and for 1/10th of the cost).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this, it is much too expensive and doesn&#x27;t keep it&#x27;s promises and doesn&#x27;t moisturize my skin hardly at all.</li>
            <li> After using this product for just a few days, my skin was, and has remained, noticibly smoother.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> even few hours after delivering my baby.)</li>
            <li> too bad it costs so much!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately Kinerase no longer makes the cream with sunscreen, so I&#x27;m switching over to their ultimate day moisturizer.</li>
            <li> To the reviewers who complained that  it does not moisturize, you are correct.</li>
            <li> When I say I have tried everything, I mean it.  </li>
            <li> so its not so bad.  </li>
            <li> I hate to imagine what my skin would have looked like</li>
    </ol>

            <li> FAST SHIPPING AND PERFECT PRODUCT, IM ORDERING SOME MORE TODAY...YOU CANT BEAT THE PRICE....      MARK R.    RALEIGH NC</li>
            <li> I have used Kinerase Ultimate Day moisturizer in the past and found this one when looking to reorder.&lt;br /&gt;It had more of the ingredients I was looking for.  It does a good job of moisturizing but not as well as the Ultimate day moisturizer.  As for diminishing fine lines or wrinkles I have not noticed a difference as I have dry skin and my main concern is to keep my skin from drying out especially during the winter months.  Kinerase has not let me down. It is not greasy, has no odor and goes on smoothly.  It&#x27;s a little pricey but it is the only moisturizer that will get me through the winter and keep my skin from getting too dry.</li>
            <li> Nothing I have found has ever equalled this cream for irregular skin tones.  It works every time, all the time.  Skin feels refreshed and smooth. Great product, a bit pricey but you do get what you pay for! A tube usally lasts me about 2 months.  Highly recommended..</li>
            <li> You only need about a pea sized amount for the entire face. I found it creamy and moisturizing without being greasy. Sinks in quickly. The finished look was quite matte. After about an hour, my face didn&#x27;t feel quite as moisturized anymore. My complaint is that for this price, you should be moisturized all day long (like my unrefined shea butter does and for 1/10th of the cost). I definitely feel that this product is priced way too high for what it delivers.</li>
            <li> I have used this cream for years now: It was recommended by a dermatologist. It is the best ....you will not be dissapointed if you purchase this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Kinerase Cream with SPF15 for the past 5 years or so, and must say it&#x27;s been wonderful.  I&#x27;ve tried many, many others including some expensive name brands, and nothing has come close to Kinerase.  It&#x27;s extremely gentle and nourishing on the skin.  I am 55 years old, and my age spots have slowly disappeared over the years since I started using this product, and I have very few wrinkles.  This product is expensive, but it spread really well, so a tube lasts a long time.  Unfortunately Kinerase no longer makes the cream with sunscreen, so I&#x27;m switching over to their ultimate day moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Kinerase is wonderful for aging skin.  It minimizes fine lines and keeps skin healthy looking.</li>
            <li> I have been using the ROC deep wrinkle night cream and wanted to try this since it has a better score on the hazardous cosmetics rating but it doesn&#x27;t moisturize and it doesn&#x27;t help my wrinkles, especially under my eyes. I would not recommend this, it is much too expensive and doesn&#x27;t keep it&#x27;s promises and doesn&#x27;t moisturize my skin hardly at all.</li>
            <li> I have used Kinerace cream for many years.  This product was originally recommended as an alternative for retinol products for use on sensitive skin.  The delivery was timely and I will undoubtedly continue ordering this product.</li>
            <li> i have t-zone skin and thought that this product was not hydrating enough at all and i would definitely not get it again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for about 3 years and can&#x27;t say enough about it. I moved to Denver where the climate is VERY dry and this cream is just perfect. I have also used in more humid climates and it soaks into my skin immediately, never giving me that greasy, oily feel. It is definitely worth the cost!!</li>
            <li> Love Kinerase products. This one has different ingredients than the ones sold at the Kinerase site.  The formula they used 10 years ago has changed and I liked the old one better.  Do not buy this on Amazon though--I dont think its authentic. But it from Kinerase or Skin Store.</li>
            <li> I bought Kinerase because I heard it would help with bruising on my forearms. I am a month into using it and I can see improvement. I was told it would take two months and suspect, and hope, I will see more improvement over the next month. I plan to buy more.</li>
            <li> This is awesome stuff.  I could tell a difference right away.  I wish it was more affordable though!</li>
            <li> I have used Kinerese since I was approximately 30 years old. I will turn 52 tomorrow. My skin is absolutely wonderful and I am always guessed to be in my mid to late 30&#x27;s. Looks like this stuff works!</li>
            <li> I have been using Kinerase Lotion since January but I decided to try the cream version in early March.  I didn&#x27;t feel that the lotion was quite moisturizing enough for my neck and chest area, but it was appropriate for my face which is prone to breakouts. I have a sprinkling of sun damage on my cheek bones and a few fine lines around my eyes (I&#x27;m 44) so those were my initial target areas.  The fine lines and freckle-like sun damaged areas have minimally improved but the overall texture of my skin has improved greatly and it also seems to have minimized the pores around my nose.  It also somehow made my breakouts MUCH less frequent. As for the cream, it has only been a month since I started using it, but I really haven&#x27;t seen any noticable improvement in the lines that I&#x27;m starting to get on my neck and chest. I suppose I expected a lot out of the product for the price but while I can&#x27;t resoundingly recommend it, I would say that it is above average for its retexturizing ability.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist gave me a sample. At first I couldn&#x27;t figure out what was making my skin look so good (sans wrinkles) and then I figured it out</li>
            <li> 64 year old woman - used Kinerase for several years - love it.  My skin is sensitive to most other products, but never breaks out from this.  Skin is supple and feels great.</li>
            <li> This is a good product for smoothing out fine lines. To the reviewers who complained that  it does not moisturize, you are correct. But it is not supposed to. Read the directions. This is a treatment, not a moisturizer. You should apply to clean skin and let it soak in and then follow with moisturizer. After using this product for just a few days, my skin was, and has remained, noticibly smoother.</li>
            <li> Love Kinerase! Have been using this in the morning under moisturizer for years and am often told how good my skin looks. Wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use it all the time. It works wonders. My doctor recommended it to me. A must buy!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t seem to live without this product!  Yes it is pricey, and I normally do not spend a lot of money on facial products, but this is the exception.  It doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts yet moisturizes my skin very well.  My foundation goes on smoothly over it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over ten years now. I hate to imagine what my skin would have looked like if I never used this product! I highly recommend it. I&#x27;ve looked elsewhere online but Amazon.com usually has the best price for this product name. All kinerase products are excellent.</li>
            <li> This is the best over-the-counter facial cream I have used and I have tried many. It does improve the appearance of the skin even diminishing existing minor skin lesions in very little time. As I enter the end of the \\&quot;panic decade\\&quot; for women--the 50s, I am staying with this one as I accept the realities of being that older woman.</li>
            <li> I first was told about this product by my dermatologist when undergoing my usual skin cancer cuttings (having been a &#x27;sun bunny&#x27; growing up at the beach in FL). Was told this was an excellent moisturizer and also faded &#x27;sun spots&#x27; on the face and neck area.  Well, I am living proof that this is definitely true! Moving from FL to AZ (frying pan to fire), this product has been a godsend for my skin - especially in the dry Arizona dessert area. I could not live without it and Amazon has the BEST price. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Excellent but I sure wish it was cheaper</li>
            <li> Everything was as ordered and arrived in a timely manner.  We have purchased on more than one occasion and will continue to.</li>
            <li> I am now on day 28 of Kinerase&#x27;s \\&quot;28 days to younger skin\\&quot; program.  I am 41, have wrinkling around the eyes and mouth, have spent a small fortune on this entire regime, and have zero results.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 36 with combination skin, prone to some acne... this is the only cream i have been able to use without my skin breaking out and the results are tremendous.  Since I started using Kinerase cream, people compliment my skin (even few hours after delivering my baby.)... the truth I&#x27;m amazed myself.  Kinerase worths every penny, believe the hype.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years upon the recommendation of my dermatologist and have had consistently good results.  The vendor that I used received the order on a Tuesday in California and I received my product on Thursday in Florida.  The price was the best I found, $30+ less than most sellers. I hope California revises their tax policy so that I can again use this seller.  [[ASIN:B000EGILRE Kinerase 0.1% N6-furfuryladenine Lotion (80ml)   2.8 Ounces]]</li>
            <li> Have been using Kinerase since my mid-forties. Almost 20 years later, I&#x27;ve never needed injections, chemical peels or surgery.  Best product on the market.</li>
            <li> I like it, my face easy oily in daytime.&lt;br /&gt;But in night time, I need more hydrating or moisture.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not good writer.</li>
            <li> I tried this product last year for a few months and it was OK.  When I came back to buy it again, the price has doubled. I paid $76 not six months earlier, and it was sold by Amazon.  I would never pay the asking price for this.  Since then, I discovered Lancome&#x27;s Visionnaire and I&#x27;m blown away. You get almost immediate results.  So much so, I had to use it only every other day. I don&#x27;t know how it smooths the skin so quickly but your face looks like it has makeup on and I, like many others found I could go without makeup, but use it anyway and look fantastic.  I was never sure about Kinerase&#x27;s results, I didn&#x27;t see anything amazing to warrant the price. Moved on.</li>
            <li> The Kinerase products are my favorites for aging skin care.  I have been using them for years and often get favorable comments about my beautiful skin.  I am 77.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with Kinerase and wished I had been more consistent in my use of it.</li>
            <li> I am 35 with very sensitive, dry, and acne prone skin and this is the ONLY product that really works. I was my face with cetaphil and aveeno and then use this product after, morning and night.  It keeps my skin clear and hydrated without leaving a greasy feel.  I saw results in about a week and I would recommend this product to anyone, with problem skin or not.  The price may seem steep at first but this size will last at least 2 months using it 2x&#x27;s daily so its not so bad.  When I say I have tried everything, I mean it.  7 years ago I started having problems with my skin and tried everything from Proactive to Accutane with my dermatologist as well as almost every over the counter product.  Either it was too drying or didnt clean well enough or the worst....too greasy!!  After I had been using this product for about 6 months I decided to try something else to try to save some money and within 1 week my skin started to act up again.  Needless to say I went right back on my regime with Kinerase!  If you are fed up with the product merry go round, this one is worth  one more try.  I &#x27;ve used this for almost a year now and I waited until now to rate it to know for sure if it was all it seemed cracked up to be.  It is now one of my Must haves!!</li>
            <li> PRICE TOO HIGH FOR PRODUCT. LOOK FOR SOMETHING ELSE. I have very very sensitive skin/mild rosacea and have been using this product for about a year. Recommended by my dermatologist. This is the only cream I have found that does not catch my face on fire or make my eyes water. I can&#x27;t really say that its a miracle cream that makes you look longer or helps wrinkles but it definitely does moisturize very well and my skin is very soft! I use it every morning under makeup and every night before bed. Ships quickly. too bad it costs so much! I will look for something else.</li>
            <li> Kinerase Cream has been great for my wife&#x27;s skin.  She loves how it goes on and that a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This is a great item. I am sure anyone that buys it will not be sorry.  It makes your skin feel wonderful!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many years and my skin proves it.</li>
