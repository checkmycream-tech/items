            <li>I LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>It came out perfectly smooth and frizz free.  </li>

            <li>and I love the Agadir line normally.</li>
            <li>a quarters worth is all it takes.</li>
            <li>and I have sprayed just a tiny bit on after using another product just to make my hair smell nice.  </li>
            <li>LOVE this product, my hair is super dry and this makes it look like silk !!  </li>

            <li>It smells great, protects the hair from heat damage caused by flat ironing and most importantly is light weight and doesn&#x27;t leave African American hair weighted down and greasy.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair look soft and moisturized after a nice Dominican set and blow dry.</li>
            <li>Great product to protect and tame frizzy hair from hot tools like curling and flat irons.</li>
            <li>It really tames fly-aways and diminishes the look of my split ends.</li>
            <li>Make sure to use when hair is wet before using any heat appliances or roller set.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a hair stylist and I can tell you that&#x27;s the price here on Amazon is much cheaper than the beauty supply companies that sell it.</li>
            <li>Spray this on and use the straight iron</li>
            <li>this is a quality product that leaves my hair very silky, fast.</li>
            <li>I used about 4 sprays on my long hair prior to blow drying and the results were truly amazing.  </li>
            <li>I just spray this lightly on my hair (don&#x27;t use too much), comb it through to distribute it evenly, then blow it dry.  </li>
            <li>I have thick, colored hair, and am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>It gets very dry and brittle, I noticed far more breakage using this product</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair tangle free and protects it from the heat when you dry your hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair was soft, frizz free, and actually straighter!  </li>
            <li>Makes your hair straight and soft!  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Would most definitely recommend if you are an curling iron/ flat iron girl</li>
            <li>I had my hair flat ironed with it, and I got so many compliments all week long.</li>
            <li>Then I moved to a new town and found a new hairdresser.  </li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>Yes!&lt;br /&gt;I have fine hair, and just a little mist does the trick.</li>
            <li>I will try to be a little more liberal the next time I use it</li>
            <li>It leaves my daughter&#x27;s hair so soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I have curly hair and have worn it in it&#x27;s natural state for years.  </li>
            <li>My hair looked soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>It also leaves hair and skin soft.  </li>
            <li>I use for styling my natural when I straighten my locs.  </li>
            <li>Your hair is not wet from the product.  </li>
            <li>But you have to be very careful not to use too much...</li>
            <li>I usually order this through the salon that does my hair and pay double this price, but this product is worth it.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> In the past I could never get it straight</li>
            <li> But, in the winter my hair gets flat from being under a hat all the time</li>
            <li> I flat iron my hair and wanted to use something to protect my hair.  </li>
            <li> She used just this on my hair and blew it dry using only her fingers because that&#x27;s how I told her I dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> and after I blow dry and style my hair.  </li>
            <li> Its like a dry mist that protects your hair.</li>
            <li> I might have sprayed a little too much on, I&#x27;m not sure.  </li>
            <li> This product I thought when I ordered it was going to be a wet spray, however when you spray it on your hair its a dry spray.  </li>
            <li> If you have curly, frizzy-type of hair, this will make your hair oily despite using only a little bit.</li>
            <li> I use this on my wet hair.....</li>
            <li> This stuff is a bit oily though so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased other Argan oil products that have a synthetic smell.  </li>
            <li> My hair is coarse like Scary Spice&#x27;s natural hair from the Spice girls (Mel B).</li>
            <li> and it makes my hair really soft, however the only drawback is that because it has an oil base, it made my hair look oily and flat.  </li>
            <li> just a few mists...as it can make your hair look oily.  </li>
            <li> Wrong item, they sent me regular  argan oil !!!!</li>
            <li> But for those with thick hair</li>
            <li> Too bad can&#x27;t find it locally here (Houston) at any retailer that way you can just return it.</li>
            <li> or if I did it was limp from using the wrong products.  </li>
            <li> My sister doesn&#x27;t have as curly or frizzy hair as I do, but she hated the film left on their hair.</li>
            <li> Hopeful, but doubtful</li>
            <li> I hated this product, Threw it in the trash.</li>

            <li> Wrong item, they sent me regular  argan oil !!!!&lt;br /&gt;Only 2 sample hair shield 450 :)) it is funny!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed , i am going to return it!</li>
            <li> I tried this because it&#x27;s. got argon oilin it ,plus the 450 heat protection. It does what it says it will do. I use agaric 4oz bottles. I use this on my wet hair.....a quarters worth is all it takes.I&#x27;ll never run out of these. I am going to keep my ship mention coming.</li>
            <li> Great product , very happy to find this on here make my hair looks great and provide the protection needed .</li>
            <li> Love this product!  I use it before and after I blow dry and style my hair.  I love that I can apply a lot of this and go to sleep with it and it not look oily in the morning.  It really tames fly-aways and diminishes the look of my split ends.</li>
            <li> I really liked it very much!!! It is a wonderful product. I am very happy with it. Will recommend it.</li>
            <li> If you have curly, frizzy-type of hair, this will make your hair oily despite using only a little bit. I hated this product, Threw it in the trash. My sister doesn&#x27;t have as curly or frizzy hair as I do, but she hated the film left on their hair. I don&#x27;t know .. some people like it. We just didn&#x27;t. Too bad can&#x27;t find it locally here (Houston) at any retailer that way you can just return it.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product, my hair is super dry and this makes it look like silk !!  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It leaves my daughter&#x27;s hair so soft and silky.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  I have curly hair and have worn it in it&#x27;s natural state for years.  But, in the winter my hair gets flat from being under a hat all the time so I try to straighten it after my shower.  In the past I could never get it straight or if I did it was limp from using the wrong products.  I tried LOTS of products.  Then I moved to a new town and found a new hairdresser.  She used just this on my hair and blew it dry using only her fingers because that&#x27;s how I told her I dry my hair.  It came out perfectly smooth and frizz free.  Hopeful, but doubtful, I went home and repeated what she did and it worked!  No kidding.  I just spray this lightly on my hair (don&#x27;t use too much), comb it through to distribute it evenly, then blow it dry.  That&#x27;s it!  Perfectly straight, smooth, shiny hair that&#x27;s not greasy at all!  I&#x27;ll use this product all the time now.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair look soft and moisturized after a nice Dominican set and blow dry. I had my hair flat ironed with it, and I got so many compliments all week long. My hair looked soft and shiny. Make sure to use when hair is wet before using any heat appliances or roller set. Feel free to use as a sheen after style. My hair is coarse like Scary Spice&#x27;s natural hair from the Spice girls (Mel B).</li>
            <li> Love love love this stuff. Its $28 in the store, so i was really happy with the price. Humidity frizz&#x3D;gone. Heat damage&#x3D;gone. Shiny hair&#x3D; Yes!&lt;br /&gt;I have fine hair, and just a little mist does the trick. Definitely don&#x27;t overdo it or your hair will be greasy.</li>
            <li> WOW! Agadir Argan Hair Shield made my dry, wavy, fine hair look like SILK!  I used about 4 sprays on my long hair prior to blow drying and the results were truly amazing.  My hair was soft, frizz free, and actually straighter!  It was NOT sticky or too oily!  No weird residue that day or the following.&lt;br /&gt;Truly one of the BEST heat protectors I&#x27;ve ever used!  Highly Recommend!</li>
            <li> I usually order this through the salon that does my hair and pay double this price, but this product is worth it.  It leaves your hair tangle free and protects it from the heat when you dry your hair.  It also leaves hair and skin soft.  Love this product!</li>
            <li> Makes your hair straight and soft!  Also smells very nice!</li>
            <li> This product I thought when I ordered it was going to be a wet spray, however when you spray it on your hair its a dry spray.  Your hair is not wet from the product.  Its like a dry mist that protects your hair.,  You know the product is on your hair when I ironed it you see the steam from the iron.  Love Love it</li>
            <li> My hair dresser uses this and i always loved the way my hair smelled and felt after leaving her so i bought it and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  This stuff is a bit oily though so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Great product to protect and tame frizzy hair from hot tools like curling and flat irons. I&#x27;m a hair stylist and I can tell you that&#x27;s the price here on Amazon is much cheaper than the beauty supply companies that sell it. How can we even resale it with a profit if it&#x27;s sold to us for much more than we can buy it on Amazon?</li>
            <li> Love this! It smells great, protects the hair from heat damage caused by flat ironing and most importantly is light weight and doesn&#x27;t leave African American hair weighted down and greasy.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, hair is protected, smells really nice as well. Would most definitely recommend if you are an curling iron/ flat iron girl</li>
            <li> Best stuff for straightening curly hair.</li>
            <li> My beautician used this on my hair and I loved i.  I am buying this for gifts my family.  Spray this on and use the straight iron and it smells great.  It also helps with tangles.</li>
            <li> I flat iron my hair and wanted to use something to protect my hair.  I had used the Agadir Argan Oil before so I thought this would be a good choice.  It gives my hair a lovely scent and a very nice sheen.  But you have to be very careful not to use too much...just a few mists...as it can make your hair look oily.  I have thick, colored hair, and am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time!  It has a wonderful aroma which I love and it makes my hair really soft, however the only drawback is that because it has an oil base, it made my hair look oily and flat.  Now it might have been my fault....I might have sprayed a little too much on, I&#x27;m not sure.  But for those with thick hair I&#x27;m sure you would love it!  I don&#x27;t dislike it, like I said it has a wonderful aroma to it and I have sprayed just a tiny bit on after using another product just to make my hair smell nice.  You just have to try it for yourself and make your own judgement.  Everyone&#x27;s hair is different. I will try to be a little more liberal the next time I use it and no doubt it will work better.....it did when my hairdresser used it lol....guess I have a &amp;#34;heavy finger&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I have been using Argan Oil for 2 yrs and absolutely love it.  I will definitely purchase again without a doubt!</li>
            <li> My stylist used this product on my hair and I had to have it.  Best when used in your hair before blow drying.</li>
            <li> Great product! I use for styling my natural when I straighten my locs.  If you use argan oil this is a very good choice.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.  It smells amazing - very natural.  I&#x27;ve purchased other Argan oil products that have a synthetic smell.  this is a quality product that leaves my hair very silky, fast.</li>
            <li> I like this product! My hair is not sticky</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair that&#x27;s wavy, I straighten it almost every day. It gets very dry and brittle, I noticed far more breakage using this product and I love the Agadir line normally. I quit using it almost immediately.</li>
