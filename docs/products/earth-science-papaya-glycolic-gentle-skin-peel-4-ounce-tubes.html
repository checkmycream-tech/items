            <li>That&#x27;s the good news healthwise!  </li>
            <li>This peel is great, I bought it for my two teenaged girls for their acne and use it myself.</li>
            <li>very effective.</li>
            <li>But the papaya enzymes do the scrubbing on their own!  </li>
            <li>I read some where that Papaya was good for the skin.  </li>
            <li>But not all was good . .</li>
            <li>Good buy.</li>

            <li>This is a nice peel.</li>
            <li>If you gingerly work with it, you can scrub  with warm water, and get a nice exfoliation out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It did cause some mild blotchy redness that lasted a day, but I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
            <li>stay away from this one, spend some more $ for a good clean peel and read the ingredients!</li>
            <li>One of the best all natural products on the market.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Seems okay.</li>
            <li>would be better suited for my skin.</li>
            <li>i love this mask.</li>
            <li>I have many acne scars and was hoping for something that would lessen them.</li>
            <li>would order this again for sure.</li>
            <li>OK, just your pores.</li>
            <li>is just a drying mask, it&#x27;s ok, but</li>
            <li>This peel worked better than i thought it would.</li>
            <li>Toner is fabulous too - yay for hydraluronic acid!</li>
            <li>But better. :)</li>
            <li>I love the feel of my face once I removed it.</li>
            <li>I loved the smell right off the bat.</li>
            <li>This mask smell delicious, and really leaves my skin smooth and clean without the redness and irritation.</li>
            <li>Its kind of like oatmeal, but its worth it!  </li>
            <li>Feels nice throughout the process and my fianc√©e commented after that my skin looked more taut and shiny, in a good, new skin way.</li>
            <li>This one is a gel, glides on smoothly and rinses off very easily.</li>
            <li>It may be mild and non stinging, but it is effective.</li>
            <li>As with all Earth Science products I have tried, they work beautifully and are made of natural products and cruelty free tested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a healthy (not perfumed scent) which is important for me.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>I feel like this helps keep my skin very clean and smooth, while exfoliating away anything gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I make sure I have a clean washcloth with me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too strong.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s normally just to make me feel good.</li>
            <li>That works just fine.</li>
            <li>After my treatment, my skin was glowing with visible reduction in fine lines.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many facial masques over the years--at varying prices--and can honestly say that this face masque has them all beat!  </li>
            <li>I originally found their clarifying wash at Whole Foods and loved how gentle yet also effective it was.</li>
            <li>It is paraben free, cruelty free, vegan, and gluten free.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of the Earth Science product line.</li>
            <li>after u spread it on the face, it starts reeking of cheap cologne and doesn&#x27;t go away.</li>
            <li>When you wash it off your face is soft and bright and touchy.  </li>
            <li>and it really smelled nice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall: Nice ingredients at a reasonable price</li>
            <li>and I really enjoy it.  </li>
            <li>This does a fantastic job without drying...</li>
            <li>And for anyone like me, who uses retin-a, this is a nice way to exfoliate gently, once or twice a week.)</li>
            <li>It made my skin really smooth and glowing after rinsing it off.</li>
            <li>It makes my face feel clean and smooth</li>
            <li>So that&#x27;s worth it to me!</li>
            <li>once you wash it off, your face feels so clean.</li>
            <li>My face feels clean and looks smoother after.</li>
            <li>It has a strong scent that isn&#x27;t the best, but you actually get used to it once you use this peel regularly.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think this mask did anything special.</li>
            <li>I have been experimenting a lot lately to find the best combination of products for my skin type.</li>
            <li>This is a good to use as a regular face mask, but I did not see any improvement in my skin from directed usage.  </li>
            <li>They love it and it has really helped with their skin.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly and washes quickly</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s mild enough where I&#x27;m sure more treatments wouldn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li>so forth this is way too mild for you.</li>
            <li>, main thing here is that it works!!!</li>
            <li>Although the smell is slightly off putting (smells like a really great pasta sauce?)</li>
            <li>just used it today and can&#x27;t stop touching my face because it feels so soft!</li>
            <li>(not red and irritated; rosy as in healthy looking!)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the best I&#x27;ve used, but this is all natural (so says the bottle) and has less of the yucky chemicals in it....</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t seen much difference in the fine lines and wrinkles just yet</li>
            <li>My husband makes fun of me for using it because I make him stroke my face after I wash it off going &amp;</li>
            <li>: I like the natural ingredients, many of which are derived from plants.</li>
            <li>I love how it&#x27;s mostly natural too.</li>
            <li>So much so, that my 25 year old son commented on how nice my skin looked, that I looked &amp;#34;young &amp; glowing.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>It kind of introduced me to the  benefits of glycolic acid and would like to try stronger formulas in the future.</li>
            <li>like the scent, it&#x27;s natural and refreshing without being medicinal.</li>
            <li>But, the results are so worth it.</li>
            <li>but it left my skin bright, clean and very soft.</li>
            <li>It is a little intimidating at first after reading some of the reviews, but fear not, I have found  the perfect way to remove it to reveal soft, glowing skin underneath!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I ordered another one right</li>
            <li>This product didn&#x27;t make a ton of difference on my scars or discolored areas right away</li>
            <li>I followed the dry removal with warm water - felt so good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Is very gentle.</li>
            <li>do not feel a stinging or tingling effect upon application which tell me the formula is very gentle.</li>
            <li>It gets rid of rashes, fine lines and gives skin that is soft, dewey, and glowing, without foundation</li>
            <li>it leaves your skin feeling wonderfully soft, fresh &amp; clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>The first time I tried it, the smell was so off</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m thinking something with a higher amount of glycolic acid</li>
            <li>Hopefully it works for others, as everyone&#x27;s skin is different :-)</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure not everyone is going to have the same reaction</li>
            <li>THIS PRODUCT HAS SO MUCH GOING FOR IT!  </li>
            <li>I naturally have a good, smooth skin, no acne, nothing out of the ordinary.</li>
            <li>As circulation is a good thing, I feel that I am not only getting instant benefits from using this product, but long-term benefits as well!</li>
            <li>Within one use my skin is super soft and very much improved.</li>
            <li>gave it two stars because my skin is a special sort of sensitive</li>
            <li>i think people get positive result from clay .</li>
            <li>Were the positive results because of the strenuous mask or my incessant scrubbing?</li>
            <li>My skin is also super soft.  </li>
            <li>and my face feels super soft and</li>
            <li>Just make sure to let it dry all the way before removing.</li>
            <li>I found this at Whole Foods.</li>
            <li>I bought this at Whole Foods.  </li>
            <li>It was really noticeable.   </li>
            <li>i really like this product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not an intense peel where my face is burning.</li>
            <li>and this helps a lot, with it being so gentle</li>
            <li>I rated this product, I was into DIY masks and a lot of physical exfoliation that leave the skin smooth.</li>
            <li>but I enjoy it since is only for some minutes</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t really bother me</li>
            <li>I like the texture, but not the smell of the product, so much.  </li>
            <li>which means it really did the job...</li>
            <li>Very herbal.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really see a change at all.</li>
            <li>Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Immediately after treatment my skin feels tighter and very refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this is very grainy and clumpy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really like it.</li>
            <li>When I feel that it has dried on my skin I wash it off with warm water and the washcloth.</li>
            <li>The texture is definitely something different, it appears to be more like a scrub at first, but it&#x27;s a drying mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is not a peel, just a clay mask with not so natural ingredients (the ones they list and also by law they can hide multitude of sins under &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not harsh, nor does it smell funny.  </li>
            <li>I really love this product and cant wait to try other items in this line!</li>
            <li>/&gt;To take it off, I splash once with water then gently rub off with a washcloth and then splash a little more.</li>
            <li>Smooth it on and when dry wash it off with a washcloth.</li>
            <li>It works very well as whole facial peel while still being very gentle.</li>
            <li>Dlivery time was good but not strong or litle bigger as I was expecting.</li>
            <li>found it slightly hard to take off with warm water, just because it wanted to peel off in sheets.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice much of a complexion change as far as &#x27;brightness&#x27; goes</li>
            <li>be gentle around your nose and sensitive areas..</li>
            <li>My skin is left clear, clear, and smooth.</li>
            <li>I have normal skin with some sensitivity issues (</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend using a washcloth or waiting to use it until right before a shower.</li>
            <li>very strong fumes, kind of smells bad and makes my eyes water even if it is nowhere near my eyes</li>
            <li>When I wake in the morning, I&#x27;m usually pale looking and it takes several hours for my circulation to step up; however, immediately after using this product, I find that my facial circulation has improved and I have a nice rosy glow!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s  very soft to your skin after you use it.</li>
            <li>This product looks and have texture like the St. Ives facial scrub but is a little more gentle in texture.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost through my first tube, and I will definitely be purchasing again.</li>
            <li>So far I have had no negative reactions to this.</li>
            <li>(but not all the way), rub it about and it will take the top dead skin cells off, and it did!  </li>
            <li>However for the price point and natural ingredients, I&#x27;m hooked on this brand!</li>
            <li>I am 22 years old with combination skin (dry with an oily t-zone) and mild acne</li>
            <li>This mask works, it makes my face smooth &amp; has helped with my black heads that were plaguing my forehead.</li>
            <li>However, once I washed it off, my skin was so soft that I decided to keep it.</li>
            <li>Gentle enough to use 2-3 times per week.</li>
            <li>I used to have what I thought was hormonal acne, but after using this it&#x27;s completely dissapeared.</li>
            <li>It really does have a weird smell but after you see the results, you really don&#x27;t care.&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>You can feel the natural ingredients repairing your skin when you rub it on.</li>
            <li>I need more time to see if it helps with the recent sunburn damage I have, but I like looking less wrinkly!</li>
            <li>I first cleanse my face, then dry it and put the peel on my face (NOT around eye area).</li>
            <li>My skin feels so clean, firm, and soft without irritation.</li>
            <li>in this &#x27;&#x27;peel&amp;#34; first ingredient is water, 2nd apricot seeds, 3rd bentonite clay.</li>
            <li>, I have very dry skin and was a little worried it would cause my skin to be even dryer, not the case at all, I put this on left it for about 10/15 mins, used warm water to loosen it mask up , then used a wash cloth to remove the rest of it.</li>
            <li>Personally I prefer a light stinging sensation to assure myself that the product is working to remove dead layers of skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is gentle enough to be used daily</li>
            <li>If your looking for some extreme results, example like the first layer or so burnt off, peeling and</li>
            <li>After using it every other day for two weeks my face was much lighter.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping to use this to even my skin tone after a couple bad breakouts in a row left some reddish scars, so I pretty much ripped it open after the post man handed it to me and did what I do with every other product I own - tested it on the inside of my elbow.</li>
            <li>The skin is very soft afterwords without being dry.  </li>
            <li>but there are much easier (less smelly) ways to get the results.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out completely.</li>
            <li>I have dry, mature skin</li>
            <li>My skin is thin and tends to be easily irritated so exfoliation is always a challenge.</li>

            <li> and it really smelled nice.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall: Nice ingredients at a reasonable price</li>
            <li> and I really enjoy it.  </li>
            <li> This does a fantastic job without drying...</li>
            <li> And for anyone like me, who uses retin-a, this is a nice way to exfoliate gently, once or twice a week.)</li>
            <li> It made my skin really smooth and glowing after rinsing it off.</li>
            <li> It makes my face feel clean and smooth</li>
            <li> So that&#x27;s worth it to me!</li>
            <li> once you wash it off, your face feels so clean.</li>
            <li> My face feels clean and looks smoother after.</li>
            <li> It has a strong scent that isn&#x27;t the best, but you actually get used to it once you use this peel regularly.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think this mask did anything special.</li>
            <li> I have been experimenting a lot lately to find the best combination of products for my skin type.</li>
            <li> This is a good to use as a regular face mask, but I did not see any improvement in my skin from directed usage.  </li>
            <li> They love it and it has really helped with their skin.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly and washes quickly</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s mild enough where I&#x27;m sure more treatments wouldn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> so forth this is way too mild for you.</li>
            <li> , main thing here is that it works!!!</li>
            <li> Although the smell is slightly off putting (smells like a really great pasta sauce?)</li>
            <li> just used it today and can&#x27;t stop touching my face because it feels so soft!</li>
            <li> (not red and irritated; rosy as in healthy looking!)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the best I&#x27;ve used, but this is all natural (so says the bottle) and has less of the yucky chemicals in it....</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen much difference in the fine lines and wrinkles just yet</li>
            <li> My husband makes fun of me for using it because I make him stroke my face after I wash it off going &amp;</li>
            <li> : I like the natural ingredients, many of which are derived from plants.</li>
            <li> I love how it&#x27;s mostly natural too.</li>
            <li> So much so, that my 25 year old son commented on how nice my skin looked, that I looked &amp;#34;young &amp; glowing.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> It kind of introduced me to the  benefits of glycolic acid and would like to try stronger formulas in the future.</li>
            <li> like the scent, it&#x27;s natural and refreshing without being medicinal.</li>
            <li> But, the results are so worth it.</li>
            <li> but it left my skin bright, clean and very soft.</li>
            <li> It is a little intimidating at first after reading some of the reviews, but fear not, I have found  the perfect way to remove it to reveal soft, glowing skin underneath!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ordered another one right</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t make a ton of difference on my scars or discolored areas right away</li>
            <li> I followed the dry removal with warm water - felt so good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Is very gentle.</li>
            <li> do not feel a stinging or tingling effect upon application which tell me the formula is very gentle.</li>
            <li> It gets rid of rashes, fine lines and gives skin that is soft, dewey, and glowing, without foundation</li>
            <li> it leaves your skin feeling wonderfully soft, fresh &amp; clean feeling.  </li>
            <li> The first time I tried it, the smell was so off</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m thinking something with a higher amount of glycolic acid</li>
            <li> Hopefully it works for others, as everyone&#x27;s skin is different :-)</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure not everyone is going to have the same reaction</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT HAS SO MUCH GOING FOR IT!  </li>
            <li> I naturally have a good, smooth skin, no acne, nothing out of the ordinary.</li>
            <li> As circulation is a good thing, I feel that I am not only getting instant benefits from using this product, but long-term benefits as well!</li>
            <li> Within one use my skin is super soft and very much improved.</li>
            <li> gave it two stars because my skin is a special sort of sensitive</li>
            <li> i think people get positive result from clay .</li>
            <li> Were the positive results because of the strenuous mask or my incessant scrubbing?</li>
            <li> My skin is also super soft.  </li>
            <li> and my face feels super soft and</li>
            <li> Just make sure to let it dry all the way before removing.</li>
            <li> I found this at Whole Foods.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Whole Foods.  </li>
            <li> It was really noticeable.   </li>
            <li> i really like this product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not an intense peel where my face is burning.</li>
            <li> and this helps a lot, with it being so gentle</li>
            <li> I rated this product, I was into DIY masks and a lot of physical exfoliation that leave the skin smooth.</li>
            <li> but I enjoy it since is only for some minutes</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t really bother me</li>
            <li> I like the texture, but not the smell of the product, so much.  </li>
            <li> which means it really did the job...</li>
            <li> Very herbal.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really see a change at all.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Immediately after treatment my skin feels tighter and very refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this is very grainy and clumpy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really like it.</li>
            <li> When I feel that it has dried on my skin I wash it off with warm water and the washcloth.</li>
            <li> The texture is definitely something different, it appears to be more like a scrub at first, but it&#x27;s a drying mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is not a peel, just a clay mask with not so natural ingredients (the ones they list and also by law they can hide multitude of sins under &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not harsh, nor does it smell funny.  </li>
            <li> I really love this product and cant wait to try other items in this line!</li>
            <li> /&gt;To take it off, I splash once with water then gently rub off with a washcloth and then splash a little more.</li>
            <li> Smooth it on and when dry wash it off with a washcloth.</li>
            <li> It works very well as whole facial peel while still being very gentle.</li>
            <li> Dlivery time was good but not strong or litle bigger as I was expecting.</li>
            <li> found it slightly hard to take off with warm water, just because it wanted to peel off in sheets.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much of a complexion change as far as &#x27;brightness&#x27; goes</li>
            <li> be gentle around your nose and sensitive areas..</li>
            <li> My skin is left clear, clear, and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have normal skin with some sensitivity issues (</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend using a washcloth or waiting to use it until right before a shower.</li>
            <li> very strong fumes, kind of smells bad and makes my eyes water even if it is nowhere near my eyes</li>
            <li> When I wake in the morning, I&#x27;m usually pale looking and it takes several hours for my circulation to step up; however, immediately after using this product, I find that my facial circulation has improved and I have a nice rosy glow!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s  very soft to your skin after you use it.</li>
            <li> This product looks and have texture like the St. Ives facial scrub but is a little more gentle in texture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost through my first tube, and I will definitely be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> So far I have had no negative reactions to this.</li>
            <li> (but not all the way), rub it about and it will take the top dead skin cells off, and it did!  </li>
            <li> However for the price point and natural ingredients, I&#x27;m hooked on this brand!</li>
            <li> I am 22 years old with combination skin (dry with an oily t-zone) and mild acne</li>
            <li> This mask works, it makes my face smooth &amp; has helped with my black heads that were plaguing my forehead.</li>
            <li> However, once I washed it off, my skin was so soft that I decided to keep it.</li>
            <li> Gentle enough to use 2-3 times per week.</li>
            <li> I used to have what I thought was hormonal acne, but after using this it&#x27;s completely dissapeared.</li>
            <li> It really does have a weird smell but after you see the results, you really don&#x27;t care.&#x3D;)</li>
            <li> You can feel the natural ingredients repairing your skin when you rub it on.</li>
            <li> I need more time to see if it helps with the recent sunburn damage I have, but I like looking less wrinkly!</li>
            <li> I first cleanse my face, then dry it and put the peel on my face (NOT around eye area).</li>
            <li> My skin feels so clean, firm, and soft without irritation.</li>
            <li> in this &#x27;&#x27;peel&amp;#34; first ingredient is water, 2nd apricot seeds, 3rd bentonite clay.</li>
            <li> , I have very dry skin and was a little worried it would cause my skin to be even dryer, not the case at all, I put this on left it for about 10/15 mins, used warm water to loosen it mask up , then used a wash cloth to remove the rest of it.</li>
            <li> Personally I prefer a light stinging sensation to assure myself that the product is working to remove dead layers of skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is gentle enough to be used daily</li>
            <li> If your looking for some extreme results, example like the first layer or so burnt off, peeling and</li>
            <li> After using it every other day for two weeks my face was much lighter.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping to use this to even my skin tone after a couple bad breakouts in a row left some reddish scars, so I pretty much ripped it open after the post man handed it to me and did what I do with every other product I own - tested it on the inside of my elbow.</li>
            <li> The skin is very soft afterwords without being dry.  </li>
            <li> but there are much easier (less smelly) ways to get the results.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out completely.</li>
            <li> I have dry, mature skin</li>
            <li> My skin is thin and tends to be easily irritated so exfoliation is always a challenge.</li>
            <li> Definately recommend for someone with acne to tame it, and it really freshes and brightens up your skin after you use it.</li>
            <li> A little messy, but I apply it right before shower, no problem in cleaning,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At first the scent was a little odd to me - almost savory.</li>
            <li> a face cloth or towel with hot water, and simply press it onto the dried peel for a few seconds.</li>
            <li> so I did not want to leave it on too long.</li>
            <li> have oily, acne-prone skin, so can&#x27;t speak to long term efficacy yet.</li>
            <li> I tried this product a number of ways including allowing it to dry before rinsing and rinsing before it dried completely.</li>
            <li> My face started getting dry</li>
            <li> I will have to say I also use vanicream moisturize for my dry skin so that + this face mask never been happier..</li>
            <li> it gets really dry and makes you want to take it off as it dries, but be patient.</li>
            <li> This peel will dry and tighten on your skin.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine trying to remove this dry, that would take hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (&lt;br /&gt;For removing, I also peel it, once it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li> Instead of using this like the directions recommend, she told me to put it on, let it dry a bit then, when it&#x27;s kinda dry</li>
            <li> it on for about 10 minutes and opted to follow another reviewer&#x27;s advice about removing dry with a dry washcloth.</li>
            <li> Apply a thin coat covering your face and neck, let dry, and then soften with a wash cloth immersed in hot water.  </li>
            <li> I was struggling with dry patches and redness as well as a rough texture on my face.</li>
            <li> My skin is a little sensitive and typically oily.  </li>
            <li> The consistency was very thick with large particles.</li>
            <li> Then I use a wet face cloth.</li>
            <li> , I have small bumps on the side of my jaw line and in just one use, they were much smaller, I have been using this mask 2x a week</li>
            <li> I can use every other weekend with no problems.</li>
            <li> but he says that with all of the other products that I used.</li>
            <li> This works extremely well.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that gets little bumps and rashes and itches if anything hard touches it.</li>
            <li> This does take away some of the redness (I&#x27;ve been using it about 3 weeks now every other day or less).</li>
            <li> i will not scrub those delicate areas next time.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a few of their other products, so tried this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will update my previous 3* review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I settled on rinsing after it dried while in the shower - still messy but it just went down the drain.</li>
            <li> I leave it a few minutes longer than recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this a few times now</li>
            <li> yet I feel the tingling sensation for a few minutes after application.</li>
            <li> What a mess!</li>
            <li> so i wanted to start to try to slow down the aging process.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable.</li>
            <li> , this went on thick and dried well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We are both a bit prone to cystic acne and when we have one of these horrible little things coming up we can take care of it quickly with much less pain.</li>
            <li> Oh and the reviews where people say its hard to remove, its not that bad, i use a hand body washer that is mesh from target and gentle exfoliate it off my face.  </li>
            <li> thick texture.</li>
            <li> just take plain AZTEC SECRET</li>
            <li> It has scrubbing grains in it, but the texture is almost like a clay mask, so &amp;#34;scrubbing with this is a little difficult.  </li>
            <li> its a bit hard to take off so I suggest using a damp facecloth, your skin will feel refreshed and glowy afterwards!</li>
            <li> very hard to apply.  </li>
            <li> this peel is very thick and grainy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little hard to scrub off, but that&#x27;s not too bad</li>
            <li> This stuff in serious business!</li>
            <li> Once dried, it was very difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> very  disappointed sending it back.</li>
            <li> It is somewhat difficult to wash off, however.</li>
            <li> Trust me you wont be sorry.</li>
            <li> I am guilty of not using sun blocks and moisturizers.</li>
            <li> Not a chemical-y smell, but an unpleasant one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does smell a bit funky, but it&#x27;s not too bad.  </li>
            <li> this crap I guess.</li>
            <li> , I think if it would be on me for hours it might be annoying</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it smelled too awful</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> i think people get positive result from clay . in this &#x27;&#x27;peel&amp;#34; first ingredient is water, 2nd apricot seeds, 3rd bentonite clay. just take plain AZTEC SECRET and you&#x27;ll get the same effect. you get what you pay for w this crap I guess. i&#x27;ll stick w MyChelle papaya peel. thought i&#x27;d save some $ and try this. OMG the smell! I almost gagged. after u spread it on the face, it starts reeking of cheap cologne and doesn&#x27;t go away. it is not a peel, just a clay mask with not so natural ingredients (the ones they list and also by law they can hide multitude of sins under &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34;). stay away from this one, spend some more $ for a good clean peel and read the ingredients!</li>
            <li> Feels nice throughout the process and my fianc√©e commented after that my skin looked more taut and shiny, in a good, new skin way. It did cause some mild blotchy redness that lasted a day, but I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I have been experimenting a lot lately to find the best combination of products for my skin type. I naturally have a good, smooth skin, no acne, nothing out of the ordinary. That said, I am going on 37 and I am wanted to start taking care of my hair and skin. My skin is thin and tends to be easily irritated so exfoliation is always a challenge. This mask smell delicious, and really leaves my skin smooth and clean without the redness and irritation. I follow-up with an oatmeal mask, and my skin looks noticeably healthier/younger.</li>
            <li> I found this at Whole Foods. The first time I tried it, the smell was so off that I immediately decided I was going to discard the remainder. Not a chemical-y smell, but an unpleasant one. However, once I washed it off, my skin was so soft that I decided to keep it. The next morning, I saw a visible improvement in my skin tone and a reduction of my blemishes. I&#x27;m almost through my first tube, and I will definitely be purchasing again. Gentle enough to use 2-3 times per week. It is somewhat difficult to wash off, however. I would definitely recommend using a washcloth or waiting to use it until right before a shower.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Whole Foods.  I read some where that Papaya was good for the skin.  So I tried it.  I found that it was easier to peel off if I put on a thicker layer.  I also noticed that my freckles started getting lighter.  After using it every other day for two weeks my face was much lighter.  I wish I took before and after pictures. It was really noticeable.   My face started getting dry so I use this once a week now.  My skin is also super soft.  I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that gets little bumps and rashes and itches if anything hard touches it. After turning 30 noticed my skin changed so i wanted to start to try to slow down the aging process. After reading reviews and not wanting to try harsh chemical peel no matter how gentle it says it is, I decided to purchase this product.  Very, very pleased.  It gets rid of rashes, fine lines and gives skin that is soft, dewey, and glowing, without foundation like I&#x27;m 18 again. Would definitely purchase again and recommend.  Oh and the reviews where people say its hard to remove, its not that bad, i use a hand body washer that is mesh from target and gentle exfoliate it off my face.  Trust me you wont be sorry.</li>
            <li> very effective. I wish it smelled nicer, though. it smelly powdery/perfumey to me.</li>
            <li> i ordered the peel with glycolic acidand i received a  scrub that has no papaya or glycolic acid ..very  disappointed sending it back.</li>
            <li> This stuff in serious business! I read the reviews and thought why not give it a shot, I have very dry skin and was a little worried it would cause my skin to be even dryer, not the case at all, I put this on left it for about 10/15 mins, used warm water to loosen it mask up , then used a wash cloth to remove the rest of it. I was amazing truly, I have small bumps on the side of my jaw line and in just one use, they were much smaller, I have been using this mask 2x a week and my face feels super soft and almost all the bumps on my jaw line are gone!! I will have to say I also use vanicream moisturize for my dry skin so that + this face mask never been happier.. I would recommended this 100%</li>
            <li> Seems okay. I didn&#x27;t notice much of a complexion change as far as &#x27;brightness&#x27; goes so I&#x27;m thinking something with a higher amount of glycolic acid would be better suited for my skin. I regenerate skin like a lizard of some sort so this may just be an issue for like people.</li>
            <li> very strong fumes, kind of smells bad and makes my eyes water even if it is nowhere near my eyes</li>
            <li> Best skin peel product. I leave it a few minutes longer than recommended. Works amazing.</li>
            <li> i love this mask. it gets really dry and makes you want to take it off as it dries, but be patient. once you wash it off, your face feels so clean. i really like this product</li>
            <li> This is a good to use as a regular face mask, but I did not see any improvement in my skin from directed usage.  No visible exfoliation or shedding/peeling.  Hopefully it works for others, as everyone&#x27;s skin is different :-)</li>
            <li> This is an excellent face peel. Especially if you are low on funds. Just make sure to let it dry all the way before removing. Works great !</li>
            <li> There is a smell, it isn&#x27;t unpleasent, but... It does have a smell.  When you wash it off your face is soft and bright and touchy.  My husband makes fun of me for using it because I make him stroke my face after I wash it off going &amp;#34;Feel how soft!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I loved the smell right off the bat. I was hoping to use this to even my skin tone after a couple bad breakouts in a row left some reddish scars, so I pretty much ripped it open after the post man handed it to me and did what I do with every other product I own - tested it on the inside of my elbow. After letting it sit for about an hour and not having any allergic reactions, I put it on my face. It tingled a bit being smoothed on, but I figured it was just reacting to the air. A minute into having it on my face it started burning. Thank goodness I was already in the bathroom, because I had to run and wash it off immediately. My skin is still blotchy red a day later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it two stars because my skin is a special sort of sensitive and I&#x27;m sure not everyone is going to have the same reaction and it really smelled nice. I&#x27;m gifting the tube to a friend.</li>
            <li> Definitely keeps the acne at bay and creates an even skin tone. I have many acne scars and was hoping for something that would lessen them. This does take away some of the redness (I&#x27;ve been using it about 3 weeks now every other day or less). I don&#x27;t forsee it helping with the indentations but I&#x27;ll keep trying. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to someone dealing with acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, when I put this on, I leave it on for about 5 minutes. Another reviewer said that it made her skin red so I did not want to leave it on too long. So far I have had no negative reactions to this. Also, it does not sting whatsoever, it just tightens your skin when it&#x27;s on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To take it off, I splash once with water then gently rub off with a washcloth and then splash a little more. That works just fine.</li>
            <li> Caveat: Different skin, different results. This review is based on my experience. I have normal skin with some sensitivity issues (e.g. alcohol-based products).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: I like the natural ingredients, many of which are derived from plants. I tried this product a number of ways including allowing it to dry before rinsing and rinsing before it dried completely. I settled on rinsing after it dried while in the shower - still messy but it just went down the drain. After finishing the bottle, I found the areas where I applied the mask to be tighter and smoother. But not all was good . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The smell reminded me of my stuffing - lots of sage and thyme. The consistency was very thick with large particles. Once dried, it was very difficult to remove. I scrubbed with my loofah to get it all off. Were the positive results because of the strenuous mask or my incessant scrubbing? The world may never know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: Nice ingredients at a reasonable price but there are much easier (less smelly) ways to get the results.</li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, so what works for me might not work for you, but I use this peel about twice a week at night, and it dramatically gets rid of my acne. I used to have what I thought was hormonal acne, but after using this it&#x27;s completely dissapeared. It has a strong scent that isn&#x27;t the best, but you actually get used to it once you use this peel regularly. Definately recommend for someone with acne to tame it, and it really freshes and brightens up your skin after you use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this a few times now and I really enjoy it.  My skin is a little sensitive and typically oily.  I feel like this helps keep my skin very clean and smooth, while exfoliating away anything gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does smell a bit funky, but it&#x27;s not too bad.  It&#x27;s a little hard to scrub off, but that&#x27;s not too bad either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would order this again for sure.</li>
            <li> I love that this product is vegan!  I am 22 years old with combination skin (dry with an oily t-zone) and mild acne and I use this product about twice a week so it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out completely. I like how it tightens my face pores and you can feel it instantly working! its a bit hard to take off so I suggest using a damp facecloth, your skin will feel refreshed and glowy afterwards!</li>
            <li> My face feels clean and looks smoother after. It&#x27;s not an intense peel where my face is burning. Is very gentle. I love how it&#x27;s mostly natural too. Will continue to use. Still waiting on it to fade two acne makes tho. If it can do that I will give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> My mom introduced me to this product. We are both a bit prone to cystic acne and when we have one of these horrible little things coming up we can take care of it quickly with much less pain. It works very well as whole facial peel while still being very gentle. I tend to have oily skin and this helps a lot, with it being so gentle I can use every other weekend with no problems.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff.  Cleans out your pores and sins.  OK, just your pores.</li>
            <li> UPDATE: I will update my previous 3* review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I rated this product, I was into DIY masks and a lot of physical exfoliation that leave the skin smooth. I didn&#x27;t think this mask did anything special. However, I learned a lot about skin care, and I don&#x27;t scrub my face anymore. I had this mask at the back of the drawer, and decided to finish it just to get some space. After two applications, I realized that my redness was reduced A LOT. I wasn&#x27;t even expecting to see any result, I wish I took before/after pics. Unbelievable. I ordered another one right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;This is just a drying mask, it&#x27;s ok, but nothing spectacular. A little messy, but I apply it right before shower, no problem in cleaning,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely prefer my home made oat meal, or aspirin, or sugar masks, they work wonders. I&#x27;m not buying this again.</li>
            <li> i see results already since using for a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t make a ton of difference on my scars or discolored areas right away but it definatly helped my acne after one use!</li>
            <li> Great product!  I try to give myself a facial once a week, and after washing my face I start with this mask to exfoliate, then move on to the Queen Helene Mud mask. This does a fantastic job without drying... it leaves your skin feeling wonderfully soft, fresh &amp; clean feeling.  After my treatment, my skin was glowing with visible reduction in fine lines.  So much so, that my 25 year old son commented on how nice my skin looked, that I looked &amp;#34;young &amp; glowing.&amp;#34;  Perfect!  And you cannot beat the price.  As with all Earth Science products I have tried, they work beautifully and are made of natural products and cruelty free tested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.:  I have never had a problem getting this product off my face after it dries as others have mentioned, nor has it stained my white face cloths.  Apply a thin coat covering your face and neck, let dry, and then soften with a wash cloth immersed in hot water.  I do intentionally scrub in a circular motion to exfoliate my skin.  It&#x27;s not harsh, nor does it smell funny.  Good buy.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I got this peel! It is a little intimidating at first after reading some of the reviews, but fear not, I have found  the perfect way to remove it to reveal soft, glowing skin underneath!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off - this peel is very thick and grainy. Its kind of like oatmeal, but its worth it!  Put a layer on your face avoiding eyes (and hair- it will stick in your hair).  At first the scent was a little odd to me - almost savory. But then I began to get notes of lavender and oats.  Wait 10-15 minutes. This peel will dry and tighten on your skin. I don&#x27;t suggest trying to eat while wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warm a face cloth or towel with hot water, and simply press it onto the dried peel for a few seconds. Do this a few times, It will soften the peel and it will come off much easier.  I can&#x27;t imagine trying to remove this dry, that would take hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels softer and refreshed after using it. I really love this product and cant wait to try other items in this line!</li>
            <li> This is a nice peel. It may be mild and non stinging, but it is effective. The skin is very soft afterwords without being dry.  (&lt;br /&gt;For removing, I also peel it, once it&#x27;s dry. Then I use a wet face cloth. And for anyone like me, who uses retin-a, this is a nice way to exfoliate gently, once or twice a week.) Recommended.</li>
            <li> This peel is great, I bought it for my two teenaged girls for their acne and use it myself. They love it and it has really helped with their skin. Smooth it on and when dry wash it off with a washcloth.</li>
            <li> It works great, leaves skin so smooth I think some people don&#x27;t like the smell, I think if it would be on me for hours it might be annoying but I enjoy it since is only for some minutes and it doesn&#x27;t really bother me, main thing here is that it works!!!</li>
            <li> Although the smell is slightly off putting (smells like a really great pasta sauce?), this went on thick and dried well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it slightly hard to take off with warm water, just because it wanted to peel off in sheets. If you gingerly work with it, you can scrub  with warm water, and get a nice exfoliation out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this product worked well at smoothing my skin. It&#x27;s not the best I&#x27;ve used, but this is all natural (so says the bottle) and has less of the yucky chemicals in it....So that&#x27;s worth it to me!</li>
            <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this because my esthetician recommended it.  I like the texture, but not the smell of the product, so much.  Instead of using this like the directions recommend, she told me to put it on, let it dry a bit then, when it&#x27;s kinda dry (but not all the way), rub it about and it will take the top dead skin cells off, and it did!  I need more time to see if it helps with the recent sunburn damage I have, but I like looking less wrinkly!</li>
            <li> This peel worked better than i thought it would. Haven&#x27;t seen much difference in the fine lines and wrinkles just yet but it left my skin bright, clean and very soft.</li>
            <li> it works!  I feel like the texture is a bit off.  It has scrubbing grains in it, but the texture is almost like a clay mask, so &amp;#34;scrubbing with this is a little difficult.  But the papaya enzymes do the scrubbing on their own!  be gentle around your nose and sensitive areas.. I did have a tiny bit of sensitivity after using this- which means it really did the job... i will not scrub those delicate areas next time.</li>
            <li> This product has improved the look of my skin drastically. I was struggling with dry patches and redness as well as a rough texture on my face. Within one use my skin is super soft and very much improved. The smell is quite...strong though. Very herbal. I didn&#x27;t think it smelled too awful but my fiance made a remark about it being &amp;#34;stinky&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I will be buying this product again when I run out.</li>
            <li> This product looks and have texture like the St. Ives facial scrub but is a little more gentle in texture. It smells like the Oxy Facial Cleaning pads with a hint of citrus. It&#x27;s not too strong. When it goes on it stings just a tiny bit. If you&#x27;re listening to music you probably wouldn&#x27;t even notice. It dries quickly and washes quickly but it&#x27;s not for everyone. My husband says he sees a difference but he says that with all of the other products that I used. It&#x27;s normally just to make me feel good. I don&#x27;t really see a change at all. It makes my face feel clean and smooth but I am looking to get rid of and spots. I thought a peel will get the job done and maybe it will work in younger skin. I am guilty of not using sun blocks and moisturizers. Maybe it&#x27;s just me and not the product.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Immediately after treatment my skin feels tighter and very refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Very thick texture. Does not glide on easily.&lt;br /&gt;Messy removal after drying.&lt;br /&gt;I do not feel a stinging or tingling effect upon application which tell me the formula is very gentle. Personally I prefer a light stinging sensation to assure myself that the product is working to remove dead layers of skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendations:&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a natural/enzyme facial mask, I recommend the Alba Botanica Papaya Enzyme Facial Mask ([[ASIN:B0058WABXG Alba Botanica Papaya Enzyme Facial]] This one is a gel, glides on smoothly and rinses off very easily. It is gentle enough to be used daily yet I feel the tingling sensation for a few minutes after application. I have been using this one for 10 months now. Each 3 oz tub last me for about 3 months with daily application.</li>
            <li> I use this in the shower. I make sure I have a clean washcloth with me. I first cleanse my face, then dry it and put the peel on my face (NOT around eye area). Any leftovers I put on the backs of my hands. When I feel that it has dried on my skin I wash it off with warm water and the washcloth. It has a healthy (not perfumed scent) which is important for me.&lt;br /&gt;When I get out of the shower and see my reflection in the mirror my skin is glowing and radiant.  I have dry, mature skin (I&#x27;m 64) so then I immediately hydrate my skin. I use this once a week. I would venture to say if one has oily skin or is younger, twice a week would be good.&lt;br /&gt;I just used it today and can&#x27;t stop touching my face because it feels so soft!</li>
            <li> I use this as an exfoliate, twice a day. I don&#x27;t let it stay on my face, neck, and decoupage, longer than 2 minutes. My skin is left clear, clear, and smooth. My makeup goes on smoother each morning, after use.</li>
            <li> I positively LOVE Earth Science&#x27;s papaya-glycolic radiant skin masque!  I discovered this product a good twenty-years ago when it was listed in a natural-health newsletter that I subscribed to.  THIS PRODUCT HAS SO MUCH GOING FOR IT!  It is paraben free, cruelty free, vegan, and gluten free.  That&#x27;s the good news healthwise!  Let&#x27;s face it, though gals:  Our #1 reason for buying any beauty product is what it does for our looks!  I have tried many facial masques over the years--at varying prices--and can honestly say that this face masque has them all beat!  It is the only product I have ever used that gives INSTANT RESULTS!  I noticed that immediately after using this product, not only is my face smoother, but the circulation in my face has stepped up!  When I wake in the morning, I&#x27;m usually pale looking and it takes several hours for my circulation to step up; however, immediately after using this product, I find that my facial circulation has improved and I have a nice rosy glow!  (not red and irritated; rosy as in healthy looking!) As circulation is a good thing, I feel that I am not only getting instant benefits from using this product, but long-term benefits as well!</li>
            <li> this is very grainy and clumpy.  very hard to apply.  didn&#x27;t notice a difference.</li>
            <li> It really does have a weird smell but after you see the results, you really don&#x27;t care.&#x3D;) It made my skin really smooth and glowing after rinsing it off. It kind of introduced me to the  benefits of glycolic acid and would like to try stronger formulas in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really like it. It&#x27;s  very soft to your skin after you use it.</li>
            <li> This mask works, it makes my face smooth &amp; has helped with my black heads that were plaguing my forehead. I do use it twice weekly like they recommend but it&#x27;s mild enough where I&#x27;m sure more treatments wouldn&#x27;t hurt. If your looking for some extreme results, example like the first layer or so burnt off, peeling and so forth this is way too mild for you.</li>
            <li> One of the best all natural products on the market.  Order was received as promised and on time.</li>
            <li> Dlivery time was good but not strong or litle bigger as I was expecting.</li>
            <li> You can feel the natural ingredients repairing your skin when you rub it on. I like this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of the Earth Science product line. I originally found their clarifying wash at Whole Foods and loved how gentle yet also effective it was. Toner is fabulous too - yay for hydraluronic acid! I wanted to try a few of their other products, so tried this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the scent, it&#x27;s natural and refreshing without being medicinal. The texture is definitely something different, it appears to be more like a scrub at first, but it&#x27;s a drying mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Left it on for about 10 minutes and opted to follow another reviewer&#x27;s advice about removing dry with a dry washcloth. What a mess! But, the results are so worth it. My skin feels so clean, firm, and soft without irritation. I followed the dry removal with warm water - felt so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have oily, acne-prone skin, so can&#x27;t speak to long term efficacy yet. However for the price point and natural ingredients, I&#x27;m hooked on this brand! I compare it to dermalogica. But better. :)</li>
            <li> This works extremely well. I love the feel of my face once I removed it.</li>
