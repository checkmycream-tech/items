            <li>does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do and smells nice.</li>
            <li>My hair is processed and fine.</li>
            <li>I searched for some time for a clarifying shampoo that is sulfate free and gentle yet effective.</li>
            <li>It was a great product, left my hair feeling light and a lot cleaner.</li>
            <li>This shampoo really fit the bill.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing (leaves hair scented for a while), and it really cleans the product build up out of the hair.  </li>

            <li>Ive used this product a few times now, and first of all I have to use a ton of it to get a good lather going in my hair, and I didn&#x27;t feel it was that much better than some of the cheaper products Ive used in the past.</li>
            <li>It took a bit more than usual to really lather up</li>
            <li>This is a new clarifying shampoo and works well.</li>
            <li>This really strips all the extra product and grease from your hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like starting fresh, my hair even dries faster when I get all the extra build-up off my hair.</li>
            <li>does a good job getting the chlorine out of my hair after a swim without messing up my hair too badly.</li>

            <li> Smells Like plastic.  Seems to be fake or expired product</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Leaves my hair super clean but still moisturized.</li>
            <li> does a good job getting the chlorine out of my hair after a swim without messing up my hair too badly.</li>
            <li> I searched for some time for a clarifying shampoo that is sulfate free and gentle yet effective. This shampoo really fit the bill. It smells amazing (leaves hair scented for a while), and it really cleans the product build up out of the hair.  I have naturally curly hair so being careful to not over-strip the hair is important.  It allows other products to work better because the hair is clean of build up.  The instructions are to use once every 2 weeks unless you use  a ton of products.  I use it as directed and works great.</li>
            <li> Ive used this product a few times now, and first of all I have to use a ton of it to get a good lather going in my hair, and I didn&#x27;t feel it was that much better than some of the cheaper products Ive used in the past.</li>
            <li> Another excellent Moroccanoil product. This is a new clarifying shampoo and works well. It took a bit more than usual to really lather up but that could be a result of the hard water here. I highly recommend this product to any true Moroccanoil enthusiast.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! I would recommend it. I use it once a week to get rid of buildup.</li>
            <li> My hair looks so clean after I use this. I had no idea how blonde my hair was! I guess hair products have been building up. I use this once a week to clean out all the hair product build up.</li>
            <li> I tried to use this to get the color out of my hair since there was a reviewer that said it was bad for their color. That didn&#x27;t work for me. However, it smells nice for a long time after you use it. As others have said it is necessary to condition well afterward, although you will know that when you finish rinsing it out. It makes the hair so dry I really had to gob on my conditioner and leave it on a few extra minutes. I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again mostly because of the price, but it gets the job donw. The bottle says to use every other week, so even they know how harsh it is. I think Neutrogena&#x27;s clear clarifying shampoo is less harsh if that is something you&#x27;re worried about.</li>
            <li> works like nothing else.</li>
            <li> I recently moved to Hawaii and the water is brutal on my hair! I use this once every week and half or two weeks and it&#x27;s amazing!!! I follow up with Joico- Moisture Recovery Conditioner and they work well together. I love this stuff and will continue to order!!! Great for hard water or product build up.</li>
            <li> It was a great product, left my hair feeling light and a lot cleaner.</li>
            <li> does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do and smells nice.</li>
            <li> My hair is processed and fine. Therefore, I use several products on it to protect it from heat and to make it shine. I also find that water from showers, when I travel, adversely affects my hair. Once a month use of Morrocan Oil Clarifying Shampoo brings my hair back to a fluffy shine.</li>
            <li> its a very good shampoo u  can use before treatments.</li>
            <li> Did what it was ment to.</li>
            <li> Good product great seller</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel oily- not clarified.  Won&#x27;t repurchase</li>
            <li> I love this product line, my hair smells soo good after I use it.  The clarifying shampoo is great too, my hair dresser would clarify me and kept telling me that I needed to &#x27;clarify more often at home&#x27; because I have such oily hair.  I always noticed my hair looked great when I left the salon and now I know why.  This really strips all the extra product and grease from your hair.  It&#x27;s like starting fresh, my hair even dries faster when I get all the extra build-up off my hair.</li>
