            <li>This product has variable heat temps and a swivel cord and heats very quickly.  </li>
            <li>BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS YOU CAN EASILY CLEAN</li>
            <li>I ordered this particular Brush Iron that works beautifully and heats up really fast</li>
            <li>but, there is one huge problem with the bristles.  </li>
            <li>THE HEAT IS ADJUSTABLE, THE BRISTLES ARE SMOOTH</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get as hot as I thought it would being that it is labeled as &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34;, but it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I love the iron in general and it is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Until it emitted a loud explosive sound and a bright red flash I really liked this curling iron.</li>
            <li>Good for my short hair.</li>
            <li>The adjustable heat is a plus and the curl is just the right size - smooth and shiny.</li>

            <li>I love these, and I always keep one new one on hand.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too darn hot!  </li>
            <li>They are very easy to replace, but I&#x27;d like to see an extra set included rather than have to send for them.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize this product was made by Helen of Troy, who usually has a great product.  </li>
            <li>Heats up really fast, love the long swivel cord and love the way it can turn my curly, fine hair into something I can actually work with.</li>
            <li>I like it very much</li>
            <li>problem is the cord wires break very fast....</li>
            <li>this is true professional  quality!!  </li>
            <li>Was great for the first 4 months and now the plastic teeth are falling out making it hard to use without getting burned.</li>
            <li>The curling brush does pretty well for me.</li>
            <li>Great styling and long lasting.</li>
            <li>(Helen of Troy manufactures Hot Tools.)</li>
            <li>The rod gets too hot.  </li>
            <li>This brush curling iron is perfect for touch ups when you sleep the wrong way and have to resurrect your hairstyle.  </li>
            <li>This one does exactly that.  </li>
            <li>this is my 6th Hot Tools hot brush.</li>
            <li>The first one&#x27;s brushes just disintegrated after some use</li>
            <li>so I thought perhaps I had it set too hot.  </li>
            <li>It has a 1-inch exposed metal section between the handle and bristles which gets extremely hot and burns you if you touch your skin.  </li>
            <li>gives lots of curl,,,,gets really hot</li>
            <li>It gets too hot and there is no control for that.</li>
            <li>I haveused this hot tools brush for years</li>
            <li>Heats up fast, and stays hot.</li>
            <li>If a store doesn&#x27;t carry them, I order them online easy enough.</li>
            <li>Love this new Brush Iron-professional is the key word.  </li>
            <li>This curler gets to a very high heat that ny hair responds to.</li>
            <li>So hard to find good ones anymore.</li>
            <li>It does curl the hair if you are very cautious in its use.</li>
            <li>She wants one everywhere.  </li>
            <li>Fast response to the order.  </li>
            <li>Shipped fast</li>
            <li>Ready in no time.</li>
            <li>but I will be looking for a different kind in the future.</li>
            <li>The cord is long and easy to manipulate.  </li>
            <li>The brush is extremely overpriced and, for the money, should be a better product.  </li>
            <li>I have order at least 5 of these over the years, they are fantastic and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Love Hot Tools as they are what the professionals use and they last a very long time.</li>
            <li>I was lucky it was not next to my head.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>When my hair tells me it wants to do the opposite of what I want I just get out the Hot Tool and do what I want.....</li>
            <li>The store graciously replaced it with a new one.  </li>
            <li>In May, 2013, I ordered replacement bristles from Helen of Troy and have yet to receive the new ones.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>Hope my new one lasts a lot longer.</li>
            <li>This will work great on my three nieces thick straight and slightly wavy hair.</li>
            <li>this is my second one first one died and had to get a new one .</li>
            <li>This is my second Hot Tools.  </li>
            <li>This is my 2nd Ht1141, the handle of my first one is so sticky I can no longer tolerate using it.</li>
            <li>I have used this same hot brush for years and have always used one.  </li>
            <li>THIS IS MY THIRD HOT TOOLS CURLING BRUSH.  </li>
            <li>HOWEVER, THE REASON IT IS MY THIRD PURCHASE IS THE FIRST TWO DEVELOPED SHORTS IN THE SWIVEL PART OF THE CORD.</li>
            <li>The bristles wear out fast though, so order extra bristles as soon as you buy it.</li>
            <li>But thought the teeth should have last much longer.</li>
            <li>My hair is stick straight and this is the only curling iron that can handle giving me curls.</li>
            <li>One line of the brushes on this one came loose on its first usage.  </li>
            <li>The only brand that gets hot enough to hold a curl or style.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a curling brush that would get hot enough to do the job in a short amount of time.  </li>
            <li>Having to use an old barely working one.</li>
            <li>The negative is the brushes will fall out easily.</li>
            <li>I found no other brush with the power that this one has.</li>
            <li>These Hot Tools hair products work so well that I just don&#x27;t even look for any other brand anymore.</li>
            <li>Major flaw</li>
            <li>AS THEY DO DETERIORATE DUE TO THE HIGHER HEAT USED.  </li>
            <li>It is too bad, because everything else about this brush iron is great.  </li>
            <li>This brush iron sucks heats up fast and stays hot but the bristles break and fall off all over.</li>
            <li>These kind of brush&lt;br /&gt;irons are difficult to find</li>
            <li>Just be careful with the base by the handle, very hot easy to burn face or neck depending on how you turn your hand, but as long as you pay attention you will be fine..</li>
            <li>I love the extra long thin cord.</li>

            <li> I have used this same hot brush for years and have always used one.  </li>
            <li> THIS IS MY THIRD HOT TOOLS CURLING BRUSH.  </li>
            <li> HOWEVER, THE REASON IT IS MY THIRD PURCHASE IS THE FIRST TWO DEVELOPED SHORTS IN THE SWIVEL PART OF THE CORD.</li>
            <li> The bristles wear out fast though, so order extra bristles as soon as you buy it.</li>
            <li> But thought the teeth should have last much longer.</li>
            <li> My hair is stick straight and this is the only curling iron that can handle giving me curls.</li>
            <li> One line of the brushes on this one came loose on its first usage.  </li>
            <li> The only brand that gets hot enough to hold a curl or style.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a curling brush that would get hot enough to do the job in a short amount of time.  </li>
            <li> Having to use an old barely working one.</li>
            <li> The negative is the brushes will fall out easily.</li>
            <li> I found no other brush with the power that this one has.</li>
            <li> These Hot Tools hair products work so well that I just don&#x27;t even look for any other brand anymore.</li>
            <li> Major flaw</li>
            <li> AS THEY DO DETERIORATE DUE TO THE HIGHER HEAT USED.  </li>
            <li> It is too bad, because everything else about this brush iron is great.  </li>
            <li> This brush iron sucks heats up fast and stays hot but the bristles break and fall off all over.</li>
            <li> These kind of brush&lt;br /&gt;irons are difficult to find</li>
            <li> Just be careful with the base by the handle, very hot easy to burn face or neck depending on how you turn your hand, but as long as you pay attention you will be fine..</li>
            <li> I love the extra long thin cord.</li>
            <li> It has ten heat settings so even at setting 5 it gets hot enough to curl my thick stubborn hair.</li>
            <li> In less than 4 months I took it back to the retailer because of many broken bristles.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it for everyday use and for just touch ups.</li>
            <li> I DO LIKE THE EXTRA LONG CORD ON THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> That makes it difficult to put it away somewhere where the cord can be straight and the brush bristles tend to delaminate due to the higher temperature.</li>
            <li> so it curled my hair a little Shirley Temple-ish, even when I twirled it up and down really fast.  </li>
            <li> Replacements take too long to get.  </li>
            <li> I would have rated it a five except for two minor points.</li>
            <li> I air dry my hair</li>
            <li> I am only giving i t4  stars because I have had it just a few days and want to see how it does over the long haul.  </li>
            <li> I gave the brush iron a 4 star rating due to ease of use, adjustable heat, long and flexible cord.  </li>
            <li> After only a few months of use, the bristles began to break off, and the strips of bristles began to shred off the iron.  </li>
            <li> I have to be careful to prevent it from falling out.  </li>
            <li> I just wish there was an auto off feature as I was used to this in other curling irons.</li>
            <li> so I had t learn to use the other hand.  </li>
            <li> Once it exploded in my hand (at setting 5 - can&#x27;t imagine what setting 10 would have done), I checked online and other people have had this problem with Helen of Troy curling irons.</li>
            <li> The replacement bristles that came with the new one are already broken.  </li>
            <li> except that my hair is fairly thin and very naturally curly</li>
            <li> Heavy duty cord,  8&#x27; long, heats up in less than 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li> I keep lowering the heat way down to below medium</li>
            <li> Two down sides:  </li>
            <li> Any less heat is insufficient.  </li>
            <li> It is one of the few curling irons with a 3/4\\&quot; barrel in a brush type.</li>
            <li> Then after a few months those will go to pieces also.  </li>
            <li> I purchased mine at Ulta &amp; it was on sale but still not cheap.  </li>
            <li> Every one of them had missing spots.  </li>
            <li> Not recommended for thick and heavy hair.</li>
            <li> I have very heavy and thick hair, so it does not work as well as on my head.</li>
            <li> Hard to find</li>
            <li> I CAN FIND IN THE STORE AND WITH MY THICK HAIR</li>
            <li> I do not recommend purchasing this item as you will have nothing but problems with broken bristles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy since I&#x27;m going to have to order another one.</li>
            <li> and it still burns any skin or unfortunate</li>
            <li> It has a rotating cord so the cord does not become twisted or damaged.</li>
            <li> I HAD A DIFFICULT TIME OF FINDING ONE WITH THE HEAT THIS ONE GIVES.  </li>
            <li> i have one that the wires are broken and very difficult to fix.</li>
            <li> horrible product!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the best brush iron that I have ever used</li>
            <li> The curling brush does pretty well for me.I just wish there was an auto off feature as I was used to this in other curling irons.</li>
            <li> Love the way this product heats up but, there is one huge problem with the bristles.  I orginally purchased this product in the fall of 2012.  In less than 4 months I took it back to the retailer because of many broken bristles.  The store graciously replaced it with a new one.  The replacement bristles that came with the new one are already broken.  In May, 2013, I ordered replacement bristles from Helen of Troy and have yet to receive the new ones.  Twice, I have called there Customer Service phone number and was advised that they would check on my order and call me back.  As of this writing, I have not received a return phone call.  I do not recommend purchasing this item as you will have nothing but problems with broken bristles.</li>
            <li> works well. my wife loves it.</li>
            <li> Great product and easy to use once you get used to it.  Good for my short hair. Will recommend to friends.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> You can get replacements at:  Consumer service Dept  1 Helen of Troy Plaza  El Paso, TX 79912  USA  Send $1.00 for each row of bristles and a one time charge of $ .50 for shipping/handling.  Be sure to give the model number Brush Curling Iron - Model 1141R</li>
            <li> I love this curling brush. So hard to find good ones anymore. I have bought three or four because they do wear out. (The tip breaks off)</li>
            <li> This was a replacement item. I found no other brush with the power that this one has. I love the extra long thin cord. Replacement bristles from company is an added feature. Great styling and long lasting. Get yours today!</li>
            <li> These Hot Tools hair products work so well that I just don&#x27;t even look for any other brand anymore. If a store doesn&#x27;t carry them, I order them online easy enough. I ordered this particular Brush Iron that works beautifully and heats up really fast except that my hair is fairly thin and very naturally curly so it curled my hair a little Shirley Temple-ish, even when I twirled it up and down really fast.  I am going to order the larger size iron and try that. This will work great on my three nieces thick straight and slightly wavy hair. They&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I bought it when I brook my wrist (dominant hand) so I had t learn to use the other hand.  this was invaluable.  I use it now even though my wrist has healed</li>
            <li> I gave the brush iron a 4 star rating due to ease of use, adjustable heat, long and flexible cord.  I also have issues with the bristles disintegrating.  After only a few months of use, the bristles began to break off, and the strips of bristles began to shred off the iron.  It is too bad, because everything else about this brush iron is great.  I am currently awaiting replacement bristles.  Hopefully they have been better designed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too darn hot!  I keep lowering the heat way down to below medium and it still burns any skin or unfortunate ear part that it gets close to.  It needs to have longer teeth to keep skin away from the heat.  It does curl the hair if you are very cautious in its use.</li>
            <li> Until it emitted a loud explosive sound and a bright red flash I really liked this curling iron. It is one of the few curling irons with a 3/4\\&quot; barrel in a brush type. It has a rotating cord so the cord does not become twisted or damaged. It has ten heat settings so even at setting 5 it gets hot enough to curl my thick stubborn hair. The bristles wear out fast though, so order extra bristles as soon as you buy it. It comes with two extra bristles but they all deteriorate together, and you will need 7 extras.  Then after a few months those will go to pieces also.  Maybe you better order a bunch!  Once it exploded in my hand (at setting 5 - can&#x27;t imagine what setting 10 would have done), I checked online and other people have had this problem with Helen of Troy curling irons. (Helen of Troy manufactures Hot Tools.) I was lucky it was not next to my head. You can check out the reports at SaferProducts.gov which is part of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission.  Helen of Troy needs to monitor the manufacture and safety of its curling irons, which are made in China.</li>
            <li> This product works great.  The cord is long and easy to manipulate.  The negative is the brushes will fall out easily. The price was good compared to Ulta&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li> this is true professional  quality!!  Heavy duty cord,  8&#x27; long, heats up in less than 30 seconds.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have very heavy and thick hair, so it does not work as well as on my head. Sometime I was burned and my hair was stuck on it. Not recommended for thick and heavy hair.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize this product was made by Helen of Troy, who usually has a great product.  The brush is extremely overpriced and, for the money, should be a better product.  I purchased mine at Ulta &amp; it was on sale but still not cheap.  I did not have extra bristles in my package, either. The bristles started bending &amp; tearing up.  I sent off for replacement bristles but have yet to receive them. I have also tried to contact/communicate with Customer Service there and they are clueless.&lt;br /&gt;If you happen to send off for replacement bristles, watch out.  They will cash your check and you may never see the bristles.  I am boycotting all Helen of Troy product.</li>
            <li> The rod gets too hot.  No place to hold it while trying to curl hair.  I would not recommend this curling iron.</li>
            <li> Horrid...stay away.  After 2 months of use, the bristles in this brush started to fall off.  I was left with a  curing brush with several gaps and bald spots within the bristles.  There are 2 replacement bristles, but that was not enough.  Every one of them had missing spots.  I had to return it and although it was beyond the mfg 30 day return policy, amazon stood by me and refunded my money. Thank you amazon!!</li>
            <li> this is my second one first one died and had to get a new one . I like it very much</li>
            <li> This is the only one that my wife will use.  She wants one everywhere.  Fast response to the order.  Will order again.</li>
            <li> Love Hot Tools as they are what the professionals use and they last a very long time.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I looked all over in local stores, but finally had to go to Amazon.  Guess what?  They had it and it works great.</li>
            <li> This is the best curling brush I have ever used, with the exception of one several years ago that used real bristles (not plastic teeth) but that said, this one is great!  Heats up really fast, love the long swivel cord and love the way it can turn my curly, fine hair into something I can actually work with. I am only giving i t4  stars because I have had it just a few days and want to see how it does over the long haul.  One more thing - I like the fact that they included replacement teeth with instructions on how to use.</li>
            <li> I HAD A DIFFICULT TIME OF FINDING ONE WITH THE HEAT THIS ONE GIVES.  ITS JUST PERFECT FOR MY HAIR.  THE CORD IS A REALLY GOOD LENGTH AND DOESN&#x27;T TANGLE.  THE ONE THING I DON&#x27;T LIKE IS, GETTIN REPLACEMENT BRISTLES,  YOU HAVE TO ORDER THEM AND IT TAKES SEVERAL WEEKS TO ARRIVE.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the Hot Tools Brush Iron.  The adjustable heat is a plus and the curl is just the right size - smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> THE HEAT IS ADJUSTABLE, THE BRISTLES ARE SMOOTH SO IT MAKES MY HAIR LOOK NATURAL.&lt;br /&gt;BRISTLE STRIP BREAKS TOO EASILY SO THEY HAVE TO BE REPLACED OFTEN, BUT IS THE BEST CURLING BRUSH I&#x27;ve EVER OWNED</li>
            <li> It stopped working after I had only had it a couple of weeks. I&#x27;m not happy since I&#x27;m going to have to order another one. Having to use an old barely working one.</li>
            <li> This brush curling iron is perfect for touch ups when you sleep the wrong way and have to resurrect your hairstyle.  The only brand that gets hot enough to hold a curl or style.</li>
            <li> This brush iron sucks heats up fast and stays hot but the bristles break and fall off all over. Major flaw hopefully I can get some replacement bristles</li>
            <li> I have order at least 5 of these over the years, they are fantastic and easy to use. I love they fact that their very hot, so it takes no time to do your hair.</li>
            <li> For someone who not proficient with a curling iron, this curling brush is definitely the answer.  Just watch out for burning your ears!!!</li>
            <li> Love this new Brush Iron-professional is the key word.  Works well-high quality. Easy to use. Love the adjustable heat settings.</li>
            <li> Was great for the first 4 months and now the plastic teeth are falling out making it hard to use without getting burned.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it. It is the best tool for your hair. Use it daily.&lt;br /&gt;It. Is easy to use, better than a curling iron.</li>
            <li> Works great love it!!!  Got product the next day</li>
            <li> I like this because of the brush, only one problem the teeth on the brush break.  They only give you two replacements.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a curling brush that would get hot enough to do the job in a short amount of time.  This one does exactly that.  Just be careful with the base by the handle, very hot easy to burn face or neck depending on how you turn your hand, but as long as you pay attention you will be fine.. Great tool for your hair. Will buy again when I need to. Shipped fast</li>
            <li> This product is by far the best  I have used.  The only drawback is that after several months, the &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; start falling out.  Replacements take too long to get.  It would be great if they were sold like the hot brush.</li>
            <li> Unit works well. Love everything about it but the teeth. 10 months later all the teeth are gone. Can buy replacements for those. But thought the teeth should have last much longer. Unit is still working just as good as the day I bought it.</li>
            <li> this is my 6th Hot Tools hot brush. It&#x27;s great for me and only one that suits me perfectly</li>
            <li> Great curling iron...problem is the cord wires break very fast....i have one that the wires are broken and very difficult to fix.</li>
            <li> This Hot Tool Brush is wonderful.....When my hair tells me it wants to do the opposite of what I want I just get out the Hot Tool and do what I want.....I have one home and one always in my Gym bag....Try it ....its the BEST....</li>
            <li> Best curling iron for short hair. Heats up fast, and stays hot. The swivel cord makes curling my hair easy, no tangled cord to hassle with.</li>
            <li> This is my second Hot Tools.  The first one&#x27;s brushes just disintegrated after some use so I thought perhaps I had it set too hot.  One line of the brushes on this one came loose on its first usage.  I have to be careful to prevent it from falling out.  These kind of brush&lt;br /&gt;irons are difficult to find so I thought I would try it again but I will be looking for a different kind in the future.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd Ht1141, the handle of my first one is so sticky I can no longer tolerate using it. Don&#x27;t have any idea how to correct this. Hope my new one lasts a lot longer. Let me know how I can correct the problem.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Two down sides:  It doesn&#x27;t have an automatic shutoff after one hour, which I like for home use. It has a 1-inch exposed metal section between the handle and bristles which gets extremely hot and burns you if you touch your skin.  Very easy to get against your ear when curling the hair in that area.</li>
            <li> My hair is stick straight and this is the only curling iron that can handle giving me curls. I would have rated it a five except for two minor points. The cord is a bit touchy and can&#x27;t be rolled around the iron. That makes it difficult to put it away somewhere where the cord can be straight and the brush bristles tend to delaminate due to the higher temperature. They are very easy to replace, but I&#x27;d like to see an extra set included rather than have to send for them. I love the iron in general and it is very easy to use. I can&#x27;t seem to master an iron with a clamp on it.</li>
            <li> gives lots of curl,,,,gets really hot</li>
            <li> Best curling iron out there.</li>
            <li> I love these, and I always keep one new one on hand.  The reason I keep a spare, though, is that the teeth fall out after about a year.  The rod still heats well, but you can&#x27;t use it without the teeth and I have not found any replacements for them.</li>
            <li> horrible product!! Hair gets stuck in the brush bristles and the plastic bristles fall off brush... it is pretty pointless.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly, handles easily (cord rotates) and I am happy with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Purchased to replace an older &amp;#34;hot tools&amp;#34; device which lasted 12 years.</li>
            <li> I have used this same hot brush for years and have always used one.  The last one I used quit heating up, I tried to order one from a local beauty supply place but kept being told that she would check on the order.  I went on line, found the one I wanted, ordered it and had it within 3 days.  I am extremely happy and will probably order another one before the end of the year.  I will probably order more things from amazon.  Thanks for the great customer service.</li>
            <li> THIS IS MY THIRD HOT TOOLS CURLING BRUSH.  IT GETS HOTTER THAN ANY I CAN FIND IN THE STORE AND WITH MY THICK HAIR I NEED THAT HEAT TO CURL MY HAIR.  HOWEVER, THE REASON IT IS MY THIRD PURCHASE IS THE FIRST TWO DEVELOPED SHORTS IN THE SWIVEL PART OF THE CORD. I ALSO RECOMMEND YOU ORDER THE EXTRA BRISTLES AS THEY DO DETERIORATE DUE TO THE HIGHER HEAT USED.  THE BRISTLES ARE INEXPENSIVE SO THIS IS NOT A BIG ISSUE FOR ME.  I DO WISH HOWEVER THEY COULD CORRECT THE PROBLEM WITH THE CORD.  I DO LIKE THE EXTRA LONG CORD ON THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Already have one of these and wanted one for travel...am used to the way it feels and works on my hair.</li>
            <li> IT CURLS MY HAIR SO MUCH BETTER. BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS YOU CAN EASILY CLEAN IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WORKS GREAT BUT BEING ABLE TO CLEAN THE &amp;#34;GUNK&amp;#34; FROM THE TEETH THAT BUILDS UP IS WONDERFUL</li>
            <li> I love this product and use it each day.  It works best for me and I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> The best bang for the buck!  Ready in no time. Highly recommend it for everyday use and for just touch ups.</li>
            <li> It gets too hot and there is no control for that.</li>
            <li> I haveused this hot tools brush for years and I like it very much wouldn&#x27;t use anything else Good product</li>
            <li> This is my second one, love this product, perfect for my hair! I air dry my hair then just go over it with this iron</li>
            <li> This curler gets to a very high heat that ny hair responds to. Any less heat is insufficient.  This product has variable heat temps and a swivel cord and heats very quickly.  The bristles do break eventually, and need to be replaced.</li>
            <li> This brush iron gets used every day.  Hard to find but amazon came through again.  Very good item for a very reasonable price..</li>
            <li> Love this curling iron.  Had one for many years and had to replace it.  Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get as hot as I thought it would being that it is labeled as &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34;, but it&#x27;s okay. I do wish that the temperature control dial would indicate the degree it is warming up to.</li>
