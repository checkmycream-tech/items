            <li>It is perfect for very dry skin.  </li>
            <li>It is fast drying, smells good and it works.</li>

            <li>I ORIGINALLY BOUGHT THIS FOR MY DAUGHTER</li>

            <li>Lotil heals them quickly.</li>
            <li>and i am willing to try anything!</li>
            <li>I had to make an emergency order from amazon to replace my old trusty tube of Lotil, because my mother&#x27;s need for it was greater than my own.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cream is quickly absorbed into your skin with no sticky residue.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for an effective hand cream, look no further.  </li>

            <li>My husband and I find that this cream does a wonderful job of quickly healing small cuts especially those on fingers and hands.</li>

            <li>THANKS ANYWAY!</li>
            <li>When you put it on, it kind of dries instantly, but doesn&#x27;t keep my hands soft at all!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite lotion for dry skin--works great and does not leave your hands feeling greasy and wet like regular lotion.</li>
            <li>so I can write this review on my smart phone without dirtying up the screen.</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>Really didn&#x27;t like it,</li>
            <li>Great for keeping my hands from falling off with all the super cold temps we&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>This is a healthy product that I use year round.</li>
            <li>The lotion comes out and goes on &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34; which is an important attribute for my use because there is less chance of it running all over the place.  </li>
            <li>My hands and feet are soft, no cracks or dryness.</li>
            <li>The aroma is what I would describe as neutral, neither masculine nor feminine, truly androgynous.  </li>

            <li>doesn&#x27;t help my hands stay soft or moisturized.</li>
            <li>With a performance coming up, she finally tried it, and had such success that she asked to take it home with her.</li>
            <li>It is a convenient size to carry with you, not too small that you only get two applications, but not too large as in a full- size product.  </li>
            <li>I have dry hands and found this product to work very well.  </li>
            <li>It helps us keep the skin of our fingertips from cracking in the dry climate of New Mexico.</li>
            <li>This is a great product I get cracked skin due to winter cold.</li>
            <li>My dry skin fells good after all winds and cold.</li>

            <li> it does have a slight medicinal odor that goes away after about half an hour, some tubes of Lotil, the ones with the word Lotil printed vertically have no odor.</li>
            <li> My daughter has severe eczema and i am willing to try anything! I bought this hoping it would help. No good....waste of money</li>
            <li> When I first used this lotion I thought it could not do any good because it was not greasy.  However, I noticed that I no longer had the dry scratchy feeling on my fingers.  I still love my greasy lotions, but for daytime use that works without leaving an oily spot on anything I touch, I use the Lotil.</li>
            <li> I have been using Lotil for years with amazing results. My hands and feet are soft, no cracks or dryness. It is fast drying, smells good and it works. This is a healthy product that I use year round.</li>
            <li> I ORIGINALLY BOUGHT THIS FOR MY DAUGHTER BUT NOW SHE WON&#x27;T USE IT SO IM USING IT AND I DON&#x27;T PLAN ON BUYING IT AGAIN BUT MAYBE SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE. SO I&#x27;M BACK TO USING LARSON&#x27;S LOTION ON HER DRY FEET AND SHE WON&#x27;T USE HAND LOTION SO THERE&#x27;S NO REASON TO ORDER IT.  THANKS ANYWAY!</li>
            <li> My Dad used to use this all the time.  He worked out in the cold on engines all year round.  He would come home and wash his hands with solvent to remove the grease and then would use the Lotil on his fingertips to help with the cracked skin.  Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I had to make an emergency order from amazon to replace my old trusty tube of Lotil, because my mother&#x27;s need for it was greater than my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been trying for 15 years to get my mother to try Lotil.  My mother is a pianist. She developed nasty fingertip cracks while visiting for Thanksgiving. With a performance coming up, she finally tried it, and had such success that she asked to take it home with her. I have tried everything from Bag Balm to U-Lactin, and Lotil is the only thing that has ever worked.  The great news is that it is now easier to find (thank you, Amazon) and it works fast!  It also lasts a long time. It gets my highest recommendation.</li>
            <li> I purchased a jar of the Lotil Cream and a 1.7 oz tube.  This product was recommended to me by a friend and I wasn&#x27;t sure how I would like it.  Well, it&#x27;s the best cream I have ever used.  It is perfect for very dry skin.  I bought it specifically for my hands, but use it on my legs and my feet.  My manicurist wanted to know what I had done to my hands in a week that made them so much better!!  It works very fast.  I recommend it to all my friends.  I will keep this on hand as long as they make it.</li>
            <li> My husband and I find that this cream does a wonderful job of quickly healing small cuts especially those on fingers and hands.</li>
            <li> love this stuff-  you don&#x27;t need a lot and it absorbs nicely. this size tube lasts a good while because you don&#x27;t need much. and great to carry with me. I never leave the house without it. Great for keeping my hands from falling off with all the super cold temps we&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> I want to marry this moisturizer, swath myself in its beneficence, bathe myself in its soothing, smoothing comfort ... all of which is possible without feeling, looking or smelling like an oily mess. It leaves a silky feel to the skin ... absorbs almost immediately so I can write this review on my smart phone without dirtying up the screen. This is just the convenient carry-along version for my bag (I have all the regular sizes) and I&#x27;d swear by this English product, but the Brits don&#x27;t swear (or do they?). Keep it coming... worth the extra tuppence for sure.</li>
            <li> Hand cream absorbs well but the smell isn&#x27;t great. Not likely to buy this again since there are many better hand creams out there.</li>
            <li> Yummmm, good!  That is my reaction to this hand cream.  It is a convenient size to carry with you, not too small that you only get two applications, but not too large as in a full- size product.  The lotion comes out and goes on &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34; which is an important attribute for my use because there is less chance of it running all over the place.  The aroma is what I would describe as neutral, neither masculine nor feminine, truly androgynous.  The cream is quickly absorbed into your skin with no sticky residue.  Your hands will feel &amp;#34;calm&amp;#34;, soothed, and soft.  This product has been around for a long time and there is a reason for its longevity- it does what it claims!  If you are looking for an effective hand cream, look no further.  Get some and you will be a lifetime convert.</li>
            <li> Love Lotil !!  Keeps my heels soft all year round, also apply to nail cuticles !!  Have been using Lotil for years and the tube is handy to carry in purse.</li>
            <li> A nice, easy way to carry what I think is the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.  It&#x27;s not greasy, blends in easily and it WORKS like a charm.  I have found my dry skin lotion...no others need apply!  And PS: the foot cream is the BEST, too!</li>
            <li> A bit expensive but works we&#x27;ll especially during this very cold dry weather. Fits easily into my purse and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> This is an effective, non-greasy hand cream.  It is nice that it has no added fragrance, just a gentle, natural whiff of whatever is in it.</li>
            <li> We have been buying this great lotion for years for the cracks on my husband&#x27;s hands.  It works very well.</li>
            <li> This hand cream is the abbsolute best for winter dried and chapped hands.  It is also the best for gardening hands!  Never feels &amp;#34;tacky&amp;#34; and smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> I love it especially this cold week in New York. My dry skin fells good after all winds and cold.</li>
            <li> Purchased for cream for my wife and she loves it. She uses to help with her dry hands will order larger size.</li>
            <li> My wife and I have used this cream very successfully for many years. It helps us keep the skin of our fingertips from cracking in the dry climate of New Mexico. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This wonderful hand cream is the only cream that truly helps my hands in winter! My fingertips tend to crack and bleed and Lotil heals them quickly. I recommend this awesome product to anyone and everyone!!</li>
            <li> This is not the same product that I purchased years ago.  It used to tout boroleum on the front of the tube, but I can&#x27;t find it in the list of ingredients now.  It doesn&#x27;t have the same healing properties as it once did.</li>
            <li> Good cream , but not anti-fungus..</li>
            <li> Really didn&#x27;t like it, doesn&#x27;t help my hands stay soft or moisturized. When you put it on, it kind of dries instantly, but doesn&#x27;t keep my hands soft at all!</li>
            <li> I have dry hands and found this product to work very well.  Will keep this around especially in the winter months.</li>
            <li> This is a great product I get cracked skin due to winter cold. This product is antibacterial and anti fungal  and helps cuts and scratches  helps all skin conditions</li>
            <li> Very effective lotion for hands  Non greasy.  clends&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;super hand cream and lotion.  Non  greasy.  Heals cracks in badly chaped hands&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\</li>
            <li> Effective hand cream for cold winters.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lotion for dry skin--works great and does not leave your hands feeling greasy and wet like regular lotion. Dries completely when rubbed in and does not feel greasy or like touching things will rub off lotion.</li>
            <li> It does what it says it does, it&#x27;s a serious moisturizer for skin, and it works really well.  That said, I dread using it because it smells SO AWFUL.  I feel like they moisturize doctor&#x27;s office walls with it to give it that smell.  This stuff also goes on really thick, which is beneficial, but then my hands sweat through it, it&#x27;s really odd.  I would only use this for severe dry skin.</li>
