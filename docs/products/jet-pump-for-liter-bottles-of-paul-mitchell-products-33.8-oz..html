            <li> Using them is much safer than having a heavy bottle slip out of your wet hands and onto your toe in the shower.</li>
            <li> we worked for and paid off in fifteen years because she thi ks because her dad rented so long that she should entitled to inherit his lease and any rent he laid as &amp;#34;equity&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> arrived earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> The color is grey.  </li>
            <li> the first time i had trouble pouring it into small travel size bottles.</li>
            <li> I had a bit of trouble figuring out how to open the pump so it would work, but finally got it.  </li>
            <li> Curious to see what you may do, or if you will even read this.</li>
            <li> Still pumping shampoo as expected.</li>
            <li> no more picking up those giant bottles of shampoo.</li>
            <li> just got it in the mail and does not fit the Paul Mitchell</li>
            <li> makes it easier than lifting and trying to maneuver pouring from the heavy bottle.</li>
            <li> Despite the negative review, I thought I&#x27;d give this a chance.  </li>
            <li> Ordered 2 only 1 worked, frustrating!!!</li>
            <li> Not really happy with the plastic though.</li>
            <li> Absurd?</li>
            <li> What is wrong with this Country?</li>
            <li> Expensive for what it is.</li>
            <li> it is useless!</li>
            <li> but I was mildly disappointed.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> it is useless! too short. after you use 1/4 of the bottle, it doesnt reach the conditioner!</li>
            <li> it was exactly as stateed and works well. i can&#x27;t think of 12 more things to say about a plastic pump</li>
            <li> Fits my 1 liter Paul Mitchell awapuhi perfectly</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a pump for my Paul Mitchell shampoo for years!  This one arrived in perfect condition and works beautifully.  The price was right too!</li>
            <li> I ordered one set of two pumps for some Paul Mitchell shampoo and conditioner in 33.3 oz bottles. I Love the product but I ordered one set of two and you sent me two sets of two and it will cost me more in postage to send them back than they cost to begin with. Can you fix it. Can you credit me or send a small free gift in return? That&#x27;s a lot of shampoo and conditioner for the two pumps In it. Really, it would mean a lot and cost would really make my day for you to want to make it right especially today..won&#x27;t go into it but would make my day. My husband&#x27;s biological father passed away Sunday at 1:45 in the a.m.,drove from Dallas to Beaumont for viewing today, funeral tomorrow and we could really just use a break. Thank you either way. His name was Glen Earl Horton, Sr, at Melancon Funeral Home in Beaumont, Tx. Curious to see what you may do, or if you will even read this. In the meantime, someone is trying to take our home we worked for and paid off in fifteen years because she thi ks because her dad rented so long that she should entitled to inherit his lease and any rent he laid as &amp;#34;equity&amp;#34;?? Absurd? I know. Maybe if you could maybe tell the press, media, someone, my house is in Monahans,Tx. And they are trying to take my house. Please draw attention to it somehow.Yeah, I know its not your job, just wanted to see if someone in this wirld would go above and beyond.  Thank you. The more publicity the better. This girl just moved into my house in west tx because she knows we now live in Garland and thinks nobody will do anything while she &amp;#34;squats&amp;#34;, the legal term while she  has never paid a dime on this house. What is wrong with this Country? This is &amp;#34;THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA&amp;#34; where I hen you work hard for fifteen years and pay off the deed you whould own it! Period! If you agree share this story with your local media. If it happens to me  in court on July 28,2015? It could happen to YOU. (214)--952-9241.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend, the pump is heavy duty, is perfect fit for the bottle, performs as expected and does not clog or stick.</li>
            <li> Did not match website photograph, mine came as a metallic [glitter] bronze.&lt;br /&gt;It seems others have received off colors as well.&lt;br /&gt;Mid-States Beauty&#x27;s return label does not include postage,&lt;br /&gt;as such it&#x27;s not cost effective to even return it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m felling kinda scammed.</li>
            <li> Works just like promised.</li>
            <li> I thought I already gave a review, but I will do it again. I really like this pump. It came in two pieces and was so easy to put together. Pump fits the Paul Mitchell Liter bottles perfectly and was easy to use. It makes it much easier in the shower.</li>
            <li> works Perfect with my 33oz Conditioner bottle!</li>
            <li> Fit the bottle of my Paul Mitchell shampoo great.  Easy to access shampoo without having to open it every time and  found it to be very beneficial.</li>
            <li> It works as it claims..  It looks short but it reaches the bottle when assembled. Expensive for what it is.</li>
            <li> Seems like I&#x27;m not the only one, so buyers should just be awared that the pumps gonna come in different colors. Mine are bronze. Good news is I bought 2 and received them in the same color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t exactly fit the bottle - but it works. So it&#x27;s okay. Not really happy with the plastic though.</li>
            <li> This broke the first time I used it .</li>
            <li> Works as expected....makes use of large bottles so much easier!</li>
            <li> The pump makes it so much easier to use this great moisturizing shampoo. My husband and I both love it.</li>
            <li> just got it in the mail and does not fit the Paul Mitchell The Conditioner Liter bottle,, dissapointed as hell,, i couldn&#x27;t get the pump to open but when i finally did,, it fit but not perfectly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you OPEN THE PUMP to put on the bottle ! THAT WAS THE PROBLEM I HAD,,,)</li>
            <li> Despite the negative review, I thought I&#x27;d give this a chance.  It looks just like the picture and it does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.  I used it on a 33.8 oz bottle of Paul Mitchell conditioner.  It took me a couple of minutes to fugure it out to get it working, but I&#x27;m glad I got it.</li>
            <li> arrived earlier than expected. they fit just fine. no more picking up those giant bottles of shampoo. best of all, they are reusable. i didn&#x27;t know such products existed but i found them at a great time; my sister had just broken her arm! i may order more since i gave mine to my one-armed sister!</li>
            <li> Not much to say about it really. It arrived on time, it fits well, has a nice smooth action and does not splatter. Works perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> Always wanted these pumps for our large size Paul Mitchell shampoo and conditioner. Great purchase. These pumps are convenient and conserve use of the product by pumping correct amount.</li>
            <li> These pumps sure make using the large containers of shampoo and conditioner easy.  They work fine even with wet hands, and fit perfectly in the Paul Mitchell bottles.</li>
            <li> The photo they displayed looked like a Paul Mitchell pump.&lt;br /&gt;But, it was not.  They said I could return it.</li>
            <li> What can you say about a pump. It does what its supposed to do. Its great for distributing just the right amount of product.</li>
            <li> I recieved this today.  It doesn&#x27;t fit the paul mitchell bottle.  And, it does not look like the picture either.  It is blue plastic.  Don&#x27;t buy it!!!</li>
            <li> The pump pictured is white, the two that I received are a light brownish/gold color.  I have these on two liter bottles of P. Mitchell in my shower and they work just fine.  The color isn&#x27;t a huge issue but I was mildly disappointed.  Using them is much safer than having a heavy bottle slip out of your wet hands and onto your toe in the shower.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted and early arrival.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> The shampoo bottle is large so hard to pour in the shower, the pump is great and makes it easier to use.  Dispenses just the right amount.</li>
            <li> Ordered 2 only 1 worked, frustrating!!!</li>

            <li> This did fit my bottle and works perfectly.  I had a bit of trouble figuring out how to open the pump so it would work, but finally got it.  The color is grey.  This is much more convenient than picking up these large bottles and squeezing out conditioner.</li>

            <li> It works just like it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> Definitely needed for the 33oz of Paul Mitchell Conditioner. makes it easier than lifting and trying to maneuver pouring from the heavy bottle.</li>
            <li> It works perfectly and was in good condition. Very easy to assemble and use. Fits great and makes it much easier to use the shampoo.</li>
            <li> Fits the Paul Mitchell bottles perfectly.  It was packaged well and arrived intact and quickly.  Still pumping shampoo as expected.</li>
            <li> Works very well with the Paul Mitchell large shampoos.  My order came in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li> Make sure to cutâ€‹ a little off of the bottom before using.</li>
            <li> Product as described, thanks. exactly what I needed. Fits all paul mitchell shampoos/conditioners. Works wonderful. Glad I ordered this product</li>
            <li> These are the best liter bottle pumps I have owned!  They even close and lock in case you wanted to close them for travel.  Very pleased with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Works well with the paul mitchell 32 oz. bottle</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughter&#x27;s shampoo and conditioner but cannot figure out how to get them to work.  Some reviews said \\&quot;tricky\\&quot; but could someone please tell me how they got the pump open?  Seems like it will be a very good product.</li>
            <li> Now I do not have to lift a liter of shampoo every time I shower.&lt;br /&gt;This pump is very nice and works well.</li>
