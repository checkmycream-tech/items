            <li>, I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t lose money on this, but still, I thought that was odd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>long.the smell is ok.</li>

            <li>Love this product, but would appreciate more information from the provider/manufacturer as to the &amp;#34;Organic&amp;#34; designation.</li>
            <li>I AM THOROUGHLY ENJOYING THIS PRODUCT ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,</li>
            <li>I AM THOROUGHLY ENJOYING THIS PRODUCT ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WORKING ,</li>
            <li>heard it&#x27;s good for the skin, haven&#x27;t tried it as yet but based on what i have read, i&#x27;m soooooooo willing to try.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;I have issued you a full refund.&amp;#34; Which is nice</li>
            <li>The oil didn&#x27;t do what I expected, its probably best used on anything but hair.</li>
            <li>Also, this oil is very light and absorbs in my hair quickly.</li>
            <li>Very light oil.nice mild almost no scent.</li>
            <li>I received thisi product in fine condition.  </li>
            <li>The product in itself seems fine, however, I&#x27;ve never bought almond oil before</li>
            <li>I probably would not reorder this based off of that, but will use the product as it moisturizes just fine.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t clog the pores of your face, important to me because I&#x27;m prone to acne and thought oil on my face was counterintuitive, but</li>
            <li>It does not soak in right away, allowing the massage to go on longer without having to stop every two min. and pour more into my hands.</li>
            <li>The label stating it was &amp;#34;Organic Sweet Almond Oil&amp;#34; covered another label that said &amp;#34;Organic Avocado Oil.&amp;#34; One has no idea what kind of oil this really is.</li>
            <li>how could you even feel confident that you are getting a 100% pure and organic product.</li>
            <li>I will surly be ordering another bottle of Sweet Almond Oil.</li>
            <li>had sweet almond oil in and how my hair grew when I used it.</li>
            <li>So, I thought I try just sweet almond oil by itself to see what would happen.</li>
            <li>Excellent quality oil with a subtle fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>I use this for when my skin is especially dry, and it has been really great.</li>
            <li>100% pure and organic oil that is excellent lubricant and will not break down your adult toys but will provide the lubrication you need to have enjoyable</li>
            <li>I look much younger and healthier:) It is also great to mix it with your daily lotion!</li>
            <li>found this to be useful for a lot of skin problems, use in my creams and alone</li>
            <li>no artificial stuff</li>
            <li>love all natural products will continue to buy these</li>
            <li>This is as expected, the oil is good, I am using it as a lotion</li>
            <li>Recommend it to anyone, I myself use this to blend my own essential oils.</li>
            <li>Shipping was very fast as well.</li>
            <li>ordering 2 more bottles,  Thank you, Back rub Queen</li>
            <li>and I most definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s great, but I had the feeling that they had heard this complaint before.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;it makes my skin soft and smooth</li>
            <li>and that make me very upset!</li>
            <li>This oil grew back the hair I loss and more.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted for my project...</li>
            <li>/&gt;The seller was very prompt, sent the item immediatly and it seems to be exactly what&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I have read the sweet almond oil should have a soft but nutty scent, and this oil has no smell at all.  </li>
            <li>This is very high grade oil.</li>
            <li>With all the \\&quot;iffiness\\&quot; surrounding the presentation  and real ounce amount</li>
            <li>I wish that it had a smell, but almonds really don&#x27;t have a smell.</li>
            <li>it works very well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definetly recomended and MUCH cheaper than buying a ton of lotions.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know what it really is</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have since learned that if you don&#x27;t use it too fast it starts to stink.  </li>
            <li>product arrived after the expected ship date, and my shipping was $8 which is way more than the &amp;#34;ship by weight&amp;#34; charts listed on the seller&#x27;s</li>
            <li>page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The label on it is so crappy it made me wonder if this product is really what it says it is.</li>
            <li>It smells like absolute nothing.</li>
            <li>I now have a $15 bottle (don&#x27;t forget shipping fees) that I will put REAL almond oil in.</li>
            <li>if it&#x27;s real almond oil</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone that wants to use almond oil for thier products.</li>
            <li>I have ordered almond oil in the past from other sellers, and almond oil has a sweet, pleasant smell to it, which this does not.</li>
            <li>to the company&#x27;s credit, when I called and told them about the labeling, they said &amp;#34;Oh, that should never be, that&#x27;s terrible.&amp;#34; And they credited me for the full amount plus shipping that same day.</li>
            <li>The label only says \\&quot;sweet almond oil 16 fl oz\\&quot;</li>
            <li>the same saler through Amazon&#x27;s website)the sweet almond oil gives my hair shine without greasiness.</li>
            <li>Additionally, it has a thicker feel/viscosity than I (in my experience) sweet almond oil traditionally has.</li>
            <li>Also prevented peeling from a little too much sun, has a clean fresh scent</li>
            <li>This oil is high in ALA and Omega 3&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Completely unscented and absorbs in skin fast with no greasy residue.</li>
            <li>so, maybe they got it right or fired the last packing person...</li>
            <li>I use it in my hair as a deep hot oil treatment.</li>
            <li>so does mazola oil if you don&#x27;t use it fast enough.</li>
            <li>so far, i have not used it.</li>
            <li>like natural things</li>
            <li>I have been pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>no odors or issues, leaves hair feeling soft and silky</li>
            <li>makes it soft</li>
            <li>I use only about a tablespoon per spray bottle of water; it is nice smelling and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>We live in the land of labels and proper seals.</li>
            <li>My daughter and I have natural African American hair and it makes our hair very soft and keeps it hydrated.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny, no funky smell, no overly heavy feel.</li>
            <li>I mix this sweet almond oil with water in a spray bottle as a dry skin treatment for my little dog.  </li>

            <li> if it&#x27;s real almond oil</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone that wants to use almond oil for thier products.</li>
            <li> I have ordered almond oil in the past from other sellers, and almond oil has a sweet, pleasant smell to it, which this does not.</li>
            <li> to the company&#x27;s credit, when I called and told them about the labeling, they said &amp;#34;Oh, that should never be, that&#x27;s terrible.&amp;#34; And they credited me for the full amount plus shipping that same day.</li>
            <li> The label only says \\&quot;sweet almond oil 16 fl oz\\&quot;</li>
            <li> the same saler through Amazon&#x27;s website)the sweet almond oil gives my hair shine without greasiness.</li>
            <li> Additionally, it has a thicker feel/viscosity than I (in my experience) sweet almond oil traditionally has.</li>
            <li> Also prevented peeling from a little too much sun, has a clean fresh scent</li>
            <li> This oil is high in ALA and Omega 3&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Completely unscented and absorbs in skin fast with no greasy residue.</li>
            <li> so, maybe they got it right or fired the last packing person...</li>
            <li> I use it in my hair as a deep hot oil treatment.</li>
            <li> so does mazola oil if you don&#x27;t use it fast enough.</li>
            <li> so far, i have not used it.</li>
            <li> like natural things</li>
            <li> I have been pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> no odors or issues, leaves hair feeling soft and silky</li>
            <li> makes it soft</li>
            <li> I use only about a tablespoon per spray bottle of water; it is nice smelling and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> We live in the land of labels and proper seals.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have natural African American hair and it makes our hair very soft and keeps it hydrated.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny, no funky smell, no overly heavy feel.</li>
            <li> I mix this sweet almond oil with water in a spray bottle as a dry skin treatment for my little dog.  </li>
            <li> It has a very faint, light smell that isn&#x27;t overpowering and it soaks in very well.</li>
            <li> I have thick natural 3c/4a hair and have been using it for both natural styles</li>
            <li> I mix it with other essential oils and use daily on hair and body......</li>
            <li> I know I only spent 36.00 with the seller but its the principle</li>
            <li> I give this a three star because I order other oils with this order and they all smelled the same...</li>
            <li> When I ordered this item, I bought it because a friend of mine had suggested that I do so as a cosmetic aid for dry</li>
            <li> Let it air dry</li>
            <li> In the winter months here in the Northeast, with indoor heating, the air gets very dry and my skin tends to as well, with accompanied itching and flaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I noticed improvement in my sons skin after using this; he has very dry skin.</li>
            <li> Use it in a mixture of other oils to keep my skin moisturized during this dry winter months.</li>
            <li> this is a hard to find item if you don&#x27;t have a health store anywhere near you plus this can be used orally just check the web</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, even if they changed the packaging it could be deceivingly commercial and then I would not know the difference, so no real complaint overall.</li>
            <li> I attempted to reply to the email a few minutes later but the address they had emailed me from was no longer in existence</li>
            <li> In a random bottle with cheap label not sealed therefore not safe.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.....</li>
            <li> other then that, no issues.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and use a little in my bath, add  a bit to my lotion, and rub it into the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li> I have very coarse thick hair and after showering I put about a nickle size drop in my palms and rub them together before running through my wet hair.  </li>
            <li> Be very careful!</li>
            <li> This was NOT even almond oil, much less organic.</li>
            <li> This product works well when you mix it with Black Seed Oil, Mustard oil, and Jamaican Castor Oil.</li>
            <li> Then I remebered the shampoo I previous used</li>
            <li> Granted, packaging is not everything, but it lends little to consumer confidence.</li>
            <li> a little goes along way</li>
            <li> so this purchase was a waste.</li>
            <li> so I will be contacting amazon and the seller (everyday) until I get a return.</li>
            <li> this was a waste.</li>
            <li> I also plan to add a few drops to my lotion to see how if affects my skin.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a barcode on the side but its clearly fake because I can hardly even tell it is one, its completely fuzzy.</li>
            <li> Very little detail provided, which makes me question if this product is indeed what they say it is.</li>
            <li> yourself the trouble and DO NOT ORDER!</li>
            <li> At least not mine</li>
            <li> They were extremely rude and told me that I should have done my research before they wasted their time shipping it to me, then told me that the information i was requesting is on the bottle (its not!!)</li>
            <li> use this oil after bathing..especially during the cold and dry seasons.&lt;br /&gt;Great for pedicures and manicures, it softens the skin and smells devine</li>
            <li> So when I received the product, I was very disappointed because this seller \\&quot;claims\\&quot; that it&#x27;s 100% pure and orgranic, but the label is homemade and you canot read anything on the label.</li>
            <li> I contacted the seller about both the expensive shipping and the poor label, and questioned whether this product was truly organic.</li>
            <li> It was difficult to have confidence in the item because of that.</li>
            <li> Needless to say it is clearing up.</li>
            <li> It goes bad.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad.</li>
            <li> need to stop the limit on word its annoying</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Purchased this Almond oil even though product had no reviews. Big mistake! Bottle came rigged with electrical tape so oil doesn&#x27;t spill out which it did anyway. Bottle is 8 to 10 oz at most and looked nothing like the picture... With all the \\&quot;iffiness\\&quot; surrounding the presentation  and real ounce amount how could you even feel confident that you are getting a 100% pure and organic product. Save yourself the time and money and buy elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I had just the opposite experience so, maybe they got it right or fired the last packing person... LOL&lt;br /&gt;my product came in the bottle shown, no leaks and is just lovely.  It absorbs into the skin as it should.  My guy has problems with his back muscles knotting up and I use this to rub his back, it&#x27;s great !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m ordering 2 more bottles,  Thank you, Back rub Queen</li>
            <li> I wish that it had a smell, but almonds really don&#x27;t have a smell. I been considering mixing it with some essential oils for fragrance. My daughter and I have natural African American hair and it makes our hair very soft and keeps it hydrated. We also use it on our skin after baths. My son has eczema and his skin is looking so much better.  I will surly be ordering another bottle of Sweet Almond Oil.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this item, I bought it because a friend of mine had suggested that I do so as a cosmetic aid for dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;I use it as a moisterizer for my face, neck and the rest of my body :-). it works very well. In the winter months here in the Northeast, with indoor heating, the air gets very dry and my skin tends to as well, with accompanied itching and flaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works beautifully for that. Best way to use it for this purpose, I&#x27;ve found, is to slather it on immediatly after showering for nice rich supple skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definetly recomended and MUCH cheaper than buying a ton of lotions. you get a nice scent, great skin and it doesn&#x27;t clog the pores of your face, important to me because I&#x27;m prone to acne and thought oil on my face was counterintuitive, but it&#x27;s wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller was very prompt, sent the item immediatly and it seems to be exactly what&#x27;s it&#x27;s labeled to be, pute almond oil.</li>
            <li> I make my own lotions with almond oil, coconut oil and Shea butter.</li>
            <li> I use it for making homemade soap, besides just using it to oil my skin. Also mix it will organic cocount oil and I have the best non chemical lotion you every want to buy.</li>
            <li> I have very coarse thick hair and after showering I put about a nickle size drop in my palms and rub them together before running through my wet hair.  Let it air dry and it lays beautifully without frizz and a softness I havent found a salon product to match.  Also prevented peeling from a little too much sun, has a clean fresh scent</li>
            <li> This oil is not as hydrating as the coconut oil.  It just leaves a shiny coating all over.  I&#x27;m not buying anymore of this oil.</li>
            <li> I loved the fragrance.  I wish it came in a bigger size.  Will purchase again in the future.  Love the fragrance</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife because she wanted the almond smell however, this one DOES NOT smell like almond (it has no noticeable smell at all). ...other then that, no issues.</li>
            <li> found this to be useful for a lot of skin problems, use in my creams and alone</li>
            <li> In a random bottle with cheap label not sealed therefore not safe. Don&#x27;t know what it really is and I don&#x27;t know how you expect anyone to trust this. We live in the land of labels and proper seals. Can&#x27;t trust just anyone so this purchase was a waste. It could be vegetable oil for all I know. No smell. Very disappointed.  This should not even be allowed.</li>
            <li> 100% pure and organic oil that is excellent lubricant and will not break down your adult toys but will provide the lubrication you need to have enjoyable sex.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have since learned that if you don&#x27;t use it too fast it starts to stink.  It goes bad.  But then I guess so does mazola oil if you don&#x27;t use it fast enough.</li>
            <li> I bought this oil and another to mix together to help keeps ticks from attacking my husband. It seemed to work. I also put the mixture on my dog and we haven&#x27;t found any ticks on him.</li>
            <li> heard it&#x27;s good for the skin, haven&#x27;t tried it as yet but based on what i have read, i&#x27;m soooooooo willing to try.</li>
            <li> I received thisi product in fine condition.  Problem was, I had eaxpected a fragrance, and these bottles had none.  The purpose I purchased them for was moot at that point.</li>
            <li> LOVE It. I purchased this oil to mix with my shea butter for my hair and skin and I am loving the combo. I will be ordering again and I most definitely recommend this product. Package it great plus it looks just like the pic shown. Shipping was very fast as well.</li>
            <li> Order several different oils from them all came at once. Each oil smelled and looked the same. I order apricot, almond, wheat germ, and avocado all very different oils and should feel and smell different. So I toke the bottles to my local organic market had the lady there smell the oils and give me her opinion. She said she thought the oils smelled like veg or corn oil, she toke me to her oil section and let me sample the oils on my skin and yes there suppose to smell different too. She said the company is stating there organic but there are laws that have to be followed in order to be organic and seals on each bottle are on of those laws. There were no seals on these bottles and the label is printed from home. On the label it said 10oz the seller scratch that out with pen and wrote 16oz to the side of it. When I got home I contacted the seller for a return they declined my request. I know I only spent 36.00 with the seller but its the principle so I will be contacting amazon and the seller (everyday) until I get a return. Good luck to anyone who buys from this seller!</li>
            <li> I like this Almond oil a lot, I use it to seal my ends after I moisturize. A little goes a long way.....</li>
            <li> Great for making lotion.  Completely unscented and absorbs in skin fast with no greasy residue. I&#x27;ll buy again.  Great price for the value.</li>
            <li> This was NOT even almond oil, much less organic. The label stating it was &amp;#34;Organic Sweet Almond Oil&amp;#34; covered another label that said &amp;#34;Organic Avocado Oil.&amp;#34; One has no idea what kind of oil this really is. The oil didn&#x27;t have the nutty smell of almond oil...it had actually no smell or taste at all.&lt;br /&gt;Much to the company&#x27;s credit, when I called and told them about the labeling, they said &amp;#34;Oh, that should never be, that&#x27;s terrible.&amp;#34; And they credited me for the full amount plus shipping that same day. I didn&#x27;t even have to return the oil. That&#x27;s great, but I had the feeling that they had heard this complaint before.&lt;br /&gt;But because I have no idea what kind of oil they are selling me, I will not be using this company again. It&#x27;s too bad.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality oil with a subtle fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;Quick delivery. Would recommend to anyone crafting lotions, balms and even non processed.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat almond oil for great moisterizing soaps, balms &amp; lotions.  Easy to work with &amp; fair pricing.  Thank you</li>
            <li> i got this to mix and make perfumes (for lack of a better word). so far, i have not used it. i bought it because of reviews.</li>
            <li> It was great!  I used it for making body butter and scrubs!</li>
            <li> Great oil and great price!</li>
            <li> The product in itself seems fine, however, I&#x27;ve never bought almond oil before so I had no idea what to expect. The bottle did come with electrical tape and a homemade label that was illegible. It was difficult to have confidence in the item because of that. Unfortunately, even if they changed the packaging it could be deceivingly commercial and then I would not know the difference, so no real complaint overall. I probably would not reorder this based off of that, but will use the product as it moisturizes just fine.</li>
            <li> I use this for when my skin is especially dry, and it has been really great. It has a very faint, light smell that isn&#x27;t overpowering and it soaks in very well.</li>
            <li> use it after my shower love this product&lt;br /&gt;it makes my skin soft and smooth&lt;br /&gt;I like natural things no artificial stuff</li>
            <li> This is perfect! It does not soak in right away, allowing the massage to go on longer without having to stop every two min. and pour more into my hands.</li>
            <li> SO great I had to buy it again. This product works well when you mix it with Black Seed Oil, Mustard oil, and Jamaican Castor Oil. I use it in my hair as a deep hot oil treatment. It also softens the skin after a shower. I noticed improvement in my sons skin after using this; he has very dry skin. Needless to say it is clearing up.</li>
            <li> love all natural products will continue to buy these they are awesome.they need to stop the limit on word its annoying</li>
            <li> I received the item as promised, and just absolutely love the oil.  It was a good buy for my collections of oils.  I have used it several times since making the purchase.</li>
            <li> This oil is high in ALA and Omega 3&#x27;s. Great for using in soaps, and moisturizing the skin.. I even use it to take off my makeup.</li>
            <li> I use Almond oil, Spearmint oil and Peppermint oil to make toothpaste with. These 3 ingredients is all you need to have a your mouth feeling the best it ever has. And it can kill bacteria in the mouth for receding gums.</li>
            <li> this product is great for leaving on the hair before or after shampooing and conditioning. I have been pleasantly surprised. no odors or issues, leaves hair feeling soft and silky</li>
            <li> This is a great light oil for aroma therapy and massage.  Worth every penny, no funky smell, no overly heavy feel.</li>
            <li> i got a bang for my buck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i mostly use it in a mixture for my face, but i also use it in my hair. we&#x27;ll see how it does on my skin</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for this seller because it was one of the cheaper options, but you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product arrived after the expected ship date, and my shipping was $8 which is way more than the &amp;#34;ship by weight&amp;#34; charts listed on the seller&#x27;s page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The label on it is so crappy it made me wonder if this product is really what it says it is. Granted, packaging is not everything, but it lends little to consumer confidence. I contacted the seller about both the expensive shipping and the poor label, and questioned whether this product was truly organic. His response? &amp;#34;I have issued you a full refund.&amp;#34; Which is nice, I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t lose money on this, but still, I thought that was odd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I finally opened the product seal, since I had nothing to lose... and no big surprise - it does NOT appear to be almond oil. It smells like absolute nothing. I have ordered almond oil in the past from other sellers, and almond oil has a sweet, pleasant smell to it, which this does not. I&#x27;m just going to throw it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save yourself the trouble and DO NOT ORDER!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product in hopes that I would have a bottle of almond oil. Well...it&#x27;s some sort of oil anyway. The label only says \\&quot;sweet almond oil 16 fl oz\\&quot; and it was hand printed, EXTREMELY low quality. There&#x27;s a barcode on the side but its clearly fake because I can hardly even tell it is one, its completely fuzzy. The bottle says nothing about the oil being organic and it lists no company name and no ingredients (even if it is only one ingredient, it should be listed under \\&quot;ingredients\\&quot;.) I emailed the seller and asked for a return label. I also asked for the company name so I could look the product up. They were extremely rude and told me that I should have done my research before they wasted their time shipping it to me, then told me that the information i was requesting is on the bottle (its not!!) I attempted to reply to the email a few minutes later but the address they had emailed me from was no longer in existence (??!!!) This product is going nowhere but the drain. I now have a $15 bottle (don&#x27;t forget shipping fees) that I will put REAL almond oil in.</li>
            <li> GREAT for all my LOTIONS, SOAP and TINCTURES: www.whiterabbitessential.com uses this as moisturizer in our hand made bath and body products.</li>
            <li> This is definitely an essential oil. I am using it for my skin and hair. I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> this is a hard to find item if you don&#x27;t have a health store anywhere near you plus this can be used orally just check the web</li>
            <li> I give this a three star because I order other oils with this order and they all smelled the same...</li>
            <li> use this oil after bathing..especially during the cold and dry seasons.&lt;br /&gt;Great for pedicures and manicures, it softens the skin and smells devine</li>
            <li> The oil didn&#x27;t do what I expected, its probably best used on anything but hair. At least not mine this was a waste.</li>
            <li> i like it on my skin. makes it soft but it wear&#x27;s off after for so long.the smell is ok.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never bought almond oil, so I don&#x27;t know how it&#x27;s supposed to look, feel, smell, or taste. So when I received the product, I was very disappointed because this seller \\&quot;claims\\&quot; that it&#x27;s 100% pure and orgranic, but the label is homemade and you canot read anything on the label. It doesn&#x27;t say the nutritional facts on it or how many calories it has. It doesn&#x27;t say anything on the label! Be very careful! I&#x27;m not even sure if it&#x27;s real almond oil and that make me very upset!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get enought of this oil. I had a problem with hair loss (along my forehead and temple areas). I tried everything to grow my hair back and nothing worked. Then I remebered the shampoo I previous used had sweet almond oil in and how my hair grew when I used it. So, I thought I try just sweet almond oil by itself to see what would happen. I am so glad I did. This oil grew back the hair I loss and more. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product. Also, this oil is very light and absorbs in my hair quickly. Just like the shea butter oil I bought(from the same saler through Amazon&#x27;s website)the sweet almond oil gives my hair shine without greasiness. Love it.</li>
            <li> Makes for very smooth skin balm.</li>
            <li> I love this oil I mix it with other essential oils and use daily on hair and body...... a little goes along way</li>
            <li> Very light oil.nice mild almost no scent.I would recommend it to anyone that wants to use almond oil for thier products.</li>
            <li> love this product, use it a lot, will order again</li>
            <li> It did not seem to be Almond Oil from smell.</li>
            <li> Love this oil. Use it in a mixture of other oils to keep my skin moisturized during this dry winter months.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted for my project... it worked perfect!  Definately would buy this product again when I need more.</li>
            <li> I mix this sweet almond oil with water in a spray bottle as a dry skin treatment for my little dog.  It is a very good and healthy treatment between shampoos and is excellent as a treatment for dry skin.  I use only about a tablespoon per spray bottle of water; it is nice smelling and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> In addtion to this I also bought avocado oil from this seller and aside from the labels (which appear to be pixelated print outs), the oils appear to be identical.  I have read the sweet almond oil should have a soft but nutty scent, and this oil has no smell at all.  That being said I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now and my hair still feels healthy and moisturized, so it hasn&#x27;t done my hair any harm.  I have thick natural 3c/4a hair and have been using it for both natural styles and if I straighten my hair.  I also plan to add a few drops to my lotion to see how if affects my skin.</li>
            <li> Love this product, but would appreciate more information from the provider/manufacturer as to the &amp;#34;Organic&amp;#34; designation. Are you certified...? Where is your product bottled...? Very little detail provided, which makes me question if this product is indeed what they say it is.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I have dry skin and use a little in my bath, add  a bit to my lotion, and rub it into the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li> This is as expected, the oil is good, I am using it as a lotion and it is very nice for that.</li>
            <li> This is very high grade oil. Great product. Recommend it to anyone, I myself use this to blend my own essential oils.</li>
            <li> ...that this is organic.  Additionally, it has a thicker feel/viscosity than I (in my experience) sweet almond oil traditionally has.</li>
            <li> I used it on my skin and it is amazing! I look much younger and healthier:) It is also great to mix it with your daily lotion!</li>
            <li> THANK YOU I AM THOROUGHLY ENJOYING THIS PRODUCT ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,THANK YOU I AM THOROUGHLY ENJOYING THIS PRODUCT ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WORKING ,GREAT FOR  MY HAIR AND SKIN</li>
