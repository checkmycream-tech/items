            <li>SO light, smells great and has improved my hair dramatically....</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>With just a coupe of squirts this does the job and smells nice too.</li>
            <li>Smells nice, though.  </li>
            <li>Liked the</li>
            <li>And it smells good too &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>BEST LEAVE-IN REALLY HYDRATES MY HAIR &amp; I</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell</li>
            <li>The texture was so greatly improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this Lite version is lower in price than the original, i&#x27;d say start with this one and see how it does.</li>
            <li>My curls and waves are more defined and I have way more volume without frizz!  </li>
            <li>The best leave-in product I have tried soo far.</li>
            <li>That my own thing though :).</li>
            <li>Worth every penny and great prices</li>
            <li>Removes tangles easily!</li>
            <li>This is the perfect leave in conditioner for straight, fine hair.</li>
            <li>It still repairs and detangles every bit as good as the original.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is strong but fairly nice.  </li>
            <li>now i&#x27;m working on getting it healthy again, and this stuff is def helping.</li>
            <li>I got the LITE formula to see if that was better</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried most of the Its a 10 Miracle leave in</li>
            <li>This works really well, and the price is great</li>
            <li>Nice and light.  </li>
            <li>Smells great but didn&#x27;t condition hair very well.  </li>
            <li>I love that it also has thermal protection.</li>
            <li>and so glad I did.</li>
            <li>ordering more</li>
            <li>; light, nice fragrance, non-build up.  </li>
            <li>Love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>Wish they made a bottle more proportionely sized to the shampoo.</li>
            <li>and I fell in love with the scent and the way my hair looked and felt after she was done styling it.</li>
            <li>However I love this one the most..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so lightweight, some days when my hair is a bit more thirsty I can add more to the ends and not worry about it looking greasy.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product fop heat protectant.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i just love it.</li>

            <li>Just okay.</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>okay...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an okay product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an ok product.</li>
            <li>and I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>If you wear extensions, this stuff is great to help blend the extensions and real hair.</li>
            <li>I think it might actually be better than 12 benefits which has a lot of hype.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Maybe works better for those with better hair.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>

            <li>Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>love this product.</li>
            <li>I love the lite #10</li>
            <li>My hair needs washing more often</li>
            <li>Even if you just want to add some manageability and not necessarily repair, it is excellent.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>but this stuff is even better.</li>
            <li>It has a nice fresh warm scent.</li>
            <li>I got the perfect 10 basic shampoo and conditioner, and the leave in for blondes.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing again for sure.</li>
            <li>My hair looks better without applying this spray.</li>
            <li>This is a nice, light leave in conditioner.  </li>
            <li>will stick with the regular one as that works best for me.</li>
            <li>I love the &#x27;lite&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I also love the way it smells.</li>

            <li>:) :)</li>
            <li>:) : )</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll probably keep ordering, but I cannot have more than 2 squirts</li>
            <li>This stuff is so light but so effective.  </li>
            <li>It is actually just perfect.  </li>
            <li>My daughter has very fine but easily tangled hair.</li>
            <li>I was excited to see a lite version, but honestly, this one seems to be just as greasy if accidentally overused.</li>
            <li>As my hair turns gray it is becoming increasingly curley, which is okay.</li>
            <li>/&gt;[am able to do it myself (without my daughter} VERY QUICK DELIVERY</li>
            <li>Its not a terrible smell, but it is STRONG.</li>
            <li>Works great to keep my hair soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and prone to static.</li>
            <li>I just love this product for my fine textured hair.</li>
            <li>Found this worked just as well and probably better for fine hair.</li>
            <li>Love this conditioner-use it after washing with Its a 10 shampoo and it is light and works well on my fine hair leaving it shiny and with more volume.</li>
            <li>It works great in all the sense that it leaves your hair soft and tangle-free but it is not LITE.</li>
            <li>Several months ago I permed it, then got the brilliant idea to bleach it.</li>
            <li>very lightweight and smells so good</li>
            <li>Applying this to your freshly shampooed and conditioned hair nicely detangles my hair allowing the comb to glide through easily.</li>
            <li>Originally bought this at my hair salon and needed more...</li>
            <li>Works even better than the original its a 10 product.</li>
            <li>Easy to use Leave in conditioning for your hair.  </li>
            <li>Really like this and so far, very impressed with the</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use</li>
            <li>The smell is not too strong either, floral scent.</li>
            <li>I have fine straight hair and this by far one of the best products ive ever tried!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty amazing stuff.</li>
            <li>This is some pretty amazing hair treatment.</li>
            <li>I have really fine hair that gets tangled after showering and this product makes it so easy to comb through.  </li>
            <li>I really think it works just as good as the original - it does for me</li>
            <li>I have fine, wavy color treated hair and am having some breakage and dryness since highlighting.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair</li>
            <li>I have fine, medium length hair and a TON of it.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, curly hair that I color.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine but lots of body.</li>
            <li>Does wonders for my fine hair (that is super tangly!)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s GREAT for detangling, leaves a nice scent, and I haven&#x27;t noticed that it weighs down my hair at all.</li>
            <li>Great product, helps with my super dry hair, very hydrating, great price too</li>
            <li>This product makes a huge difference in how my fine hair feels.  </li>
            <li>Perfect to add a little softness after using the Its A 10 Miracle Volumizing Shampoo.</li>
            <li>The reviews I&#x27;ve read about this product were absolutely accurate.  </li>
            <li>It tends to be a bit cheaper in price though, so that is a huge bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product will be a huge help.</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of the</li>
            <li>and I have noticed a huge reduction in frizz and the effects of humidity on my hair.  </li>
            <li>I am happy with the Lite version and just ordered my second bottle.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really smooth, but helps control frizz.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe that this is a genuine product.</li>
            <li>Leave hair smooth and shiny without adding weight.</li>
            <li>but it definitely keeps my ends looking great.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair feeling silky smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a 10 is available in salons, but every time I have compare prices, Amazon&#x27;s have been lower.  </li>
            <li>I have relaxed hair that I enjoy taking care of, and this has been the LIFE of my hair.</li>
            <li>I use it everyday and It makes my hair look awesome!</li>
            <li>I love it so much I bought another bottle for my daughter and grand daughter.</li>
            <li>Its a 10 fixes it right up and makes it all better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I took a chance and tried the light version because it really does work!</li>
            <li>I have been using the original</li>
            <li>I feel in love with it after the first use.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell like the original product, and doesn&#x27;t feel like it in my hair.</li>
            <li>First leave-in product I&#x27;ve ever been able to say that about.  </li>
            <li>I started off using the original version after my stylist recommended it to me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a fan of the original for quite some time</li>
            <li>I started using the original spray years ago.</li>
            <li>A hair dresser recommended the original Miracle Leave In Product  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a 10 products, but I was use to the original version.  </li>
            <li>I think I prefer the original and</li>
            <li>But so worth it!</li>
            <li>I have very fine straight hair that is prone to oiliness.  </li>
            <li>Same great features as the standard product (which I LOVE) but better and lighter.  </li>
            <li>This is a great leave-in conditioner because it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my fine hair.</li>
            <li>I really like this leave in conditioner, and I have tried many of them.  </li>
            <li>This leave-in product makes hair-brushing much easier and more manageable and don&#x27;t leave greasy feeling in your hair.</li>
            <li>My favorite of the whole line.</li>
            <li>My hair stylist recommended I use this product because I straighten daily (with Paul Mitchell Neuro Smooth Flat Iron, which is awesome!).</li>
            <li>I washed and deep conditioned with other products that I&#x27;m happy with, but needed a good leave-in conditioner to deal with tangles.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair tangle free and gives it just the right amount of conditioning.  </li>
            <li>My stylist suggested I try the new Lite version because my hair is very fine.  </li>
            <li>I have always had very straight, fine hair.</li>
            <li>Not as powerful as the original product</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say it has fixed my hair problem as in made it all healthy again, but it does do the trick for after shampooing getting the hair to dry into a manageable condition, and that makes me happy.</li>
            <li>Shipped and received quickly.  </li>
            <li>Stylist uses the regular strength Perfect 10 at the salon, but because she recommended a deep conditioner for the shower, I didn&#x27;t want to overdo it and make my hair feel greasy at home.</li>
            <li>The blonde is perfect, but the smell is gross.</li>
            <li>I found this a tremendous bargain compared to my salon.  </li>
            <li>While browsing on Amazon I stumbled upon a lite version and quickly ordered some.</li>
            <li>Delived quickly and no damage.</li>
            <li>Great selling product that detangles your hair without leaving a heavy residue like the original</li>
            <li>This conditioner does not dull my hair and my highlights seem to stand out more.</li>
            <li>This really does detangle it easily and that reduces breakage.  </li>
            <li>which is awesome because I&#x27;ve been trying to grow out my hair for a long time without results but all of a sudden</li>
            <li>Amazon is much cheaper!!</li>
            <li>It shipped extremely quickly and it left my hair smelling and feeling amazing.</li>
            <li>and my hair is smooth, static free &amp; also has some body after blow dry.</li>
            <li>Was recommended this product by a local beauty supply store -- for more volume for fine hair.  </li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;lite&amp;#34; works great without weighing down my hair, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about putting on too much like I did with the original.</li>
            <li>is very conditioning, even for a &#x27;light&#x27; conditioner.  </li>
            <li>So far I have used it twice and love it.</li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews, but had to weigh in on this one.</li>
            <li>worth it.</li>
            <li>keeps your hair soft and prevents static.</li>
            <li>rarely I love how soft my hair feel when I use it though.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had good hair days for a week, so I am certainly not complaining.</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to be able to return it for a full refund.  </li>
            <li>I liked the original, but it really was too heavy for my super fine hair.</li>
            <li>I tried the original and didn&#x27;t really care for it</li>
            <li>If you are reading this, and you have abused your hair with flat irons/heat styling, please be kind to yourself and purchase a bottle.</li>
            <li>Most hair products contain PARABENS and finding a good leave-in without parabens is very hard.</li>
            <li>I use two sprays and it&#x27;s easy to comb through my hair without tugging or pulling and my hair is so soft and manageable for the rest of the day.  </li>
            <li>Previously used the non-lite version of this product and loved it.</li>
            <li>WAY less fly aways than I normally had...</li>
            <li>I have fine, naturally curly hair and</li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy/curly fine hair</li>
            <li>It really does what the ads say...how unusual!!</li>
            <li>But this spray has helped so much, my hair doesn&#x27;t tangle as much as it used to.&lt;br /&gt;It smells clean</li>
            <li>Light enough for my 3 year old&#x27;s fine hair too!</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;lite&amp;#34; was way better than the regular</li>
            <li>Great product omgoodness detangles fast and combs through well no more snagging will be def.</li>
            <li>Nice product, but did not do as well as I expected.</li>
            <li>Soft, but not at all greasy, and light, but still has volume.</li>
            <li>Really!</li>
            <li>Exactly as seen in reviews.</li>
            <li>This is EXACTLY what I needed.</li>
            <li>I also have a pretty oily scalp</li>
            <li>First time trying this product and it exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for 6 months and my hair is much healthier!</li>
            <li>I suggest spraying it onto your hands and rubbing it into your hair better than just simply spraying it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It makes your hair feel really soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>It brought life back to my hair and made it so healthy.</li>
            <li>I have used this religiously, much cheaper here on Amazon then in stores (even drug stores!)</li>
            <li>It is light though and most conditioners weigh it down.  </li>
            <li>It smells a little different than the original, but smells great.</li>
            <li>My hair is unbelievably soft and shiny, and it looks good even when I just let it air dry.</li>
            <li>It weighed down my hair, even more so than the original</li>
            <li>Cheaper then a drug store, works simply amazing on my dry and tangled hair!!!</li>
            <li>It is well worth the high price</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to roller set quicker than usual because the combs easily slid through my strands.  </li>
            <li>I love this product, I have long hair that is always tangled, even after I use lots of conditioner in the shower.</li>
            <li>This is the best detangler ever, and I have used quite a few of them due to babyfine hair.  </li>
            <li>a 10 really is like a miracle product and you can tell a difference in your hair after the first time you use it.</li>
            <li>Love this product will use as long as I can.</li>
            <li>It just feels like I have soft, full hair.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and still controls the tanlges which is nice</li>
            <li>It smells nice &amp; it does not weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li>Works great with a flat iron - and makes me hair so much easier to comb wet.  </li>
            <li>It is much better when I use it on dry hair, so I guess I won&#x27;t be getting any of those (supposedly) heat protecting capabilities.</li>
            <li>I really love this stuff but if it actually gave my hair more body instead of just not weighing it down it would be my ONE hair product..</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;It&#x27;s a 10\\&quot; for blondes definitely helps with the toning, but this stuff is magic on making my hair soft!</li>
            <li>It does help detangle my hair a little and make it smell nice, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li>Not heavy at all and does exactly what it says it does!</li>
            <li>Those are expensive but very good.</li>
            <li>and it makes combing much easier.  </li>
            <li>I think that for once I&#x27;ve found a product that really does all (10 things) that it claims.</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>I really recommend it.</li>
            <li>, gunky &amp; my hair is very managable after using.</li>
            <li>and I have seen much improvement with my hair.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>but I would be hesitant to give this product up because I haven&#x27;t found anything I like as much yet.</li>
            <li>Still, I haven&#x27;t noticed much of an impact.  </li>
            <li>and it is very manageable...</li>
            <li>It really helps to blend all the hair strands together.</li>
            <li>really</li>
            <li>It really does all 10 things it says it does.</li>
            <li>This is very lite as a leave in conditioner, it does make your hair shine, and it removes the tangles.  </li>
            <li>Makes your hair really shiny.  </li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>This was one product that really lived up to its name.  </li>
            <li>leave my hair really oily at the end of the day...</li>
            <li>Much cheaper to buy on here than in a salon or supply store.</li>
            <li>Received in a very timely manner and with no issues.</li>
            <li>Now after 55 years with straight hair, I must learn how to style curley hair.</li>
            <li>Fragrance is gentle.  </li>
            <li>I then came across the light version at a clearance price at my local grocery store for $6.  </li>
            <li>My hair is so much healthier since I started using this product.  </li>
            <li>I really like it so far.&lt;br</li>
            <li>awesome for the price, i have chemically treated bleach blonde hair that is thin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK, but didn&#x27;t do anything special for my fine, curly, difficult hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair is super shiny, bouncy and light - not weighed down at all.  </li>
            <li>When my hairdresser introduced me to the original product, I was astonished at how great it worked with just a small amount of product - it didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and it seemed to be a miracle.  </li>
            <li>I have dry frizzy naturally wavy hair that is color processed and very fine</li>
            <li>i like the lite formula better than the regular since my hair has a fine texture and can be weighed down</li>
            <li>but I think I&#x27;ll go back to the original.  </li>
            <li>Works great and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>After using this the first time, I couldn&#x27;t believe that my hair felt so soft!</li>
            <li>It does all the same as the original but feels lighter on my hair.</li>
            <li>I have long, fine hair, but lots of it.  </li>
            <li>I used this product for the first time last night on freshly washed (well, WEN lotioned) and OHEMGEEEE.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to spray on and reduces the amount of time to blow dry hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine, thin hair and the original &amp;#34;leave in&amp;#34; formula made my hair super greasy on day 2.  </li>
            <li>This product definitely has an appropriate name, because it has been a miracle for my fine, limp hair.  </li>
            <li>Will continue to buy this as long as it is available.</li>
            <li>I have found the opposite to be true with Its a 10 Lite.</li>
            <li>However, it is so good that my very fine, thin, poker straight hair becomes even more difficult to style.</li>
            <li>It does not leave my hair weighed down and greasy like too many of these products.  </li>
            <li>Its a 10.&lt;br /&gt;It works just as well and better because it doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair down or make it greasy.</li>
            <li>Most of the leave-ins i have tried would not hold curls and this doesn&#x27;t weigh down hair or my curls at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product because it does not weigh down my hair.</li>
            <li>The original is good, but a little heavy for my hair.</li>
            <li>While it says Lite is still is a bit heavy for very fine hair.</li>
            <li>This product makes combing my wet hair easy.  </li>
            <li>i lightly spray on and blow dry and</li>
            <li>It tames my fly-aways and gives it a nice soft texture, without making it heavy.  </li>
            <li>particular product fits the bill, though.  </li>
            <li>I use it mainly on my ends at it</li>
            <li>I love the way my hair looks when I use it, and I can see a difference in hair health, but by the end of the day it&#x27;s a greasy mess</li>
            <li>The very first time I used this a friend immediately noticed and asked what I did differently!</li>
            <li>I have long, straight and super tangly hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been red, ash blonde, light blonde, light brown and one time....</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>but it doesnt help your stands blend into each other, its more stringy but shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>This cost a little more than 1/2 at the beauty supply stores.</li>
            <li>but it weighed my fine hair down too much.  </li>
            <li>I use it as a detangler in the morning when my hair near the nape of my neck is tangled from sleeping, and it makes my ponytail look straight and sleek.</li>
            <li>Using this leave-in conditioner makes my hair soft and very manageable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the regular formula for several months and I love how shiny and soft it makes my hair</li>
            <li>They all are great at conditioning, especially when I pull my hair into a bun, but when I leave my hair down, I prefer the blonde as it&#x27;s not heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li>this stuff is great especially for fine hair and lets you round brush your hair w/o it looking greasy and dull</li>
            <li>Right now, I&#x27;m a &#x27;sun kissed&#x27; blonde and</li>
            <li>It makes it easy to brush thru after washing and does not weigh hair down.</li>
            <li>I am African American, and my hair is relaxed, fine and shoulder</li>
            <li>I live in Florida</li>
            <li>No matter how ratty our daughter&#x27;s hair gets from her active, boisterous lifestyle, we can count on this product to smooth out and help separate her tangled hair that still manages to stay tangled even after getting out of the shower with shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine hair down.</li>
            <li>This product works well with my finely textured hair because it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.  </li>
            <li>It does not weigh your hair down if you have fine hair like me.</li>
            <li>I also started using the \\&quot;its a 10 keratin deep conditioner\\&quot; which just makes my processed blonde hair so much softer, sleeker and really does feel so much healthier!</li>
            <li>Just a little spray and the brush/combs goes right thru!!  </li>
            <li>so far I have had no complaints!</li>
            <li>my hair looks exactly the same</li>
            <li>I used it that first time and was actually amazed.</li>
            <li>Because my hair is so fine it is easily weighed down by heavy products but not this one.  </li>
            <li>I have thin, fine, hair that clumps up or looks oily very easily from a lot of hair products, so I have to be careful.</li>
            <li>This one works much better for me and does not leave my hair limp and heavy as the original product did.</li>
            <li>I have super thin and fine hair and when I go to salons I&#x27;ve had the stylist use</li>
            <li>A spray on conditioner that is not heavy and it make my hair feel so very soft, and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I thought it might be worth trying this product to see if it wouldn&#x27;t weigh my hair down as much as others, but if I use it all over it does tend to do this.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair seem a little second day in a good way, when I use it on dry hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light enough that one extra spray won&#x27;t put you overboard from smooth to greasy.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down like the original formula does.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; product dosent weigh my hair down like the original.</li>
            <li>Old fashioned conditioners help to untangle but have always been too heavy and waxy for my fine hair.</li>
            <li>We then apply short, rapid strokes to the hair while holding near the roots to avoid root pain from the comb pulling the hair with too much force.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft yet not greasy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 49 years old.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft, silky and shiny.  </li>
            <li>So far, I haven&#x27;t found it in stores, so I will continue to buy it online....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m all for the natural texture trend and haven&#x27;t blow dryed my hair in months.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft &amp; shiny, and the texture is still there, but tamed.  </li>
            <li>Detangles while leaving hair soft.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li>It will make your hair so soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>I use wet roller sets to achieve my straight style, so it&#x27;s important for me to have slip for wet combing.  </li>
            <li>If what you want is soft, puffy, frizzy hair, this is for you.  </li>
            <li>you won&#x27;t believe it is your old hair.  </li>
            <li>Thought maybe the regular product might be a bit heavy in summer or on vacations when I shampoo more often.</li>
            <li>Too heavy for fine hair, but it does take out bad knots which fine hair can get very easily.  </li>
            <li>Like many of the other reviewers, I have very fine, very thin hair.  </li>
            <li>bottle at full price and the product just weighed down my hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little on the pricier side, but after being on the hunt for &#x27;years&#x27; for decent products, it&#x27;s worth it to me.</li>
            <li>Arrived right when it was expected.</li>
            <li>I use this on my daughter&#x27;s hair (2 yrs) and i really like that its not very heavy like the regular</li>
            <li>My hair is oily, fine and thin and I live in a very humid area.</li>
            <li>I bought some for my daughter (who has very oily hair) because she likes to use heat (flat iron or curling wand).</li>
            <li>I never thought the original Its a 10 was heavy on my hair, but decided to try this Lite version just to see what the difference is.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am Latina with very long, straight to wavy hair and it leaves my hair soft and detangles my hair with ease.</li>
            <li>The problem is that now half my hair is straight, half is curley,and all of it is fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all I use after I wash and towel dry, spray lightly around entire head, comb through and blow dry.  </li>
            <li>I have finer blonde hair, and this is my least favorite of the 3 &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a Miracle&amp;#34; products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m accomplished the same results with lesser products.</li>
            <li>But no other hair products with aragon oil can compete in my view.  </li>
            <li>I have blonde very fine, soft, thin hair.</li>
            <li>It can be a little pricey but its worth it.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a decent product, just use a VERY tiny amount.</li>
            <li>I struggle to combat hard water and dryness with keeping fabulous hair.  </li>
            <li>I use it everyday and my hair was over processed and dry and this helps make it look more natural when I blow dry it.</li>
            <li>about three sprits of this in my damp freshly washed hair left my hair feeling silky, soft, moisturized and even a little volumized.</li>
            <li>Since I was old enough to steal my sister&#x27;s Seventeen Magazine I have been taught to treat my hair with heat.</li>
            <li>then left it softer and  natural.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft (its also color treated), has extra volume even!  </li>
            <li>Fantastic product for thick hair.  </li>
            <li>But I can&#x27;t use too much conditioner or product without completely weighing it down.</li>
            <li>Many products are just too heavy for my hair and weigh it down.  </li>
            <li>but it does contain something that makes my hair feel less than fresh the next day.  </li>
            <li>I have normal (not greasy or dry) hair.  </li>
            <li>I recommend no more that two (2) quick sprays.</li>
            <li>Due to my hair type, it gets very tangly and knotty after washing, even after using conditioner.  </li>
            <li>This product helps it stay soft and manageable all day long.  </li>
            <li>This not only eliminates tangles and frizz but does 8 other awesome things to turn my dried out, hard to tame hair into something that actually resembles a hairstyle!  </li>
            <li>However, although it didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down much, I really wanted a lighter version - and I now have it.  </li>
            <li>Although it didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down as much, It did nothing for me hair.  </li>
            <li>So far my hair is still dry, so</li>
            <li>When dry my hair is soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>bottle is fairly small, and it goes quickly if you use it 4-7 times a week on long hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It does weigh my hair down a little, but its something I&#x27;m willing to live with for hair</li>
            <li>I have thin, fine hair &amp; I</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work well for thin, fine hair.</li>
            <li>I recommend it to all women with thin or fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have extremely thin, fine, and damaged hair.</li>
            <li>It is a little bottle, so I don&#x27;t used a whole lot of it.</li>

            <li> Great for fine hair.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  </li>
            <li> It will make your hair amazing.</li>
            <li> The amount of hair that would break off was amazing.</li>
            <li> SO light, smells great and has improved my hair dramatically....</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li> With just a coupe of squirts this does the job and smells nice too.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, though.  </li>
            <li> Liked the</li>
            <li> And it smells good too &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> BEST LEAVE-IN REALLY HYDRATES MY HAIR &amp; I</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell</li>
            <li> The texture was so greatly improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this Lite version is lower in price than the original, i&#x27;d say start with this one and see how it does.</li>
            <li> My curls and waves are more defined and I have way more volume without frizz!  </li>
            <li> The best leave-in product I have tried soo far.</li>
            <li> That my own thing though :).</li>
            <li> Worth every penny and great prices</li>
            <li> Removes tangles easily!</li>
            <li> This is the perfect leave in conditioner for straight, fine hair.</li>
            <li> It still repairs and detangles every bit as good as the original.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is strong but fairly nice.  </li>
            <li> now i&#x27;m working on getting it healthy again, and this stuff is def helping.</li>
            <li> I got the LITE formula to see if that was better</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried most of the Its a 10 Miracle leave in</li>
            <li> This works really well, and the price is great</li>
            <li> Nice and light.  </li>
            <li> Smells great but didn&#x27;t condition hair very well.  </li>
            <li> I love that it also has thermal protection.</li>
            <li> and so glad I did.</li>
            <li> ordering more</li>
            <li> ; light, nice fragrance, non-build up.  </li>
            <li> Love this conditioner.</li>
            <li> Wish they made a bottle more proportionely sized to the shampoo.</li>
            <li> and I fell in love with the scent and the way my hair looked and felt after she was done styling it.</li>
            <li> However I love this one the most..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so lightweight, some days when my hair is a bit more thirsty I can add more to the ends and not worry about it looking greasy.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product fop heat protectant.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i just love it.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Just okay.</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> okay...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an ok product.</li>
            <li> and I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> If you wear extensions, this stuff is great to help blend the extensions and real hair.</li>
            <li> I think it might actually be better than 12 benefits which has a lot of hype.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Maybe works better for those with better hair.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> She mostly likes the way it makes her hair smell, but her hair looks better since she&#x27;s been using it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> love this product.</li>
            <li> I love the lite #10</li>
            <li> My hair needs washing more often</li>
            <li> Even if you just want to add some manageability and not necessarily repair, it is excellent.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> but this stuff is even better.</li>
            <li> It has a nice fresh warm scent.</li>
            <li> I got the perfect 10 basic shampoo and conditioner, and the leave in for blondes.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing again for sure.</li>
            <li> My hair looks better without applying this spray.</li>
            <li> This is a nice, light leave in conditioner.  </li>
            <li> will stick with the regular one as that works best for me.</li>
            <li> I love the &#x27;lite&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I also love the way it smells.</li>
            <li> I am glad I had this after using the Its A 10 Miracle Volumizing Shampoo.</li>
            <li> :) :)</li>
            <li> :) : )</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll probably keep ordering, but I cannot have more than 2 squirts</li>
            <li> This stuff is so light but so effective.  </li>
            <li> It is actually just perfect.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has very fine but easily tangled hair.</li>
            <li> I was excited to see a lite version, but honestly, this one seems to be just as greasy if accidentally overused.</li>
            <li> As my hair turns gray it is becoming increasingly curley, which is okay.</li>
            <li> /&gt;[am able to do it myself (without my daughter} VERY QUICK DELIVERY</li>
            <li> Its not a terrible smell, but it is STRONG.</li>
            <li> Works great to keep my hair soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and prone to static.</li>
            <li> I just love this product for my fine textured hair.</li>
            <li> Found this worked just as well and probably better for fine hair.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner-use it after washing with Its a 10 shampoo and it is light and works well on my fine hair leaving it shiny and with more volume.</li>
            <li> It works great in all the sense that it leaves your hair soft and tangle-free but it is not LITE.</li>
            <li> Several months ago I permed it, then got the brilliant idea to bleach it.</li>
            <li> very lightweight and smells so good</li>
            <li> Applying this to your freshly shampooed and conditioned hair nicely detangles my hair allowing the comb to glide through easily.</li>
            <li> Originally bought this at my hair salon and needed more...</li>
            <li> Works even better than the original its a 10 product.</li>
            <li> Easy to use Leave in conditioning for your hair.  </li>
            <li> Really like this and so far, very impressed with the</li>
            <li> It is so easy to use</li>
            <li> The smell is not too strong either, floral scent.</li>
            <li> I have fine straight hair and this by far one of the best products ive ever tried!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty amazing stuff.</li>
            <li> This is some pretty amazing hair treatment.</li>
            <li> I have really fine hair that gets tangled after showering and this product makes it so easy to comb through.  </li>
            <li> I really think it works just as good as the original - it does for me</li>
            <li> I have fine, wavy color treated hair and am having some breakage and dryness since highlighting.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair</li>
            <li> I have fine, medium length hair and a TON of it.  </li>
            <li> I have fine, curly hair that I color.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine but lots of body.</li>
            <li> Does wonders for my fine hair (that is super tangly!)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s GREAT for detangling, leaves a nice scent, and I haven&#x27;t noticed that it weighs down my hair at all.</li>
            <li> Great product, helps with my super dry hair, very hydrating, great price too</li>
            <li> This product makes a huge difference in how my fine hair feels.  </li>
            <li> Perfect to add a little softness after using the Its A 10 Miracle Volumizing Shampoo.</li>
            <li> The reviews I&#x27;ve read about this product were absolutely accurate.  </li>
            <li> It tends to be a bit cheaper in price though, so that is a huge bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product will be a huge help.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of the</li>
            <li> and I have noticed a huge reduction in frizz and the effects of humidity on my hair.  </li>
            <li> I am happy with the Lite version and just ordered my second bottle.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really smooth, but helps control frizz.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe that this is a genuine product.</li>
            <li> Leave hair smooth and shiny without adding weight.</li>
            <li> but it definitely keeps my ends looking great.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair feeling silky smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a 10 is available in salons, but every time I have compare prices, Amazon&#x27;s have been lower.  </li>
            <li> I have relaxed hair that I enjoy taking care of, and this has been the LIFE of my hair.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and It makes my hair look awesome!</li>
            <li> I love it so much I bought another bottle for my daughter and grand daughter.</li>
            <li> Its a 10 fixes it right up and makes it all better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I took a chance and tried the light version because it really does work!</li>
            <li> I have been using the original</li>
            <li> I feel in love with it after the first use.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like the original product, and doesn&#x27;t feel like it in my hair.</li>
            <li> First leave-in product I&#x27;ve ever been able to say that about.  </li>
            <li> I started off using the original version after my stylist recommended it to me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of the original for quite some time</li>
            <li> I started using the original spray years ago.</li>
            <li> A hair dresser recommended the original Miracle Leave In Product  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a 10 products, but I was use to the original version.  </li>
            <li> I think I prefer the original and</li>
            <li> But so worth it!</li>
            <li> I have very fine straight hair that is prone to oiliness.  </li>
            <li> Same great features as the standard product (which I LOVE) but better and lighter.  </li>
            <li> This is a great leave-in conditioner because it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my fine hair.</li>
            <li> I really like this leave in conditioner, and I have tried many of them.  </li>
            <li> This leave-in product makes hair-brushing much easier and more manageable and don&#x27;t leave greasy feeling in your hair.</li>
            <li> My favorite of the whole line.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist recommended I use this product because I straighten daily (with Paul Mitchell Neuro Smooth Flat Iron, which is awesome!).</li>
            <li> I washed and deep conditioned with other products that I&#x27;m happy with, but needed a good leave-in conditioner to deal with tangles.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair tangle free and gives it just the right amount of conditioning.  </li>
            <li> My stylist suggested I try the new Lite version because my hair is very fine.  </li>
            <li> I have always had very straight, fine hair.</li>
            <li> Not as powerful as the original product</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say it has fixed my hair problem as in made it all healthy again, but it does do the trick for after shampooing getting the hair to dry into a manageable condition, and that makes me happy.</li>
            <li> Shipped and received quickly.  </li>
            <li> Stylist uses the regular strength Perfect 10 at the salon, but because she recommended a deep conditioner for the shower, I didn&#x27;t want to overdo it and make my hair feel greasy at home.</li>
            <li> The blonde is perfect, but the smell is gross.</li>
            <li> I found this a tremendous bargain compared to my salon.  </li>
            <li> While browsing on Amazon I stumbled upon a lite version and quickly ordered some.</li>
            <li> Delived quickly and no damage.</li>
            <li> Great selling product that detangles your hair without leaving a heavy residue like the original</li>
            <li> This conditioner does not dull my hair and my highlights seem to stand out more.</li>
            <li> This really does detangle it easily and that reduces breakage.  </li>
            <li> which is awesome because I&#x27;ve been trying to grow out my hair for a long time without results but all of a sudden</li>
            <li> Amazon is much cheaper!!</li>
            <li> It shipped extremely quickly and it left my hair smelling and feeling amazing.</li>
            <li> and my hair is smooth, static free &amp; also has some body after blow dry.</li>
            <li> Was recommended this product by a local beauty supply store -- for more volume for fine hair.  </li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;lite&amp;#34; works great without weighing down my hair, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about putting on too much like I did with the original.</li>
            <li> is very conditioning, even for a &#x27;light&#x27; conditioner.  </li>
            <li> So far I have used it twice and love it.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews, but had to weigh in on this one.</li>
            <li> worth it.</li>
            <li> keeps your hair soft and prevents static.</li>
            <li> rarely I love how soft my hair feel when I use it though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had good hair days for a week, so I am certainly not complaining.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to be able to return it for a full refund.  </li>
            <li> I liked the original, but it really was too heavy for my super fine hair.</li>
            <li> I tried the original and didn&#x27;t really care for it</li>
            <li> If you are reading this, and you have abused your hair with flat irons/heat styling, please be kind to yourself and purchase a bottle.</li>
            <li> Most hair products contain PARABENS and finding a good leave-in without parabens is very hard.</li>
            <li> I use two sprays and it&#x27;s easy to comb through my hair without tugging or pulling and my hair is so soft and manageable for the rest of the day.  </li>
            <li> Previously used the non-lite version of this product and loved it.</li>
            <li> WAY less fly aways than I normally had...</li>
            <li> I have fine, naturally curly hair and</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy/curly fine hair</li>
            <li> It really does what the ads say...how unusual!!</li>
            <li> But this spray has helped so much, my hair doesn&#x27;t tangle as much as it used to.&lt;br /&gt;It smells clean</li>
            <li> Light enough for my 3 year old&#x27;s fine hair too!</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;lite&amp;#34; was way better than the regular</li>
            <li> Great product omgoodness detangles fast and combs through well no more snagging will be def.</li>
            <li> Nice product, but did not do as well as I expected.</li>
            <li> Soft, but not at all greasy, and light, but still has volume.</li>
            <li> Really!</li>
            <li> Exactly as seen in reviews.</li>
            <li> This is EXACTLY what I needed.</li>
            <li> I also have a pretty oily scalp</li>
            <li> First time trying this product and it exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 6 months and my hair is much healthier!</li>
            <li> I suggest spraying it onto your hands and rubbing it into your hair better than just simply spraying it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It makes your hair feel really soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> It brought life back to my hair and made it so healthy.</li>
            <li> I have used this religiously, much cheaper here on Amazon then in stores (even drug stores!)</li>
            <li> It is light though and most conditioners weigh it down.  </li>
            <li> It smells a little different than the original, but smells great.</li>
            <li> My hair is unbelievably soft and shiny, and it looks good even when I just let it air dry.</li>
            <li> It weighed down my hair, even more so than the original</li>
            <li> Cheaper then a drug store, works simply amazing on my dry and tangled hair!!!</li>
            <li> It is well worth the high price</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to roller set quicker than usual because the combs easily slid through my strands.  </li>
            <li> I love this product, I have long hair that is always tangled, even after I use lots of conditioner in the shower.</li>
            <li> This is the best detangler ever, and I have used quite a few of them due to babyfine hair.  </li>
            <li> a 10 really is like a miracle product and you can tell a difference in your hair after the first time you use it.</li>
            <li> Love this product will use as long as I can.</li>
            <li> It just feels like I have soft, full hair.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and still controls the tanlges which is nice</li>
            <li> It smells nice &amp; it does not weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> Works great with a flat iron - and makes me hair so much easier to comb wet.  </li>
            <li> It is much better when I use it on dry hair, so I guess I won&#x27;t be getting any of those (supposedly) heat protecting capabilities.</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff but if it actually gave my hair more body instead of just not weighing it down it would be my ONE hair product..</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;It&#x27;s a 10\\&quot; for blondes definitely helps with the toning, but this stuff is magic on making my hair soft!</li>
            <li> It does help detangle my hair a little and make it smell nice, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> Not heavy at all and does exactly what it says it does!</li>
            <li> Those are expensive but very good.</li>
            <li> and it makes combing much easier.  </li>
            <li> I think that for once I&#x27;ve found a product that really does all (10 things) that it claims.</li>
            <li> I really like this product</li>
            <li> I really recommend it.</li>
            <li> , gunky &amp; my hair is very managable after using.</li>
            <li> and I have seen much improvement with my hair.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> but I would be hesitant to give this product up because I haven&#x27;t found anything I like as much yet.</li>
            <li> Still, I haven&#x27;t noticed much of an impact.  </li>
            <li> and it is very manageable...</li>
            <li> It really helps to blend all the hair strands together.</li>
            <li> really</li>
            <li> It really does all 10 things it says it does.</li>
            <li> This is very lite as a leave in conditioner, it does make your hair shine, and it removes the tangles.  </li>
            <li> Makes your hair really shiny.  </li>
            <li> I really like it.  </li>
            <li> This was one product that really lived up to its name.  </li>
            <li> leave my hair really oily at the end of the day...</li>
            <li> Much cheaper to buy on here than in a salon or supply store.</li>
            <li> Received in a very timely manner and with no issues.</li>
            <li> Now after 55 years with straight hair, I must learn how to style curley hair.</li>
            <li> Fragrance is gentle.  </li>
            <li> I then came across the light version at a clearance price at my local grocery store for $6.  </li>
            <li> My hair is so much healthier since I started using this product.  </li>
            <li> I really like it so far.&lt;br</li>
            <li> awesome for the price, i have chemically treated bleach blonde hair that is thin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK, but didn&#x27;t do anything special for my fine, curly, difficult hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is super shiny, bouncy and light - not weighed down at all.  </li>
            <li> When my hairdresser introduced me to the original product, I was astonished at how great it worked with just a small amount of product - it didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and it seemed to be a miracle.  </li>
            <li> I have dry frizzy naturally wavy hair that is color processed and very fine</li>
            <li> i like the lite formula better than the regular since my hair has a fine texture and can be weighed down</li>
            <li> but I think I&#x27;ll go back to the original.  </li>
            <li> Works great and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> After using this the first time, I couldn&#x27;t believe that my hair felt so soft!</li>
            <li> It does all the same as the original but feels lighter on my hair.</li>
            <li> I have long, fine hair, but lots of it.  </li>
            <li> I used this product for the first time last night on freshly washed (well, WEN lotioned) and OHEMGEEEE.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to spray on and reduces the amount of time to blow dry hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair and the original &amp;#34;leave in&amp;#34; formula made my hair super greasy on day 2.  </li>
            <li> This product definitely has an appropriate name, because it has been a miracle for my fine, limp hair.  </li>
            <li> Will continue to buy this as long as it is available.</li>
            <li> I have found the opposite to be true with Its a 10 Lite.</li>
            <li> However, it is so good that my very fine, thin, poker straight hair becomes even more difficult to style.</li>
            <li> It does not leave my hair weighed down and greasy like too many of these products.  </li>
            <li> Its a 10.&lt;br /&gt;It works just as well and better because it doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair down or make it greasy.</li>
            <li> Most of the leave-ins i have tried would not hold curls and this doesn&#x27;t weigh down hair or my curls at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this product because it does not weigh down my hair.</li>
            <li> The original is good, but a little heavy for my hair.</li>
            <li> While it says Lite is still is a bit heavy for very fine hair.</li>
            <li> This product makes combing my wet hair easy.  </li>
            <li> i lightly spray on and blow dry and</li>
            <li> It tames my fly-aways and gives it a nice soft texture, without making it heavy.  </li>
            <li> particular product fits the bill, though.  </li>
            <li> I use it mainly on my ends at it</li>
            <li> I love the way my hair looks when I use it, and I can see a difference in hair health, but by the end of the day it&#x27;s a greasy mess</li>
            <li> The very first time I used this a friend immediately noticed and asked what I did differently!</li>
            <li> I have long, straight and super tangly hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been red, ash blonde, light blonde, light brown and one time....</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> but it doesnt help your stands blend into each other, its more stringy but shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> This cost a little more than 1/2 at the beauty supply stores.</li>
            <li> but it weighed my fine hair down too much.  </li>
            <li> I use it as a detangler in the morning when my hair near the nape of my neck is tangled from sleeping, and it makes my ponytail look straight and sleek.</li>
            <li> Using this leave-in conditioner makes my hair soft and very manageable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the regular formula for several months and I love how shiny and soft it makes my hair</li>
            <li> They all are great at conditioning, especially when I pull my hair into a bun, but when I leave my hair down, I prefer the blonde as it&#x27;s not heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> this stuff is great especially for fine hair and lets you round brush your hair w/o it looking greasy and dull</li>
            <li> Right now, I&#x27;m a &#x27;sun kissed&#x27; blonde and</li>
            <li> It makes it easy to brush thru after washing and does not weigh hair down.</li>
            <li> I am African American, and my hair is relaxed, fine and shoulder</li>
            <li> I live in Florida</li>
            <li> No matter how ratty our daughter&#x27;s hair gets from her active, boisterous lifestyle, we can count on this product to smooth out and help separate her tangled hair that still manages to stay tangled even after getting out of the shower with shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine hair down.</li>
            <li> This product works well with my finely textured hair because it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.  </li>
            <li> It does not weigh your hair down if you have fine hair like me.</li>
            <li> I also started using the \\&quot;its a 10 keratin deep conditioner\\&quot; which just makes my processed blonde hair so much softer, sleeker and really does feel so much healthier!</li>
            <li> Just a little spray and the brush/combs goes right thru!!  </li>
            <li> so far I have had no complaints!</li>
            <li> my hair looks exactly the same</li>
            <li> I used it that first time and was actually amazed.</li>
            <li> Because my hair is so fine it is easily weighed down by heavy products but not this one.  </li>
            <li> I have thin, fine, hair that clumps up or looks oily very easily from a lot of hair products, so I have to be careful.</li>
            <li> This one works much better for me and does not leave my hair limp and heavy as the original product did.</li>
            <li> I have super thin and fine hair and when I go to salons I&#x27;ve had the stylist use</li>
            <li> A spray on conditioner that is not heavy and it make my hair feel so very soft, and shiny.  </li>
            <li> I thought it might be worth trying this product to see if it wouldn&#x27;t weigh my hair down as much as others, but if I use it all over it does tend to do this.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair seem a little second day in a good way, when I use it on dry hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light enough that one extra spray won&#x27;t put you overboard from smooth to greasy.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down like the original formula does.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; product dosent weigh my hair down like the original.</li>
            <li> Old fashioned conditioners help to untangle but have always been too heavy and waxy for my fine hair.</li>
            <li> We then apply short, rapid strokes to the hair while holding near the roots to avoid root pain from the comb pulling the hair with too much force.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft yet not greasy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 49 years old.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft, silky and shiny.  </li>
            <li> So far, I haven&#x27;t found it in stores, so I will continue to buy it online....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m all for the natural texture trend and haven&#x27;t blow dryed my hair in months.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft &amp; shiny, and the texture is still there, but tamed.  </li>
            <li> Detangles while leaving hair soft.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> It will make your hair so soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> I use wet roller sets to achieve my straight style, so it&#x27;s important for me to have slip for wet combing.  </li>
            <li> If what you want is soft, puffy, frizzy hair, this is for you.  </li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t believe it is your old hair.  </li>
            <li> Thought maybe the regular product might be a bit heavy in summer or on vacations when I shampoo more often.</li>
            <li> Too heavy for fine hair, but it does take out bad knots which fine hair can get very easily.  </li>
            <li> Like many of the other reviewers, I have very fine, very thin hair.  </li>
            <li> bottle at full price and the product just weighed down my hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little on the pricier side, but after being on the hunt for &#x27;years&#x27; for decent products, it&#x27;s worth it to me.</li>
            <li> Arrived right when it was expected.</li>
            <li> I use this on my daughter&#x27;s hair (2 yrs) and i really like that its not very heavy like the regular</li>
            <li> My hair is oily, fine and thin and I live in a very humid area.</li>
            <li> I bought some for my daughter (who has very oily hair) because she likes to use heat (flat iron or curling wand).</li>
            <li> I never thought the original Its a 10 was heavy on my hair, but decided to try this Lite version just to see what the difference is.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am Latina with very long, straight to wavy hair and it leaves my hair soft and detangles my hair with ease.</li>
            <li> The problem is that now half my hair is straight, half is curley,and all of it is fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all I use after I wash and towel dry, spray lightly around entire head, comb through and blow dry.  </li>
            <li> I have finer blonde hair, and this is my least favorite of the 3 &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a Miracle&amp;#34; products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m accomplished the same results with lesser products.</li>
            <li> But no other hair products with aragon oil can compete in my view.  </li>
            <li> I have blonde very fine, soft, thin hair.</li>
            <li> It can be a little pricey but its worth it.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a decent product, just use a VERY tiny amount.</li>
            <li> I struggle to combat hard water and dryness with keeping fabulous hair.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday and my hair was over processed and dry and this helps make it look more natural when I blow dry it.</li>
            <li> about three sprits of this in my damp freshly washed hair left my hair feeling silky, soft, moisturized and even a little volumized.</li>
            <li> Since I was old enough to steal my sister&#x27;s Seventeen Magazine I have been taught to treat my hair with heat.</li>
            <li> then left it softer and  natural.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft (its also color treated), has extra volume even!  </li>
            <li> Fantastic product for thick hair.  </li>
            <li> But I can&#x27;t use too much conditioner or product without completely weighing it down.</li>
            <li> Many products are just too heavy for my hair and weigh it down.  </li>
            <li> but it does contain something that makes my hair feel less than fresh the next day.  </li>
            <li> I have normal (not greasy or dry) hair.  </li>
            <li> I recommend no more that two (2) quick sprays.</li>
            <li> Due to my hair type, it gets very tangly and knotty after washing, even after using conditioner.  </li>
            <li> This product helps it stay soft and manageable all day long.  </li>
            <li> This not only eliminates tangles and frizz but does 8 other awesome things to turn my dried out, hard to tame hair into something that actually resembles a hairstyle!  </li>
            <li> However, although it didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down much, I really wanted a lighter version - and I now have it.  </li>
            <li> Although it didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down as much, It did nothing for me hair.  </li>
            <li> So far my hair is still dry, so</li>
            <li> When dry my hair is soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> bottle is fairly small, and it goes quickly if you use it 4-7 times a week on long hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It does weigh my hair down a little, but its something I&#x27;m willing to live with for hair</li>
            <li> I have thin, fine hair &amp; I</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well for thin, fine hair.</li>
            <li> I recommend it to all women with thin or fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have extremely thin, fine, and damaged hair.</li>
            <li> It is a little bottle, so I don&#x27;t used a whole lot of it.</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t wear it down because my ends stick out in strange, unusual patterns.</li>
            <li> We tried this product after buying other ones that either left a greasy hair texture, or simply did not affect knots enough that we could comb them out on our young daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It quickly untangled wet hair but was heavy and once dry, left my hair crunchy.</li>
            <li> It protects my hair from the daily stress of blow-drying, and it works wonders as heat protection against a curling or flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I have used the regular formula and left my fine hair limp and hard to style.  </li>
            <li> I use this every day with no problems or flat hair.</li>
            <li> Lightweight formula won&#x27;t leave hair flat.</li>
            <li> I overprocess my hair with a blow dryer and now flat iron</li>
            <li> so even the smallest size will probably last me a long time.</li>
            <li> I used it every day for the first few days, and then skipped to every other day and then just like once or twice a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a light leave in conditioner because I&#x27;m over pulling through tangles, but everything seemed to make my hair dull and heavy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had short hair,  medium and very long.  </li>
            <li> i use it every time i wash my hair (2-3 times a week), and if my ends are feeling extra crispy, i use some on them when my hair is dry.</li>
            <li> I have slightly below shoulder-length hair that is naturally wavy with a tendency towards fluffiness after washing.  </li>
            <li> Compliments all day, every day.&lt;br /&gt;Use especially with the matching shampoo and blow dry styling spray.  </li>
            <li> The lite is what I need due to my hair being so thin and fine</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so I recommend starting with just a few spritzes at first, then working up from there depending on your needs.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t smooth out the ends without using a flat or curling iron.</li>
            <li> I have very thin, oily hair that tangles easily.  </li>
            <li> I have very VERY thick fine hair, but it can still be frizzy, fluffy or hat head flat.  </li>
            <li> I usually stick with only natural products</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a Ten in a dark blue bottle.  </li>
            <li> This is now my third bottle of the leave-in spray for just 1 bottle of shampoo, and I don&#x27;t think the shampoo is close to empty.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time too,</li>
            <li> My hair feels soft as silk, without being limp.</li>
            <li> so be careful and use a tiny bit.  </li>
            <li> It helps detangle my long hair.</li>
            <li> The shampoo left my hair feeling like straw, so I squirted some of this into my wet hair.</li>
            <li> At the end of the day, my hair is still soft and fluffy.  </li>
            <li> BTw, I&#x27;ve tried copy-cat versions that are more and less expensive but</li>
            <li> While other products similar to this one have made my hair to appear greasy, limp, or thin, It&#x27;s a 10 Lite has actually added enough body and bounce to my hair that I rarely even have to style my long hair anymore.  </li>
            <li> Only used it a couple of times, but my color treated hair was starting to look a little damaged&lt;br /&gt;on</li>
            <li> I do have to watch how much I apply to my roots since it will tend to get a little greasy throughout the day if I go to heavy with it.</li>
            <li> and I just spray, brush and let dry.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s naturally dry,</li>
            <li> or I use it to protect my hair during a blow dry.  </li>
            <li> i towel dry</li>
            <li> My hair was dry, damaged, over processed and the pH was not correct.</li>
            <li> When I started using it, my hair was dry, fuzzy, and breaking off like straw.  </li>
            <li> I had a Brazilian Blowout, and this product practically reversed it and has made my hair course and dry.  </li>
            <li> i recently had a terrible experience with hair dye, ending with bleach and many processes to get it back to normal again.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a decrease in breakage after only a few uses, even with use of my flat iron.</li>
            <li> I bought the dark blue &amp;#34;10&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I am generally not a fan of &amp;#34;leave-in&amp;#34; conditioners due to the fact that they tend to leave an oily residue and leave my hair looking wilted about halfway through the day.  </li>
            <li> the regular It&#x27;s a 10 leave in treatment, and it has always weighed my hair down.  </li>
            <li> live in a very dry climate and have hard water.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve sprayed it a bunch on both wet and dry hair and have had no issues.</li>
            <li> This is a bit expensive but goes a long way and worth every cent.</li>
            <li> Prefer the lite because the regular version leaves my hair a little greasy.</li>
            <li> I also like the fact that it is a heat protector since I also blow dry every other day.  </li>
            <li> I tried using it twice for that shine it claimed to impart and my hair turned cottony, dull and without its natural wave..  </li>
            <li> I&amp;#34;m curious to see how well it does in the summertime.  </li>
            <li> For when I wet and go</li>
            <li> Use it with the Wet Brush and save your hair.</li>
            <li> so I have to be careful of what I use.</li>
            <li> It definitely calms down frizzies and flyaways without weighing down my hair or making it look unclean.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use this, and as far as the price, I feel like this is a bargain compared to what I have spent in the past on hair products that did not perform half as well.</li>
            <li> I blow dry my hair almost everyday, so it tends to get dry.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to someone who needs a little extra moisture without the greasy, weighed down, look.</li>
            <li> treated hard water and it made my hair soft without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Just a little bit of this goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> And a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s the utter miracle</li>
            <li> One side flips in, the other out.</li>
            <li> My husband catches a whiff of it when he walks past me and stops, turns around, and comes back to sniff again and he always smiles.</li>
            <li> I use this every other day.</li>
            <li> But, just a few sprays go a long way.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday after I towel dry.  </li>
            <li> Too bad it is not paraben free like the</li>
            <li> The frizz makes it not worth the lighter weight.</li>
            <li> Still  experimenting with amount to use, but doesn&#x27;t seem to weigh hair down or make it feel greasy.  </li>
            <li> It does not weigh hair down at all.</li>
            <li> Does not make your hair feel weighted down</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair or make it feel sticky..</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t way down my hair.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling oily or feeling hair held down.</li>
            <li> I think I found the trick to wearing my hair down without any heat.</li>
            <li> Despite it saying lite its still weighs my hair down a lot</li>
            <li> It does all the things the manufacturer claims that it does, and the lite version keeps it from weighing down my hair.  </li>
            <li> Even my husband is using it and he doesn&#x27;t like anything that weights his hair down.</li>
            <li> its just great.&lt;br /&gt;i might as well toss all my other products!</li>
            <li> She told me to wash and condition as I usually do; towel dry and then add the leave in conditioner.  </li>
            <li> and I had to use half the bottle for it to even seem as if I put a product that helped any flyaways stay down.</li>
            <li> Other product too heavy on hair, this is a spray oil mist.</li>
            <li> it makes my hair feel lighter and less to no frizz.</li>
            <li> but I still had slight limpness.</li>
            <li> Too expensive, but my favorite for thin hair conditioning!</li>
            <li> /&gt;a little goes a long way - my hair is a little past my shoulders</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a mess.</li>
            <li> I would suggest this to all girls who have long thick hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over a month, and I wouldn&#x27;t say my hair is shinier</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little on the fence with this product.</li>
            <li> Maybe a little shininess too.</li>
            <li> I just wish it was a little easier to remember to put it in after the shower.  </li>
            <li> Just a little bit does it.  </li>
            <li> Just spray a little on before drying.</li>
            <li> I tried the regular version and it did the same thing, but it weighed my hair down and made it look dirty by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a 10 &amp;#34;regular,&amp;#34; but it was a little heavy, so tried this.  </li>
            <li> Not weighed down at all!</li>
            <li> I have thick, straight, very long hair, and it is impossible to find a product that tames frizz, cares for split ends, and doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down... until now.</li>
            <li> Its crazy how much cheaper it is on amazon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just too heavy.</li>
            <li> A few sprays of this</li>
            <li> this conditioner isn&#x27;t too heavy.  </li>
            <li> green....</li>
            <li> Just a few spritzes and a comb through</li>
            <li> Few harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> not too heavy if you have fine/thin hair</li>
            <li> My hairdresser had used this on my hair before she dried.</li>
            <li> even alittle heavy.  </li>
            <li> i have very thin flat hair and this definately helps add some volume when used with the blow dry volumizer!</li>
            <li> Now that my formerly thick, wavy hair has become thin and brittle due to flat iron abuse, I had to do something.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair feeling fuller without feeling stiff or sticky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had frizz for years and could never find anything to tame it.  </li>
            <li> I usually avoid drugstore leave-in treatments and conditioners because they have weighed my hair down in the past.  </li>
            <li> For the price at $13-$20 each, that makes it a very expensive conditioner but because of how much I like what it does to my hair, I&#x27;ll probably keep using it.</li>
            <li> I have never really liked leave-in treatments because they weighed my hair down, but I decided to give this a try out of desperation.</li>
            <li> You can use as much or as little as needed and it works wonders!</li>
            <li> my hair just feels greasy after using this, and I use very little.</li>
            <li> Just use very little.</li>
            <li> il you want your hair to be manageable and fluffy!</li>
            <li> The make a heavier one if your hair is not healthy.</li>
            <li> It was unbelievable.</li>
            <li> This lite one is not a favorite of mine.  </li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t use leave in conditioners.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or like it has excessive product in it.  </li>
            <li> &amp;#34;My hair feels like a human&#x27;s again!&amp;#34; I exclaimed to my very confused husband.</li>
            <li> but I have thin hair and it weighs it down.  </li>
            <li> The roller take down was a breeze because I didn&#x27;t have broken hair in the sink.  </li>
            <li> The smell of this product is SO strong that until my hair dries I am miserable because of my allergies.</li>
            <li> It is very hard to find a product that untangles my hair without weighing it down or making it look too greasy, but this stuff does the trick!  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve always had a hard time finding a product that defined my waves and curls but also gave me movement and volume.  </li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m not going to say there&#x27;s NO friz, but not enough to make me unhappy.  </li>
            <li> too thick for thinning hair</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair</li>
            <li> I recommend this product for thin, limp hair.</li>
            <li> it left a weird, nasty build up/film on my hair, did not condition, did not improve my hair and did not help much even with detangling.</li>
            <li> it left my hair in bad shape.</li>
            <li> It gets really bad after I use a flat iron.</li>
            <li> I have been using this with the volumizing sulfate-free shampoo and am NOT happy with the results.  </li>
            <li> have thick, natual curl in my hair , i have a difficult time straighteren it ,but with product&lt;br</li>
            <li> it really helped to work out those nasty tangles.</li>
            <li> I have crazy frizzy curly thick hair and this conditioner detangles and tames the beast 😀</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of it being the legitimate brand, but it indeed is.</li>
            <li> Still so expensive.</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair which is thinning at the scalp also, and this helps to give it body &amp; bounce.</li>
            <li> I still can notice my hair looks dirty sooner when I use</li>
            <li> texture so that it tangles badly.  </li>
            <li> My hair used to get bad rat&#x27;s nests all the time that were a pain to brush out.</li>
            <li> I have really, really bad allergies and scented stuff</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Crazy!</li>
            <li> I give this product 2 stars because I am totally disappointed with it.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair frizzy and nasty if I put it in while its damp.</li>
            <li> bothers my allergies terribly</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this stuff! Prefer the lite because the regular version leaves my hair a little greasy. It&#x27;s just too heavy. This is perfect. Smooths my hair out and keeps it shiny but not greasy.</li>
            <li> This product works great for tangles.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  Spray on after getting out of shower and it makes combing much easier.  It smells great too.  Will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I have long hair that is always tangled, even after I use lots of conditioner in the shower. A few sprays of this and I can run a comb through my hair! And it smells really good too. I tried the regular version and it did the same thing, but it weighed my hair down and made it look dirty by the end of the day. The lite version fixes that problem and I am in love with it!</li>
            <li> I tried the original and didn&#x27;t really care for it (felt sort of sticky on my hair). I&#x27;m glad I took a chance and tried the light version because it really does work!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.  I have very fine straight hair that is prone to oiliness.  Many products are just too heavy for my hair and weigh it down.  This product actually works with my hair!  It&#x27;s all I use after I wash and towel dry, spray lightly around entire head, comb through and blow dry.  It tames my fly-aways and gives it a nice soft texture, without making it heavy.  One of the best things about it though is that it makes combing through my hair way easy!!!  Due to my hair type, it gets very tangly and knotty after washing, even after using conditioner.  This product makes combing my wet hair easy.  Love this product!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! Love the way my hair feels when I use it!</li>
            <li> While it says Lite is still is a bit heavy for very fine hair. I recommend no more that two (2) quick sprays.</li>
            <li> love this stuff! i have very thin flat hair and this definately helps add some volume when used with the blow dry volumizer!</li>
            <li> I liked the original, but it really was too heavy for my super fine hair. The &amp;#34;lite&amp;#34; works great without weighing down my hair, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about putting on too much like I did with the original. I think that for once I&#x27;ve found a product that really does all (10 things) that it claims. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Works for me.  I have fine, thin hair and the original &amp;#34;leave in&amp;#34; formula made my hair super greasy on day 2.  Was happy to see this &amp;#34;lite&amp;#34; option and so far I have had no complaints!</li>
            <li> this stuff works great. i recently had a terrible experience with hair dye, ending with bleach and many processes to get it back to normal again. it left my hair in bad shape. now i&#x27;m working on getting it healthy again, and this stuff is def helping. i use it every time i wash my hair (2-3 times a week), and if my ends are feeling extra crispy, i use some on them when my hair is dry. i like the lite formula better than the regular since my hair has a fine texture and can be weighed down easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a little goes a long way - my hair is a little past my shoulders and i spray 4 pumps into my hands then run then through my hair.</li>
            <li> Product works perfect in my hair....The lite is what I need due to my hair being so thin and fine</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the regular formula for several months and I love how shiny and soft it makes my hair but I have thin hair and it weighs it down.  I got the LITE formula to see if that was better and it is lighter; however it does nothing for frizz or shine.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and still controls the tanlges which is nice but I think I&#x27;ll go back to the original.  The frizz makes it not worth the lighter weight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried most of the Its a 10 Miracle leave in and I like the Lite the best.  Doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine hair down.</li>
            <li> This works really well, and the price is great</li>
            <li> I have been using the original It&#x27;s a 10 product for years.  My stylist suggested I try the new Lite version because my hair is very fine.  Same great features as the standard product (which I LOVE) but better and lighter.  Works great with a flat iron - and makes me hair so much easier to comb wet.  I am happy with the Lite version and just ordered my second bottle.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> This is the best detangler ever, and I have used quite a few of them due to babyfine hair.  Buy it!</li>
            <li> Nice and light.  I have fine, wavy color treated hair and am having some breakage and dryness since highlighting. Still  experimenting with amount to use, but doesn&#x27;t seem to weigh hair down or make it feel greasy.  Shipped and received quickly.  This product was much more expensive in stores.  Very happy with this price!</li>
            <li> Smells great but didn&#x27;t condition hair very well.  Look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Not for me...my hair looks exactly the same and I had to use half the bottle for it to even seem as if I put a product that helped any flyaways stay down.</li>
            <li> too thick for thinning hair</li>
            <li> This product works well with my finely textured hair because it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.  I have been using it for over three years and have not plans to stop.</li>
            <li> This is just good stuff. I have very thin hair which is thinning at the scalp also, and this helps to give it body &amp; bounce. I love that it also has thermal protection. It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down like the original formula does. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I really like this leave in conditioner, and I have tried many of them.  I have dry frizzy naturally wavy hair that is color processed and very fine texture so that it tangles badly.  This really does detangle it easily and that reduces breakage.  It does not leave my hair weighed down and greasy like too many of these products.  So far my hair is still dry, so I wouldn&#x27;t say it has fixed my hair problem as in made it all healthy again, but it does do the trick for after shampooing getting the hair to dry into a manageable condition, and that makes me happy.</li>
            <li> I really like this product it&#x27;s pretty amazing stuff. I bought it on a whim when it was on sale and so glad I did. I switch back and forth using this product and nexxus leave in conditioner. I also recently tried the it&#x27;s a 10 keratin but like the lite THE BEST. I have crazy frizzy curly thick hair and this conditioner detangles and tames the beast 😀 it makes my hair feel lighter and less to no frizz.</li>
            <li> I have used the regular formula and left my fine hair limp and hard to style.  My stylist recommend it. The &amp;#34;lite&amp;#34; was way better than the regular but I still had slight limpness.</li>
            <li> Perfect to add a little softness after using the Its A 10 Miracle Volumizing Shampoo. It does not weigh hair down at all.</li>
            <li> Great for knotty hair and smells great... It also sells for 21$ in a salon. Amazon is much cheaper!! I really recommend it. It&#x27;s very light.</li>
            <li> This is some pretty amazing hair treatment. I love it so much I bought another bottle for my daughter and grand daughter.</li>
            <li> Great product omgoodness detangles fast and combs through well no more snagging will be def. ordering more</li>
            <li> Nice product, but did not do as well as I expected.</li>
            <li> Originally bought this at my hair salon and needed more...it is the best leave-in detangler I have used; light, nice fragrance, non-build up.  You can use as much or as little as needed and it works wonders!</li>
            <li> Best conditioner for fine hair.  Does not make your hair feel weighted down, gunky &amp; my hair is very managable after using.</li>
            <li> My daughter has very fine but easily tangled hair. With just a coupe of squirts this does the job and smells nice too.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner. I have fine, naturally curly hair and this conditioner isn&#x27;t too heavy.  It leaves my hair soft yet not greasy.</li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the size of the bottle &amp; its price for the size. I have thin, fine hair &amp; I use the matching shampoo with this leave-in conditioner &amp; I love how my hair feels! Soft, but not at all greasy, and light, but still has volume. Not weighed down at all! My only issue is the size of the leave-in conditioner bottle. This is now my third bottle of the leave-in spray for just 1 bottle of shampoo, and I don&#x27;t think the shampoo is close to empty. For the price at $13-$20 each, that makes it a very expensive conditioner but because of how much I like what it does to my hair, I&#x27;ll probably keep using it. Wish they made a bottle more proportionely sized to the shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year now and I have seen much improvement with my hair.  It can be a little pricey but its worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, ever since my hairstylist sprayed it on my hair before blow-drying it and I fell in love with the scent and the way my hair looked and felt after she was done styling it. It&#x27;s GREAT for detangling, leaves a nice scent, and I haven&#x27;t noticed that it weighs down my hair at all. Definitely my favorite!</li>
            <li> I have thin, fine, hair that clumps up or looks oily very easily from a lot of hair products, so I have to be careful. I&#x27;m so glad I found this leave-in conditioner! I&#x27;ve sprayed it a bunch on both wet and dry hair and have had no issues. I use it as a detangler in the morning when my hair near the nape of my neck is tangled from sleeping, and it makes my ponytail look straight and sleek.</li>
            <li> My hair person 1st introduced me to this line of shampoo and leave in conditioner.  I have short hair and I just spray, brush and let dry. My hair is always silky.  Lasts a long time too,</li>
            <li> We tried this product after buying other ones that either left a greasy hair texture, or simply did not affect knots enough that we could comb them out on our young daughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular product fits the bill, though.  No matter how ratty our daughter&#x27;s hair gets from her active, boisterous lifestyle, we can count on this product to smooth out and help separate her tangled hair that still manages to stay tangled even after getting out of the shower with shampoo and conditioner.  The &amp;#34;10&amp;#34; formula seems to blend in with the hair, leaving it smelling fragrant, instead of smelling like you just sprayed it with chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is fairly small, and it goes quickly if you use it 4-7 times a week on long hair.  The formula can be sprayed onto the comb teeth, as that seems to help tease apart hair that has become tangled. We then apply short, rapid strokes to the hair while holding near the roots to avoid root pain from the comb pulling the hair with too much force.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, definitely give this a shot.</li>
            <li> I have both the it&#x27;s a ten miracle leave-in sprays. However I love this one the most.. Doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair or make it feel sticky.. I have thick wavy hair and it&#x27;s naturally dry, this stuff rocks..</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy/curly fine hair and I&#x27;ve always had a hard time finding a product that defined my waves and curls but also gave me movement and volume.  I go to a very nice salon that uses Paul Mitchell products and I liked those but felt I wasn&#x27;t completely satisfied.  I usually avoid drugstore leave-in treatments and conditioners because they have weighed my hair down in the past.  One day I picked this up from the beauty isle of the grocery store and my life was quite possibly changed.  My curls and waves are more defined and I have way more volume without frizz!  It&#x27;s so lightweight, some days when my hair is a bit more thirsty I can add more to the ends and not worry about it looking greasy.  It also works great when styling my hair, which I don&#x27;t do often but I like the idea of only needing one product for any style I choose to do that day!  I feel like it&#x27;s actually helping my hair grow too, which is awesome because I&#x27;ve been trying to grow out my hair for a long time without results but all of a sudden I see more length!  Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> This is the perfect leave in conditioner for straight, fine hair. It makes it easy to brush thru after washing and does not weigh hair down. You do not need a lot...2-3 sprays and voila! Highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> My hairdresser introduced me to It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Leave in Lite.  I had constant frizz after washing my hair. I have long, fine hair, but lots of it.  She told me to wash and condition as I usually do; towel dry and then add the leave in conditioner.  I can definitely see a difference.  I no longer have frizz.  Really! I&#x27;ve had frizz for years and could never find anything to tame it.  I&amp;#34;m curious to see how well it does in the summertime.  I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> does not do what it promises</li>
            <li> The product was actually only a 2 oz. bottle.  The seller did contact me to let me know it was a smaller bottle before they shipped it. I would buy from them again. I absolutely love this product fop heat protectant.</li>
            <li> Only used it a couple of times, but my color treated hair was starting to look a little damaged&lt;br /&gt;on the ends this has helped with its appearance and the feel over all.  I would probably buy it again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after reading the reviews and asking a question concerning my hair type. As everyone else, I have tried so many products after reading great reviews but this product delivers. So far I have used it twice and love it. It&#x27;s not heavy so it doesn&#x27;t way down my hair. My curls are great and not frizzy. I think I have found a permanent solution to my frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Great product, helps with my super dry hair, very hydrating, great price too</li>
            <li> I use this every day.  For when I wet and go or I use it to protect my hair during a blow dry.  I usually stick with only natural products but I would be hesitant to give this product up because I haven&#x27;t found anything I like as much yet.</li>
            <li> great product! very lightweight and smells so good</li>
            <li> i put this on after i take a shower. it&#x27;s somewhat a detangler. i love it and it smells so good! people stop me all the time and ask me why does my hair smell so good.</li>
            <li> I Loved. Exactly as seen in reviews. A fragrance that makes you more wonderful still.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a 10 is the 1!!  Works great and a little goes a long way.  It really does what the ads say...how unusual!!</li>
            <li> i was introduced to this by a walmart stylist.&lt;br /&gt;i just love it. i use the lite shampoo and then no conditioner but&lt;br /&gt;after i towel dry i lightly spray on and blow dry and styld.&lt;br /&gt;makes my hair fuller. shiny, swingy, bouncy, its just great.&lt;br /&gt;i might as well toss all my other products!</li>
            <li> Easy to use Leave in conditioning for your hair.  Smells great and works wonderful. Doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling oily or feeling hair held down.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews, but had to weigh in on this one. I received this in a monthly beauty box sampler, and it sat in the bathroom cabinet for a couple of months. Now that my formerly thick, wavy hair has become thin and brittle due to flat iron abuse, I had to do something. I have never really liked leave-in treatments because they weighed my hair down, but I decided to give this a try out of desperation. After one use, I was utterly amazed. My hair feels soft as silk, without being limp. It not only moves, it actually bounces! I have noticed a decrease in breakage after only a few uses, even with use of my flat iron. My hair is shinier now, and is really starting to come back around. I will continue to use this, and as far as the price, I feel like this is a bargain compared to what I have spent in the past on hair products that did not perform half as well. If you are reading this, and you have abused your hair with flat irons/heat styling, please be kind to yourself and purchase a bottle. I hope that you are as impressed as I have been.</li>
            <li> Like many of the other reviewers, I have very fine, very thin hair.  I thought it might be worth trying this product to see if it wouldn&#x27;t weigh my hair down as much as others, but if I use it all over it does tend to do this.  I&#x27;ve learned to only use it on the ends of my hair, and indeed when I visited my hairdresser for a trim she actually suggested I use this product on only the bottom two-thirds of my hair.  Still, I haven&#x27;t noticed much of an impact.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little over a month, and I wouldn&#x27;t say my hair is shinier/less frizzy/etc.  It does help detangle my hair a little and make it smell nice, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> will never do without this product.its a leave in and detangles my hair.my hair is curly and after I shower I put this product in and it is very manageable...a must have</li>
            <li> This not only eliminates tangles and frizz but does 8 other awesome things to turn my dried out, hard to tame hair into something that actually resembles a hairstyle!  Love it!</li>
            <li> Those are expensive but very good. It is well worth the high price il you want your hair to be manageable and fluffy!</li>
            <li> Hair is FRIED FRIED FRIED after over a decade of bleaching and coloring. Stylist uses the regular strength Perfect 10 at the salon, but because she recommended a deep conditioner for the shower, I didn&#x27;t want to overdo it and make my hair feel greasy at home. This is EXACTLY what I needed. After using this the first time, I couldn&#x27;t believe that my hair felt so soft! &amp;#34;My hair feels like a human&#x27;s again!&amp;#34; I exclaimed to my very confused husband.</li>
            <li> This product makes a huge difference in how my fine hair feels.  It is shinier and feels softer than ever.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Just okay. Not as powerful as the original product but okay. I did not like it for long-term use</li>
            <li> This is a good product.  I have fine hair so be careful and use a tiny bit.  A little goes a long way.  It makes your hair shiny. This cost a little more than 1/2 at the beauty supply stores.</li>
            <li> I started using de-tangler when I was a kid.  As I grew up, the products changed.  I&#x27;m 49 years old.  I&#x27;ve had short hair,  medium and very long.  It&#x27;s been red, ash blonde, light blonde, light brown and one time....green....okay...maybe twice...green.  I got this product as a sample to try.  I feel in love with it after the first use.  I have very VERY thick fine hair, but it can still be frizzy, fluffy or hat head flat.  Right now, I&#x27;m a &#x27;sun kissed&#x27; blonde and it&#x27;s medium length.  I use this everyday after I towel dry.  It leaves my hair soft, silky and shiny.  So far, I haven&#x27;t found it in stores, so I will continue to buy it online....worth it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful leave in conditioner. I&#x27;d buy it again, but I needed to use a good conditioner before this leave in is applied.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is strong but fairly nice.  I makes my hair easier to comb but it does contain something that makes my hair feel less than fresh the next day.  It&#x27;s an okay product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great and this is an amazing price for it. It works great in my hair when I need to detangle.</li>
            <li> I have finer blonde hair, and this is my least favorite of the 3 &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a Miracle&amp;#34; products I&#x27;ve tried. The original is good, but a little heavy for my hair. The blonde is perfect, but the smell is gross. Then, there&#x27;s this one- my hair just feels greasy after using this, and I use very little. They all are great at conditioning, especially when I pull my hair into a bun, but when I leave my hair down, I prefer the blonde as it&#x27;s not heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> Works even better than the original its a 10 product. The &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; product dosent weigh my hair down like the original. I have blonde very fine, soft, thin hair. If you have hair like mine I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Was recommended this product by a local beauty supply store -- for more volume for fine hair.  Loved It!!!&lt;br /&gt;Ordered it from Amazon because the price was great and free shipping when ordering two!!!</li>
            <li> Love this product! My hair is fine and prone to static. I also have a pretty oily scalp and I HAVE to wash and style daily. But I can&#x27;t use too much conditioner or product without completely weighing it down. This has truly been a miracle. Just a few spritzes and a comb through and my hair is smooth, static free &amp; also has some body after blow dry. Best styling product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> this stuff is great especially for fine hair and lets you round brush your hair w/o it looking greasy and dull</li>
            <li> Few harsh chemicals. Other product too heavy on hair, this is a spray oil mist. The smell is not too strong either, floral scent. Doesn&#x27;t really smooth, but helps control frizz.</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff but if it actually gave my hair more body instead of just not weighing it down it would be my ONE hair product..as it is I just add a volumizer and its great!</li>
            <li> AWESOME PRODUCT. First time trying this product and it exceeded my expectations. I will for sure order again! Thank you.</li>
            <li> Arrived right when it was expected.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent for ridding your hair of tangles. However, it is so good that my very fine, thin, poker straight hair becomes even more difficult to style.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe that this is a genuine product. It doesn&#x27;t smell like the original product, and doesn&#x27;t feel like it in my hair. I didn&#x27;t like this product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an ok product. It helps detangle my long hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome, gets rid of tangles fast, and smells wonderful. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Eh. I&#x27;m a little on the fence with this product. It makes my hair frizzy and nasty if I put it in while its damp. It is much better when I use it on dry hair, so I guess I won&#x27;t be getting any of those (supposedly) heat protecting capabilities. I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s the utter miracle it&#x27;s hyped up to be. I&#x27;m accomplished the same results with lesser products. Makes my hair seem a little second day in a good way, when I use it on dry hair. Maybe a little shininess too. It didn&#x27;t smell as awesome as I was hoping.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this.  I still can&#x27;t figure out why or what this product does.  I would order something cheaper.</li>
            <li> awesome for the price, i have chemically treated bleach blonde hair that is thin. this product is 17.99 at target . Its crazy how much cheaper it is on amazon. When I went to target there was only 1 bottle of this left so I assumed it was awesome stuff but didnt like that it was only 4fl oz .but I wanted to check reviews online so I did and they were great so I ordered it online and I am satisfied. It really helps to blend all the hair strands together. If you wear extensions, this stuff is great to help blend the extensions and real hair. I think it might actually be better than 12 benefits which has a lot of hype.  The 12 benefits works just as good really but it doesnt help your stands blend into each other, its more stringy but shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> amazing product!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Always a great product. Light enough for my 3 year old&#x27;s fine hair too!</li>
            <li> My hair tends to be oily - the light version is perfect for combing through just washed hair. I use this every day with no problems or flat hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine, medium length hair and a TON of it.  Since I was old enough to steal my sister&#x27;s Seventeen Magazine I have been taught to treat my hair with heat. But my hair doesn&#x27;t like heat, And still misbehaves. I&#x27;m all for the natural texture trend and haven&#x27;t blow dryed my hair in months. But I don&#x27;t wear it down because my ends stick out in strange, unusual patterns. One side flips in, the other out. It&#x27;s a mess. I used this product for the first time last night on freshly washed (well, WEN lotioned) and OHEMGEEEE.  My hair is soft &amp; shiny, and the texture is still there, but tamed.  I think I found the trick to wearing my hair down without any heat.</li>
            <li> Leave hair smooth and shiny without adding weight. First leave-in product I&#x27;ve ever been able to say that about.  Love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK, but didn&#x27;t do anything special for my fine, curly, difficult hair.  Smells nice, though.  Maybe works better for those with better hair.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It really does all 10 things it says it does. However, doesn&#x27;t control frizz 100% but there&#x27;s definitely a noticeable difference in the amount of frizz when i use this product. can&#x27;t imagine going back to having 10 bottles of products when now all I need is 1</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this! She mostly likes the way it makes her hair smell, but her hair looks better since she&#x27;s been using it.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist recommended I use this product because I straighten daily (with Paul Mitchell Neuro Smooth Flat Iron, which is awesome!). Works great to keep my hair soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Will order again.</li>
            <li> This product is outstanding! It&#x27;s easy to spray on and reduces the amount of time to blow dry hair. I have been using this product for 6 months and my hair is much healthier!</li>
            <li> I am on the fence with this product.  I love the way my hair looks when I use it, and I can see a difference in hair health, but by the end of the day it&#x27;s a greasy mess and I have to wash it again!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I attempted to spray the product into my hands and just work into my ends to help alleviate this.  I still can notice my hair looks dirty sooner when I use but it definitely keeps my ends looking great.</li>
            <li> I picked this up at a beauty store on a whim, and I could not be happier! I have thick, straight, very long hair, and it is impossible to find a product that tames frizz, cares for split ends, and doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down... until now. My hair is unbelievably soft and shiny, and it looks good even when I just let it air dry. Crazy! Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Awesome price for such an awesome product!! This is a great hair product and I got it for an awesome price and fast delivery!</li>
            <li> AWESOME PRODUCT, plus good shipping time. It leaves my hair softer, protects from heat, and does not get frizzy throughout the day!</li>
            <li> keeps your hair soft and prevents static. love this product. not too heavy if you have fine/thin hair</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I color my hair often and about twice a year drastically change it.  This product helps it stay soft and manageable all day long.  I also like the fact that it is a heat protector since I also blow dry every other day.  I do have to watch how much I apply to my roots since it will tend to get a little greasy throughout the day if I go to heavy with it.</li>
            <li> Greasy. Doesn&#x27;t work well for thin, fine hair.</li>
            <li> If you have tangly hair, this product is for you! I have long, straight and super tangly hair. This leave-in product makes hair-brushing much easier and more manageable and don&#x27;t leave greasy feeling in your hair. Very nice. The best leave-in product I have tried soo far.</li>
            <li> Removes tangles easily!</li>
            <li> I found this a tremendous bargain compared to my salon.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Liked the It&#x27;s a 10 &amp;#34;regular,&amp;#34; but it was a little heavy, so tried this.  Love it - perfect &amp;#34;weight&amp;#34; for my fine hair.  Does everything promised, except... Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t smooth out the ends without using a flat or curling iron.</li>
            <li> I like this leave in treatment. It smells nice &amp; it does not weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff I have found for mine and my daughters tangles!  Just a little spray and the brush/combs goes right thru!!  And it smells good too &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I love the lite #10 it is so great for kids with curly hair, the comb just glides tho with no tears on their hurts.</li>
            <li> It works great in all the sense that it leaves your hair soft and tangle-free but it is not LITE. It weighed down my hair, even more so than the original Its A 10 Miracle Leave In. Overall, it&#x27;s a decent product, just use a VERY tiny amount. I suggest spraying it onto your hands and rubbing it into your hair better than just simply spraying it.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!!  Hair feels great!!!</li>
            <li> The reviews I&#x27;ve read about this product were absolutely accurate.  This is very lite as a leave in conditioner, it does make your hair shine, and it removes the tangles.  This is a great hair care product!</li>
            <li> My hair needs washing more often</li>
            <li> Makes your hair really shiny.  I really like it.  I recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;It makes your hair feel really soft and smooth.  The make a heavier one if your hair is not healthy.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner-use it after washing with Its a 10 shampoo and it is light and works well on my fine hair leaving it shiny and with more volume.</li>
            <li> Too heavy for fine hair, but it does take out bad knots which fine hair can get very easily.  I just LOVE the smell!</li>
            <li> When my hairdresser introduced me to the original product, I was astonished at how great it worked with just a small amount of product - it didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down and it seemed to be a miracle.  This was one product that really lived up to its name.  However, although it didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down much, I really wanted a lighter version - and I now have it.  BTw, I&#x27;ve tried copy-cat versions that are more and less expensive but none are as good.  In fact, this has introduced me to aragon oil and I now use a lot of products with aragon oil in it.  But no other hair products with aragon oil can compete in my view.  This is a bit expensive but goes a long way and worth every cent.</li>
            <li> I never thought the original Its a 10 was heavy on my hair, but decided to try this Lite version just to see what the difference is.&lt;br /&gt;It works just as good. It smells a little different than the original, but smells great. It still repairs and detangles every bit as good as the original. It tends to be a bit cheaper in price though, so that is a huge bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a 10 really is like a miracle product and you can tell a difference in your hair after the first time you use it. I started off using the original version after my stylist recommended it to me. My hair was dry, damaged, over processed and the pH was not correct. I used it that first time and was actually amazed. I could not believe the difference it made. It was unbelievable. I used it every day for the first few days, and then skipped to every other day and then just like once or twice a week. I blow dry my hair almost everyday, so it tends to get dry. It gets really bad after I use a flat iron. Its a 10 fixes it right up and makes it all better. I buy it regularly now and only use it as needed. I don&#x27;t have to use it every day anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone and everyone. Even if you just want to add some manageability and not necessarily repair, it is excellent. It will make your hair amazing. It brought life back to my hair and made it so healthy. The texture was so greatly improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this Lite version is lower in price than the original, i&#x27;d say start with this one and see how it does. I really think it works just as good as the original - it does for me anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend the Keratin version. it left a weird, nasty build up/film on my hair, did not condition, did not improve my hair and did not help much even with detangling. I did not like it at all.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  When I started using it, my hair was dry, fuzzy, and breaking off like straw.  Now it&#x27;s longer, smoother, softer, and shinier.  I use it every day!</li>
            <li> A spray on conditioner that is not heavy and it make my hair feel so very soft, and shiny.  This conditioner does not dull my hair and my highlights seem to stand out more.</li>
            <li> I use this on my daughter&#x27;s hair (2 yrs) and i really like that its not very heavy like the regular Its a 10.&lt;br /&gt;It works just as well and better because it doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair down or make it greasy. Just use very little.</li>
            <li> I have used this religiously, much cheaper here on Amazon then in stores (even drug stores!) Does wonders for my fine hair (that is super tangly!) Will always recommend the It&#x27;s a ten products!</li>
            <li> Fantastic product for thick hair.  Detangles while leaving hair soft.  Lightweight formula won&#x27;t leave hair flat.</li>
            <li> Despite it saying lite its still weighs my hair down a lot so I use it rarely I love how soft my hair feel when I use it though.</li>
            <li> DO NOT ORDER - this item is regular not lite.</li>
            <li> This product is great. Spray after towel drying your hair and comb/pic through. It is the best detangler. It does not weigh your hair down if you have fine hair like me.</li>
            <li> Just a little bit of this goes a long way.  I use it mainly on my ends at it is very conditioning, even for a &#x27;light&#x27; conditioner.  But boy does it cut through the tangles like nothing I&#x27;ve ever tried before. Really like this and so far, very impressed with the It&#x27;s a 10 products I&#x27;ve purchased.  It&#x27;s a little on the pricier side, but after being on the hunt for &#x27;years&#x27; for decent products, it&#x27;s worth it to me.</li>
            <li> Chemical smell gives me a headache</li>
            <li> The best product I have ever used for my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of the original for quite some time but this stuff is even better. It&#x27;s light enough that one extra spray won&#x27;t put you overboard from smooth to greasy.</li>
            <li> I have normal (not greasy or dry) hair.  It is light though and most conditioners weigh it down.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of &amp;#34;defrizzing&amp;#34; products and 80% of them leave my hair really oily at the end of the day...this one doesn&#x27;t.  I just wish it was a little easier to remember to put it in after the shower.  That my own thing though :).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a swimmer and need to protect and treat my hair against and from chlorine. Applying this to your freshly shampooed and conditioned hair nicely detangles my hair allowing the comb to glide through easily. Using this leave-in conditioner makes my hair soft and very manageable. When dry my hair is soft and shiny. An added bonus is that it smells REALLY good. My husband catches a whiff of it when he walks past me and stops, turns around, and comes back to sniff again and he always smiles. He doesn&#x27;t think it smells too fruity or flowery. It has a nice fresh warm scent. Will continue to buy this as long as it is available.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF! I got the perfect 10 basic shampoo and conditioner, and the leave in for blondes. The \\&quot;It&#x27;s a 10\\&quot; for blondes definitely helps with the toning, but this stuff is magic on making my hair soft! I also started using the \\&quot;its a 10 keratin deep conditioner\\&quot; which just makes my processed blonde hair so much softer, sleeker and really does feel so much healthier! But back to this stuff... I would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair feeling silky smooth.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is the best leave in conditioner I have ever tried. I am Latina with very long, straight to wavy hair and it leaves my hair soft and detangles my hair with ease. My hair used to get bad rat&#x27;s nests all the time that were a pain to brush out. The amount of hair that would break off was amazing. But this spray has helped so much, my hair doesn&#x27;t tangle as much as it used to.&lt;br /&gt;It smells clean and it&#x27;s not heavy or greasy. It just feels like I have soft, full hair.  Most of the leave-ins i have tried would not hold curls and this doesn&#x27;t weigh down hair or my curls at all.&lt;br /&gt;****I would give it 5 stars but it does contain parabens which have been shown to cause cancer. Most hair products contain PARABENS and finding a good leave-in without parabens is very hard. So for that, I give only 4 stars instead of 5.***</li>
            <li> Just a little bit does it.  It is so easy to use and it makes my hair look and feel good.</li>
            <li> I am generally not a fan of &amp;#34;leave-in&amp;#34; conditioners due to the fact that they tend to leave an oily residue and leave my hair looking wilted about halfway through the day.  I have found the opposite to be true with Its a 10 Lite. It definitely calms down frizzies and flyaways without weighing down my hair or making it look unclean.  It is also very effective at eliminating tangles after shampooing.  A little goes a long way, so I recommend starting with just a few spritzes at first, then working up from there depending on your needs.</li>
            <li> great product ! my mom loves it, always have to buy more a nd more for her, she says is the best she have ever tried, and her hair is looking very nice</li>
            <li> My wife swears by this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Much cheaper to buy on here than in a salon or supply store. I was skeptical of it being the legitimate brand, but it indeed is. Received in a very timely manner and with no issues. Will be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and my hair was over processed and dry and this helps make it look more natural when I blow dry it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, and I saved a lot buying online versus the salon.  I will be purchasing again for sure.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by my hairstylist sister and I like it a lot!  It&#x27;s great for my type of hair and does everything as advertised.</li>
            <li> I started using the original spray years ago. This one works much better for me and does not leave my hair limp and heavy as the original product did.</li>
            <li> I give this product 2 stars because I am totally disappointed with it. I&#x27;m still waiting for my hair to react to it as it says in the bottle. I still leaves my hair frizzy and thicker than ever. i have read very good reviews about it and it was also recommended to me by my stylist, but it is nothing as described. My hair looks better without applying this spray.</li>
            <li> I have always had very straight, fine hair. As my hair turns gray it is becoming increasingly curley, which is okay. The problem is that now half my hair is straight, half is curley,and all of it is fine. After I shampoo my hair has become a tangled mass. Old fashioned conditioners help to untangle but have always been too heavy and waxy for my fine hair. A hair dresser recommended the original Miracle Leave In Product  by It&#x27;s a Ten in a dark blue bottle.  It quickly untangled wet hair but was heavy and once dry, left my hair crunchy. While browsing on Amazon I stumbled upon a lite version and quickly ordered some. It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Leave In Lite untangled my hair then left it softer and  natural. Now after 55 years with straight hair, I must learn how to style curley hair. This product will be a huge help.</li>
            <li> I have fine, curly hair that I color. This is a great leave-in conditioner because it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my fine hair. I&#x27;ve only been using this for 1 week and I&#x27;ve already noticed a difference in the health of my hair. I bought some for my daughter (who has very oily hair) because she likes to use heat (flat iron or curling wand). I actually canceled her hair cut appointment because this product repaired her hair after just 2 weeks of using it! I just gave a bottle to my mom and I&#x27;ve been recommending it to all of my friends.</li>
            <li> This is a nice, light leave in conditioner.  It will be better for the summer than the winter, but it&#x27;s still a good product and it smells great.  It leaves my hair tangle free and gives it just the right amount of conditioning.  I like that it protects against thermal styling too so I don&#x27;t have to use anything after I spray this in.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!!</li>
            <li> Love this product will use as long as I can. Great price.</li>
            <li> BEST LEAVE-IN REALLY HYDRATES MY HAIR &amp; I CAN DEFINITLEY NOTICE THE VOLUME.</li>
            <li> I keep re-ordering this product for the last 2 years! Cheaper then a drug store, works simply amazing on my dry and tangled hair!!!</li>
            <li> Bought it to add shine to my hair.  Fragrance is gentle.  Amazing since I have started using this so has my beautician!</li>
            <li> This product definitely has an appropriate name, because it has been a miracle for my fine, limp hair.  It does all the things the manufacturer claims that it does, and the lite version keeps it from weighing down my hair.  I spray it through my hair after I get out of the shower, and it detangles so well that I can run a brush through it immediately without adding further breakage to my hair.  It protects my hair from the daily stress of blow-drying, and it works wonders as heat protection against a curling or flat iron.  While other products similar to this one have made my hair to appear greasy, limp, or thin, It&#x27;s a 10 Lite has actually added enough body and bounce to my hair that I rarely even have to style my long hair anymore.  I just blow-dry and go.  It&#x27;s a 10 is available in salons, but every time I have compare prices, Amazon&#x27;s have been lower.  I could not go one day without this product!  I recommend it to all women with thin or fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using this with the volumizing sulfate-free shampoo and am NOT happy with the results.  I had a Brazilian Blowout, and this product practically reversed it and has made my hair course and dry.  Would NOT recommend.</li>
            <li> I saw this and thought I would give it a try.  I have been using the regular one and like it alot.  I tried the one with the Keratin but it weighed my fine hair down too much.  This lite one is not a favorite of mine.  It has a nice smell but I feel that it makes my hair too flyaway and a bit too firzzy.&lt;br /&gt;I will stick with the regular one as that works best for me.</li>
            <li> I like the &#x27;It&#x27;s a 10&#x27; product so I decided to try the the &#x27;lite&#x27; version. My hair is fine but lots of body. Thought maybe the regular product might be a bit heavy in summer or on vacations when I shampoo more often. I love the &#x27;lite&#x27;. It does all the same as the original but feels lighter on my hair. I trade off using both now depending on how often I need to wash my hair.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair feeling fuller without feeling stiff or sticky. I also love the way it smells. I recommend this product for thin, limp hair.</li>
            <li> I just love this product for my fine textured hair. My hair looks shiny, sleek and manageable. People have asked what am I doing differently with my hair! I use this every other day. It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> i love it best hair product yet, i will be reorderingthis GREAT,GREAT!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have thick, natual curl in my hair , i have a difficult time straighteren it ,but with product&lt;br /&gt;[am able to do it myself (without my daughter} VERY QUICK DELIVERY</li>
            <li> Great selling product that detangles your hair without leaving a heavy residue like the original it&#x27;s a ten does. My favorite of the whole line.</li>
            <li> detangles without making your hair greasy. Even my husband is using it and he doesn&#x27;t like anything that weights his hair down. Use it with the Wet Brush and save your hair.</li>
            <li> Well, I don&#x27;t know what all the rave is about this product line, but I rate it a ONE!  I bought the dark blue &amp;#34;10&amp;#34; bottle at full price and the product just weighed down my hair.  I was lucky enough to be able to return it for a full refund.  I then came across the light version at a clearance price at my local grocery store for $6.  Although it didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down as much, It did nothing for me hair.  Try ISO Bouncy Cream.  It will make your hair so soft and manageable.  Just my two &amp;#34;beauty&amp;#34; cents.</li>
            <li> I have extremely thin, fine, and damaged hair. Several months ago I permed it, then got the brilliant idea to bleach it. I totally ruined my hair by doing that. 10 months later and all the damage still hasn&#x27;t grown out and my hairdresser recommended this product and the hair mask to me.&lt;br /&gt;Just using it for 2 days I see and feel a noticeable difference in my hair. It is softer and the ends no longer look as damaged as they did before.&lt;br /&gt;It does weigh my hair down a little, but its something I&#x27;m willing to live with for hair I can actually stand to touch now.&lt;br /&gt;However, the smell... Its not a terrible smell, but it is STRONG. I have really, really bad allergies and scented stuff bothers my allergies terribly so I have to be careful of what I use. The smell of this product is SO strong that until my hair dries I am miserable because of my allergies. I could speed up this process my blow drying it, but until all the damaged areas of my hair grow out, I&#x27;m trying to avoid using my hair dryer...</li>
            <li> SO light, smells great and has improved my hair dramatically.... WAY less fly aways than I normally had...</li>
            <li> My hair is so much healthier since I started using this product.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t use leave in conditioners. My hair is oily, fine and thin and I live in a very humid area. But I have to admit, this one is so light weight and wonderful for my hair...I love it!!!</li>
            <li> I am glad I had this after using the Its A 10 Miracle Volumizing Shampoo. The shampoo left my hair feeling like straw, so I squirted some of this into my wet hair. Aaahhh...it really helped to work out those nasty tangles. I overprocess my hair with a blow dryer and now flat iron and I think this helps prevent further damage. It is a little bottle, so I don&#x27;t used a whole lot of it. But, just a few sprays go a long way.</li>
            <li> Too expensive, but my favorite for thin hair conditioning!</li>
            <li> I have very thin, oily hair that tangles easily.  It is very hard to find a product that untangles my hair without weighing it down or making it look too greasy, but this stuff does the trick!  I use two sprays and it&#x27;s easy to comb through my hair without tugging or pulling and my hair is so soft and manageable for the rest of the day.  It even gives my hair some body and bounce!  This product has now become a staple in my daily routine.  So glad to have found a lite leave in conditioner on Amazon!</li>
            <li> good for well water. treated hard water and it made my hair soft without weighing it down. i would buy again</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!!!  Works great and not tested on animals, this is a miracle in a bottle! :) :) :) : )</li>
            <li> Previously used the non-lite version of this product and loved it. Found this worked just as well and probably better for fine hair.</li>
            <li> Delived quickly and no damage.</li>
            <li> I am African American, and my hair is relaxed, fine and shoulder length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in a very dry climate and have hard water.  I struggle to combat hard water and dryness with keeping fabulous hair.  I washed and deep conditioned with other products that I&#x27;m happy with, but needed a good leave-in conditioner to deal with tangles.  I use wet roller sets to achieve my straight style, so it&#x27;s important for me to have slip for wet combing.  I&#x27;ve used this leave-in several times and will likely only use this from now on...I really like it so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to roller set quicker than usual because the combs easily slid through my strands.  The roller take down was a breeze because I didn&#x27;t have broken hair in the sink.  My hair is super shiny, bouncy and light - not weighed down at all.  At the end of the day, my hair is still soft and fluffy.  I&#x27;d pay twice the cost for these results.</li>
            <li> Too bad it is not paraben free like the it&#x27;s a 10 volumizing shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Would have loved to try this but not with Methylparaben!&lt;br /&gt;Purchased Alteran instead which is PARABEN-FREE</li>
            <li> My hairdresser had used this on my hair before she dried. Just spray a little on before drying. It helps with frizzes and just makes your hair manageable. Still need regular conditioner. Great product....</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Great for fine hair.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of the It&#x27;s a 10 products, but I was use to the original version.  I was excited to see a lite version, but honestly, this one seems to be just as greasy if accidentally overused. I think I prefer the original and I never thought I&#x27;d say that.  You can&#x27;t beat the price..... so I&#x27;ll probably keep ordering, but I cannot have more than 2 squirts and I have to keep it on my ends or my blonde hair looks greasy...</li>
            <li> If what you want is soft, puffy, frizzy hair, this is for you.  I tried using it twice for that shine it claimed to impart and my hair turned cottony, dull and without its natural wave..  I have slightly below shoulder-length hair that is naturally wavy with a tendency towards fluffiness after washing.  I use Aussie leave-in conditioner and Pureology styling lotion after washing, then Frizz-ease Secret Weapon to smooth it after drying.  I just need some shine; guess I&#x27;ll keep looking.</li>
            <li> Best product for fine hair!! The very first time I used this a friend immediately noticed and asked what I did differently! I have fine straight hair and this by far one of the best products ive ever tried! I want to send a thank you letter to whoever formulated this. After doing some research I picked this up at CVS instead of the regular formula in the smallest size possible. Still so expensive. But so worth it! And a little goes a long way so even the smallest size will probably last me a long time. about three sprits of this in my damp freshly washed hair left my hair feeling silky, soft, moisturized and even a little volumized. Not heavy at all and does exactly what it says it does!</li>
            <li> It shipped extremely quickly and it left my hair smelling and feeling amazing. I would recommend this to someone who needs a little extra moisture without the greasy, weighed down, look. I would suggest this to all girls who have long thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have super thin and fine hair and when I go to salons I&#x27;ve had the stylist use the regular It&#x27;s a 10 leave in treatment, and it has always weighed my hair down.  I&#x27;ve been searching for a light leave in conditioner because I&#x27;m over pulling through tangles, but everything seemed to make my hair dull and heavy.  This stuff is amazing.  I&#x27;ve used it every day for a week.  My hair is soft (its also color treated), has extra volume even!  It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or like it has excessive product in it.  There&#x27;s no offensive smell, I cannot stand smelly hair products.  I live in Florida and I have noticed a huge reduction in frizz and the effects of humidity on my hair.  Now I&#x27;m not going to say there&#x27;s NO friz, but not enough to make me unhappy.  I&#x27;ve had good hair days for a week, so I am certainly not complaining.</li>
            <li> I have really fine hair that gets tangled after showering and this product makes it so easy to comb through.  Because my hair is so fine it is easily weighed down by heavy products but not this one.  This stuff is so light but so effective.  I&#x27;ll definitely be repurchasing this when I run out.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!!!  in fact, I suggest the keratin shampoo, deep conditioner, and the moisture serum along with this.  I have relaxed hair that I enjoy taking care of, and this has been the LIFE of my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it does not weigh down my hair. I use it everyday and It makes my hair look awesome!</li>
            <li> Best leave in conditioner on the market at any price. Use after shampoo, or between shampoos&lt;br /&gt;for shiny, manageable hair that holds a style. Beautiful texture, no tangles or hair breakage.&lt;br /&gt;Not even alittle heavy.  It is actually just perfect.  Use anything from It &#x27;s A 10 hair products&lt;br /&gt;and you won&#x27;t believe it is your old hair.  Compliments all day, every day.&lt;br /&gt;Use especially with the matching shampoo and blow dry styling spray.  Worth every penny and great prices&lt;br /&gt;at Amazon !&lt;br /&gt;LOVE THE PRODUCT AND WILL BUY FROM NOW ON.......FOREVER !</li>
