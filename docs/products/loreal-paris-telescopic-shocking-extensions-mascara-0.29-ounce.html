            <li>liked the brush applicator and the way the mascara went on so nicely.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much to be honest.</li>
            <li>This mascara, however, delivers a nice result.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried virtually every mascara on the market, from drug-store brands to high-end, and honestly, this mascara is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Easy to remove as well!</li>
            <li>This stuff is great, but the carbon black is my favorite!!!</li>

            <li>&quot; I think my lashes look great, and the product lent itself well to easy &amp; quick application.</li>
            <li>It lengthened okay but looked sparse....</li>
            <li>Love this..</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love his mascara /</li>

            <li>I love this mascara for length.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>Was referred to this product by a lady at Walgreens....; and fell in love.  </li>
            <li>and now it&#x27;s her FAVORITE.  </li>
            <li>I will have to buy more soon.</li>
            <li>think she&#x27;s tried every drug store brand of mascara, and even a couple of Sephora and makeup counter brands, but this one is her favorite based on performance and price.</li>
            <li>If you want them to stand out make sure to do a top coat of a volumizing mascara.  </li>
            <li>I love this mascara.</li>
            <li>This mascaras okay.</li>
            <li>The lengthening power is okay</li>
            <li>I looked okay</li>
            <li>This is my favorite mascara.  </li>
            <li>My favorite mascara.</li>
            <li>Love this mascara.</li>
            <li>I love makeup.</li>
            <li>until I find something that looks &amp; applies better, that&#x27;s part of the price I pay.</li>
            <li>I believe this is my favorite mascara.</li>
            <li>But this one is my all time favorite.</li>
            <li>It lengthened well, but I wasn&#x27;t able to create any volume whatsoever.</li>
            <li>I am a huge makeup-junkie, some women love shoes, or handbags, or jewelry...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, nothing to get too excited over.</li>
            <li>clump goes on easily and separates each lash giving the appearance of longer lashes.</li>
            <li>yet it washes off easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t clump.  </li>
            <li>I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I have fine, sparse, blond lashes and this mascara</li>
            <li>I am a huge Mascara junkie and have tried almost all of them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and reallyyyy lengthens your eye lashes.</li>
            <li>Glides on smoothly.</li>
            <li>Does not go on smoothly, clumps and chunks, and basically looks awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brush really grabbed every lash and applied a nice coat of product that was even a bit \\&quot;build</li>
            <li>This works great and is very affordable, I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>This product is FAR superior to all of your Covergirl mascaras and all of the Mabelline ones I have tried as well.</li>
            <li>so I am familiar with it.</li>
            <li>It stays on all day and washes off cleanly at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wonderful long and voluminous eylashes that look quite natural beacause of the brush that doesn&#x27;t allow them to stick together while applying the mascara.</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff, but it&#x27;ll burn my eyes at some point in the day causing them to water which makes more burning &amp; people</li>
            <li>If it didn&#x27;t flake, this would be my absolute favorite mascara.</li>
            <li>So by the time you&#x27;re done, they look super clumpy and overworked.  </li>
            <li>Not difficult to remove at all!</li>
            <li>It is great for an everyday look.  </li>
            <li>I rarely wear mascara -</li>
            <li>This gives me just the right look.</li>
            <li>I very rarely buy a mascara more than once, but I&#x27;m on my 3rd tube which is really saying something for me!</li>
            <li>Which is just perfectly fine if you want natural looking lashes.</li>
            <li>I used an eyelash curler first</li>
            <li>I happen to love all of the L&#x27;Oreal mascaras, but this one is a definite fave.  </li>
            <li>Makes my lashes look fuller and really pretty.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used so many different mascaras over the years and this ranks at the very bottom.</li>
            <li>Easy to open &amp; close.</li>
            <li>Makes your lashes look good but doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>Makes my eyelashes look soooooo much longer.</li>
            <li>i can take it off very easyly.  </li>
            <li>I had lost most of my lashes as I aged.</li>
            <li>I really do like this a lot, but you must use a volumizing mascara with it.  </li>
            <li>It does make your eyelashes longer, but it flakes so much.</li>
            <li>I would have paid so much for this</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re happy with a few long, clumped lashes, you may like this product, but it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
            <li>but this product really gives them new length without the clumpiness.  </li>
            <li>And when the mascara runs dry, I wash the wand out and use it as a mascara comb to smooth out my lashes.</li>
            <li>I used the Telescopic in Carbon Black and love that one</li>
            <li>I am always especially hesitant to use the \\&quot;new\\&quot; plastic \\&quot;defining\\&quot; brushes, because so many of them basically apply virtually NO product to your lashes, but this one is different.  </li>
            <li>I love the telescopic mascara and order it all the time, but this particular mascara was dried out...</li>
            <li>It seems to go on nice, hardly any clumping, and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>The tube doesn&#x27;t get all gooky or messy either &amp; that&#x27;s my favorite part about it.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try one of the types that give you long, full lashes, but didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money.</li>
            <li>If your looking for a new mascara then pick this up.</li>
            <li>I like dramatic lashes, with good length and volume, and this product delivers.</li>
            <li>First time out of the package and the wand broke going back into the container.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and exactly as expected.</li>
            <li>It seemed that the mascara may have been really old.</li>
            <li>I let my 17 year old daughter try it</li>
            <li>First of all, the formula is very dry, even for a brand new tube.  </li>
            <li>So i mainly use only for my lower lashes.</li>
            <li>Gives me nice, thick, long lashes.</li>
            <li>When I want to make my eyes pop and have a more dramatic look, I first apply this mascara, and then apply Benefit, They&#x27;re Real as a second coat.  </li>
            <li>It will not give you thickness or a dramatic night out look, but it shows off my short lashes for a nice eye framing day/ work look.</li>
            <li>Love the thin tiny brush.</li>
            <li>However I was happily surprised at how long my lashes looked.</li>

            <li> When I want to make my eyes pop and have a more dramatic look, I first apply this mascara, and then apply Benefit, They&#x27;re Real as a second coat.  </li>
            <li> It will not give you thickness or a dramatic night out look, but it shows off my short lashes for a nice eye framing day/ work look.</li>
            <li> Love the thin tiny brush.</li>
            <li> However I was happily surprised at how long my lashes looked.</li>
            <li> From looking at the previous reviews, I had high expectations for this mascara.</li>
            <li> It has a nice thin brush that doesn&#x27;t smudge all over my upper lid like the thick brushes do.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes look long and defined now instead of clumpy and spidery.</li>
            <li> The waterproof one (blue) clumps and is a bit thicker I think, so you can&#x27;t build it up like the pink one.</li>
            <li> My lashes have never looked so long, curled, and volumized.</li>
            <li> Before, my mascara made my eyes tired and heavy but this mascara is so light that I forgot I even had any on!&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I notice i&#x27;m constantly checking for black specs on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> I prefer the non-waterproof one (pink).</li>
            <li> This should get minus stars.</li>
            <li> Not much in the tube.</li>
            <li> if there is a due date for mascara to expire, I think this one surpassed its due date.</li>
            <li> Bought it on a whim one day, and now I&#x27;ve thrown away my other mascaras.</li>
            <li> This product is so bad, I wouldn&#x27;t take it for free.</li>
            <li> Black flakes were all around my eyes and on my cheeks.  </li>
            <li> My lashes are long and thick, but not clumpy or spider-y.</li>
            <li> makes my eyelashes look so thick and long</li>
            <li> It was dry and thick in the tube.</li>
            <li> but it seriously made my lashes long and somewhat curled!</li>
            <li> think I&#x27;m really crying.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on the eyes.</li>
            <li> and I would see black specks around my eyes!</li>
            <li> I use this everyday!</li>
            <li> My lashes still don&#x27;t look that lengthened or volumptuous, just messy!  </li>
            <li> I was left with ugly clumps.</li>
            <li> When I tried to build upon my lashes by reapplying, I got a hairy, spider look that I was not happy with at all.</li>
            <li> I like Max Factor 2000 Calorie Dramatic Volume Mascara.</li>
            <li> NOT GOOD!</li>
            <li> Worst mascara ever!  </li>
            <li> Horrible!</li>
            <li> this just might be the worst mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Makes my eyelashes look soooooo much longer.</li>
            <li> I have very short eye lashes - like, you can&#x27;t even tell I have eyelashes until I put on mascara.  I have been searching for a good mascara for years - I love this Telescopic mascara.  It is great for an everyday look.  When I want to make my eyes pop and have a more dramatic look, I first apply this mascara, and then apply Benefit, They&#x27;re Real as a second coat.  The combination of the two has been working wonderfully for me.</li>
            <li> Very good mascara. it does a great job while leaving your lashes clean &amp; smooth. The tube doesn&#x27;t get all gooky or messy either &amp; that&#x27;s my favorite part about it. Easy to open &amp; close.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this mascara....it didn&#x27;t thicken like I wanted it to. It lengthened okay but looked sparse....I would have to coat my lashes over and over again and then it would flake off. I didn&#x27;t like the brush either. I would never buy this mascara again.</li>
            <li> Love this.. i cant say it enough. If your looking for a new mascara then pick this up. You wont regret it. My eyelashes look long and defined now instead of clumpy and spidery.</li>
            <li> I bought this for years and now they&#x27;ve updated the formula and it flakes into the eyes and irritates.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It works great and I have fuller, longer eyelashes. I will be buying again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for the last two years and I love it. It was great to be able to order it through amazon. Great product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, but the carbon black is my favorite!!!</li>
            <li> I love his mascara / it dosen&#x27;t clump goes on easily and separates each lash giving the appearance of longer lashes.</li>
            <li> I used this mascara, tonight. I used an eyelash curler first and then I applied the mascara, wiggling up my lashes.  This was not clumpy, have me longer lashes and was really nice looking on.  I&#x27;m glad I bought this product.</li>
            <li> this is a great product to make your lashes get separated and looking longer</li>
            <li> I use this everyday! My go to mascara</li>
            <li> It seemed that the mascara may have been really old. It was dry and thick in the tube. This is the brand that I use always so I am familiar with it. It wasn&#x27;t the same as when I purchase in the store.</li>
            <li> love the formula. my lashes are amazing!!! doesnt fall off. i can take it off very easyly.  I recommended . love it</li>
            <li> Hope they never stop making it.</li>
            <li> I had lost most of my lashes as I aged. I didn&#x27;t want big fakey lashes. This gives me just the right look. Not too big or clumpy. I am so happy with it.</li>
            <li> I happen to love all of the L&#x27;Oreal mascaras, but this one is a definite fave.  And when the mascara runs dry, I wash the wand out and use it as a mascara comb to smooth out my lashes.</li>
            <li> My go to mascara. Lengthens and separates even after multiple layers. Not difficult to remove at all!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara for length. It is great for a day look to define lashes. It will not give you thickness or a dramatic night out look, but it shows off my short lashes for a nice eye framing day/ work look.</li>
            <li> This mascara flakes. I was not a fan.</li>
            <li> Love this. I have bought it before &amp; I&#x27;m very happy with it</li>
            <li> Was referred to this product by a lady at Walgreens....; and fell in love.  Loooooong lashes and a great/unique brush.  I&#x27;m 45+ so my lashes aren&#x27;t what they used to be but this product really gives them new length without the clumpiness.  I let my 17 year old daughter try it and now it&#x27;s her FAVORITE.  She loves it too.  I will have to buy more soon.</li>
            <li> Love the thin tiny brush. It catches each lash effortlessly and separates them. Plus, I can use on the lower lashes because of the size of the brush. It is lengthening, though, and not volumizing. Which is just perfectly fine if you want natural looking lashes. I love this one! Easy to remove as well!</li>
            <li> My daughter has used this mascara for a couple of years, and I just bought a tube to put in her stocking for Christmas.  She loves the way this mascara thickens and lengthens her lashes without clumping or flaking.  The brush is perfectly shaped to coat each lash without globbing the product on.  It stays on all day and washes off cleanly at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think she&#x27;s tried every drug store brand of mascara, and even a couple of Sephora and makeup counter brands, but this one is her favorite based on performance and price.</li>
            <li> It has a nice thin brush that doesn&#x27;t smudge all over my upper lid like the thick brushes do. It does extend the lashes and stays put.</li>
            <li> I love the wand its perfect for your lower lashes and getting in the corners of your eye, it does however flake easily and I notice i&#x27;m constantly checking for black specs on my cheeks. So i mainly use only for my lower lashes.</li>
            <li> I really do like this a lot, but you must use a volumizing mascara with it.  It just lengthened my lashes.  If you want them to stand out make sure to do a top coat of a volumizing mascara.  I like Max Factor 2000 Calorie Dramatic Volume Mascara.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara. It&#x27;s light and reallyyyy lengthens your eye lashes.</li>
            <li> I love the telescopic mascara and order it all the time, but this particular mascara was dried out...if there is a due date for mascara to expire, I think this one surpassed its due date.</li>
            <li> I am a total mascara junkie and I did not like this at all!!  I used the Telescopic in Carbon Black and love that one so I figured I would try this one.  First of all, the formula is very dry, even for a brand new tube.  You have to constantly be swiping at your lashes to get product on them.  So by the time you&#x27;re done, they look super clumpy and overworked.  My lashes still don&#x27;t look that lengthened or volumptuous, just messy!  Also, you end up with a lot of mascara bits and flakes on your cheeks, etc.  Maybe I ended up with one that was defective or something, but NOT A FAN!</li>
            <li> This mascaras okay. The lengthening power is okay but there is fallout an hour or so after putting it on.</li>
            <li> Worst mascara ever!  I looked okay after I put it on but when I got home that night, I looked like a racoon.  Black flakes were all around my eyes and on my cheeks.  This product is so bad, I wouldn&#x27;t take it for free.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara.  Doesn&#x27;t run, but yet it washes off easily.</li>
            <li> My favorite mascara. Bought it on a whim one day, and now I&#x27;ve thrown away my other mascaras. I only use this one. It&#x27;s great. Glides on smoothly. Doesn&#x27;t clump. Gives me nice, thick, long lashes. I prefer the non-waterproof one (pink). The waterproof one (blue) clumps and is a bit thicker I think, so you can&#x27;t build it up like the pink one.</li>
            <li> First time out of the package and the wand broke going back into the container.  This should get minus stars.</li>
            <li> Wonderful long and voluminous eylashes that look quite natural beacause of the brush that doesn&#x27;t allow them to stick together while applying the mascara.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara. I wanted to try one of the types that give you long, full lashes, but didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money. This works great and is very affordable, I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I am a huge makeup-junkie, some women love shoes, or handbags, or jewelry...I love makeup. I&#x27;ve tried virtually every mascara on the market, from drug-store brands to high-end, and honestly, this mascara is my favorite. My lashes are long and thick, but not clumpy or spider-y. Great for layering coats to achieve your desired look. I very rarely buy a mascara more than once, but I&#x27;m on my 3rd tube which is really saying something for me!</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff, but it&#x27;ll burn my eyes at some point in the day causing them to water which makes more burning &amp; people think I&#x27;m really crying. until I find something that looks &amp; applies better, that&#x27;s part of the price I pay.</li>
            <li> I think this is a good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the brush applicator and the way the mascara went on so nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would try it again</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t clump.  Makes my lashes look fuller and really pretty.</li>
            <li> I believe this is my favorite mascara. It seems to go on nice, hardly any clumping, and lasts all day. No issues here!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, nothing to get too excited over. Makes your lashes look good but doesn&#x27;t last long. Not much in the tube.</li>
            <li> Best mascara and affordable.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It does make your eyelashes longer, but it flakes so much. If it didn&#x27;t flake, this would be my absolute favorite mascara. I&#x27;m so bummed out about it.</li>
            <li> I am a huge Mascara junkie and have tried almost all of them. But this one is my all time favorite. It does everything amazingly. My lashes have never looked so long, curled, and volumized. It lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t smudge. It is the best mascara money can buy. I would have paid so much for this but I don&#x27;t have to because its drugstore! Thank you Loreal!!!! Holy Grail Makeup Product!!!!</li>
            <li> Very Nice Mascara.... It does extend the lashes :D</li>
            <li> I actually bought this at the drugstore, but I have to write a review to try and stop others from buying it! Horrible! I don&#x27;t understand the good reviews...this just might be the worst mascara I&#x27;ve ever used.  Does not go on smoothly, clumps and chunks, and basically looks awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used so many different mascaras over the years and this ranks at the very bottom.</li>
            <li> Product was as pictured, delivered as promised.</li>
            <li> this is a wonderful product that does exactly what it is supposed to do. I will be buying it again for sure!</li>
            <li> From looking at the previous reviews, I had high expectations for this mascara. It lengthened well, but I wasn&#x27;t able to create any volume whatsoever. When I tried to build upon my lashes by reapplying, I got a hairy, spider look that I was not happy with at all. The brush didn&#x27;t separate my lashes either. I was left with ugly clumps. If you&#x27;re happy with a few long, clumped lashes, you may like this product, but it&#x27;s not for me. NOT GOOD!</li>
            <li> Crappiest mascara I ever used!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much to be honest. However I was happily surprised at how long my lashes looked. Best drug store mascara I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I rarely wear mascara - I prefer falsies or extensions. For all the time &amp; bother it is to put mascara on &amp; take it off, I find the results so disappointing compared to a nice set of well-done synthetic lashes that can wear for days or weeks.  This mascara, however, delivers a nice result. I like dramatic lashes, with good length and volume, and this product delivers. I am always especially hesitant to use the \\&quot;new\\&quot; plastic \\&quot;defining\\&quot; brushes, because so many of them basically apply virtually NO product to your lashes, but this one is different.  The brush really grabbed every lash and applied a nice coat of product that was even a bit \\&quot;build-able.\\&quot; I think my lashes look great, and the product lent itself well to easy &amp; quick application. This product is FAR superior to all of your Covergirl mascaras and all of the Mabelline ones I have tried as well.</li>
            <li> This is amazing mascara.  I have fine, sparse, blond lashes and this mascara makes my eyelashes look so thick and long you&#x27;d think I was wearing extensions.  I haven&#x27;t tried the waterproof version, but plan to with the approach of swim weather.  Excellent value.</li>
            <li> I have looking forever to find the perfect mascara! I love this! It&#x27;s a drier mascara but it seriously made my lashes long and somewhat curled! It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on the eyes. Before, my mascara made my eyes tired and heavy but this mascara is so light that I forgot I even had any on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason it doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars is because it flakes off during the day! I looked in the mirror and I would see black specks around my eyes!</li>
