            <li>/&gt;These are a great choice if using a brand name with fancy features isn&#x27;t an issue.</li>
            <li>This is a great buy.  </li>
            <li>Great iron for the price.  </li>
            <li>Bought it for my sister she loved it, I use it sometimes</li>
            <li>I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>I just love it !  </li>
            <li>These Avantek straighteners were supplied to me without cost, this is my honest and unbiased opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a happy gal with shiny straight hair!</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and is definitely a good buy for the price.</li>
            <li>and I love it too.</li>
            <li>I am really pleased with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Kind of cheap...</li>
            <li>Works much better than the CHI I had.  </li>
            <li>I received the AVANTEK straightener very quickly, and it was packaged nicely, as most Amazon packages are.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It heats up quickly, and as advertised, glides through the hair very smoothly.  </li>
            <li>I use it occasionally (1 or 2 times a month) and am happy with the results.</li>
            <li>They are well made of quality materials and don&#x27;t look as if they were cheaply manufactured</li>
            <li>My hair stayed smooth afterwards with no frizz or fly-aways.</li>
            <li>The sturdy spring hinge gives precise control.</li>
            <li>Much better results than expected and a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li>Much better results than expected and a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is a gap of around 2.5 centimetres (1 inch) between the heating plates and on-off switch which reduces the risk of accidentally touching the hot plates as the straighteners are switched off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have gotten many compliments from people who saw me after using it for the first time.  </li>
            <li>Dont heat up all too good ..and u have to keep turning it back on because it shuts off by itself</li>
            <li>As a first time reluctant user, I was happy to see that the flat iron provided optimum results even on a low heat setting.</li>
            <li>It gets hot very quickly.  </li>
            <li>found them light and easy to use, I appreciated the swivel cord so that there were no awkward twists of the flex, again not something always found on budget models.</li>
            <li>but heats up quick and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>have fine, normal hair</li>
            <li>her regular straightener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a very good price, and does the job better than much more expensive brands.</li>
            <li>Item came exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>though I will say, the design and feel of the straightener is pretty sleek.</li>
            <li>My hair is so thick and wavy that I need a straightener that gets much warmer.&lt;br /&gt;Straightener heats up fast (because it doesn&#x27;t get that warm to begin with), but the plates to pull my hair out.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately for me, this straightener isn&#x27;t any better than the Babyliss model I was using for over a year.</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron.</li>
            <li>Perfect my hair thick and long Heathly for u to use</li>
            <li>heats up fast works</li>
            <li>Works like one that costs 5 times that much.</li>
            <li>and it arrived on time thank you so much</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has state-of-the art floating plates made of tourmaline ceramic that heat up fast.</li>
            <li>like I do would have a much easier time with it,</li>
            <li>The straightener is lightweight, and the cord is a really nice cord, it feels heavy</li>
            <li>A small red light indicated that the straighteners were switched on and heating up, this light turned green when the optimum temperature was reached.</li>
            <li>highly recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>construction is solid and precise, but the overall weight is only 293 g or 10.3 oz., which is light enough to use for hours without strain.</li>
            <li>These are floating plates to adjust with ease to different hair thicknesses and give consistent contact.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are no high-tech press-button digital frills with these straighteners, but they do the job very well indeed.</li>
            <li>I only use a straightener once in a while, she uses one every day, and she said her hair is much softer than with</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that people who don&#x27;t have a thick lion mane</li>
            <li>this flat iron works really really</li>
            <li>The swivel cord features a useful little loop for hanging the straighteners, as do salon products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received a sample of this product to evaluate at little or no cost, I was under no obligation to post a review or give positive feedback.</li>
            <li>I guess I was always hesitant that it would ruin my hair since my hair is so thin &amp;  fine.  </li>

The dial goes up in 40 degree increments from 80-200 degrees, with a final setting of 220 degrees. In Fahrenheit this is 176 degrees to 427 degrees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine, normal hair so used the lower setting recommended of 120 degrees Celsius or 248 degrees Fahrenheit. A small red light indicated that the straighteners were switched on and heating up, this light turned green when the optimum temperature was reached. At 248 deg F., this was under 90 seconds, they are fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In use the super-smooth ceramic straightening plates (measuring 3.5 x 1 inches) work beautifully.

            <li> This is a great buy.  It gets hot very quickly.  I like the thermostat control and the location of the on off switch.  You can&#x27;t turn it on or off accidentally.  The price was awesome.  I&#x27;m a happy gal with shiny straight hair!</li>

            <li> This is my 2nd hair straightener purchase via Amazon. My first straightener was a Babyliss product (horrible!), so I finally had to purchase something different.&lt;br /&gt;I must have overlooked the part that stated that this iron only heats up to 220 degrees. Whoops. My hair is so thick and wavy that I need a straightener that gets much warmer.&lt;br /&gt;Straightener heats up fast (because it doesn&#x27;t get that warm to begin with), but the plates to pull my hair out.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately for me, this straightener isn&#x27;t any better than the Babyliss model I was using for over a year.

The sturdy spring hinge gives precise control. The flat power cable is 8 1/2 ft. long and resists tangling. The connector has a 120 degree angle, strain relief, an eyelet for hanging, and swivels infinitely. The plug is polarized for safety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Claybox provided a hair straightener for testing and review.</li>
