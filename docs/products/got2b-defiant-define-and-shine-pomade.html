            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for layered hair as it separates the pieces and gives it body.  </li>
            <li>This is the best price I have seen.</li>
            <li>A perfect medium hold that wont feel like you have a helmut on.</li>
            <li>This is the best hair product!</li>
            <li>it is the perfect consistency and is not sticky.</li>
            <li>I found these on Amazon.com at a discounted price and am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>, it got a flexible hold, and it smells awesome.</li>
            <li>This is the best hair product for me!</li>

            <li>So all in all, it&#x27;s great buy.</li>

            <li>Price is good and product works as it should</li>
            <li>--Good</li>
            <li>Non greasy, good hold, works for me (and I have thinning hair - greasy products make hair look thinner).</li>
            <li>Good value, too</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know what it is about it, but it&#x27;s my favorite hair product ever, and it smells like marshmallows!</li>
            <li>I use Chi leave-in conditioner spray, then my mousse, and let my hair air-dry for awhile to kind of &#x27;set&#x27; the curls, then finish it with the blow dryer.</li>
            <li>When I could no longer find got 2b playful in town any longer, I was *thrilled</li>
            <li>So far, this is the best for my hair type and length.  </li>
            <li>A great deal, economically.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s the best product I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li>but none of them was as near perfect as this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wish more stores carried it.</li>
            <li>think you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for many years and have tried many brands, and this one is definitely the best.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for years and love it.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for some years but somehow I found separated water from the cream in many of the jars.</li>
            <li>If you ever bought this in the stores, you know it&#x27;s more of a pommade/creme</li>
            <li>deflated looking - this was in combination with some hair spray over the top for hold.  </li>
            <li>I love this product...</li>
            <li>my hair stylist recommended using a pomade to thicken my hair to make it more controllable.  </li>
            <li>It does not have that waxy consistency that most pomade products have.  </li>
            <li>It works better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years and ordered it through Amazon a couple of times before.</li>
            <li>creme pomade is my favorite hair product.</li>
            <li>I get many compliments on my hair--including my stylist.</li>
            <li>I. Love.</li>
            <li>I wish I was better with words, but</li>
            <li>I like this because I like it way better then gel where it flakes up during the day.  </li>
            <li>I use got 2 b products and have always been satisfied until now.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>It is accurate when it states that it has more of a creamy texture to it.  </li>
            <li>I have used the original version for a long time and it works excellent.  </li>
            <li>easy to apply without being too sticky or glue like.  </li>
            <li>but I found if I shake it before opening it blends easily.</li>
            <li>It looks cheap and doesn&#x27;t make sense, but it&#x27;s what&#x27;s on the inside that counts, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for something to get those fly away hair down and to be able to control your hair whitout the greasy feeling, that&#x27;s the one.</li>
            <li>original version 0331823- P/N 1347866  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great on my hair, keeps it from getting frizzy and doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine hair down.</li>
            <li>If you want hair that your significant other will be happy to touch and play with (hence the name of the product), grab this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very runny, and has a strong chemical smell.</li>
            <li>It smells great (a little sweet and like vanilla), doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, and has a decent hold, but is easily reshape-able throughout the day.</li>
            <li>It will end up in the category of products that I&#x27;ll only use if there is nothing better available.</li>
            <li>Found it works best on mostly dry hair then finish finish drying or let air dry after application.</li>
            <li>The smell is also good, not like other pomade that is smell too stingy.</li>
            <li>This stuff is fairly inexpensive, but not worth it in the end.</li>
            <li>Of course you can always use another product to shape your hair then use a bit of the pomade to go over it, which usually has a very nice result.</li>
            <li>I like this pomade very much.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Amazon!</li>
            <li>When it first dries in my hair, it has a look like a lot of hair gels and holds pretty well, but</li>
            <li>and if you want more volume apply \\&quot;Dust It\\&quot; made by the same company.</li>
            <li>I apply it to dry hair everywhere, after i reaply to the top layer hair and then I fix my hair with a brush or cumb.</li>
            <li>Most pomade is really thick, this stuff is a touch passed hand cream, but just enough for some nice hold.  </li>
            <li>When I use it, I get TONS of compliments.&lt;br /&gt;Seems to work better if you just run your hands down your hair, grabbing the curls and kind of pulling down on them as you go, so you&#x27;re sort of defining them, not digging your hands into your hair messing it up.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>When I ordered this on line I saw the familiar yellow semi circle packaging.</li>
            <li>Henkle should switch back to the original</li>
            <li>Again, I haven&#x27;t noticed any real difference in performance but it makes me wonder if this is old stock or has been stored in a hot area.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY ADVISE do not purchase these from this seller.</li>
            <li>I did not complain because It becomes almost normal after remixing ( stirring)</li>
            <li>The texture feels much lighter and requires more than the store bought one I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The new version:</li>
            <li>I am a guy and when you have fine hair, finding a product that wont get your hair down, feel greasy, clump your hair is a challenge.</li>
            <li>I was pretty excited to try this after reading other reviews, but I definitely wasn&#x27;t blown away by this product.  </li>
            <li>It disappears into my hair, leaving it more moist-looking, but not wet, completely takes the frizz off, defines the curls, and then holds them in place without feeling sticky or stiff.</li>
            <li>Buy from a local Rite Aid or drug store if you can, cause the legit product is great, holds well for thick hair, and leaves a dry matte finish that isn&#x27;t shiny.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Facial hair is generally coarser than the hair on one&#x27;s head, but I still felt some hold should be evident.</li>
            <li>Opened it up and was very watery and serpated and even after mixing would not stay mixed.</li>
            <li>This product smelled really good, but left my hair feeling somewhat limp and a little greasy.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is the same product just new packaging.</li>
            <li>It will keep your hair in check, but provide that dry look without the sheen, depending on how much of the product you use.</li>
            <li>what I really like about it is that after it dries, if I fluff up my hair with my hands the spikes go away, but the hair stays up in place and has a naturally spiky look.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely a winner for me, and I just wish they would go back to using the old container.</li>
            <li>For years I used to buy this same pomade at Target, and it was far thicker, and water certainly didn&#x27;t separate out of the pomade every few days.</li>
            <li>I have always loved this product, and lately it&#x27;s been hard to find in local drugstores, etc.</li>
            <li>I also believe this particular item has been repackaged to imitation product or is some sort of sub-qulity batch.  </li>
            <li>I have fairly thin, fine hair, and</li>

            <li> I also believe this particular item has been repackaged to imitation product or is some sort of sub-qulity batch.  </li>
            <li> I have fairly thin, fine hair, and</li>
            <li> for the price, find it at my local grocery store for 3.50$ and it would last a long time.</li>
            <li> I got this to style my 3 yr old boy&#x27;s hair, but it was much to heavy and left his &amp;#34;spiky hair&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> seriously couldn&#x27;t believe all the liquid that spilled out when I first opened the product.</li>
            <li> Both packages were not near the quality of the store bought one, yet alone the smell of it as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several kinds of pommades and this is the one that holds my hair without looking shiny and wet.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick, curly and can be very frizzy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sadly, it&#x27;s very hard to find this product in stores where I live, and the only store that does carry it charges a lot for the product.  </li>
            <li> I used this product daily for years (back when it was in the clear/yellow container), but after the price doubled and then tripled, I tried a few other products for a while.</li>
            <li> It will not provide the slick back look that you can achieve with standard pomade products.  </li>
            <li> Definitely not for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I ordered these in hopes that it would save me a trip to the local CVS, and possibly a few dollars.</li>
            <li> Checked the same pomade out at a Rite Aid, and it was thick and solid as it should be.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> but last few shipments have had a odd texture.  </li>
            <li> My fiancee used to complain about the way my hair felt to her when I used other pomades and hair products, but loves to touch my hair when I use got2b&#x27;s playful creme pomade.</li>
            <li> Provides control with just a small amount on fingertips starting at root and working through to ends.</li>
            <li> First I want to say that, I really hate the new packaging.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t freak out if it&#x27;s a bit wet, after brushing your hair for not more then a minute it will dry out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my hair look wet like gel does, but it does give a little bit of a shine.</li>
            <li> Most of the pomades have a greasy, oily base, which I can&#x27;t stand.  </li>
            <li> After that, I use got2b playful creme pomade, rub it onto my hands, and rub them down the length of my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a watered down version of the store bought product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little lumpy and thicker.</li>
            <li> The product has separated a little so there is excess water</li>
            <li> It gets a little clumpy in the jar sometimes, but you just have to rub it in your hands before you work with it.</li>
            <li> different harder consistency, different bad smell, and swimming in some watery liquid.</li>
            <li> And then the liquid that continues to pour out every few days as it separates.</li>
            <li> Something is either fake or its really really old stock.</li>
            <li> this isn&#x27;t harsh on my scalp</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for quite a few years now.</li>
            <li> I read some reviews that complained about it</li>
            <li> The new version of Playful that comes in the Purple/Silver package is terrible.  </li>
            <li> To bad cause I usually luv this product.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve never used pomade so maybe my expectations are off, but this stuff is lousy for my purposes.</li>
            <li> I am afraid to use these on my hair and both are going into the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this years ago but was afraid of using it.</li>
            <li> When I don&#x27;t have it, I have bad hair days.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also not make your pillow smell bad.</li>

            <li> This product has a cream base, so it adds volume without adding an oily, greasy feel to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I opened both today and the consistency was like water with a horrible rancid smell coming from the containers.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried different pomades.  So far, this is the best for my hair type and length.  Wish more stores carried it.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick, curly and can be very frizzy. I use Chi leave-in conditioner spray, then my mousse, and let my hair air-dry for awhile to kind of &#x27;set&#x27; the curls, then finish it with the blow dryer. After that, I use got2b playful creme pomade, rub it onto my hands, and rub them down the length of my hair. It disappears into my hair, leaving it more moist-looking, but not wet, completely takes the frizz off, defines the curls, and then holds them in place without feeling sticky or stiff. It&#x27;s my &#x27;miracle&#x27; find for my hair! When I don&#x27;t have it, I have bad hair days. When I use it, I get TONS of compliments.&lt;br /&gt;Seems to work better if you just run your hands down your hair, grabbing the curls and kind of pulling down on them as you go, so you&#x27;re sort of defining them, not digging your hands into your hair messing it up.&lt;br /&gt;I think you&#x27;ll love it. I hope to never have to do without it!</li>
            <li> I used this product daily for years (back when it was in the clear/yellow container), but after the price doubled and then tripled, I tried a few other products for a while. When I decided to try it again a year later, I used it for about two weeks and noticed that my skin was breaking out around my hairline and I would get pimples on my forehead and below my sideburns. Whatever is in the product is clogging my pores. I don&#x27;t remember this from before, but I stopped using it and my skin cleared up in a matter of days. Definitely not for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 years.  I have not found any product in its category that can beat this pomade.  It smells good and does not grease your hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many years and have tried many brands, and this one is definitely the best.  It&#x27;s perfect for layered hair as it separates the pieces and gives it body.  This is the best price I have seen.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this on line I saw the familiar yellow semi circle packaging. When it arrived it was a purple container and looked totally different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is the same product just new packaging. Just threw me off.</li>
            <li> I ordered these in hopes that it would save me a trip to the local CVS, and possibly a few dollars. I had one left over which I was using up until the present while the ones I ordered sat in our drawer for about a month. I opened both today and the consistency was like water with a horrible rancid smell coming from the containers. Both packages were not near the quality of the store bought one, yet alone the smell of it as well. I am afraid to use these on my hair and both are going into the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY ADVISE do not purchase these from this seller.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years and love it.  easy to apply without being too sticky or glue like.  hair looks good.  A perfect medium hold that wont feel like you have a helmut on.</li>
            <li> Consistency was almost &#x27;curdled&#x27;, as though the cream had separated from the water in the product. Product did not have the same creamy pomade texture. It&#x27;s like a watered down version of the store bought product. Will not purchase this product from Amazon again.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair product! it is the perfect consistency and is not sticky. I play with my hair a lot so this is a big deal. Found it works best on mostly dry hair then finish finish drying or let air dry after application.</li>
            <li> It does not seem to have the same consistency/texture as when I&#x27;ve bought this product off the shelf at the store. It&#x27;s a little lumpy and thicker. I&#x27;ve been using the same product for years.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for some years but somehow I found separated water from the cream in many of the jars. I did not complain because It becomes almost normal after remixing ( stirring)</li>
            <li> Price is good and product works as it should but last few shipments have had a odd texture.  The product has separated a little so there is excess water and the product has the texture of cottage cheese (don&#x27;t know how else to explain it).  If you ever bought this in the stores, you know it&#x27;s more of a pommade/creme but that isn&#x27;t how this arrives.  Again, I haven&#x27;t noticed any real difference in performance but it makes me wonder if this is old stock or has been stored in a hot area.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find this in the store anymore, so I looked here.  It&#x27;s great on my hair, keeps it from getting frizzy and doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine hair down.</li>
            <li> A great deal, economically.</li>
            <li> I have always loved this product, and lately it&#x27;s been hard to find in local drugstores, etc. I found these on Amazon.com at a discounted price and am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I got this to style my 3 yr old boy&#x27;s hair, but it was much to heavy and left his &amp;#34;spiky hair&amp;#34; deflated looking - this was in combination with some hair spray over the top for hold.  It&#x27;s a bummer, but wouldn&#x27;t order/ use this product again.</li>
            <li> seriously great stuff for you hair. Most pomade is really thick, this stuff is a touch passed hand cream, but just enough for some nice hold.  I&amp;#34;ve shown my friends, they are all now on board.  Join us, in the Got2b movement......join us...You will learn to love it, or you will be sorry.......you will be.......you will be  - yoda</li>
            <li> Seems to work great. I read some reviews that complained about it separating - mine does this but I found if I shake it before opening it blends easily.</li>
            <li> Would not buy again from this site both containers had to throw out. Opened it up and was very watery and serpated and even after mixing would not stay mixed. Was like it item got frozen or something. To bad cause I usually luv this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product... I have fairly thin, fine hair, and my hair stylist recommended using a pomade to thicken my hair to make it more controllable.  Most of the pomades have a greasy, oily base, which I can&#x27;t stand.  This product has a cream base, so it adds volume without adding an oily, greasy feel to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, it&#x27;s very hard to find this product in stores where I live, and the only store that does carry it charges a lot for the product.  When I found out that I could get this using Amazon&#x27;s subscribe &amp; save, I jumped at the opportunity.  I now get two jars for the price I was paying for one, and have them delivered at no cost every 2 months.  Thanks, Amazon!</li>
            <li> This has been cut with water and repackaged, which is fraudulent and shameful. For years I used to buy this same pomade at Target, and it was far thicker, and water certainly didn&#x27;t separate out of the pomade every few days. Buy from a local Rite Aid or drug store if you can, cause the legit product is great, holds well for thick hair, and leaves a dry matte finish that isn&#x27;t shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I seriously couldn&#x27;t believe all the liquid that spilled out when I first opened the product. And then the liquid that continues to pour out every few days as it separates. Checked the same pomade out at a Rite Aid, and it was thick and solid as it should be.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years, so I know what to expect from it.  Don&#x27;t think this is your standard pomade.  It does not have that waxy consistency that most pomade products have.  It is accurate when it states that it has more of a creamy texture to it.  It will not provide the slick back look that you can achieve with standard pomade products.  It will keep your hair in check, but provide that dry look without the sheen, depending on how much of the product you use.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get by without this!  When I could no longer find got 2b playful in town any longer, I was *thrilled* to find it on amazon!  i hope they never ever quit making/selling this product!  It works better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried.  kudos!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. If you want hair that your significant other will be happy to touch and play with (hence the name of the product), grab this. If you are looking for something to sculpt your hair all day, you might want to look elsewhere. Of course you can always use another product to shape your hair then use a bit of the pomade to go over it, which usually has a very nice result. Also this is one of the few pomades out there that I don&#x27;t hate the smell of. So all in all, it&#x27;s great buy.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years and ordered it through Amazon a couple of times before. This last order was very different: different harder consistency, different bad smell, and swimming in some watery liquid. Definitely not something you would want to put in your hair. I had to throw all packets in my last order away.</li>
            <li> I have used the original version for a long time and it works excellent.  The new version of Playful that comes in the Purple/Silver package is terrible.  Got@2b Henkle should switch back to the original formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The original version 0331823- P/N 1347866  --Good one&lt;br /&gt;The new version: 0331824- P/N 1610008 - Not so ood one&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Henkle company&lt;br /&gt;1 800. 424-5458</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years... BUT DO NOT BUY THIS FROM AMAZON. The product is watery, flakes, and smells like trash. Something is either fake or its really really old stock. BE WARNED!</li>
            <li> First I want to say that, I really hate the new packaging. It looks cheap and doesn&#x27;t make sense, but it&#x27;s what&#x27;s on the inside that counts, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This creme pomade is my favorite hair product. It smells great (a little sweet and like vanilla), doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, and has a decent hold, but is easily reshape-able throughout the day. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair look wet like gel does, but it does give a little bit of a shine. My fiancee used to complain about the way my hair felt to her when I used other pomades and hair products, but loves to touch my hair when I use got2b&#x27;s playful creme pomade. It&#x27;s definitely a winner for me, and I just wish they would go back to using the old container.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several kinds of pommades and this is the one that holds my hair without looking shiny and wet. It gets a little clumpy in the jar sometimes, but you just have to rub it in your hands before you work with it.</li>
            <li> Non greasy, good hold, works for me (and I have thinning hair - greasy products make hair look thinner). Good value, too</li>
            <li> It used to be great stuff.  It is now grainy and awful.  They must have changed the formula?  Yuk.</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited to try this after reading other reviews, but I definitely wasn&#x27;t blown away by this product.  I am a guy with medium-length / medium thickness hair.  This product smelled really good, but left my hair feeling somewhat limp and a little greasy.  It will end up in the category of products that I&#x27;ll only use if there is nothing better available.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use this on my head as I shave it, but I did buy some at Target to use on my mustache to try and train it to the sides. I&#x27;ve never used pomade so maybe my expectations are off, but this stuff is lousy for my purposes. It&#x27;s very runny, and has a strong chemical smell. It&#x27;s ability to hold the facial hair to the sides is negligible. Facial hair is generally coarser than the hair on one&#x27;s head, but I still felt some hold should be evident. For holding your face fuzz in place, try another pomade or a mustache wax. This stuff is fairly inexpensive, but not worth it in the end.</li>
            <li> I prefer this prodcut to any salon pomade and it is VERRY affordable. Lighweight, not greasy. Provides control with just a small amount on fingertips starting at root and working through to ends. I get many compliments on my hair--including my stylist. I credit a lot of my look to this pomade.</li>
            <li> I. Love. This. Stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what it is about it, but it&#x27;s my favorite hair product ever, and it smells like marshmallows! When I have short hair I use this to spike up my hair. When it first dries in my hair, it has a look like a lot of hair gels and holds pretty well, but what I really like about it is that after it dries, if I fluff up my hair with my hands the spikes go away, but the hair stays up in place and has a naturally spiky look. I wish I was better with words, but what I&#x27;m saying is that you should give it a try. It&#x27;s cheap, it got a flexible hold, and it smells awesome.</li>
            <li> Like using this stuff, couldn&#x27;t find in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> I also believe this particular item has been repackaged to imitation product or is some sort of sub-qulity batch.  I&#x27;ve been using the product for almost a year (local store purchase) until i found this deal.  The texture feels much lighter and requires more than the store bought one I&#x27;ve used in the past. Seems like this one has added water.</li>
            <li> I like this because I like it way better then gel where it flakes up during the day.  this isn&#x27;t harsh on my scalp</li>
            <li> I use got 2 b products and have always been satisfied until now.  This product does basically nothing for my short hair except fragrance.</li>
            <li> I bought this years ago but was afraid of using it. So finally I&#x27;ve tried it and I got to say, it&#x27;s the best product I&#x27;ve used so far. I am a guy and when you have fine hair, finding a product that wont get your hair down, feel greasy, clump your hair is a challenge. I&#x27;ve tried so many expensive products (american crew, bed head...) but none of them was as near perfect as this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for something to get those fly away hair down and to be able to control your hair whitout the greasy feeling, that&#x27;s the one. I apply it to dry hair everywhere, after i reaply to the top layer hair and then I fix my hair with a brush or cumb. Don&#x27;t freak out if it&#x27;s a bit wet, after brushing your hair for not more then a minute it will dry out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This pomade is not made for holding your hair in place. It&#x27;s only to control it and if you want more volume apply \\&quot;Dust It\\&quot; made by the same company. After you&#x27;re done, you can spray a bit of hairspray to keep it in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the price, find it at my local grocery store for 3.50$ and it would last a long time. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for quite a few years now. I have frizzy hair and it works great. When I style my hair it also helps holding it. I could&#x27;nt find it at the store and I am so glad I looked here and found it!!</li>
            <li> This is the best hair product for me! I have been using it for over a year.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Hate the awkward container/cover.</li>
            <li> I like this pomade very much. It&#x27;s not sticky on my hands after I applied it on my hair. The smell is also good, not like other pomade that is smell too stingy. It&#x27;s also not make your pillow smell bad. Excellent product.</li>
