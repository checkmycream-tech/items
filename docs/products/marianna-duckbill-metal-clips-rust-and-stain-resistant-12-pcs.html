            <li>Very good buy.</li>
            <li>Nice clips, perfect size.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy with them.</li>
            <li>They hold the hair very nice.</li>
            <li>These work as advertised, they hold hair good but don&#x27;t make a crease in your hair.</li>
            <li>These are a good size and have a good grasp when in hair.</li>
            <li>but these seem to be of good quality</li>
            <li>Strong clips!!  </li>
            <li>very comfortable for all kinds of hair!</li>
            <li>These clips are very sturdy and awesome for sectioning hair, whether for curling, straightening, or whatever you need.</li>
            <li>So I ordered these because one of the companies that specializes in curly hair was selling their own clip for $6.00</li>
            <li>Thanks, great product!</li>
            <li>Love them! :)</li>
            <li>each!!!&lt;br /&gt;These work just fine to lift hair as it dries and I saved a fortune!</li>
            <li>Nice strong clips.</li>
            <li>Clip well - would work ok for clipping rollers.  </li>
            <li>Love them will be ordering more</li>
            <li>I love these clips.  </li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>I am a licensed hairdresser, and I love these metal clips.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with these clips.</li>
            <li>Goodness, I&#x27;m more than pleased.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d recommend them without hesitation :).</li>
            <li>They are the best for fine and straight hair, plus they are a real bargain.</li>
            <li>They hold my hair well and are easy to manage.</li>
            <li>These clips are easy to use and so convenient for drying and styling hair.</li>
            <li>They  are great better than I expected.</li>
            <li>Good clip, grips fine straight hair pretty well.</li>
            <li>They work great for use with my flat iron.</li>
            <li>nice clips at a decent price.</li>
            <li>Not for fashion, in my mind, but good work-horses for personal grooming.</li>
            <li>Good quality clips, however i thought they were going to be pink....</li>
            <li>These are the right size clips for my hair.</li>
            <li>I use these to hold all my hair up when curling, hot ironing or rolling my hair.</li>
            <li>Glad to finally find them here!</li>
            <li>The shipping for this product was so fast!</li>
            <li>(I have a wild mane of curly hair, that has a mind of its own, so I have respect for anything that can hold a big chunk in place</li>
            <li>These are very practical when you are curling your hair, with rollers or any time you need to keep sections of your hair in place while tending to certain areas.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li>I was trying to clip off sections of my hair to straight iron.</li>
            <li>rollers today, but these will gently hold a wave or curl  </li>
            <li>-I can even use just one of these to hold a french twist while in the shower if I place it just right, which is a marvel)!  </li>
            <li>Then lightly spray, dry and remove clip.</li>
            <li>This product will help you preserve your hair since most metal clips grips the hair so tight to the point that the roots are already pulled off.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend these to my fellow curly-haired females.</li>
            <li>They very easy to use with wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li>These sturdy little clips have a great hold on hair, but occasionally snag a hair in the hinge area despite careful placement.  </li>
            <li>Professional and work as they are supposed to.</li>
            <li>Duckbill clips seem to be outrageously priced, so I was thrilled to get a box at a good price.</li>
            <li>So strong, in fact, that you will get a strange dent in your hair from the line down them if you&#x27;re not watching what you&#x27;re doing.  </li>
            <li>which is a plus, they seem more sturdy than previous clips in the past.</li>

            <li> which is a plus, they seem more sturdy than previous clips in the past.</li>
            <li> Product performs as expected:  these clips were quite a bit smaller than I envisioned from the measurement (which apparently includes the grippy end, my mistake), but they can grip so much hair firmly, that it doesn&#x27;t matter that they are small</li>
            <li> It makes drying my thick hair much faster to use these clips and dry it in sections.</li>
            <li> Not really much else to say.</li>

            <li> My only complaint is that one of them is malformed and pulls my hair every time I use it, so that one is going in the trash.</li>
            <li> it works but now what i&#x27;m looking for my thick long hair.</li>
            <li> Perfect....not to tight.</li>
            <li> Not cheaply made either.</li>
            <li> I usually use these to pin my hair while I am braiding it.</li>
            <li> i fnd it too small.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time finding these online for the longest time.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t broken any yet</li>

            <li> Perfect....not to tight. Doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s ripping your hair out when you use it.</li>
            <li> My hair gets caught in the spring and it pulls my hair everytime I remove one.  Stopped using because it was pulling out strands of my hair.  Clip well - would work ok for clipping rollers.  I don&#x27;t think they would catch hair when used that way.  I was trying to clip off sections of my hair to straight iron.</li>
            <li> Love them will be ordering more</li>
            <li> Good quality clips, however i thought they were going to be pink....they are not.</li>
            <li> I love these clips.  Just what I was looking for to section off my hair for the curling iron.</li>
            <li> Every girl should have a set of these to help with hair styling. I use these to hold all my hair up when curling, hot ironing or rolling my hair. They are like an extra set of hands.</li>
            <li> They  are great better than I expected.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and I like it</li>
            <li> This product will help you preserve your hair since most metal clips grips the hair so tight to the point that the roots are already pulled off. very comfortable for all kinds of hair!</li>
            <li> Nice clips, perfect size.  Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> They hold the hair very nice. Highly recommended. Very good buy. They very easy to use with wet or dry hair. Love them.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for these types of clips almost all of my life and couldn&#x27;t figure for the life of me what they were called! These are very practical when you are curling your hair, with rollers or any time you need to keep sections of your hair in place while tending to certain areas.&lt;br /&gt;Does not get caught in hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging seemed damaged and worn but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time finding these online for the longest time. Glad to finally find them here! Work great! Nice strong clips.</li>
            <li> A lot cheaper than at my local beauty supply store! I usually use these to pin my hair while I am braiding it. They definitely keep the hair out of the way. I will be buying them again!</li>
            <li> Versatile clips; lightweight, but study.  Excellent for styling!  Value priced!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend these to my fellow curly-haired females. Duckbill clips seem to be outrageously priced, so I was thrilled to get a box at a good price.</li>
            <li> I used these longer hair clips back in the 50s when girls set their hair on rollers and have been wanting to find some.&lt;br /&gt;No rollers today, but these will gently hold a wave or curl  just where you want it. Then lightly spray, dry and remove clip. Voila!</li>
            <li> not has sturdy as I thought.</li>
            <li> These are the right size clips for my hair. I use them as I section it off for curling...just what I needed. Not really much else to say.</li>
            <li> These work as advertised, they hold hair good but don&#x27;t make a crease in your hair. I haven&#x27;t broken any yet which is a plus, they seem more sturdy than previous clips in the past.</li>
            <li> I use these clips all the time to clip my hair back while washing my face or deep conditioning my hair. They&#x27;re great! My only complaint is that one of them is malformed and pulls my hair every time I use it, so that one is going in the trash. Otherwise great!</li>
            <li> These clips are very sturdy and awesome for sectioning hair, whether for curling, straightening, or whatever you need. Love them! :)</li>

            <li> I am a licensed hairdresser, and I love these metal clips. They are the best for fine and straight hair, plus they are a real bargain.</li>
            <li> Good clip, grips fine straight hair pretty well.</li>
            <li> When styling your hair, this is what&#x27;s needed and even if you&#x27;re not styling oyur hair when it comes to seperation and organization, this is needed.</li>
            <li> So I ordered these because one of the companies that specializes in curly hair was selling their own clip for $6.00 each!!!&lt;br /&gt;These work just fine to lift hair as it dries and I saved a fortune!</li>

            <li> Thanks, great product!</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with these clips. They hold my hair well and are easy to manage.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and hold well.</li>

            <li> it works but now what i&#x27;m looking for my thick long hair. it keeps falling off- i fnd it too small.</li>
            <li> nice clips at a decent price. They are so hard to find at the local stores anymore.</li>
            <li> The shipping for this product was so fast! Goodness, I&#x27;m more than pleased. About the product itself I bought these clips so I could use them to hold sections of hair as I style my cosplay wigs and they do just that. I&#x27;ve never owned duckbill clips before but these seem to be of good quality and I&#x27;d recommend them without hesitation :).</li>
