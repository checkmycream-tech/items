            <li>This curling iron is amazing.</li>

            <li>If you don&#x27;t like the rotating handle you can lock it, which is a nice feature.</li>
            <li>I have shoulder length hair and was looking for something that gave me a nice curl/wave.</li>
            <li>I liked the size of the barrel</li>
            <li>This one gets very hot, has temp controls and gives a beautiful curl.  </li>
            <li>Had the best hair in high school.</li>
            <li>Hot Tools 1 1/4 Marcel Curling Iron is a great product.</li>
            <li>Bought this Hot Tools iron two years ago and it worked great, but the thermostat went out without warning this month, overheated, fried my hair.</li>
            <li>I remember just how much I love them.  </li>
            <li>I love this curling iron...</li>
            <li>Would recommend:)</li>
            <li>Love using it</li>
            <li>I love these tools, I can&#x27;t imagine not having a marcel curling iron.</li>
            <li>I love marcel irons.</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>They heat fast and has great temp for course hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was SUPER cheapy (kids toys are made better!)</li>
            <li>This size is perfect for long hair!</li>
            <li>This curler is my best friend now, saw a professional and successful hair stylist using it and bought it hoping i would get the same results...</li>
            <li>That being said, they get super hot, they work amazing!</li>
            <li>It can easily burn you if you don&#x27;t have the skills to click it and move the hair sliding through.  </li>
            <li>Great, big sexy curls, use it every day at work.</li>
            <li>I control the heat level and they are light weight with a swivel cord.</li>
            <li>IF you are comfortable with a Marcel curling iron.  </li>
            <li>Never dropped and taken great care of, then it suddenly stopped working one day.</li>
            <li>MADE CHEAP.</li>
            <li>Ordering from Amazon is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Nice adjustable heat, gets super hot if you need that</li>
            <li>Totally worth the $!  </li>
            <li>Of course, the Marcel mechanic takes some getting used to, but that&#x27;s something you had better be aware of if you&#x27;re getting this iron.</li>
            <li>I love hot tools but they break right away!</li>
            <li>It heats up super quickly and the curls with this size barrel are relaxed and easy looking.</li>
            <li>Now curls hold through a full night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
            <li>company not so quick to be helpful on the rod sticking until a review was posted.</li>
            <li>This one doesn&#x27;t have any plastic on the tip and its very very hot.</li>
            <li>Came very fast!</li>
            <li>Very fast delivery!</li>
            <li>It heats up fast and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>First of all it shipped and arrived in one day!</li>
            <li>I finally tried the 1 1/4 inch and it gave me amazing curls for my shoulder length cut.</li>
            <li>It does take some practice to use the marcel, but it is worth it.  </li>
            <li>I am still getting use to it, not as easy as normal curling handles.</li>
            <li>Also, this was my first time using the marcel handle and with practice, it is definitely worth the try.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure after a few more burns I could have gotten the hang of it, but opted to return to save my fingers</li>
            <li>at different times a Marcel is far superior in curl and ease of use (once you&#x27;re accustomed to it).  </li>
            <li>My hair does not hold curl as it is very straight, and this curling iron does a fantasic job.</li>
            <li>I have used this exact product for years ..</li>
            <li>but first time I tried using it</li>
            <li>No way to hang onto hot end??</li>
            <li>I have had these Hot Tools Marcel irons before.  </li>
            <li>I ordered another Hot Tools marcel and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  </li>
            <li>It does get extremely hot, so that is a plus.</li>
            <li>but now after some practice, I love it for personal use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the size of a QT jumbo hot dog.</li>
            <li>It gets really hot, so if you smell hair, its too hot.  </li>
            <li>Overall, extremely satisfied.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Should really work on Customer Service the first time.</li>
            <li>but this curling iron is just as good if not better.</li>
            <li>Although the barrel is too large for my hair.</li>
            <li>It is professional grade and gets very HOT.</li>
            <li>and really awkard to use.</li>
            <li>Finally reunited with this fabulous tool and my hair is so luscious looking and bouncy once again.</li>
            <li>They work so fast in my hair.  </li>
            <li>it isnt really helpful.</li>
            <li>I am a cosmetologist &amp; use this very often on my clients.</li>
            <li>I need a new iron and might try Hot Tools one more time, but I&#x27;m a little nervous to try it.</li>
            <li>the ONLY curling iron that  heats up fast &amp; hot enough to do the job for me .. plus has a nice long life  </li>
            <li>You are not supposed to rate the ease of using a Marcel, but the quality of this particular curling iron.</li>
            <li>It is a lot different to hold then a normal hinge curling iron, but it is not bad, just have to get use to it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I am an African American with shoulder length hair, and this is perfect for long lasting shiny, big curls that bounce.  </li>
            <li>Makes nice curls but the handle is hard to use.</li>
            <li>if you are not experienced with this kind of curling iron you may burn yourself, it gets HOT.</li>
            <li>but if you do not I would stick with the normal curling irons.</li>
            <li>Product was received new and worked well.</li>
            <li>Also, if you don&#x27;t know how to use a marcel, you might want to go with a regular hot tools iron with a normal flipper.</li>
            <li>I have suffered for years with regular curling irons, which don&#x27;t curl as well, aren&#x27;t as hot, and take a lot longer.  </li>
            <li>This was my first Marcel and I will be purchasing different sizes.  </li>
            <li>I assume it is because it gets hot enough.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a cosmetologist &amp; finally after 12 years my hot tools marcel iron died.  </li>
            <li>Works great but a little hard to get used to.</li>
            <li>The size of the barrel is a little big for my current hair length (just longer than shoulder length), but I think it will work very well with a couple more inches of length.</li>
            <li>I had an old curling iron Marcel style handle that lasted over 20 years.</li>
            <li>A Marcel is designed specifically for professional use with no spring.  </li>
            <li>The rotating handle is a good idea, but it is difficult to get use to.</li>
            <li>The possibilities are endless, just don&#x27;t burn yourself because it TRULY DOES GET F$&amp;@?%# hot!</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t getting hot enough so had to return it for another one and still the same problem</li>
            <li>Heats up fast and keeps the curls in all day long.</li>
            <li>As always with a Marcel you have to be careful of how hot they get and not having a covered tip.  </li>
            <li>This Curling Iron is exactly as I needed and expected.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a professional hairstylist at a busy Upper East Side Manhattan, NYC salon</li>
            <li>I plan to purchase additional Hot Tool Marcel Curling Irons in other sizes.</li>
            <li>Mine have always lasted several years, but since the last one quit i was using a regular iron, and just kept putting off buying another Hot Tools Marcel.  </li>
            <li>I have had the same Hot Tools Marcel curling iron for decades, until it finally broke (the cord connection to the iron finally gave up).  </li>
            <li>It takes a little while to get used to if you haven&#x27;t used one before but sooooo worth it.</li>
            <li>For those who marked it with a low rating</li>
            <li>I was really excited about this iron, and couldn&#x27;t have been more disappointed when I recieved</li>
            <li>I am a professional stylist, I have been using these same curling irons for ten years.  </li>
            <li>I wish the Hot Tools had lasted a little longer than two.</li>

            <li> I am an African American with shoulder length hair, and this is perfect for long lasting shiny, big curls that bounce.  </li>
            <li> Makes nice curls but the handle is hard to use.</li>
            <li> if you are not experienced with this kind of curling iron you may burn yourself, it gets HOT.</li>
            <li> but if you do not I would stick with the normal curling irons.</li>
            <li> Product was received new and worked well.</li>
            <li> Also, if you don&#x27;t know how to use a marcel, you might want to go with a regular hot tools iron with a normal flipper.</li>
            <li> I have suffered for years with regular curling irons, which don&#x27;t curl as well, aren&#x27;t as hot, and take a lot longer.  </li>
            <li> This was my first Marcel and I will be purchasing different sizes.  </li>
            <li> I assume it is because it gets hot enough.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a cosmetologist &amp; finally after 12 years my hot tools marcel iron died.  </li>
            <li> Works great but a little hard to get used to.</li>
            <li> The size of the barrel is a little big for my current hair length (just longer than shoulder length), but I think it will work very well with a couple more inches of length.</li>
            <li> I had an old curling iron Marcel style handle that lasted over 20 years.</li>
            <li> A Marcel is designed specifically for professional use with no spring.  </li>
            <li> The rotating handle is a good idea, but it is difficult to get use to.</li>
            <li> The possibilities are endless, just don&#x27;t burn yourself because it TRULY DOES GET F$&amp;@?%# hot!</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t getting hot enough so had to return it for another one and still the same problem</li>
            <li> Heats up fast and keeps the curls in all day long.</li>
            <li> As always with a Marcel you have to be careful of how hot they get and not having a covered tip.  </li>
            <li> This Curling Iron is exactly as I needed and expected.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a professional hairstylist at a busy Upper East Side Manhattan, NYC salon</li>
            <li> I plan to purchase additional Hot Tool Marcel Curling Irons in other sizes.</li>
            <li> Mine have always lasted several years, but since the last one quit i was using a regular iron, and just kept putting off buying another Hot Tools Marcel.  </li>
            <li> I have had the same Hot Tools Marcel curling iron for decades, until it finally broke (the cord connection to the iron finally gave up).  </li>
            <li> It takes a little while to get used to if you haven&#x27;t used one before but sooooo worth it.</li>
            <li> For those who marked it with a low rating</li>
            <li> I was really excited about this iron, and couldn&#x27;t have been more disappointed when I recieved</li>
            <li> I am a professional stylist, I have been using these same curling irons for ten years.  </li>
            <li> I wish the Hot Tools had lasted a little longer than two.</li>
            <li> I ordered the 1 1/4 size because I like generally wear bigger, loose curls but think I would like to have a 1/2 inch one as well for the times</li>
            <li> I have a flat iron and thought I could curl with it -</li>
            <li> I can make a title curl or loose curl with the same iron.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;To make matters worse, this is a retailer outside of Amazon, so returning it would end up costing me about us much as I paid for it (re-stocking fee, shipping, you have to contact them and wait for a return number - yet you only have 15 days to contact them, recieve the number and ship it.....</li>
            <li> , I do not need to wait that long for my hair to curl.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this size unless you have really long hair.  </li>
            <li> The long handle makes it easier to manuver.</li>
            <li> it have it touch your hair for long, so</li>
            <li> Glides through hair and you don&#x27;t have to hold the curl on the iron for long for it to stay.</li>
            <li> You can have tighter curls to loose waves and the curl lasts for so long.</li>
            <li> I went with this brand because my previous curling iron was the same brand</li>
            <li> I just wish theyade them to last a little longer.</li>
            <li> It does take a little getting used to but having used both (regular and Marcel)</li>
            <li> and I have to track down your company name and looking that way a quick response to a return request as sorry our returns are no longer accepted after 15 days</li>
            <li> The cord broke on one, and the clamp portion fell off on the other two.</li>
            <li> The marcels do not leave creases in you hair due to the rolling effect the irons have.  </li>
            <li> , it was either too tight or too loose of a curl.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time finding Marcel handels in the local area.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a little bit of a learning curve to using these</li>
            <li> but with a little practice I&#x27;ll be like a pro stylist.</li>
            <li> They never let me down!  </li>
            <li> I did burn myself a few times before I figured it out.</li>
            <li> It took her a few hours to get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I wish it came with a glove since I have burned my hand a little since the handle is hard to use.</li>
            <li> Well no more.  </li>
            <li> simply because they were not used to using a Marcel, it is an unfair rating.  </li>
            <li> but it was too late to return it by then :/</li>
            <li> they CLEARLY want to make it impossible</li>
            <li> my cousin had this curling iron and my hair is hard to curl and it stayed curled for 24 hiurs could not find it in store</li>
            <li> Hard to use.  </li>
            <li> Makes it hard to fix your hair</li>
            <li> it isnt bad, but when doing the back it is a little difficult.</li>
            <li> Then only after a bad review do you offer to assist me, I will not purchase from you again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not good at using marcel irons..</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair that never held curls before buying this iron.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately on my size 1 1/2&amp;#34; iron of the three I&#x27;ve had, three have broken within a month.</li>
            <li> Quite difficult to use unless you are using it on someone else.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a complicated curling iron to use.</li>
            <li> Sad.</li>
            <li> but sadly I had to retire it</li>
            <li> Very disappointed about the quality of the product after a few months.</li>
            <li> Seriously, 12 years!!!  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed ..</li>
            <li> Disappointed :(</li>
            <li> I hated it and won&#x27;t ever use it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Kept burning my fingers - I returned it for the type of curling iron with the plastic at the end. I&#x27;m sure after a few more burns I could have gotten the hang of it, but opted to return to save my fingers</li>
            <li> Quite difficult to use unless you are using it on someone else.</li>
            <li> Hot Tools 1 1/4 Marcel Curling Iron is a great product. I had a hard time finding Marcel handels in the local area. I like everything about these curling irons. I control the heat level and they are light weight with a swivel cord. I plan to purchase additional Hot Tool Marcel Curling Irons in other sizes. I reccomend this product!</li>
            <li> I was perfectly happy with this purchase &amp; good price!  I have used this exact product for years .. the ONLY curling iron that  heats up fast &amp; hot enough to do the job for me .. plus has a nice long life  On and on and on!  Once I found this brand I have never switched .. have used it for years .. have it in just about every size for all the different hair styles I&#x27;ve had over the years! You won&#x27;t be disappointed .. IF you are comfortable with a Marcel curling iron.  Great Product!</li>
            <li> I was really excited about this iron, and couldn&#x27;t have been more disappointed when I recieved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was SUPER cheapy (kids toys are made better!) and really awkard to use. I hated it and won&#x27;t ever use it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make matters worse, this is a retailer outside of Amazon, so returning it would end up costing me about us much as I paid for it (re-stocking fee, shipping, you have to contact them and wait for a return number - yet you only have 15 days to contact them, recieve the number and ship it.....they CLEARLY want to make it impossible so you just wont- always a sign of a company with crappy products).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just say NO!</li>
            <li> This curling iron is amazing. This is the second one I have had and I will never use another. You can have tighter curls to loose waves and the curl lasts for so long. Fair warning if you are not experienced with this kind of curling iron you may burn yourself, it gets HOT.</li>
            <li> I love hot tools but they break right away!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a little bit of a learning curve to using these but they are great quality. I now prefer them to traditional curling irons. My curls last all day!</li>
            <li> My favorite curling iron! Had the best hair in high school. Finally reunited with this fabulous tool and my hair is so luscious looking and bouncy once again.</li>
            <li> I guess I need a lesson on how to use this type of iron. It heats up good but first time I tried using it I burnt my fingers. No way to hang onto hot end??</li>
            <li> Broke only after 13 months of use. Never dropped and taken great care of, then it suddenly stopped working one day. Disappointed :(</li>
            <li> I have had these Hot Tools Marcel irons before.  Mine have always lasted several years, but since the last one quit i was using a regular iron, and just kept putting off buying another Hot Tools Marcel.  Now that i have one again - I remember just how much I love them.  They work so fast in my hair.  As always with a Marcel you have to be careful of how hot they get and not having a covered tip.  It does take some practice to use the marcel, but it is worth it.  I can make a title curl or loose curl with the same iron.  I have always purchased my Marcel Irons from my hairsytlist, and was a bit nervous to try purchasing on line.  After a month of using it, i see no difference and was very happy with the price!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. It is professional grade and gets very HOT. My hair does not hold curl as it is very straight, and this curling iron does a fantasic job. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have had the same Hot Tools Marcel curling iron for decades, until it finally broke (the cord connection to the iron finally gave up).  I have suffered for years with regular curling irons, which don&#x27;t curl as well, aren&#x27;t as hot, and take a lot longer.  Well no more.  I ordered another Hot Tools marcel and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  They just make a superior product.  It takes a little while to get used to if you haven&#x27;t used one before but sooooo worth it.</li>
            <li> Keeps hair curled longer than any others I&#x27;ve used!</li>
            <li> I am a professional stylist, I have been using these same curling irons for ten years.  They never let me down!  Nice adjustable heat, gets super hot if you need that and they last forever!</li>
            <li> provides a nice curl for medium length hair.  Definitely need to have a glove as it gets hot!&lt;br /&gt;Nice, quality product.</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron... after I learned how to use it. I did burn myself a few times before I figured it out. I found a you tube video online after my second burn. Once you do that it will be piece of cake and you will never go back.</li>
            <li> I accidently bought this item.  I didn&#x27;t realize the style of curling iron it was until I took it out of the package.  I ended up giving it to my stylist.  It&#x27;s a complicated curling iron to use.</li>
            <li> This is just so very okay, it takes a lot of getting use to. I am use to grabbing the tip of the curling iron to rotate it. This one doesn&#x27;t have any plastic on the tip and its very very hot. Out of habit I grabbed the tip and burned my fingers. The rotating handle is a good idea, but it is difficult to get use to. It does get extremely hot, so that is a plus. If you don&#x27;t like the rotating handle you can lock it, which is a nice feature.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is the best. Heats up fast and keeps the curls in all day long. I am a hair stylist and have extensions. This product keeps the curls perfect.</li>
            <li> I bought this curling iron for my girlfriend. It took her a few hours to get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a lot easier to use. When doing the front of your hair it isnt bad, but when doing the back it is a little difficult. It is a lot different to hold then a normal hinge curling iron, but it is not bad, just have to get use to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a professional hairstylist at a busy Upper East Side Manhattan, NYC salon and I love this iron!</li>
            <li> This curler is my best friend now, saw a professional and successful hair stylist using it and bought it hoping i would get the same results...sure did! Would recommend:)</li>
            <li> Makes nice curls but the handle is hard to use. I am still getting use to it, not as easy as normal curling handles. The curling iron works well, I do not need to wait that long for my hair to curl. I wish it came with a glove since I have burned my hand a little since the handle is hard to use. If you know how to use this type of handle I would definitely recommend but if you do not I would stick with the normal curling irons.</li>
            <li> Great curling iron.  This was my first Marcel and I will be purchasing different sizes.  It took a while to get used to but now after some practice, I love it for personal use.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever go back to a regular curling iron.</li>
            <li> I had an old curling iron Marcel style handle that lasted over 20 years. I didn&#x27;t think it could ever be replaced when it finally fell apart but this curling iron is just as good if not better. First of all it shipped and arrived in one day! It heats up super quickly and the curls with this size barrel are relaxed and easy looking. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase. The price was also great!</li>
            <li> my cousin had this curling iron and my hair is hard to curl and it stayed curled for 24 hiurs could not find it in store heard about Amazon ordered it from there and its great I would recommend this curling iron hairdresser use it also</li>
            <li> This size is perfect for long hair! I have very thick hair that never held curls before buying this iron. Now curls hold through a full night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
            <li> Came very fast! Love using it</li>
            <li> my favorite curling iron ever!</li>
            <li> Although the barrel is too large for my hair. I think this brand of curling irons is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company not so quick to be helpful on the rod sticking until a review was posted. Problem #1 when your return information isnt published where I am purchasing an item and I have to track down your company name and looking that way a quick response to a return request as sorry our returns are no longer accepted after 15 days, check with the manufacture it isnt really helpful. Then only after a bad review do you offer to assist me, I will not purchase from you again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should really work on Customer Service the first time.</li>
            <li> I love these tools, I can&#x27;t imagine not having a marcel curling iron. Unfortunately on my size 1 1/2&amp;#34; iron of the three I&#x27;ve had, three have broken within a month. The cord broke on one, and the clamp portion fell off on the other two. That being said, they get super hot, they work amazing! I just wish theyade them to last a little longer.</li>
            <li> I love marcel irons. Bought this Hot Tools iron two years ago and it worked great, but the thermostat went out without warning this month, overheated, fried my hair. I have a 1-inch Monsieur Charles marcel iron (don&#x27;t think they make this brand anymore) that has worked for almost twenty years. I wish the Hot Tools had lasted a little longer than two. I need a new iron and might try Hot Tools one more time, but I&#x27;m a little nervous to try it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this size unless you have really long hair.  It&#x27;s the size of a QT jumbo hot dog. It can easily burn you if you don&#x27;t have the skills to click it and move the hair sliding through.  It gets really hot, so if you smell hair, its too hot.  Love the product. 10-16-15  Very disappointed about the quality of the product after a few months. MADE CHEAP. Its falling apart. Pieces are coming off and cracking.....Sad.</li>
            <li> Perfect size curling iron for the beachy waves look. The long handle makes it easier to manuver.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length hair and was looking for something that gave me a nice curl/wave. I&#x27;ve tried a 1 inch curler and a 1 1/2 inch curler and it didn&#x27;t give me the look i wanted, it was either too tight or too loose of a curl. I finally tried the 1 1/4 inch and it gave me amazing curls for my shoulder length cut. Also, this was my first time using the marcel handle and with practice, it is definitely worth the try. I am very happy with this curler! yay!</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t even need hair spray because this tool WILL MAKE your curls stay! The possibilities are endless, just don&#x27;t burn yourself because it TRULY DOES GET F$&amp;@?%# hot!</li>
            <li> I went with this brand because my previous curling iron was the same brand and it worked wonderfully for years but sadly I had to retire it so that&#x27;s how this one comes in the picture. I liked the size of the barrel but I could not get it to curl my hair. It wasn&#x27;t getting hot enough so had to return it for another one and still the same problem but it was too late to return it by then :/</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t owned a curling iron in years.  I have a flat iron and thought I could curl with it - but it&#x27;s just too cumbersome for me.  My stylist used this iron and I loved the results.  I&#x27;m still getting used to the marcel style, but it works great.  I don&#x27;t need to straighten my hair beforehand, as this iron smooths it out and adds curls that hold.  I assume it is because it gets hot enough.  I don&#x27;t find that you need it have it touch your hair for long, so I don&#x27;t feel that it is damaging it either.</li>
            <li> Works great but a little hard to get used to. Just takes some practice</li>
            <li> Product was received new and worked well. I like the Marcel style handle. Once you become used to how to work with it, you won&#x27;t go back to the standard handle. This is the type my hairdresser uses and I love it!</li>
            <li> This is the best curling iron, if you know how to handle it.  The marcels do not leave creases in you hair due to the rolling effect the irons have.  I am an African American with shoulder length hair, and this is perfect for long lasting shiny, big curls that bounce.  If your hair is not shoulder lenght yet I would recomment the 1&amp;#34; barrel..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a cosmetologist &amp; finally after 12 years my hot tools marcel iron died.  Seriously, 12 years!!!  Totally worth the $!  Best iron ever.  Also, if you don&#x27;t know how to use a marcel, you might want to go with a regular hot tools iron with a normal flipper.</li>
            <li> Best curling iron ever</li>
            <li> Excellent curling iron!</li>
            <li> I have used a Marcel curling iron since I was a teenager (My mom was a hairstylist) and this one works great.  I like the temperature controls.  For those who marked it with a low rating simply because they were not used to using a Marcel, it is an unfair rating.  You are not supposed to rate the ease of using a Marcel, but the quality of this particular curling iron. A Marcel is designed specifically for professional use with no spring.  It does take a little getting used to but having used both (regular and Marcel) at different times a Marcel is far superior in curl and ease of use (once you&#x27;re accustomed to it).  This one gets very hot, has temp controls and gives a beautiful curl.  I think it&#x27;s a great product.  I ordered the 1 1/4 size because I like generally wear bigger, loose curls but think I would like to have a 1/2 inch one as well for the times I do want a tighter curl around my face.</li>
            <li> Great, big sexy curls, use it every day at work.</li>
            <li> This curling iron works great. Even heating, good construction. The size of the barrel is a little big for my current hair length (just longer than shoulder length), but I think it will work very well with a couple more inches of length. Of course, the Marcel mechanic takes some getting used to, but that&#x27;s something you had better be aware of if you&#x27;re getting this iron. Overall, extremely satisfied. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Product excellent, wonderful, loved! Very fast delivery!</li>
            <li> No spring to use for the handle.  Hard to use.  Makes it hard to fix your hair Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is good. It heats up fast and is easy to use. Glides through hair and you don&#x27;t have to hold the curl on the iron for long for it to stay.</li>
            <li> This Curling Iron is exactly as I needed and expected.  It was packaged perfectly and arrived in perfect condition and on time.  Rather than run around town looking for this size Curling Iron, I checked Amazon, and voi&#x27;la, there it was.  Ordering from Amazon is fantastic.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is amazing. It does take some getting used to but it creates beautiful-professional looking curls every time.</li>
            <li> Works wonderful &amp; can&#x27;t beat the price! Deff will buy from the company again! I am a cosmetologist &amp; use this very often on my clients.</li>
            <li> These curling iron are great. They heat fast and has great temp for course hair. I&#x27;m not good at using marcel irons.. but with a little practice I&#x27;ll be like a pro stylist.</li>
