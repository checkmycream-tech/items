            <li>At the end of the day, this is a good product with great results!</li>
            <li>And at first-I wasn&#x27;t very pleased!</li>
            <li>so I was a great candidate to try this product.</li>
            <li>I have been getting great compliments about my skin since, I started using it.</li>

            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>I am thrilled to discover this epilator!  </li>
            <li>and I loved it</li>
            <li>However  I am completely happy and satisfied with this .</li>
            <li>To best use this I suggest washing your face right before with warm water.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s ok to take it into the shower!  </li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>but I love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>the mirror is amazing</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to get to try this out as part of a promotion.  </li>
            <li>To be perfectly honest, this is an epilator</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s kind.</li>
            <li>it kind of hurt me, as does any emulation for me.</li>
            <li>I think it would make a nice gift for yourself or someone else.</li>
            <li>I liked the fact that you don&#x27;t have to plug anything in and it comes with a battery too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to get to try this out as part of a promotion.</li>
            <li>opinion is completely honest and not have paid me to interfere in the reality of my experience.</li>
            <li>I own a Clarisonic</li>
            <li>I was impressed with how well it seems to get the finer hairs, but also the really stubborn hairs that it takes forever to tweeze.</li>
            <li>I was extremely happy and excited to know that as a BZZagent that I would be receiving the mini epilator made by Braun.  </li>
            <li>This was where the brush to clean the epilator came in very handy.</li>
            <li>Easy to us in between the eyebrows, not painful at all and very good results…</li>
            <li>It is very easy tochange to the brush from epilator or vice versa and runs on one AA battery.  </li>
            <li>The epilator is very strong.</li>
            <li>far I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>and I love waxing</li>
            <li>Let’s be honest epilating isn’t the most comfortable feeling in the world.</li>
            <li>Plus anything that can do more than one thing (the face scrubbing attachment) is a bonus in my book.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the cleansing brush-</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely the best I&#x27;ve used, of</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed it and my skin felt softer afterwards.</li>
            <li>I did notice the thicker hairs just took a couple more seconds to grab, but that&#x27;s inconsequential compared to the time saved.    </li>
            <li>I like the Braun version better than the Mia because it spins instead of vibrates.</li>
            <li>It works great and hurts very lillte to none.</li>
            <li>I like this better than the NONO as it removes the hair much better.  </li>
            <li>This is a honest review, I have no connection with Braun nor did I receive this product free to try out.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much more convient than tweezers.</li>
            <li>READ the directions more than once before use, or you will not be pleased.</li>
            <li>I love how my face does not get irritated which this product compared to using a cream hair removing product.  </li>
            <li>If they could somehow get the machine to work under the eyebrows, then it would be a better deal.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I am highly satisfied with the results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also LOVE that I can use this in the shower,</li>
            <li>Now, I know you&#x27;re thinking if I LOVE it</li>
            <li>I love the cleansing brush.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>This product is great, and the price is very fair.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>It definitely is better than tweezing, ripping and pulling at each hair one by one.</li>
            <li>Love this one, it does everything I want it to do, love it, will be buying another one.</li>
            <li>None of them have been able to help this product keep its power.</li>
            <li>and i LOVE it it gets rid of all the un-wanted hair and the exfoliator</li>
            <li>would recommend this to my friends and family for sure</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this for the epilator for sure for my face but not for the brush a majority of the time.</li>
            <li>It is so smooth!</li>
            <li>My husband has noticed the difference and said my face has more of a \\&quot;glow\\&quot; these days.</li>
            <li>This product is great, although the price is a bit high for me.</li>
            <li>It can be used with any cleanser of your choice and leaves the face feeling very clean and exfoliated.  </li>
            <li>After every use, I was able to clean the head very easily.</li>
            <li>However this brush would be great to bring for travel as it is a nice compact size and runs on regular batteries</li>
            <li>I have light hair, so most of the hairs I would be trying to get rid of are on the thinner side.</li>
            <li>I have tried all brands of batteries from cheap knockoffs to top of the line name-brand products.</li>
            <li>Good price point, two products in one, cleans face very well, waterproof so that I can take it in the shower with</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s still a nice product I&#x27;m happy to have for the long term.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it for anyone who wants a smooth face!!!!</li>
            <li>Taking the item out of the box, I would have originally said that I was not in love with the epilator.</li>
            <li>but I wish it could clean a lot better.</li>
            <li>The epilator cleans up easily</li>
            <li>You get the face scrubber and epilator attachments, along with a mini brush to clean the epilator and a cap to store put over the top of the epilator attachments.  </li>
            <li>I still give this product 3 stars because the design is sleek and the device itself fits well in my hand and is easy to operate.</li>
            <li>The epilator cleans up easily since there is a cleaning brush included and comes with a cap for storage.</li>
            <li>up&amp;#34; and will make it easy to travel with.  </li>
            <li>It is a highly functional product for a good value.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to use super drying face soap any more.</li>
            <li>The bristles were very soft and felt good on my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an awesome little machine.</li>
            <li>I expected it to need more power, but it does great on one battery.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Honestly, it&#x27;s easier to let the epilator do the work, and much faster.  </li>
            <li>All in all this is a great product and would definitely recommend to family and friends!</li>
            <li>So I was nervous when I was sent the product as a promotional free trial.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and clean.  </li>
            <li>: This product was obtained through a Bzzz Campaign (BzzzAgent) and I got it for free in order to try it and review it.</li>
            <li>received this product for free as part of a promotion of the brand , to prove it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It worked very well on the sides of the eyebrow and on the top part of the eyebrow, but I did notice that I had to pull at my skin for the epilator to get more of the hairs</li>
            <li>The storage bag is classy and good quality, the cover cap for the epilator gives it a sleek and feminine look.</li>
            <li>This one is a great compact size and seems to be powerful enough to remove both the fine hairs on my lips and course hairs in between my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Like another reviewer, I have PCOS and was excited to receive this as a promotion.  </li>
            <li>This is totally worth it!</li>
            <li>When I started off using the epilator attachment and was excited to begin.  </li>
            <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like  this product.  </li>
            <li>that my face was clean, It was time to try the epilator.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;•comes with replacement brush and cap to keep clean when not in use&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most epilators I&#x27;ve used don&#x27;t do that and waxing certainly doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>works amazing and leaves my face feeling so soft and clean</li>
            <li>I love the epilator, it does the job so very well that I dont need to tweeze anymore on my face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really cool and saves time.</li>
            <li>The facial brush is AMAZING and so easy to use.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a great product and much cheaper than a lot of facial brushes out there.  </li>
            <li>have PCOS and probably have quite a bit more facial hair than most women.  </li>
            <li>Fine hair, such as hair along the mustache and sideburns, comes out very easily.  </li>
            <li>I was really excited to try this out as it is not only an epilator for your face, but also has a cleanser brush for your face which is amazing.</li>
            <li>First of all let me say that I did not receive this item as a free sample to test for a review.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a great item although the price is a bit high</li>
            <li>It did a pretty good job at removing the hairs and after I gave the epilator attachment the proper cleaning (which was a breeze to do)</li>
            <li>My face is very smooth after and feels soooo soft.</li>
            <li>When I used the scrubber I made sure not to apply too much pressure on it, but there is a possibility because of my sensitive skin that is prone to psorasis that it gets easily</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since the skin has to be clean before using the epilator, I decided to use the brush first.</li>
            <li>I own a regular epilator</li>
            <li>threatening that I was not afraid to use it at all.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>As a woman with more facial hair than I care to talk about, this product was fantastic.</li>
            <li>It comes with a great, soft facial cleansing brush that attaches to the handle of the epilator and cleanses thoroughly.</li>
            <li>I feel like the spinning action does a better job.</li>
            <li>SO WORTH</li>
            <li>If I had not received this item as a free promotion from the company through Buzz Agent, I would most likely not have purchased it</li>
            <li>I think it will be nice to have for in a pinch when maybe you can&#x27;t get to your esthetician for your regular wax, but I don&#x27;t see it replacing my waxing altogether.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the investment and saves you time and money at the spa.</li>
            <li>Great product,  removes facial hair effectively, the pain is so minimal and after a couple of times, it does not hurt much.  </li>
            <li>I love the cleansing brush, it gets deep in my pores and leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>would love to give this product a full 5 stars, but I think the battery-operated nature of it just doesn&#x27;t give it enough strength.</li>
            <li>I love this product and the facial brush left my skin amazing</li>
            <li>/&gt;After a couple of uses I have grown used to the sensation, and would gladly use this over other removal methods because I can do it at home within a few minutes, and it lasts a good 10 days or more.</li>
            <li>I made sure my face was cleaned as the instructions on the manual had mentioned and switched the machine on the counterclockwise position and began to work on my right side of my upper lip.  </li>
            <li>No more waxing for me - this was easy to use and effective.  </li>
            <li>It took me a few minutes to find the best positioning in order to grip all the hairs on my upper lip, but once I found the proper way to hold it, the results were much better.</li>
            <li>(I suggest washing your face as normal before using to keep clean)</li>
            <li>I normally see stores selling only one or the other so to have both in one product is a great deal!</li>
            <li>The facial brush is a plus my skin feels clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>The eplictor definitely pulled the hairs quick and easy.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money when compared to the cost of waxing and paying for a cleansing brush that is only half as good!    </li>
            <li>When I first tried the Braun Face Beauty Edition 810 epilator</li>
            <li>I was apprehensive at first.  </li>
            <li>The brush itself is really smooth and is not harsh on my skin</li>
            <li>it wasn&#x27;t completely pain free, but, it wasn&#x27;t torturous and quite bearable.</li>
            <li>I started out as the directions indicated, and used it between my browline first,</li>
            <li>It leaves a better result than some similar products I have used.  </li>
            <li>I had to get used to the pain from the first time use.</li>
            <li>I use it mostly in between my eyebrows and upper lip.</li>
            <li>I was skeptic at first.</li>
            <li>The first time I used the hair removal feature, I ended up with what looked like razor burn.</li>
            <li>;) )</li>
            <li>that makes my cleansing routine so much easier!</li>
            <li>It did hurt at first</li>
            <li>I love the way my skin feels after using the facial cleansing brush attachment...</li>
            <li>I was able to try this little beauty for free.</li>
            <li>far as the facial cleansing brush grows it is quite amazing as well.</li>
            <li>The face brush feature was small but seems to do a good job cleaning.</li>
            <li>It starts off nice and strong with a new battery, but after a short while it because significantly weaker and removes less hairs than it normally will.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>it made my skin super soft and felt like it cleansed my skin very well.  </li>
            <li>My face has a very patchy look to it most of the time, with combination dry and oily areas.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to BzzAgent</li>
            <li>Thanks Braun and thanks BuzzAgent</li>
            <li>I received the Braun face 820 model, the one with an extra refill from Bzzagent for free to try and review as part of the promotion from the brand.</li>
            <li>Also the facial cleanser is fantastic  </li>
            <li>If you are a woman who hates plucking/waxing/cremes/etc, I highly recommend this product!  </li>
            <li>It worked very well there.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s very versatile.</li>
            <li>I added some of my face wash to it w water and washed my whole face.</li>
            <li>Thanks to BzzAgent</li>
            <li>If I used the epilator as just that, the battery would have lasted much longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I feel the whole process is a lot faster.</li>
            <li>Thanks to BzzAgent</li>
            <li>My husband even commented that it really foliates the skin.</li>
            <li>addition, the facial cleanser is fantastic</li>
            <li>and you are ready to go.  </li>
            <li>Was really looking forward to trying this out.</li>
            <li>I liked that it is smaller, so it makes it easier to use around the eyebrows and upper lip.</li>
            <li>The epilator is easy for me to grip and feels comfortable in my small hands.  </li>
            <li>I feel as if I really do get a deep clean.</li>
            <li>feel as if I really do get a deep clean.</li>
            <li>With hair removal being the most unpleasant part of my &#x27;routine,&#x27; I do enjoy the cleansing brush much more.  </li>
            <li>Between uses of the epilator, I use the cleansing brush to help deep clean my pores.</li>
            <li>and I feel the deep clean</li>
            <li>My face has never left so clean after washing with it.</li>
            <li>The depilator is pretty good, a little painful to use at first, but pretty good results because hair does not grow as fast .&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>My skin is really sensitive, but I didn&#x27;t experience anything more than very minor irritation after use.</li>
            <li>The epilator is small but effective.</li>
            <li>I love the cleansing brush, it gets deep in my pores and scrubs all the day&#x27;s \\&quot;yuck\\&quot; away, but it is still gentle enough that I can use it on my child&#x27;s sticky face.  </li>
            <li>I will admit it did still hurt but not nearly as painful as I remember the larger ones being.</li>
            <li>It is small and portable, so it is easy to pull out for a quick &amp;#34;touch</li>
            <li>I would definitely give this beauty product 10 stars, except I&#x27;m only allowed to use five. :-)</li>
            <li>: Pulls even the smaller hairs, quick, cleansing brush</li>
            <li>Thank you Braun for bringing a product to the table that quickly and thoroughly helps me take care of my skin, and remove unwanted facial hair without paying an arm and a leg every two weeks at the salon.</li>
            <li>have not been able to use the epilator again since the hair is not growing back yet and despite the pain I will definitely recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>have PCOS and probably have quite a bit more facial hair such as mustache, sideburns, chin, neck, etc.</li>
            <li>My face feels extra smooth without drying and ripping at my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am extremely satisfied with this product and definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>I got a much cleaner result and my skin felt so soft.</li>
            <li>but I was using it wrong lol.</li>
            <li>The easy to use epilator caught thin, fine hairs on my mustache line and shorter, coarser hairs on my chin area.</li>
            <li>It is relevantly easy to use only have three options on the same switch; to move clockwise, counterclockwise, and the off position.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I have used the Epilator once so far and have to admit I am loving it, my hair usually grows back very fast and it has been a bit over a week and still no hairs.</li>
            <li>The brush is really soft and can be used with a facial cleanser, which I did, and after using it I could feel the difference right away, my face was fresh and deeply</li>
            <li>My friends are so surprise with my new skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have never used a facial cleansing brush before, it makes my face extra smooth</li>
            <li>so I may be too sensitive for this particular product.</li>
            <li>After a minute, my upper lip was completely smooth of all hair, including the fine hair that can be hard to get with waxing.  </li>
            <li>The facial scrubber seems to be too rough on skin that is drier or more sensitive than normal skin.  </li>
            <li>As I held my face near the mirror anticipating the hair pullage, I was so elated to see the hairs literally flying into the mirror, no effort, no pain!</li>
            <li>the brush head spins in 2 different directions, like the epilator and also vibrates and does the job pretty well</li>
            <li>The next time I used the epilator, I used the cleansing brush first.</li>
            <li>and my skin was completely clean and not red or blotchy like when I use facial scrubs.</li>
            <li>But because it&#x27;s so easy to use you can bring it out everyday to take away any of your unwanted hairs.</li>
            <li>I would love to try this with other cleansers but first I need to empty my current one.</li>
            <li>This way your skin is clean and there is less chance of breakouts.</li>
            <li>Clear skin and the tweezer part saves a lot of time.</li>
            <li>and I could not imagine having it near my face.</li>
            <li>The epilator is by far the easiest method of hair removal.  </li>
            <li>but overall I really like it.  </li>
            <li>so much why am I giving it only four stars?</li>
            <li>The simplicity of it surprised me - just put in the battery, flip the switch</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably my skin type , so it could work well in skins that are not as sensitive as mine .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But with that being said it still functions well, and I have been using it frequently (brush and epilator heads alike)</li>
            <li>you are unfamiliar with epilating as I was, you will probably be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>Braun is a very reliable brand and the product seems to be well built to last for years to come.</li>
            <li>It is small, easy to use, spins in 2 ways and does its job efficiently.</li>
            <li>Instead of just using it for a short period of time and writing a review, I decided to use it first for at least a month and then let you know more about the overall performance of the</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and provides results very similar to waxing, but without the mess.</li>
            <li>I have had several different epilators over the years, but this is the first one I&#x27;ve ever had specifically designed for the face.</li>
            <li>I am a full blown epilator convert since this little beauty came into my life.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t afford to laser it off so this little machine is the next best thing!.</li>
            <li>I would definitely and positively recommend this to all the ladies out there who want to get rid of their facial hair at home and at ease.</li>
            <li>It gets down deep leaving your pores clean.</li>
            <li>After I did the whole upper lip and lower lip, I decided to try to use it on the sides and above my eyebrow.  </li>
            <li>The brush cleans really well no problems with it although after reading other reviews I was concerned because I also have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It even grabs the fine, small hairs above the lip.</li>
            <li>My skin was also too sensitive for the facial cleansing component.</li>
            <li>This is not even a full fledged epilator, but a mini epilator only meant for a few parts of the face.  </li>
            <li>More hairs were pulled out than other epilators I have had used in the past.</li>
            <li>No need to mess with a bunch of hard to understand buttons, the way they marked the options is very clear and easy to understand.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>As someone with oily skin, I find that using the cleansing brush every other day makes my face feel so much smoother, cleaner, and softer to the touch.</li>
            <li>I compare it to getting tattooed, it kinda hurts, but it is more the built up anticipation that is worse than the actual feeling.</li>
            <li>I tried it today for the first time and this little thing blew me over.</li>
            <li>It is gentle enough on my sensitive skin to use everyday.  </li>
            <li>It took me maybe 15 min of extreme pain before finishing my upper lip but I also have to admit that the results were very satisfactory.</li>
            <li>After the first few times I used the brush, I was breaking out like</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what was my favorite feature on this little gem.  </li>
            <li>I use this usually a few days a week, and have found that my skin has less dry spots and a brighter, more polished look.  </li>
            <li>I actually ENJOY using this product, simply because it takes so much less time than using tweezers, isn&#x27;t as messy as waxing and the hair grows back smoother and softer and takes longer to grow back than hair that has been shaved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> so I was a great candidate to try this product.</li>
            <li> I have been getting great compliments about my skin since, I started using it.</li>
            <li> lol.  </li>
            <li> The scrub brush is great, too.</li>
            <li> I have been getting great compliments about my skin since I started using it.</li>
            <li> and it seems to work great.</li>
            <li> Amazing!</li>
            <li> I am thrilled to discover this epilator!  </li>
            <li> and I loved it</li>
            <li> However  I am completely happy and satisfied with this .</li>
            <li> To best use this I suggest washing your face right before with warm water.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s ok to take it into the shower!  </li>
            <li> I love this product!  </li>
            <li> but I love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> the mirror is amazing</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to get to try this out as part of a promotion.  </li>
            <li> To be perfectly honest, this is an epilator</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s kind.</li>
            <li> it kind of hurt me, as does any emulation for me.</li>
            <li> I think it would make a nice gift for yourself or someone else.</li>
            <li> I liked the fact that you don&#x27;t have to plug anything in and it comes with a battery too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to get to try this out as part of a promotion.</li>
            <li> opinion is completely honest and not have paid me to interfere in the reality of my experience.</li>
            <li> I own a Clarisonic</li>
            <li> I was impressed with how well it seems to get the finer hairs, but also the really stubborn hairs that it takes forever to tweeze.</li>
            <li> I was extremely happy and excited to know that as a BZZagent that I would be receiving the mini epilator made by Braun.  </li>
            <li> This was where the brush to clean the epilator came in very handy.</li>
            <li> Easy to us in between the eyebrows, not painful at all and very good results…</li>
            <li> It is very easy tochange to the brush from epilator or vice versa and runs on one AA battery.  </li>
            <li> The epilator is very strong.</li>
            <li> far I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> and I love waxing</li>
            <li> Let’s be honest epilating isn’t the most comfortable feeling in the world.</li>
            <li> Plus anything that can do more than one thing (the face scrubbing attachment) is a bonus in my book.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the cleansing brush-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely the best I&#x27;ve used, of</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed it and my skin felt softer afterwards.</li>
            <li> I did notice the thicker hairs just took a couple more seconds to grab, but that&#x27;s inconsequential compared to the time saved.    </li>
            <li> I like the Braun version better than the Mia because it spins instead of vibrates.</li>
            <li> It works great and hurts very lillte to none.</li>
            <li> I like this better than the NONO as it removes the hair much better.  </li>
            <li> This is a honest review, I have no connection with Braun nor did I receive this product free to try out.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much more convient than tweezers.</li>
            <li> READ the directions more than once before use, or you will not be pleased.</li>
            <li> I love how my face does not get irritated which this product compared to using a cream hair removing product.  </li>
            <li> If they could somehow get the machine to work under the eyebrows, then it would be a better deal.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I am highly satisfied with the results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also LOVE that I can use this in the shower,</li>
            <li> Now, I know you&#x27;re thinking if I LOVE it</li>
            <li> I love the cleansing brush.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> This product is great, and the price is very fair.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> It definitely is better than tweezing, ripping and pulling at each hair one by one.</li>
            <li> Love this one, it does everything I want it to do, love it, will be buying another one.</li>
            <li> None of them have been able to help this product keep its power.</li>
            <li> and i LOVE it it gets rid of all the un-wanted hair and the exfoliator</li>
            <li> would recommend this to my friends and family for sure</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this for the epilator for sure for my face but not for the brush a majority of the time.</li>
            <li> It is so smooth!</li>
            <li> My husband has noticed the difference and said my face has more of a \\&quot;glow\\&quot; these days.</li>
            <li> This product is great, although the price is a bit high for me.</li>
            <li> It can be used with any cleanser of your choice and leaves the face feeling very clean and exfoliated.  </li>
            <li> After every use, I was able to clean the head very easily.</li>
            <li> However this brush would be great to bring for travel as it is a nice compact size and runs on regular batteries</li>
            <li> I have light hair, so most of the hairs I would be trying to get rid of are on the thinner side.</li>
            <li> I have tried all brands of batteries from cheap knockoffs to top of the line name-brand products.</li>
            <li> Good price point, two products in one, cleans face very well, waterproof so that I can take it in the shower with</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s still a nice product I&#x27;m happy to have for the long term.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it for anyone who wants a smooth face!!!!</li>
            <li> Taking the item out of the box, I would have originally said that I was not in love with the epilator.</li>
            <li> but I wish it could clean a lot better.</li>
            <li> The epilator cleans up easily</li>
            <li> You get the face scrubber and epilator attachments, along with a mini brush to clean the epilator and a cap to store put over the top of the epilator attachments.  </li>
            <li> I still give this product 3 stars because the design is sleek and the device itself fits well in my hand and is easy to operate.</li>
            <li> The epilator cleans up easily since there is a cleaning brush included and comes with a cap for storage.</li>
            <li> up&amp;#34; and will make it easy to travel with.  </li>
            <li> It is a highly functional product for a good value.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to use super drying face soap any more.</li>
            <li> The bristles were very soft and felt good on my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an awesome little machine.</li>
            <li> I expected it to need more power, but it does great on one battery.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Honestly, it&#x27;s easier to let the epilator do the work, and much faster.  </li>
            <li> All in all this is a great product and would definitely recommend to family and friends!</li>
            <li> So I was nervous when I was sent the product as a promotional free trial.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and clean.  </li>
            <li> : This product was obtained through a Bzzz Campaign (BzzzAgent) and I got it for free in order to try it and review it.</li>
            <li> received this product for free as part of a promotion of the brand , to prove it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It worked very well on the sides of the eyebrow and on the top part of the eyebrow, but I did notice that I had to pull at my skin for the epilator to get more of the hairs</li>
            <li> The storage bag is classy and good quality, the cover cap for the epilator gives it a sleek and feminine look.</li>
            <li> This one is a great compact size and seems to be powerful enough to remove both the fine hairs on my lips and course hairs in between my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Like another reviewer, I have PCOS and was excited to receive this as a promotion.  </li>
            <li> This is totally worth it!</li>
            <li> When I started off using the epilator attachment and was excited to begin.  </li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like  this product.  </li>
            <li> that my face was clean, It was time to try the epilator.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;•comes with replacement brush and cap to keep clean when not in use&lt;br</li>
            <li> Most epilators I&#x27;ve used don&#x27;t do that and waxing certainly doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> works amazing and leaves my face feeling so soft and clean</li>
            <li> I love the epilator, it does the job so very well that I dont need to tweeze anymore on my face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really cool and saves time.</li>
            <li> The facial brush is AMAZING and so easy to use.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a great product and much cheaper than a lot of facial brushes out there.  </li>
            <li> have PCOS and probably have quite a bit more facial hair than most women.  </li>
            <li> Fine hair, such as hair along the mustache and sideburns, comes out very easily.  </li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this out as it is not only an epilator for your face, but also has a cleanser brush for your face which is amazing.</li>
            <li> First of all let me say that I did not receive this item as a free sample to test for a review.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a great item although the price is a bit high</li>
            <li> It did a pretty good job at removing the hairs and after I gave the epilator attachment the proper cleaning (which was a breeze to do)</li>
            <li> My face is very smooth after and feels soooo soft.</li>
            <li> When I used the scrubber I made sure not to apply too much pressure on it, but there is a possibility because of my sensitive skin that is prone to psorasis that it gets easily</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since the skin has to be clean before using the epilator, I decided to use the brush first.</li>
            <li> I own a regular epilator</li>
            <li> threatening that I was not afraid to use it at all.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> As a woman with more facial hair than I care to talk about, this product was fantastic.</li>
            <li> It comes with a great, soft facial cleansing brush that attaches to the handle of the epilator and cleanses thoroughly.</li>
            <li> I feel like the spinning action does a better job.</li>
            <li> SO WORTH</li>
            <li> If I had not received this item as a free promotion from the company through Buzz Agent, I would most likely not have purchased it</li>
            <li> I think it will be nice to have for in a pinch when maybe you can&#x27;t get to your esthetician for your regular wax, but I don&#x27;t see it replacing my waxing altogether.</li>
            <li> It is well worth the investment and saves you time and money at the spa.</li>
            <li> Great product,  removes facial hair effectively, the pain is so minimal and after a couple of times, it does not hurt much.  </li>
            <li> I love the cleansing brush, it gets deep in my pores and leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> would love to give this product a full 5 stars, but I think the battery-operated nature of it just doesn&#x27;t give it enough strength.</li>
            <li> I love this product and the facial brush left my skin amazing</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a couple of uses I have grown used to the sensation, and would gladly use this over other removal methods because I can do it at home within a few minutes, and it lasts a good 10 days or more.</li>
            <li> I made sure my face was cleaned as the instructions on the manual had mentioned and switched the machine on the counterclockwise position and began to work on my right side of my upper lip.  </li>
            <li> No more waxing for me - this was easy to use and effective.  </li>
            <li> It took me a few minutes to find the best positioning in order to grip all the hairs on my upper lip, but once I found the proper way to hold it, the results were much better.</li>
            <li> (I suggest washing your face as normal before using to keep clean)</li>
            <li> I normally see stores selling only one or the other so to have both in one product is a great deal!</li>
            <li> The facial brush is a plus my skin feels clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> The eplictor definitely pulled the hairs quick and easy.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money when compared to the cost of waxing and paying for a cleansing brush that is only half as good!    </li>
            <li> When I first tried the Braun Face Beauty Edition 810 epilator</li>
            <li> I was apprehensive at first.  </li>
            <li> The brush itself is really smooth and is not harsh on my skin</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t completely pain free, but, it wasn&#x27;t torturous and quite bearable.</li>
            <li> I started out as the directions indicated, and used it between my browline first,</li>
            <li> It leaves a better result than some similar products I have used.  </li>
            <li> I had to get used to the pain from the first time use.</li>
            <li> I use it mostly in between my eyebrows and upper lip.</li>
            <li> I was skeptic at first.</li>
            <li> The first time I used the hair removal feature, I ended up with what looked like razor burn.</li>
            <li> ;) )</li>
            <li> that makes my cleansing routine so much easier!</li>
            <li> It did hurt at first</li>
            <li> I love the way my skin feels after using the facial cleansing brush attachment...</li>
            <li> I was able to try this little beauty for free.</li>
            <li> far as the facial cleansing brush grows it is quite amazing as well.</li>
            <li> The face brush feature was small but seems to do a good job cleaning.</li>
            <li> It starts off nice and strong with a new battery, but after a short while it because significantly weaker and removes less hairs than it normally will.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> it made my skin super soft and felt like it cleansed my skin very well.  </li>
            <li> My face has a very patchy look to it most of the time, with combination dry and oily areas.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to BzzAgent</li>
            <li> Thanks Braun and thanks BuzzAgent</li>
            <li> I received the Braun face 820 model, the one with an extra refill from Bzzagent for free to try and review as part of the promotion from the brand.</li>
            <li> Also the facial cleanser is fantastic  </li>
            <li> If you are a woman who hates plucking/waxing/cremes/etc, I highly recommend this product!  </li>
            <li> It worked very well there.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s very versatile.</li>
            <li> I added some of my face wash to it w water and washed my whole face.</li>
            <li> Thanks to BzzAgent</li>
            <li> If I used the epilator as just that, the battery would have lasted much longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I feel the whole process is a lot faster.</li>
            <li> Thanks to BzzAgent</li>
            <li> My husband even commented that it really foliates the skin.</li>
            <li> addition, the facial cleanser is fantastic</li>
            <li> and you are ready to go.  </li>
            <li> Was really looking forward to trying this out.</li>
            <li> I liked that it is smaller, so it makes it easier to use around the eyebrows and upper lip.</li>
            <li> The epilator is easy for me to grip and feels comfortable in my small hands.  </li>
            <li> I feel as if I really do get a deep clean.</li>
            <li> feel as if I really do get a deep clean.</li>
            <li> With hair removal being the most unpleasant part of my &#x27;routine,&#x27; I do enjoy the cleansing brush much more.  </li>
            <li> Between uses of the epilator, I use the cleansing brush to help deep clean my pores.</li>
            <li> and I feel the deep clean</li>
            <li> My face has never left so clean after washing with it.</li>
            <li> The depilator is pretty good, a little painful to use at first, but pretty good results because hair does not grow as fast .&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> My skin is really sensitive, but I didn&#x27;t experience anything more than very minor irritation after use.</li>
            <li> The epilator is small but effective.</li>
            <li> I love the cleansing brush, it gets deep in my pores and scrubs all the day&#x27;s \\&quot;yuck\\&quot; away, but it is still gentle enough that I can use it on my child&#x27;s sticky face.  </li>
            <li> I will admit it did still hurt but not nearly as painful as I remember the larger ones being.</li>
            <li> It is small and portable, so it is easy to pull out for a quick &amp;#34;touch</li>
            <li> I would definitely give this beauty product 10 stars, except I&#x27;m only allowed to use five. :-)</li>
            <li> : Pulls even the smaller hairs, quick, cleansing brush</li>
            <li> Thank you Braun for bringing a product to the table that quickly and thoroughly helps me take care of my skin, and remove unwanted facial hair without paying an arm and a leg every two weeks at the salon.</li>
            <li> have not been able to use the epilator again since the hair is not growing back yet and despite the pain I will definitely recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> have PCOS and probably have quite a bit more facial hair such as mustache, sideburns, chin, neck, etc.</li>
            <li> My face feels extra smooth without drying and ripping at my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am extremely satisfied with this product and definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I got a much cleaner result and my skin felt so soft.</li>
            <li> but I was using it wrong lol.</li>
            <li> The easy to use epilator caught thin, fine hairs on my mustache line and shorter, coarser hairs on my chin area.</li>
            <li> It is relevantly easy to use only have three options on the same switch; to move clockwise, counterclockwise, and the off position.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I have used the Epilator once so far and have to admit I am loving it, my hair usually grows back very fast and it has been a bit over a week and still no hairs.</li>
            <li> The brush is really soft and can be used with a facial cleanser, which I did, and after using it I could feel the difference right away, my face was fresh and deeply</li>
            <li> My friends are so surprise with my new skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have never used a facial cleansing brush before, it makes my face extra smooth</li>
            <li> so I may be too sensitive for this particular product.</li>
            <li> After a minute, my upper lip was completely smooth of all hair, including the fine hair that can be hard to get with waxing.  </li>
            <li> The facial scrubber seems to be too rough on skin that is drier or more sensitive than normal skin.  </li>
            <li> As I held my face near the mirror anticipating the hair pullage, I was so elated to see the hairs literally flying into the mirror, no effort, no pain!</li>
            <li> the brush head spins in 2 different directions, like the epilator and also vibrates and does the job pretty well</li>
            <li> The next time I used the epilator, I used the cleansing brush first.</li>
            <li> and my skin was completely clean and not red or blotchy like when I use facial scrubs.</li>
            <li> But because it&#x27;s so easy to use you can bring it out everyday to take away any of your unwanted hairs.</li>
            <li> I would love to try this with other cleansers but first I need to empty my current one.</li>
            <li> This way your skin is clean and there is less chance of breakouts.</li>
            <li> Clear skin and the tweezer part saves a lot of time.</li>
            <li> and I could not imagine having it near my face.</li>
            <li> The epilator is by far the easiest method of hair removal.  </li>
            <li> but overall I really like it.  </li>
            <li> so much why am I giving it only four stars?</li>
            <li> The simplicity of it surprised me - just put in the battery, flip the switch</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably my skin type , so it could work well in skins that are not as sensitive as mine .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But with that being said it still functions well, and I have been using it frequently (brush and epilator heads alike)</li>
            <li> you are unfamiliar with epilating as I was, you will probably be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Braun is a very reliable brand and the product seems to be well built to last for years to come.</li>
            <li> It is small, easy to use, spins in 2 ways and does its job efficiently.</li>
            <li> Instead of just using it for a short period of time and writing a review, I decided to use it first for at least a month and then let you know more about the overall performance of the</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and provides results very similar to waxing, but without the mess.</li>
            <li> I have had several different epilators over the years, but this is the first one I&#x27;ve ever had specifically designed for the face.</li>
            <li> I am a full blown epilator convert since this little beauty came into my life.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t afford to laser it off so this little machine is the next best thing!.</li>
            <li> I would definitely and positively recommend this to all the ladies out there who want to get rid of their facial hair at home and at ease.</li>
            <li> It gets down deep leaving your pores clean.</li>
            <li> After I did the whole upper lip and lower lip, I decided to try to use it on the sides and above my eyebrow.  </li>
            <li> The brush cleans really well no problems with it although after reading other reviews I was concerned because I also have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> It even grabs the fine, small hairs above the lip.</li>
            <li> My skin was also too sensitive for the facial cleansing component.</li>
            <li> This is not even a full fledged epilator, but a mini epilator only meant for a few parts of the face.  </li>
            <li> More hairs were pulled out than other epilators I have had used in the past.</li>
            <li> No need to mess with a bunch of hard to understand buttons, the way they marked the options is very clear and easy to understand.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> As someone with oily skin, I find that using the cleansing brush every other day makes my face feel so much smoother, cleaner, and softer to the touch.</li>
            <li> I compare it to getting tattooed, it kinda hurts, but it is more the built up anticipation that is worse than the actual feeling.</li>
            <li> I tried it today for the first time and this little thing blew me over.</li>
            <li> It is gentle enough on my sensitive skin to use everyday.  </li>
            <li> It took me maybe 15 min of extreme pain before finishing my upper lip but I also have to admit that the results were very satisfactory.</li>
            <li> After the first few times I used the brush, I was breaking out like</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what was my favorite feature on this little gem.  </li>
            <li> I use this usually a few days a week, and have found that my skin has less dry spots and a brighter, more polished look.  </li>
            <li> I actually ENJOY using this product, simply because it takes so much less time than using tweezers, isn&#x27;t as messy as waxing and the hair grows back smoother and softer and takes longer to grow back than hair that has been shaved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I do have to admit at first I was scared to use the Epilator since, it does sound painful from the noise it makes</li>
            <li> I used Nair in the past, and it just does not work very well anymore.  </li>
            <li> To my dissappoint the facial scrubber seemed to make my skin irritated, burning, and in minor pain.  </li>
            <li> It can be a little uncomfortable to be honest.</li>
            <li> Overall this machine does remove the hair on the upper and lower lip, along with the upper eyebrow and on the sides, but the facial scrubber was too harsh on the skin and definitely is not an added bonus to the machine.  </li>
            <li> The brush is not suitable for sensitive skin, it will use only to remove makeup without lighting , only with the brush, but not for deep cleaning , because it irritates me a lot.</li>
            <li> The instructions said to use it for a minute, but I would useit for way less or not at all if you had sensitive dry</li>
            <li> Even though I got this free because I am a BZZagent, I would have to say that the price tag of $100 is quite expensive for what the machine can do.  </li>
            <li> Minor detail</li>
            <li> I have noticed the following in the month in a half that I have used the Braun Beauty Edition Facial Cleansing Brush:&lt;br /</li>
            <li> It is very soft and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin raw like other similar products have.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t very water tight and after a few uses i was having to spin it to get it started.</li>
            <li> For the courser hair, like those pesky little chin hairs (I know I can&#x27;t be the ONLY woman that has the occasional one!)</li>
            <li> as for the facial brush, it is a great disappointment as it is quite hard , use the Clarisonic Mia and had told me that much compared to this , but unfortunately nothing to do .</li>
            <li> It does need frequent battery replacement, but at least you are only replacing one AA battery.  </li>
            <li> but it was excruciating on my upper lip and not precise enough for use on my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I get my face wet, apply my face wash all over my face using a little extra, then simply dampen the brush and use.</li>
            <li> The only hair it didn&#x27;t remove was hairs that were already slightly ingrown.  </li>
            <li> I have black heads, not white heads.</li>
            <li> I was afraid it would hurt quite a lot, but it hurt less than threading, and maybe slightly more than plucking.</li>
            <li> It takes so much less time than using tweezers, isn&#x27;t as messy as waxing and the hair grows back smoother and softer and takes longer to grow back than hair that has been shaved.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The fact that I can use it in the shower is a definite bonus, making my mornings go a little quicker.</li>
            <li> I will admit that the epilator doesn&#x27;t tickle and has left a little redness that fades in a couple hours.</li>
            <li> but I hesitate on using it daily because it feels a little rough.</li>
            <li> I have  very dark upper lip hair and its been a week</li>
            <li> Using this instead of messy hair removal creams not only saves me money, but saves my face from the burning irritation I get from using the cream</li>
            <li> When will we ever get past a new gadget for each little thing?</li>
            <li> Hopefully they do offer other attachments for this epilator and change the facial scrubber attachment to have bristles that are a little softer on the skin.  </li>
            <li> and I still have very little hair growth around my upper lip and in between my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> It is painful, but nor more or less than tweezers.</li>
            <li> the reason I gave this a 4 stars is due to the cleansing brush.</li>
            <li> It does hurt just alittle when you first use it, but it is nothing that is worse than a mustache!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s small enough to get between my brows</li>
            <li> The mirror is an added bonus, but I&#x27;m  not especially pleased with it because I think it is too small.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My upper lip remain red for approximately one hour</li>
            <li> : Painful at first, battery life not long</li>
            <li> My Psoriasis caused black heads on my skin due to the thickening of my skin giving the oil and debris no where to go, so it gets clogged.</li>
            <li> I find the size of this brush to be a little too small for something that I would use on a regular basis and will stick to my Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> This item is not worth the money, had issues with it after 30days (about 5 uses) and it started giving me problems.</li>
            <li> even less than waxing.</li>
            <li> Waxing may be slightly preferable because it goes quicker.  </li>
            <li> I have slight Psoriasis on my that has taken me years to get under control.</li>
            <li> The irritation was gone in about 10 minutes, which is less than with waxing.</li>
            <li> I do feel it could be a little less money.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s going to hurt a little.  </li>
            <li> Well, IMO the epilator leaves a little room for improvements.  </li>
            <li> I admit I was a little scared of using an Epilator.</li>
            <li> I have not yet find the right way to make this experience less painful</li>
            <li> It does hurt, but if you pull the skin very tight, it does hurt significantly less.</li>
            <li> After practicing a few days I even figured out how to use it on my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> Epilator was dead on arrival.</li>
            <li> It brought all of my underlying black heads to the surface for me to treat!</li>
            <li> The price on the other hand is hard to swallow.</li>
            <li> But, this product hurts the least of all other methods I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> this product hurts the least of all other methods I&#x27;ve tried. .</li>
            <li> I am only giving to the Braun Face Beauty Edition 820 a 4-star because I have to admit that this is extremely painful when used on the upper lip-</li>
            <li> Which brings me to another reason I like this product, it gets even the SHORTEST little hairs!  </li>
            <li> No more chore of waxing here.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this is because of the type of cleanser</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin CRAZY soft.</li>
            <li> If this machine worked properly it would mean I would no longer need to use messy expensive creams to remove my lip and eyebrow hair.</li>
            <li> Purchased with hard earned money.</li>
            <li> This little thing packs quite a punch!!</li>
            <li> I have yet to find a method of removing hair by the root without at least some pain.  </li>
            <li> I guess I expected it to be much less painful</li>
            <li> Now, that little sucker does grab the hair!!  </li>
            <li> If there is anything I hate about having a hormone dysfunction, it&#x27;s facial hair.  </li>
            <li> Unlike other reviewers, I did not find it painful at all.  </li>
            <li> my mom cause she has a serious ‘stach going on)!</li>
            <li> I think it is less painful than waxing, to give you a reference.</li>
            <li> so I twisted off the epilator and put the brush head on to use.</li>
            <li> my &#x27;go to&#x27; when traveling or getting the random hair.  </li>
            <li> (Needless to say, I avoided pictures on Thanksgiving Day.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with this device.</li>
            <li> Regarding the upper lips: IT IS EXTREMELY PAINFUL!!!</li>
            <li> you can see the very thin hair in you face through it</li>
            <li> When I got the guts to try it, it was not as painful</li>
            <li> it was practically as painful or maybe</li>
            <li> It was a bit on the painful side, but nothing unbearable.  </li>
            <li> but it was so painful that I never tried it again.</li>
            <li> It is slightly painful, but manageable.</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed :(</li>
            <li> Epilator is not painless as with any hair removal system, but it isn&#x27;t horrific either.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I own a regular epilator and I love waxing so I was a great candidate to try this product. Let’s be honest epilating isn’t the most comfortable feeling in the world. I compare it to getting tattooed, it kinda hurts, but it is more the built up anticipation that is worse than the actual feeling. When I first tried the Braun Face Beauty Edition 810 epilator I was apprehensive at first.  However, it was so quiet and non –threatening that I was not afraid to use it at all. Let me tell you this thing WORKS! As I held my face near the mirror anticipating the hair pullage, I was so elated to see the hairs literally flying into the mirror, no effort, no pain! I am definitely keeping this thing around for touch ups. No more chore of waxing here. I am a full blown epilator convert since this little beauty came into my life. Thanks to BzzAgent I was able to try this little beauty for free. Plus anything that can do more than one thing (the face scrubbing attachment) is a bonus in my book. When will we ever get past a new gadget for each little thing? Thanks Braun and thanks BuzzAgent, I’m telling all my friends, (and my mom cause she has a serious ‘stach going on)!</li>
            <li> I LOVE the cleansing brush- it made my skin super soft and felt like it cleansed my skin very well.  I used the Epliator on my face- it hurt a bit (which is why I gave this product 4 stars) but I&#x27;d say it was the same amount of discomfort you&#x27;d get if you were to wax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all- it&#x27;s a great product and much cheaper than a lot of facial brushes out there.  Plus you get two products in one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Good price point, two products in one, cleans face very well, waterproof so that I can take it in the shower with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: the epilator does hurt when I use it on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I got this product as part of a promotion from this brand.</li>
            <li> I received the Braun face 820 model, the one with an extra refill from Bzzagent for free to try and review as part of the promotion from the brand. I tried it today for the first time and this little thing blew me over. I love the epilator, it does the job so very well that I dont need to tweeze anymore on my face. its perfect in every sense. It is small, easy to use, spins in 2 ways and does its job efficiently. I am so impressed that I dont have words. the reason I gave this a 4 stars is due to the cleansing brush. The brush itself is really smooth and is not harsh on my skin but I wish it could clean a lot better. I am not sure if this is because of the type of cleanser I use (I used cetaphil). the brush head spins in 2 different directions, like the epilator and also vibrates and does the job pretty well but I could still see makeup on my olay makeup remover wipes after I used the cleansing brush. I would love to try this with other cleansers but first I need to empty my current one. I would definitely and positively recommend this to all the ladies out there who want to get rid of their facial hair at home and at ease. trust me you will love the epilator!!!</li>
            <li> This product is great, although the price is a bit high for me. I do have to admit at first I was scared to use the Epilator since, it does sound painful from the noise it makes and I could not imagine having it near my face. When I got the guts to try it, it was not as painful it was practically as painful or maybe even less than waxing. I have used the Epilator once so far and have to admit I am loving it, my hair usually grows back very fast and it has been a bit over a week and still no hairs. Also the facial cleanser is fantastic  I have been getting great compliments about my skin since, I started using it. Overall, this is a great item although the price is a bit high but if you go out to the spa for facial cleansing and/or waxing often it will end up paying for its self.&lt;br /&gt;I myself received this product as a promotion from the brand but would definitely recommend it and am buying one as a gift for my sister who spends hundreds of dollars a year at the spa.</li>
            <li> I actually ENJOY using this product, simply because it takes so much less time than using tweezers, isn&#x27;t as messy as waxing and the hair grows back smoother and softer and takes longer to grow back than hair that has been shaved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have PCOS and probably have quite a bit more facial hair than most women.  I was thrilled to get to try this out as part of a promotion.  I have used several different brands of epilators and just about every method of temporary hair removal known.  That is why I am giving this product 5 stars.  To be perfectly honest, this is an epilator so it&#x27;s going to hurt a little.  I have yet to find a method of removing hair by the root without at least some pain.  But, this product hurts the least of all other methods I&#x27;ve tried.  I like and appreciate that it doesn&#x27;t use springs to remove the hair like some epilators.  Only plastic touches the skin, no metal.  This is a big plus for me.  Fine hair, such as hair along the mustache and sideburns, comes out very easily.  For the courser hair, like those pesky little chin hairs (I know I can&#x27;t be the ONLY woman that has the occasional one!), you have to &amp;#34;hover&amp;#34; over the hair a bit longer than you do the finer hairs, but it removes those hairs as well.  The only hair it didn&#x27;t remove was hairs that were already slightly ingrown.  I had to get those with tweezers.  Which brings me to another reason I like this product, it gets even the SHORTEST little hairs!  Most epilators I&#x27;ve used don&#x27;t do that and waxing certainly doesn&#x27;t.  The epilator cleans up easily (there is a cleaning brush included) and comes with a cap for storage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this is a 2 - in - 1 product, it also comes with a cleansing brush for the face.  It is very soft and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin raw like other similar products have.  It can be used with any cleanser of your choice and leaves the face feeling very clean and exfoliated.  It&#x27;s waterproof too so it&#x27;s ok to take it into the shower!  It is very easy tochange to the brush from epilator or vice versa and runs on one AA battery.  I love this product!  If you are a woman who hates plucking/waxing/cremes/etc, I highly recommend this product!  It&#x27;s definitely the best I&#x27;ve used, of it&#x27;s kind.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this out as it is not only an epilator for your face, but also has a cleanser brush for your face which is amazing. I normally see stores selling only one or the other so to have both in one product is a great deal! Worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the epilator in the evening before going to bed so that if I got any irritation it would go away by the morning. I started with my upper lip and the places it took out my hairs it kind of hurt me, as does any emulation for me. I noticed that for those really really short tiny hairs, they wouldn&#x27;t come off with this. I think I would need to let my mustache grow out another day to try again. But because it&#x27;s so easy to use you can bring it out everyday to take away any of your unwanted hairs. It&#x27;s really cool and saves time. I also used the epilator on my sideburns and sides of my face. It worked very well there. I think you can also use it for in between your eyebrows and also your chin if you have hair. It has a slim head so it&#x27;s very versatile. I like that a lot about this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to also try the cleansing facial brush head so I twisted off the epilator and put the brush head on to use. The bristles were very soft and felt good on my skin. I added some of my face wash to it w water and washed my whole face. I really enjoyed it and my skin felt softer afterwards. I want to try using it w a face scrub next. I think it will be perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I am very happy with this product. I think it would make a nice gift for yourself or someone else. I liked the fact that you don&#x27;t have to plug anything in and it comes with a battery too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun Face Beauty Edition 820 was received by me as part of a promotion by the brand Braun to try out from Bzzagent.</li>
            <li> Amazing! As a woman with more facial hair than I care to talk about, this product was fantastic. The easy to use epilator caught thin, fine hairs on my mustache line and shorter, coarser hairs on my chin area. Because it&#x27;s an epilator (pulls from root) it wasn&#x27;t completely pain free, but, it wasn&#x27;t torturous and quite bearable. It comes with a great, soft facial cleansing brush that attaches to the handle of the epilator and cleanses thoroughly. I put it to the overnight make up test and my skin was completely clean and not red or blotchy like when I use facial scrubs. I would definitely give this beauty product 10 stars, except I&#x27;m only allowed to use five. :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what was my favorite feature on this little gem.  Like another reviewer, I have PCOS and was excited to receive this as a promotion.  If there is anything I hate about having a hormone dysfunction, it&#x27;s facial hair.  The epilator is by far the easiest method of hair removal.  I started out as the directions indicated, and used it between my browline first, and then I moved to my unsightly chin hairs.  To my surprise, the epilator even grabbed the thicker, typically more difficult hairs.  It was a bit on the painful side, but nothing unbearable.  Honestly, it&#x27;s easier to let the epilator do the work, and much faster.  It beats cringing as you pay someone to rip wax strips off your face, or painstakingly trying to grab each and every hair with a pair of tweezers.  Lets not forget the stubborn hairs you have to grab over and over after unsuccessful plucks.  I did notice the thicker hairs just took a couple more seconds to grab, but that&#x27;s inconsequential compared to the time saved.    With hair removal being the most unpleasant part of my &#x27;routine,&#x27; I do enjoy the cleansing brush much more.  My face has a very patchy look to it most of the time, with combination dry and oily areas.  I use this usually a few days a week, and have found that my skin has less dry spots and a brighter, more polished look.  It leaves a better result than some similar products I have used.  I&#x27;ll be keeping this.  Definitely worth the money when compared to the cost of waxing and paying for a cleansing brush that is only half as good!    My only criticism would be wishing it came with a dock to recharge, instead of having to switch batteries.  Minor detail, it&#x27;s still a nice product I&#x27;m happy to have for the long term.</li>
            <li> Thanks to BzzAgent I got to try this product. I love the cleansing brush, it gets deep in my pores and leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean. The fact that I can use it in the shower is a definite bonus, making my mornings go a little quicker. It is gentle enough on my sensitive skin to use everyday.  The epilator is small but effective. I can see this being my &#x27;go to&#x27; when traveling or getting the random hair.  It is painful, but nor more or less than tweezers. Waxing may be slightly preferable because it goes quicker.  All in all this is a great product and would definitely recommend to family and friends!</li>
            <li> I received this item from a review website. Taking the item out of the box, I would have originally said that I was not in love with the epilator. The next time I used the epilator, I used the cleansing brush first. This makes a world of a difference when it comes to extracting the hairs. I got a much cleaner result and my skin felt so soft. The epilator is very strong. I had to get used to the pain from the first time use. It took me a few minutes to find the best positioning in order to grip all the hairs on my upper lip, but once I found the proper way to hold it, the results were much better. I have light hair, so most of the hairs I would be trying to get rid of are on the thinner side. More hairs were pulled out than other epilators I have had used in the past. This was where the brush to clean the epilator came in very handy. After every use, I was able to clean the head very easily. Between uses of the epilator, I use the cleansing brush to help deep clean my pores. As someone with oily skin, I find that using the cleansing brush every other day makes my face feel so much smoother, cleaner, and softer to the touch. All the use seems to have a draining affect on the battery. If I used the epilator as just that, the battery would have lasted much longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Pulls even the smaller hairs, quick, cleansing brush deep cleans&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Painful at first, battery life not long</li>
            <li> I received the Braun cleansing brush and epilator as a promotion from this brand for the purpose of writing this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I have to say that I&#x27;ve tried a lot of similar products to the cleansing brush, both the Mia and off brands. I like the Braun version better than the Mia because it spins instead of vibrates. I feel like the spinning action does a better job. My face is very smooth after and feels soooo soft. I feel like over time it will help get rid of acne scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The epilator is awesome too. It leaves my skin CRAZY soft. I use it mostly in between my eyebrows and upper lip. It does hurt, but if you pull the skin very tight, it does hurt significantly less. If the pain is unbearable for you, get some lidocaine cream and use that a couple times until your follicles shrink and it gets easier.</li>
            <li> This item is not worth the money, had issues with it after 30days (about 5 uses) and it started giving me problems. It isn&#x27;t very water tight and after a few uses i was having to spin it to get it started. Wouldnt recommend anyone buy this.</li>
            <li> Got it for my wife, she said the facial epilator changed her life. It works great and hurts very lillte to none.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the facial epilator for 3 months, it quit working. I think it should have lasted longer.</li>
            <li> I like this better than the NONO as it removes the hair much better.  Will take some getting used to but overall I really like it.  The brush cleans really well no problems with it although after reading other reviews I was concerned because I also have sensitive skin.  This is a honest review, I have no connection with Braun nor did I receive this product free to try out.  Purchased with hard earned money.</li>
            <li> I am Italian, and have the ever pain the butt hair growth above my lip, and face.  I used Nair in the past, and it just does not work very well anymore.  This product is great!!!  It does hurt just alittle when you first use it, but it is nothing that is worse than a mustache! lol.  I would highly recommend it for anyone who wants a smooth face!!!!</li>
            <li> Great product,  removes facial hair effectively, the pain is so minimal and after a couple of times, it does not hurt much.  I wish I had known of this product earlier, would have saved a bunch.</li>
            <li> I was skeptic at first. Assumed this would hurt a ton but I love it! After practicing a few days I even figured out how to use it on my eyebrows. It&#x27;s so much more convient than tweezers. I keep it in my purse!!! Love it! The scrub brush is great, too. I don&#x27;t have to use super drying face soap any more. This is totally worth it!</li>
            <li> I was truly impressed with this product. It works wonderfully. However, here is a heads up: it is not painless. But pain is beauty ladies! READ the directions more than once before use, or you will not be pleased. The first time I used the hair removal feature, I ended up with what looked like razor burn. (Needless to say, I avoided pictures on Thanksgiving Day. ;) ) But once I got used to it and reread the directions, it hasn&#x27;t happened again. Suggestion: don&#x27;t use the same day you have big plans. Do a test run on a night in, just in case. The facial brush is AMAZING and so easy to use. I get my face wet, apply my face wash all over my face using a little extra, then simply dampen the brush and use. I have slight Psoriasis on my that has taken me years to get under control. So I was nervous when I was sent the product as a promotional free trial. And at first-I wasn&#x27;t very pleased! My Psoriasis caused black heads on my skin due to the thickening of my skin giving the oil and debris no where to go, so it gets clogged. After the first few times I used the brush, I was breaking out like you wouldn&#x27;t believe. I have black heads, not white heads. And I all of a sudden felt like a teenager in an acne commercial. HOWEVER, to my relief, this was A GOOD THING the brush did! It brought all of my underlying black heads to the surface for me to treat! My skin has never looked this good! Thank you Braun for bringing a product to the table that quickly and thoroughly helps me take care of my skin, and remove unwanted facial hair without paying an arm and a leg every two weeks at the salon. SO WORTH IT LADIES! :D</li>
            <li> I love this product and the facial brush left my skin amazing&lt;br /&gt;Snd the mirror is amazing you can see the very thin hair in you face through it</li>
            <li> I was extremely happy and excited to know that as a BZZagent that I would be receiving the mini epilator made by Braun.  The model I received was the Face Beauty Edition 810.  Instead of just using it for a short period of time and writing a review, I decided to use it first for at least a month and then let you know more about the overall performance of the machine.&lt;br /&gt;  This epilator is as shown, it comes with two separate heads that you can interchange.  You get the face scrubber and epilator attachments, along with a mini brush to clean the epilator and a cap to store put over the top of the epilator attachments.  The epilator is easy for me to grip and feels comfortable in my small hands.  It is relevantly easy to use only have three options on the same switch; to move clockwise, counterclockwise, and the off position.&lt;br /&gt;  When I started off using the epilator attachment and was excited to begin.  If this machine worked properly it would mean I would no longer need to use messy expensive creams to remove my lip and eyebrow hair. I made sure my face was cleaned as the instructions on the manual had mentioned and switched the machine on the counterclockwise position and began to work on my right side of my upper lip.  I could tell that it was plucking off each hair, even the finest hairs on my face.  After I did the whole upper lip and lower lip, I decided to try to use it on the sides and above my eyebrow.  It worked very well on the sides of the eyebrow and on the top part of the eyebrow, but I did notice that I had to pull at my skin for the epilator to get more of the hairs (that was also mentioned in the manual).  I did experiment and try to get the hairs under the eyebrow, but because the skin was too puffy, I could only get to a couple of the hairs, the rest had to be plucked with tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;  It did a pretty good job at removing the hairs and after I gave the epilator attachment the proper cleaning (which was a breeze to do) I decided to use thefacial attachment next.  I used it with my Simple facial cleanser.  To my dissappoint the facial scrubber seemed to make my skin irritated, burning, and in minor pain.  When I used the scrubber I made sure not to apply too much pressure on it, but there is a possibility because of my sensitive skin that is prone to psorasis that it gets easily irritated.&lt;br /&gt;  I have noticed the following in the month in a half that I have used the Braun Beauty Edition Facial Cleansing Brush:&lt;br /&gt; PROS:&lt;br /&gt;** I love how my face does not get irritated which this product compared to using a cream hair removing product.  I do need to use the epilator every two to three days for touchups.&lt;br /&gt;** It is easy to use and clean.  No need to mess with a bunch of hard to understand buttons, the way they marked the options is very clear and easy to understand.&lt;br /&gt;** It removes almost all of the hair that I go over the epilator with.  The exception is under the eyebrow area, but in the manual it is never promised that it will remove the hair from that area.&lt;br /&gt;**  It runs on one AA battery.  I expected it to need more power, but it does great on one battery.&lt;br /&gt;**  Using this instead of messy hair removal creams not only saves me money, but saves my face from the burning irritation I get from using the cream (I only put it on for the time mentioned on the package or if earlier, as soon as my skin gets a burning tingling feeling.  The cream costs around $8 and I need to purchase is every one to two months.&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;** It seems to need a battery replacement every one to two weeks.  I use it for about 3-5 minutes every use which is about every two to three days.  It starts off nice and strong with a new battery, but after a short while it because significantly weaker and removes less hairs than it normally will.&lt;br /&gt;**  The facial scrubber seems to be too rough on skin that is drier or more sensitive than normal skin.  The instructions said to use it for a minute, but I would useit for way less or not at all if you had sensitive dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;** It is quite pricey.  Even though I got this free because I am a BZZagent, I would have to say that the price tag of $100 is quite expensive for what the machine can do.  This is not even a full fledged epilator, but a mini epilator only meant for a few parts of the face.  If they could somehow get the machine to work under the eyebrows, then it would be a better deal.&lt;br /&gt;  Overall this machine does remove the hair on the upper and lower lip, along with the upper eyebrow and on the sides, but the facial scrubber was too harsh on the skin and definitely is not an added bonus to the machine.  It does need frequent battery replacement, but at least you are only replacing one AA battery.  Hopefully they do offer other attachments for this epilator and change the facial scrubber attachment to have bristles that are a little softer on the skin.  I thank BZZagent for this opportunity to review this item and hope that this assists you on your decision on whether or not to purchase this machine.</li>
            <li> I like this product. It is easy to use and provides results very similar to waxing, but without the mess. I will admit that the epilator doesn&#x27;t tickle and has left a little redness that fades in a couple hours. I suggest using it at night until your skin is used to the sensation. The results are very similar to waxing but I feel the whole process is a lot faster. I have never used a facial cleansing brush before, it makes my face extra smooth and I feel the deep clean but I hesitate on using it daily because it feels a little rough. At the end of the day, this is a good product with great results! I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with this device. I guess I expected it to be much less painful but it was excruciating on my upper lip and not precise enough for use on my eyebrows. I struggled to match the rational component with the hair growth so I found myself doubling back and switching rotation often to actually pull hair. My skin was also too sensitive for the facial cleansing component. I still give this product 3 stars because the design is sleek and the device itself fits well in my hand and is easy to operate. My sister tried it and I loved it so I may be too sensitive for this particular product. If I had not received this item as a free promotion from the company through Buzz Agent, I would most likely not have purchased it</li>
            <li> I am only giving to the Braun Face Beauty Edition 820 a 4-star because I have to admit that this is extremely painful when used on the upper lip- I have not yet find the right way to make this experience less painful but I am highly satisfied with the results.&lt;br /&gt;Since the skin has to be clean before using the epilator, I decided to use the brush first. The brush is really soft and can be used with a facial cleanser, which I did, and after using it I could feel the difference right away, my face was fresh and deeply cleaned.&lt;br /&gt;Now that my face was clean, It was time to try the epilator. Easy to us in between the eyebrows, not painful at all and very good results…way faster that doing it one by one. Regarding the upper lips: IT IS EXTREMELY PAINFUL!!! I had to stop and breathe deeply several times before starting again. It took me maybe 15 min of extreme pain before finishing my upper lip but I also have to admit that the results were very satisfactory. My upper lip remain red for approximately one hour so I do not recommend doing this before going out.&lt;br /&gt;I have not been able to use the epilator again since the hair is not growing back yet and despite the pain I will definitely recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;Note: This product was obtained through a Bzzz Campaign (BzzzAgent) and I got it for free in order to try it and review it.</li>
            <li> Thanks to BzzAgent I got to try this product and man was I amazed!! This little thing packs quite a punch!! I love the cleansing brush, it gets deep in my pores and scrubs all the day&#x27;s \\&quot;yuck\\&quot; away, but it is still gentle enough that I can use it on my child&#x27;s sticky face.  I also LOVE that I can use this in the shower, that makes my cleansing routine so much easier! Now, I know you&#x27;re thinking if I LOVE it so much why am I giving it only four stars? Well, IMO the epilator leaves a little room for improvements.  Even by following the directions to a \\&quot;T\\&quot;, I still felt as if it was pinching my face while grabbing the hairs. OUCH!  Now, that little sucker does grab the hair!!  I think it will be nice to have for in a pinch when maybe you can&#x27;t get to your esthetician for your regular wax, but I don&#x27;t see it replacing my waxing altogether.</li>
            <li> I love the cleansing brush. My skins been noticeably smoother. I feel as if I really do get a deep clean. The epilator is wonderful as well. I like that it&#x27;s small enough to get between my brows and I can rotate the direction without switching hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: deep cleansing brush&lt;br /&gt;•Waterproof so I can take into the shower&lt;br /&gt;•Portable&lt;br /&gt;•comes with replacement brush and cap to keep clean when not in use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I wish it came with a smaller brush to cleanse the sides of my nose easier&lt;br /&gt;•doesn&#x27;t remove makeup that well (I suggest washing your face as normal before using to keep clean)</li>
            <li> I received the Braun Edition Facial Brush and Facial Epilator through BzzAgent as a promotion.  At first I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like  this product.  However  I am completely happy and satisfied with this . I have  very dark upper lip hair and its been a week and still it does not seem to be getting itching or stumblely. It did hurt at first but I was using it wrong lol. The facial brush is a plus my skin feels clean and smooth. Kudos Braun</li>
            <li> Great product! It takes so much less time than using tweezers, isn&#x27;t as messy as waxing and the hair grows back smoother and softer and takes longer to grow back than hair that has been shaved.&lt;br /&gt;I have PCOS and probably have quite a bit more facial hair such as mustache, sideburns, chin, neck, etc. I was thrilled to get to try this out as part of a promotion. I have used  waxing, creams, and even laser hair removal. Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t afford to laser it off so this little machine is the next best thing!. It can be a little uncomfortable to be honest. But all hair removal products are. To best use this I suggest washing your face right before with warm water. This way your skin is clean and there is less chance of breakouts. It&#x27;s an awesome little machine. this product hurts the least of all other methods I&#x27;ve tried. . t. The epilator cleans up easily since there is a cleaning brush included and comes with a cap for storage. I haven&#x27;t tried the facial cleansing brush system that came with this yet but just having the epilator makes this product great for the money!</li>
            <li> I am a buzzagent and received a similar product for trial from braun. The one I got was braun face beauty edition 810. I love it. My face has never left so clean after washing with it. My husband even commented that it really foliates the skin. The eplictor definitely pulled the hairs quick and easy. The price on the other hand is hard to swallow. I do feel it could be a little less money.</li>
            <li> This product is great, and the price is very fair.&lt;br /&gt;My face has been noticeably smoother.&lt;br /&gt;I feel as if I really do get a deep clean. My friends are so surprise with my new skin.&lt;br /&gt;The epilator is wonderful as well.&lt;br /&gt;In addition, the facial cleanser is fantastic I have been getting great compliments about my skin since I started using it.</li>
            <li> I have the 810 version of the Braun epilator and I love it. Clear skin and the tweezer part saves a lot of time. It even grabs the fine, small hairs above the lip.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled to discover this epilator!  No more waxing for me - this was easy to use and effective.  Unlike other reviewers, I did not find it painful at all.  The simplicity of it surprised me - just put in the battery, flip the switch and you are ready to go.  After a minute, my upper lip was completely smooth of all hair, including the fine hair that can be hard to get with waxing.  It is small and portable, so it is easy to pull out for a quick &amp;#34;touch up&amp;#34; and will make it easy to travel with.  I can&#x27;t believe that I haven&#x27;t had anything like this before, and it is a relief to have it now.  As for the facial cleansing brush that is included, it is similar to another battery-operated brush that I already have.  The epilator is the reason to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> This product is Great! It is well worth the investment and saves you time and money at the spa. Epilator is not painless as with any hair removal system, but it isn&#x27;t horrific either. It definitely is better than tweezing, ripping and pulling at each hair one by one. It has been almost 2 weeks since I&#x27;ve used the epilator and I still have very little hair growth around my upper lip and in between my eyebrows. Amazed with the product!&lt;br /&gt;As far as the facial cleansing brush grows it is quite amazing as well. It gets down deep leaving your pores clean. My face feels extra smooth without drying and ripping at my sensitive skin. Overall I recommend this product and will be sending these as Christmas gifts this year to all my girlfriends.</li>
            <li> Love this one, it does everything I want it to do, love it, will be buying another one.</li>
            <li> The depilator is pretty good, a little painful to use at first, but pretty good results because hair does not grow as fast .&lt;br /&gt;But as for the facial brush, it is a great disappointment as it is quite hard , use the Clarisonic Mia and had told me that much compared to this , but unfortunately nothing to do . The brush is not suitable for sensitive skin, it will use only to remove makeup without lighting , only with the brush, but not for deep cleaning , because it irritates me a lot. It&#x27;s probably my skin type , so it could work well in skins that are not as sensitive as mine .&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free as part of a promotion of the brand , to prove it.&lt;br /&gt;My opinion is completely honest and not have paid me to interfere in the reality of my experience.</li>
            <li> First of all let me say that I did not receive this item as a free sample to test for a review. I purchased this outright through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would love to give this product a full 5 stars, but I think the battery-operated nature of it just doesn&#x27;t give it enough strength. I have tried all brands of batteries from cheap knockoffs to top of the line name-brand products. None of them have been able to help this product keep its power. But with that being said it still functions well, and I have been using it frequently (brush and epilator heads alike) for a few weeks now. The storage bag is classy and good quality, the cover cap for the epilator gives it a sleek and feminine look. The mirror is an added bonus, but I&#x27;m  not especially pleased with it because I think it is too small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are unfamiliar with epilating as I was, you will probably be pleasantly surprised. I was afraid it would hurt quite a lot, but it hurt less than threading, and maybe slightly more than plucking. Its probably along the same pain level as waxing for me, but then again I&#x27;ve been waxing for years and have gotten used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a couple of uses I have grown used to the sensation, and would gladly use this over other removal methods because I can do it at home within a few minutes, and it lasts a good 10 days or more.</li>
            <li> I received this product from a promotion and i LOVE it it gets rid of all the un-wanted hair and the exfoliator works amazing and leaves my face feeling so soft and clean would recommend this to my friends and family for sure</li>
            <li> I received this epilator face brush tool as part of a market review study from BzzzAgent. I admit I was a little scared of using an Epilator.I tried one along time ago on my legs but it was so painful that I never tried it again. This one is a great compact size and seems to be powerful enough to remove both the fine hairs on my lips and course hairs in between my eyebrows.I will admit it did still hurt but not nearly as painful as I remember the larger ones being. I read some tips on the Internet to use a numbing cream before using the epilatorso I tried that and it seems to work great. The face brush feature was small but seems to do a good job cleaning. I own a Clarisonic so I&#x27;ve had lots of experience with facial brushes.I find the size of this brush to be a little too small for something that I would use on a regular basis and will stick to my Clarisonic. However this brush would be great to bring for travel as it is a nice compact size and runs on regular batteries no need to bring a charger? I will continue to use this for the epilator for sure for my face but not for the brush a majority of the time. Braun is a very reliable brand and the product seems to be well built to last for years to come. I would definitely purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I have had several different epilators over the years, but this is the first one I&#x27;ve ever had specifically designed for the face. I received it as part of a campaign designed specifically to review this product. I liked that it is smaller, so it makes it easier to use around the eyebrows and upper lip. I was impressed with how well it seems to get the finer hairs, but also the really stubborn hairs that it takes forever to tweeze. My skin is really sensitive, but I didn&#x27;t experience anything more than very minor irritation after use. The irritation was gone in about 10 minutes, which is less than with waxing. It is slightly painful, but manageable. I think it is less painful than waxing, to give you a reference. I love the way my skin feels after using the facial cleansing brush attachment... It is so smooth! My husband has noticed the difference and said my face has more of a \\&quot;glow\\&quot; these days. Overall, I am extremely satisfied with this product and definitely recommend it. It is a highly functional product for a good value.</li>
            <li> Epilator was dead on arrival. Was really looking forward to trying this out. Extremely disappointed :(</li>
