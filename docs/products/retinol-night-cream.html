            <li>its a very nice smelling retinol cream.</li>
            <li>:) great deal!</li>
            <li>My experience with retinol creams has been the not so pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>its a good cream</li>
            <li>good luck.  </li>
            <li>It smells good too.</li>
            <li>I think it is a good product</li>
            <li>Came on time in good packaging.  </li>
            <li>After reading good reviews at Sally&#x27;s website I decided to try both day and night cream and let me tell you, I couldn&#x27;t be more happy about my decision.</li>
            <li>The quality is excellent and because it absorbs quickly it can be used in the day time under makeup.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I bought this!</li>
            <li>The cream is the best of the varied OTC brands I&#x27;ve tried and I have noticed a positive difference in the pores on my face, as well the &amp;#34;age&amp;#34; lines around my mouth.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks amazing already.</li>
            <li>It is truly an amazing cream.  </li>
            <li>great leaves skin smooth.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is nice.</li>
            <li>I had been using Retinol-X for about a year and really liked it.  </li>
            <li>Smells nice.  </li>
            <li>but in fact feels great once absorbed by your skin.</li>
            <li>and WOW I am happy I had to give something else a try!</li>
            <li>this is by far the best!</li>
            <li>Hasn&#x27;t been a good fit for me.</li>
            <li>My skim is very smooth and my wrinkles have dimmed.</li>
            <li>Does  nothing needs more retinol in it.</li>
            <li>and my acne is much better.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not too in love with them.</li>
            <li>&amp; I love it.</li>
            <li>Everything is tightened and I have much more even toned skin.  </li>
            <li>I think the best part is that it actually looks &#x27;dewey&#x27; and healthy.  </li>
            <li>Allergic to this product and haven&#x27;t been able to reach the seller to see if I can return and get a refund.</li>
            <li>like the fact its a good sized jar.. anything as far as i&#x27;m concerned that has retinonal is good.</li>
            <li>and I think you&#x27;ll be really pleased.</li>
            <li>I am able to use it each night.</li>
            <li>My skin feels refreshed and looks healthy.</li>
            <li>I also love their day time cream which has sunscreen in it.</li>
            <li>This product works better than any of the others that I have tried.</li>
            <li>I used to use meaningful beauty, this products rocks over meaningful beauty.</li>
            <li>I dont recommend this for the eye area since it is very rich.</li>
            <li>Smells great and keeps my skin really soft.  </li>
            <li>greasy feel good on m sin &amp; reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast, packaged good..</li>
            <li>This is a really fantastic product and is a good price -very pleased!&lt;br</li>
            <li>honestly there are better products out there.. does not seem to have much effect in skin appearance.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use it because its perfume fragrance is way too strong.</li>
            <li>Why do they put strong fragrance in skin products???</li>
            <li>Glad I didn&#x27;t wait a full month.  </li>
            <li>Seems to soften fine my fine lines.  </li>
            <li>Exceptional without the high price.  </li>
            <li>It does smooth the face</li>
            <li>when i read reviews people say that they have better success with another product</li>
            <li>Meets the ingridents that my dermatologist said were the really only have to for great skin, and she was correct.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much that I am now trying the daytime serum as well.  </li>
            <li>So the fact that this one is so nice smelling makes me wonder how much concentration of retina A</li>
            <li>My skin truly looks fantastic and I, too, have received unsolicited compliments from family, friends, and co-workers.  </li>
            <li>Boost Collagen, Repair Cells, Tighten and Smooth Wrinkles]]</li>
            <li>My favorite product for vitamin A and worth the price</li>
            <li>But, this cream leaves your skin feeling smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li>but so far so good</li>
            <li>I just started using the product so far so good</li>
            <li>It is a good product, but I now use a natural &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; night cream.</li>
            <li>All of my breakouts have cleared up and I have significant improvement of my acne scars.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a rich cream.  </li>
            <li>There was a noticeable difference in my pore size as well as the firmness of my skin, and it really did seem to erase the very fine lines that were beginning to form.</li>
            <li>, my skin looks better, more elastic and soft.</li>
            <li>very good pricing for such high quality product.</li>
            <li>I thought I would try for a full month to see what happend.  </li>
            <li>I use a full regimen of these products.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a good anti-aging facial cream with retinol in it...</li>
            <li>Thank you for carrying such a good moisture cream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since purchased two more jars--that&#x27;s how much I like it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have wrinkles, but I do fine lines that disappear with consistent use.</li>
            <li>the smell is mild.</li>
            <li>They responded quickly and said it was 400,000 IU in the jar.  </li>
            <li>For a mild product I would stick with [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>received quickly and as described</li>
            <li>Someone thought it was then okay to put this in a shipping box and ship it out as new.  </li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive to break outs, so if you do not get acne easily, then you should be fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very impressed by the results, especially for how reasonably priced they are compared to most other Retinol creams.</li>
            <li>Really smoothes out fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>The smell is a little strong but not bad and my skin absorbs it very easily.</li>
            <li>Right after you apply it you touch your face and neck and it&#x27;s not grease</li>
            <li>price is right.  </li>
            <li>I used a correction moisturizer for awhile that came in an acne kit and noticed that did more than anything and its big claimed ingredient was retinol.  </li>
            <li>and when i first started using this i still had brakouts.</li>
            <li>Helps my skin stay smooth, hydrated and clear.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be fooled by paying higher prices.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this night cream for almost a year, and have saved several dollars a jar by purchasing it on Amazon (and free shipping with PRIME!)  </li>
            <li>Definitely one of my favorite products.</li>
            <li>This is a heavy cream with a strong smell which would be OK with me if it were 4% retinol at this price.  </li>
            <li>Initially my skin looked nice and soft in the morning with no redness.  </li>
            <li>I love this so much I need to go back to Sally&#x27;s to get the day cream, which I have yet to try.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what good it&#x27;s been doing.</li>
            <li>It is soft, smooth, firm and nicely hydrated.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this product for the next several months and see how much more clear and healthy my skin becomes.</li>
            <li>I began using it at night only, but have been using it morning and night for a couple months now, and my skin has not looked this good in a long time.</li>
            <li>I use to use to large pea size of another brand.  </li>
            <li>This takes just one large pea size for my face &amp; neck.  </li>
            <li>However, this particular brand of cream is the real deal!</li>
            <li>It was great to see it available on Amazon, as it&#x27;s several dollars less than one of the local &amp;#34;beauty&amp;#34; stores in our area.  </li>
            <li>but since I use it before bed it doesn&#x27;t really matter so much.  </li>
            <li>and I really like it</li>
            <li>my skin looks nourished and silky.i really like the texture of my skin now.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t matter much since its for night.</li>
            <li>concerning acne i don&#x27;t think it does much.</li>
            <li>This cream is very moisturizing, both the day cream and the night cream.  </li>
            <li>Very godd product.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping this cream would work for me, but it made me breakout.</li>
            <li>I was very leary when I couldn&#x27;t find anything about their company.  </li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t bother me since I like that smell.</li>
            <li>and i really like the improvements in my skin</li>
            <li>my skin looked nice because of the plumping effect of a heavy cream</li>
            <li>i really like this cream i like it better than the other two.</li>
            <li>It is not a cure by any means, but it has helped significantly to moisturize my face, and it has reduced the pores and lines enough that I will continue to use it.  </li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of other night creams and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it soaks in nit greasy and reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Hard to find great quality, such as this!  </li>
            <li>After the initial 4 days my face has cleared up tremendously.</li>
            <li>That was the main reason I purchased the cream to begin with.</li>
            <li>do they tell you how much Vitamin A is in them - usually not.  </li>
            <li>It would probably work for those with skin not prone to breakouts since it is a pretty heavy cream with a strong perfume.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this face cream.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for a day/night facial cream that would work for my dry/discoloration prone type of skin without any success.</li>
            <li>This cream really keeps my skin soft, but you really need to rub it in well, and you have to change your pillow case frequently.</li>
            <li>i love this as a part of my night time skin care routine, it is not too heavy at all</li>
            <li>After a few days I noticed my skin actually looked better!</li>
            <li>I would say that the cream is for extremely dry skin Soooooo oily Not bad for winter thought when the heaters are on</li>
            <li>It kind of have a \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; \\&quot;dollar store-ish\\&quot; scent but trust me won´t last long enough to bother you.  </li>
            <li>The cream itself is white, thick consistently, and absorbs nicely into the skin.</li>
            <li>I use it after I shower and when I apply it I do feel a slight tingle (goes away very quickly)</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and allergies, as well as a dislike of scented products.</li>
            <li>In fact my last night cream was this exact brand.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this at night (and their day version during the day), and within 2 weeks I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin looks and feels more firm!</li>
            <li>The scent everyone comments on smells EXACTLY like Estée Lauder&#x27;s White Linen perfume.</li>
            <li>My wife loves it more, I should say, but I also see that it actually does work, as a couple of age spots on my hands have decreased significantly.  </li>
            <li>Every other face lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried makes me break out--even those by Clearasil, Clean and Clear, Neutrogena, etc.</li>
            <li>In less than a week of using this cream (in the morning and night), my face is almost clear and I truely believe it will be totally clear within the month!  </li>
            <li>Get it, use it every night, you will see  a huge difference in a few weeks.</li>
            <li>What I like about my skin now is it looks so clear and luminescent.</li>
            <li>--remember it&#x27;s much easier to KEEP your skin looking and feeling young than it is to get it BACK to that state.</li>
            <li>If you have a Salley&#x27;s near by it is cheaper there.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even think you need to have sensitive skin to not want to use this product.  </li>
            <li>My skin is really soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>The lines on my forehead are completely gone.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and struggle with eczema during the fall and winter months.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the day cream as much because of the SPF, but I suppose that&#x27;s necessary.  </li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive &amp; this product doesn&#x27;t cause any burning like some can.  </li>
            <li>and my throat feeling just as soft as can be.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product and can save you hundreds of dollars a year over the expensive department store brands!</li>
            <li>I had a little redness/slight tingling when I first started using it (just for a few minutes after putting it on), but my skin quickly adjusted to the new product.</li>
            <li>Although I don&#x27;t have issues with my skin (even tone, limited blemishes, etc.), I found that it made my skin much smoother.  </li>
            <li>I havent been using long so not sure how effective it will bein the long run.</li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend this for young adults and up</li>
            <li>helps keep time from putting more damage to my face,use it night and day,but a thin layer,or it causes pimples on this 50+ face</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and creamy but not too thick and not greasy.  </li>
            <li>it feels soft and dry.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> But, this cream leaves your skin feeling smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li> but so far so good</li>
            <li> I just started using the product so far so good</li>
            <li> It is a good product, but I now use a natural &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; night cream.</li>
            <li> All of my breakouts have cleared up and I have significant improvement of my acne scars.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a rich cream.  </li>
            <li> There was a noticeable difference in my pore size as well as the firmness of my skin, and it really did seem to erase the very fine lines that were beginning to form.</li>
            <li> , my skin looks better, more elastic and soft.</li>
            <li> very good pricing for such high quality product.</li>
            <li> I thought I would try for a full month to see what happend.  </li>
            <li> I use a full regimen of these products.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a good anti-aging facial cream with retinol in it...</li>
            <li> Thank you for carrying such a good moisture cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since purchased two more jars--that&#x27;s how much I like it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have wrinkles, but I do fine lines that disappear with consistent use.</li>
            <li> the smell is mild.</li>
            <li> They responded quickly and said it was 400,000 IU in the jar.  </li>
            <li> For a mild product I would stick with [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> received quickly and as described</li>
            <li> Someone thought it was then okay to put this in a shipping box and ship it out as new.  </li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive to break outs, so if you do not get acne easily, then you should be fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed by the results, especially for how reasonably priced they are compared to most other Retinol creams.</li>
            <li> Really smoothes out fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> The smell is a little strong but not bad and my skin absorbs it very easily.</li>
            <li> Right after you apply it you touch your face and neck and it&#x27;s not grease</li>
            <li> price is right.  </li>
            <li> I used a correction moisturizer for awhile that came in an acne kit and noticed that did more than anything and its big claimed ingredient was retinol.  </li>
            <li> and when i first started using this i still had brakouts.</li>
            <li> Helps my skin stay smooth, hydrated and clear.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by paying higher prices.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this night cream for almost a year, and have saved several dollars a jar by purchasing it on Amazon (and free shipping with PRIME!)  </li>
            <li> Definitely one of my favorite products.</li>
            <li> This is a heavy cream with a strong smell which would be OK with me if it were 4% retinol at this price.  </li>
            <li> Initially my skin looked nice and soft in the morning with no redness.  </li>
            <li> I love this so much I need to go back to Sally&#x27;s to get the day cream, which I have yet to try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what good it&#x27;s been doing.</li>
            <li> It is soft, smooth, firm and nicely hydrated.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product for the next several months and see how much more clear and healthy my skin becomes.</li>
            <li> I began using it at night only, but have been using it morning and night for a couple months now, and my skin has not looked this good in a long time.</li>
            <li> I use to use to large pea size of another brand.  </li>
            <li> This takes just one large pea size for my face &amp; neck.  </li>
            <li> However, this particular brand of cream is the real deal!</li>
            <li> It was great to see it available on Amazon, as it&#x27;s several dollars less than one of the local &amp;#34;beauty&amp;#34; stores in our area.  </li>
            <li> but since I use it before bed it doesn&#x27;t really matter so much.  </li>
            <li> and I really like it</li>
            <li> my skin looks nourished and silky.i really like the texture of my skin now.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t matter much since its for night.</li>
            <li> concerning acne i don&#x27;t think it does much.</li>
            <li> This cream is very moisturizing, both the day cream and the night cream.  </li>
            <li> Very godd product.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping this cream would work for me, but it made me breakout.</li>
            <li> I was very leary when I couldn&#x27;t find anything about their company.  </li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t bother me since I like that smell.</li>
            <li> and i really like the improvements in my skin</li>
            <li> my skin looked nice because of the plumping effect of a heavy cream</li>
            <li> i really like this cream i like it better than the other two.</li>
            <li> It is not a cure by any means, but it has helped significantly to moisturize my face, and it has reduced the pores and lines enough that I will continue to use it.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of other night creams and this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it soaks in nit greasy and reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Hard to find great quality, such as this!  </li>
            <li> After the initial 4 days my face has cleared up tremendously.</li>
            <li> That was the main reason I purchased the cream to begin with.</li>
            <li> do they tell you how much Vitamin A is in them - usually not.  </li>
            <li> It would probably work for those with skin not prone to breakouts since it is a pretty heavy cream with a strong perfume.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this face cream.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a day/night facial cream that would work for my dry/discoloration prone type of skin without any success.</li>
            <li> This cream really keeps my skin soft, but you really need to rub it in well, and you have to change your pillow case frequently.</li>
            <li> i love this as a part of my night time skin care routine, it is not too heavy at all</li>
            <li> After a few days I noticed my skin actually looked better!</li>
            <li> I would say that the cream is for extremely dry skin Soooooo oily Not bad for winter thought when the heaters are on</li>
            <li> It kind of have a \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; \\&quot;dollar store-ish\\&quot; scent but trust me won´t last long enough to bother you.  </li>
            <li> The cream itself is white, thick consistently, and absorbs nicely into the skin.</li>
            <li> I use it after I shower and when I apply it I do feel a slight tingle (goes away very quickly)</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and allergies, as well as a dislike of scented products.</li>
            <li> In fact my last night cream was this exact brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this at night (and their day version during the day), and within 2 weeks I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin looks and feels more firm!</li>
            <li> The scent everyone comments on smells EXACTLY like Estée Lauder&#x27;s White Linen perfume.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it more, I should say, but I also see that it actually does work, as a couple of age spots on my hands have decreased significantly.  </li>
            <li> Every other face lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried makes me break out--even those by Clearasil, Clean and Clear, Neutrogena, etc.</li>
            <li> In less than a week of using this cream (in the morning and night), my face is almost clear and I truely believe it will be totally clear within the month!  </li>
            <li> Get it, use it every night, you will see  a huge difference in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> What I like about my skin now is it looks so clear and luminescent.</li>
            <li> --remember it&#x27;s much easier to KEEP your skin looking and feeling young than it is to get it BACK to that state.</li>
            <li> If you have a Salley&#x27;s near by it is cheaper there.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even think you need to have sensitive skin to not want to use this product.  </li>
            <li> My skin is really soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> The lines on my forehead are completely gone.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and struggle with eczema during the fall and winter months.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the day cream as much because of the SPF, but I suppose that&#x27;s necessary.  </li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive &amp; this product doesn&#x27;t cause any burning like some can.  </li>
            <li> and my throat feeling just as soft as can be.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product and can save you hundreds of dollars a year over the expensive department store brands!</li>
            <li> I had a little redness/slight tingling when I first started using it (just for a few minutes after putting it on), but my skin quickly adjusted to the new product.</li>
            <li> Although I don&#x27;t have issues with my skin (even tone, limited blemishes, etc.), I found that it made my skin much smoother.  </li>
            <li> I havent been using long so not sure how effective it will bein the long run.</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend this for young adults and up</li>
            <li> helps keep time from putting more damage to my face,use it night and day,but a thin layer,or it causes pimples on this 50+ face</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and creamy but not too thick and not greasy.  </li>
            <li> it feels soft and dry.</li>
            <li> but it will definitely last a long time.      </li>
            <li> This retinol go&#x27;s a long ways toward my goal of keep the wrinkles that are present from getting any deeper.  </li>
            <li> so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> The smell does seem to go away not too long after applying it.</li>
            <li> Due to the time required to see results from retinoic acid, I can only hope it works.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m another happy customer, no more expensive creams, no more trips to Macy&#x27;s comestic department, I found my product!</li>
            <li> My skin tends to get dry in the winter</li>
            <li> I use it morning and night as I have dry skin.</li>
            <li> It caused burning, itching and dry peeling skin.</li>
            <li> This product has made me break out really bad, so I haven&#x27;t been able to use it.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my skin moist and really do not need to use foundation.</li>
            <li> I hesitated to purchase this because other reviewers didn&#x27;t care for the smell.</li>
            <li> i have reviewed the other two retinol products i have mentioned if you would like to see</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cream like every other.</li>
            <li> so a little goes a long ways!  </li>
            <li> But this smell didn&#x27;t bother me; it&#x27;s definitely there, but it&#x27;s not overwhelmingly floral or chemical, just a typical lotion scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this every night for 6 months now, and my skin is softer, firmer, and all my dark spots (from sun exposure and aging) are gone.</li>
            <li> no visible pores, no redness, no visible dark spots.</li>
            <li> Since I have used retinol for a long time, redness doesn&#x27;t usually happen on my face</li>
            <li> , the smell of it could use improvement but thats my only complaint</li>
            <li> Over the past year, things such as benzyl peroxide and salicilic acid have not been clearing up my skin from breakouts (I am 22 and still have pretty bad acne).  </li>
            <li> not sure it works like i expected I dont care for perfume smell</li>
            <li> Which isn&#x27;t bad for a mild retinol solution but not when it is so smelly.  </li>
            <li> i am a little shiny though</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Retinol night cream for a few weeks</li>
            <li> It is SO heavily perfumed that it just turned my stomach.  </li>
            <li> Cream seems to be heavy texture</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 53 and have few wrinkles.</li>
            <li> This cream made my skin break out, so I had to stop using it after a few days.</li>
            <li> All I know is that I have to scrub a thin layer of skin off my face in the morning or the next day leaving it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find it harsh and even use a vitamin C serum in the day.  </li>
            <li> The other problem is that it is so thick, it feels like axel grease.  </li>
            <li> The night Retinol cream is a little heavier than I usually like</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thick moisturizing cream without being heavy.</li>
            <li> It is a small container</li>
            <li> So I bit the bullet and order my usual 2 times stronger Cosmedix.  </li>
            <li> Get past the perfume scent</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always skeptical of products like this, but I purchased one jar after finding it had an amount of retinol that, reportedly, would actually make a difference.</li>
            <li> They state vague numbers such as .05% - really that is worthless.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s been using it for at least a year now, and loves it.  </li>
            <li> and I prefer a thick one, specifically for forehead</li>
            <li> The cream is thick</li>
            <li> Might cause Milia like I got from a thick cream.</li>
            <li> The cream is thick and has a perfume type smell ( I do wish they offered a non scented).</li>
            <li> Waste of money !!</li>
            <li> Smell is not that bad especially if you put on at night.</li>
            <li> While I like the results, I won&#x27;t buy this product again because it smells terrible for about the first hour it is on your face.</li>
            <li> It is very thick</li>
            <li> Sorry - not loving it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products and have always been disappointed.</li>
            <li> and unfortunately it does contains parabens.</li>
            <li> I ordered this looking for an alternative to my expensive 4% retinol Cosmedix Refine.  </li>
            <li> if it doesn&#x27;t say 4%, 400,000 IU is meaningless.</li>
            <li> I am 49 and have very few wrinkles and want to keep it that way!!!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The night Retinol cream is a little heavier than I usually like but since I use it before bed it doesn&#x27;t really matter so much.  It does smooth the face and I have no skin problems using it.  All of the Retinol products have been very good for me.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use it because its perfume fragrance is way too strong. Why do they put strong fragrance in skin products???</li>
            <li> I hesitated to purchase this because other reviewers didn&#x27;t care for the smell. I have very sensitive skin, and allergies, as well as a dislike of scented products. But this smell didn&#x27;t bother me; it&#x27;s definitely there, but it&#x27;s not overwhelmingly floral or chemical, just a typical lotion scent. I&#x27;m so glad I bought this! It&#x27;s a thick moisturizing cream without being heavy. You can feel that it&#x27;s on, but it&#x27;s not greasy. Every other face lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried makes me break out--even those by Clearasil, Clean and Clear, Neutrogena, etc. This didn&#x27;t. After a few days I noticed my skin actually looked better! I highly recommend this face cream.</li>
            <li> I picked this up at Sally&#x27;s for the texture - I needed a cream for night and I prefer a thick one, specifically for forehead lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it on and it immediately dulled the lines on my forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went back the next day to get the day cream with SPF. My skin looks amazing already.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Retinol night cream for a few weeks and I really like it, my skin looks better, more elastic and soft. The smell is a little strong but not bad and my skin absorbs it very easily. Right after you apply it you touch your face and neck and it&#x27;s not grease it feels soft and dry.</li>
            <li> Over the past year, things such as benzyl peroxide and salicilic acid have not been clearing up my skin from breakouts (I am 22 and still have pretty bad acne).  I used a correction moisturizer for awhile that came in an acne kit and noticed that did more than anything and its big claimed ingredient was retinol.  I then decided to look for retinol lotions to help my skin.  In less than a week of using this cream (in the morning and night), my face is almost clear and I truely believe it will be totally clear within the month!  It is truly an amazing cream.  It is a small container but it will definitely last a long time.      Ps.  I did not actually buy this product from amazon but found it at Marshalls in the beauty section for only 9.99!! :) great deal!</li>
            <li> I have used this \\&quot;type\\&quot; of cream for over twenty years.  However, this particular brand of cream is the real deal! Hard to find great quality, such as this!  I am 68, do not have crows feet, forehead lines or neck issues.  I was happy to see they have an eye cream as well.  Get it, use it every night, you will see  a huge difference in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Does  nothing needs more retinol in it.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine gave this to me after she had an allergy to it.  Before this, at 26 y.o., I never used a night cream!  Although I don&#x27;t have issues with my skin (even tone, limited blemishes, etc.), I found that it made my skin much smoother.  It is now a nightly ritual for me!</li>
            <li> Did no help my wrinkles</li>
            <li> I have not used this product but had to give a rating. Since the ingredients aren&#x27;t given on this site, I had to go to Salley Beauty Supply to check out and unfortunately it does contains parabens. If you have a Salley&#x27;s near by it is cheaper there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this every night for 6 months now, and my skin is softer, firmer, and all my dark spots (from sun exposure and aging) are gone. I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I use it on my face and hands.</li>
            <li> i bought this about a month ago along with the retinol day cream and the lines skin brightener. i really like this cream i like it better than the other two. i put it on and in the morning my skin looks nourished and silky.i really like the texture of my skin now. i am a little shiny though but it doesn&#x27;t matter much since its for night. the smell is mild. i don&#x27;t see how it couldn&#x27;t be bearable. concerning acne i don&#x27;t think it does much. i have moderate acne and when i first started using this i still had brakouts. its a good cream but i still have to use my acne products. i have been using a 10 percent sulfur ointment cream with this and my acne is much better. i used to get around 3 or 4 pimples a day and now i get maybe a couple a week. i think the night cream and the rest of the product line help with that to. i would recommend this. i have reviewed the other two retinol products i have mentioned if you would like to see but I&#x27;m not too in love with them. i know sometimes when i read reviews people say that they have better success with another product but they don&#x27;t mention the name so I&#x27;m putting the link to the sulfur ointment and i hope you get the results you want with it. good luck.  http://www.amazon.com/Pomada-De-Ointment-La-Cruz/dp/B00411B4CC/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?s&#x3D;beauty&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1336860945&amp;sr&#x3D;1-1</li>
            <li> helps keep time from putting more damage to my face,use it night and day,but a thin layer,or it causes pimples on this 50+ face</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even think you need to have sensitive skin to not want to use this product.  It is SO heavily perfumed that it just turned my stomach.  I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s necessary to do that to a face cream -what&#x27;s the point?  I returned the product and Amazon was great about it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a day/night facial cream that would work for my dry/discoloration prone type of skin without any success. I&#x27;ve try Shiseido, Estee Lauder, Lancome, Elizabeth Arden, you name it... After reading good reviews at Sally&#x27;s website I decided to try both day and night cream and let me tell you, I couldn&#x27;t be more happy about my decision. My skin is glowing... no visible pores, no redness, no visible dark spots. Cream seems to be heavy texture but in fact feels great once absorbed by your skin. It kind of have a \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; \\&quot;dollar store-ish\\&quot; scent but trust me won´t last long enough to bother you.  I guess I&#x27;m another happy customer, no more expensive creams, no more trips to Macy&#x27;s comestic department, I found my product!</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for almost 6 mos. &amp; I love it. It is&lt;br /&gt;not greasy feel good on m sin &amp; reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. It&#x27;s a cream like every other. I&#x27;m not sure what good it&#x27;s been doing. The fragrance is nice.</li>
            <li> This cream is very moisturizing, both the day cream and the night cream.  Keeps my skin moist and really do not need to use foundation.</li>
            <li> Very godd product. It met my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent quality.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery Washington satisfactory.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend This product 100%.&lt;br /&gt;Considers it in my upcoming purchases.</li>
            <li> Exceptional without the high price.  Meets the ingridents that my dermatologist said were the really only have to for great skin, and she was correct.</li>
            <li> This is everything I had hoped for. It is not oily and you don&#x27;t need a lot so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> The cream is thick so it makes me feel like I am getting a lot of moisture. It smells good too. Haven&#x27;t noticed a difference but it does make my face feel smoother.</li>
            <li> I use this in conjunction with Retinol-X.Would not be without either of them now.I put this on b4 bed,and my face is still soft,smooth and hydrated in the morning.LOVE it!!</li>
            <li> I was really hoping this cream would work for me, but it made me breakout. It would probably work for those with skin not prone to breakouts since it is a pretty heavy cream with a strong perfume. Can&#x27;t speak on the benefits of the retinol because of the breakouts my skin feels bumpy and looks irritated.</li>
            <li> I picked this up on sale at TJ Maxx, thinking it probably wouldn&#x27;t make a difference in my skin. I&#x27;ve tried other products and have always been disappointed. This stuff is awesome! I began using it at night only, but have been using it morning and night for a couple months now, and my skin has not looked this good in a long time. I&#x27;m 53 and have few wrinkles. What I like about my skin now is it looks so clear and luminescent. It is soft, smooth, firm and nicely hydrated. My skin tends to get dry in the winter and I&#x27;ve not had any problems with it since I&#x27;ve been using this. I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a really fantastic product and is a good price -very pleased!&lt;br /&gt;That is why I gave it 5 stars!</li>
            <li> Really smoothes out fine lines and wrinkles.Smell is not that bad especially if you put on at night. My go to cream.</li>
            <li> I like this product. I gave it three stars because when I got it in the mail I realized that I had used this brand before. In fact my last night cream was this exact brand. I gave it 3 stars because I bought my last jar of this night cream at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply for 10 bucks and it is the same Retinol cream!  Only difference was my Sally&#x27;s jar was 2.25 Oz for $10 and this one was $17 for 1.7oz. Hmmm... You might want to make a trip to Sally&#x27;s before you buy this online.</li>
            <li> I had been using Retinol-X for about a year and really liked it.  But then I couldn&#x27;t find it so I bought this at Ulta and WOW I am happy I had to give something else a try! My skin is really soft and moisturized.  The lines on my forehead are completely gone.  Everything is tightened and I have much more even toned skin.  I think the best part is that it actually looks &#x27;dewey&#x27; and healthy.  I liked it so much that I am now trying the daytime serum as well.  This is a great product and can save you hundreds of dollars a year over the expensive department store brands! Definitely a keeper!</li>
            <li> its a very nice smelling retinol cream. My experience with retinol creams has been the not so pleasant smell. So the fact that this one is so nice smelling makes me wonder how much concentration of retina A it contains. I believe one of the reviewers had given some scientific evidence about it being v low concentration. That is my only issue with it. I havent been using long so not sure how effective it will bein the long run. but so far so good</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by my dermatologist to hydrate my skin, minimize my pores and breakouts, and fade acne scars. After the initial 4 days my face has cleared up tremendously. All of my breakouts have cleared up and I have significant improvement of my acne scars. I have extremely sensitive skin and struggle with eczema during the fall and winter months. My skin truly looks fantastic and I, too, have received unsolicited compliments from family, friends, and co-workers.  Definitely give the product a try! I plan to check out the Cleansing Cream and Day Cream with SPF 20 next.</li>
            <li> While I like the results, I won&#x27;t buy this product again because it smells terrible for about the first hour it is on your face. The other problem is that it is so thick, it feels like axel grease.  Sorry - not loving it.</li>
            <li> The smell of the cream was unbearable.</li>
            <li> I just started using the product so far so good hopefully the results will be great and no breakouts as of yet I&#x27;m on week two</li>
            <li> Best retinol product I ever used. Helps my skin stay smooth, hydrated and clear. very good pricing for such high quality product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this at night (and their day version during the day), and within 2 weeks I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin looks and feels more firm! I&#x27;m very impressed by the results, especially for how reasonably priced they are compared to most other Retinol creams.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous(&amp;costly) moisturizers...this is by far the best! I use it morning and night as I have dry skin.</li>
            <li> I like this cream  not sure it works like i expected I dont care for perfume smell</li>
            <li> Broke my face out with bumps. Waste of money !!</li>
            <li> Have not had an opportunity to use this product yet...and am hesitant to do so.&lt;br /&gt;The product packaging was damaged and scotch taped to keep the night cream from falling out. Someone thought it was then okay to put this in a shipping box and ship it out as new.  Since the integrity of the packaging was compromised, I question whether or not the product itself has been tampered with.</li>
            <li> I ordered this looking for an alternative to my expensive 4% retinol Cosmedix Refine.  This is a heavy cream with a strong smell which would be OK with me if it were 4% retinol at this price.  Initially my skin looked nice and soft in the morning with no redness.  Since I have used retinol for a long time, redness doesn&#x27;t usually happen on my face but my neck will show irritation.  So I didn&#x27;t know if 1)  my skin looked nice because of the plumping effect of a heavy cream and/or 2) there was no irritation because the cream was soothing.  I thought I would try for a full month to see what happend.  I received an inquiry after my review of [[ASIN:B0069YCYB4 COQ10, Hyaluronic Acid, Matrixyl 3000 and Argireline Cell Repair Concentrate Serum..Boost Collagen, Repair Cells, Tighten and Smooth Wrinkles]] so decided to do some research.  I was very leary when I couldn&#x27;t find anything about their company.  Their website is strictly a selling site but it does have a \\&quot;contact us\\&quot; feature.  So I sent an email asking if it was 400,000 IU in the 1.7 oz jar or 400,000 IU per gram (which is a 4% retinol solution).  They responded quickly and said it was 400,000 IU in the jar.  Which works out to something like a 2% retinol solution.  Which isn&#x27;t bad for a mild retinol solution but not when it is so smelly.  For a mild product I would stick with [[ASIN:B004YWS430 Watts Beauty Retinol Face Cream 1.5% or 150,000 IU Per Oz / 2oz with Treatment Pump]] So I bit the bullet and order my usual 2 times stronger Cosmedix.  Glad I didn&#x27;t wait a full month.  Lesson- if it doesn&#x27;t say 4%, 400,000 IU is meaningless.</li>
            <li> This product has made me break out really bad, so I haven&#x27;t been able to use it.  Hasn&#x27;t been a good fit for me.</li>
            <li> great leaves skin smooth.  price is right.  I have also used this as a day moisturizer but think it works best at night.,</li>
            <li> The Skincare Cosmetics products work and are THE best Retinol Products on the market.  Don&#x27;t be fooled by paying higher prices.  Check out these products against the pricer ones - do they tell you how much Vitamin A is in them - usually not.  They state vague numbers such as .05% - really that is worthless.</li>
            <li> Allergic to this product and haven&#x27;t been able to reach the seller to see if I can return and get a refund. It caused burning, itching and dry peeling skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before. The quality is excellent and because it absorbs quickly it can be used in the day time under makeup.</li>
            <li> I use a full regimen of these products.  My favorites are the night cream and the serum.  I don&#x27;t like the day cream as much because of the SPF, but I suppose that&#x27;s necessary.  Bottom line, everyone thinks I&#x27;m much younger than I am.</li>
            <li> The BEST ...Skin care...Skincare LdeL Cosmetics Retinol Night Cream, 1.7-Ounce Jar....Highly recommend it soaks in nit greasy and reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I think it is a good product and I like what I see.</li>
            <li> i have no issues with this cream. like the fact its a good sized jar.. anything as far as i&#x27;m concerned that has retinonal is good. I have no complaints. Shipping was fast, packaged good..</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good anti-aging facial cream with retinol in it...this night cream is just what I was looking for.  It goes on smooth and creamy but not too thick and not greasy.  Smells great and keeps my skin really soft.  Seems to soften fine my fine lines.  I will continue to use it and see what happens....</li>
            <li> This cream really keeps my skin soft, but you really need to rub it in well, and you have to change your pillow case frequently.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a rich cream.  Not watery at all.  Smells nice.  Came on time in good packaging.  Due to the time required to see results from retinoic acid, I can only hope it works.</li>
            <li> I would say that the cream is for extremely dry skin Soooooo oily Not bad for winter thought when the heaters are on</li>
            <li> I initially received this as a sample in the Retinol eye gel from this brand that I use both night and day. The scent everyone comments on smells EXACTLY like Estée Lauder&#x27;s White Linen perfume. It really doesn&#x27;t bother me since I like that smell. The cream itself is white, thick consistently, and absorbs nicely into the skin. I dont recommend this for the eye area since it is very rich. Might cause Milia like I got from a thick cream. Go for the gel for the eye area. I don&#x27;t have wrinkles, but I do fine lines that disappear with consistent use. I use this with the Neutrogena at home microdermabrasion system (2x week dermabrasion) and my skin glows. I love this so much I need to go back to Sally&#x27;s to get the day cream, which I have yet to try. Get past the perfume scent and I think you&#x27;ll be really pleased.</li>
            <li> This cream made my skin break out, so I had to stop using it after a few days. My skin is sensitive to break outs, so if you do not get acne easily, then you should be fine.</li>
            <li> This retinol go&#x27;s a long ways toward my goal of keep the wrinkles that are present from getting any deeper.  I also like the smell of it.  I use to use to large pea size of another brand.  This takes just one large pea size for my face &amp; neck.  My skin is sensitive &amp; this product doesn&#x27;t cause any burning like some can.  I am able to use it each night.</li>
            <li> My skin feels refreshed and looks healthy. I will continue to use this product for the next several months and see how much more clear and healthy my skin becomes.</li>
            <li> received quickly and as described</li>
            <li> i love this as a part of my night time skin care routine, it is not too heavy at all and i really like the improvements in my skin, the smell of it could use improvement but thats my only complaint</li>
            <li> My favorite product for vitamin A and worth the price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this night cream for almost a year, and have saved several dollars a jar by purchasing it on Amazon (and free shipping with PRIME!)  The cream is the best of the varied OTC brands I&#x27;ve tried and I have noticed a positive difference in the pores on my face, as well the &amp;#34;age&amp;#34; lines around my mouth.  It is not a cure by any means, but it has helped significantly to moisturize my face, and it has reduced the pores and lines enough that I will continue to use it.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I had never tried this before, but after several days I could tell a big difference in my skin. My skim is very smooth and my wrinkles have dimmed. Thank you for carrying such a good moisture cream.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it more, I should say, but I also see that it actually does work, as a couple of age spots on my hands have decreased significantly.  One of my sisters told me about this product, and she says it is wonderful too.  She&#x27;s been using it for at least a year now, and loves it.  It was great to see it available on Amazon, as it&#x27;s several dollars less than one of the local &amp;#34;beauty&amp;#34; stores in our area.  Go AMAZON!!!</li>
            <li> It is a good product, but I now use a natural &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; night cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m assuming this stuff does what it says it does.  All I know is that I have to scrub a thin layer of skin off my face in the morning or the next day leaving it and my throat feeling just as soft as can be.  I don&#x27;t find it harsh and even use a vitamin C serum in the day.  It is very thick so a little goes a long ways!  I find that this company puts its efforts in its product and not marketing and fancy packaging.  Definitely one of my favorite products.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 5 years now. I have tried a lot of other night creams and this is my favorite. I stopped using it for a short time because it was back ordered by the manufacturer. During that time my skin broke out and just didn&#x27;t look as well as it does when I use this cream. I am 49 and have very few wrinkles and want to keep it that way!!! That was the main reason I purchased the cream to begin with. The cream is thick and has a perfume type smell ( I do wish they offered a non scented). The smell does seem to go away not too long after applying it. I use it after I shower and when I apply it I do feel a slight tingle (goes away very quickly) But, this cream leaves your skin feeling smooth and hydrated. I use to occasionally have hormonal type break outs on my face and I do not have them when using this cream. I also love their day time cream which has sunscreen in it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always skeptical of products like this, but I purchased one jar after finding it had an amount of retinol that, reportedly, would actually make a difference. I&#x27;ve since purchased two more jars--that&#x27;s how much I like it. There was a noticeable difference in my pore size as well as the firmness of my skin, and it really did seem to erase the very fine lines that were beginning to form. I had a little redness/slight tingling when I first started using it (just for a few minutes after putting it on), but my skin quickly adjusted to the new product. Would definitely recommend this for young adults and up--remember it&#x27;s much easier to KEEP your skin looking and feeling young than it is to get it BACK to that state.</li>
            <li> This is just alright.. honestly there are better products out there.. does not seem to have much effect in skin appearance. would not buy again.</li>
            <li> This product works better than any of the others that I have tried. I used to use meaningful beauty, this products rocks over meaningful beauty.</li>
