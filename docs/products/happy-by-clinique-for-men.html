            <li>It arrived  fast still smell great and ladies love it .I should have got the gift set instead of this one.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite colognes that I wear.</li>
            <li>did a great job getting me my product and keeping me informed on its arvial thanks</li>
            <li>There are MANY others as well.</li>
            <li>love the smell ......</li>
            <li>I bought this based off the many 5 star reviews and, I have to admit</li>
            <li>This is great for being around people so, you smell clean, fresh and are pleasing to be around, not over powering.</li>
            <li>Its not too strong and has a good fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>its real light and sweet.</li>
            <li>Upon initial application, it smells wonderful - the citrus is very light and sweet.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft and smells great.  </li>
            <li>It is fruity and clean with a strong tone so its perfect for daily use.</li>
            <li>Fast and efficent and good prices for a wondeful product that has never gone out of style.</li>
            <li>Very fresh, refreshing, tangy and musculine smell.</li>
            <li>Easy on the senses.</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re going to spend this much on a clean scent, you&#x27;d be better off trying R DeCappucci, Vetiver, Aqua Di Silva, Gendarme, or Terre D&#x27;Hermes.</li>
            <li>I looove this scent its nice abd fresh, perfect for everyday use.</li>
            <li>Satisfied very much so!</li>
            <li>Countless women have complimented me when I wear Happy.</li>
            <li>This cologne smells clean and not too strong.</li>
            <li>The scent is very fresh with a hint of citrus.</li>
            <li>unique smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clean and fresh and a great simple fragrance to have on hand.</li>
            <li>Great scent, just as expected.</li>
            <li>clean fresh scent</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>I recomend this buyer it is quick and responsable and the thing a bought</li>
            <li>But sniff quickly - it begins to fade to nothingness quickly.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend using Happy in the Spring/Summer seasons as the scent is heavily citrus-based.</li>
            <li>There are far better scents available for the same price, or up to $5 more.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much</li>
            <li>exactly what i was looking for.</li>
            <li>The price was much better than I could get it anywhere locally.  </li>
            <li>Prepare yourself for compliments ;)</li>
            <li>This cologne is just ok because the smell is very generic.</li>
            <li>First, let me say that the fragrance itself is not repulsive or too feminine.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery!</li>
            <li>I love this cologne, as it&#x27;s not overpowering and generic - it has a lighter sweeter scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, fresh and very citrusy despite it not smelling natural</li>
            <li>for the cologne, I think it is a great, subtle fragrance for men and one of the reasons I keep using it</li>
            <li>This is a very pleasing scent that does last most of the day.</li>
            <li>I smell a lot of tangerine and green base,it&#x27;s very refreshing.</li>
            <li>It is strong enough.</li>
            <li>It is not too strong, nor is it weak,  but overall,  it&#x27;s a great scent.</li>
            <li>we bought this from Amazon because all of the other stores were too much money for smaller bottles, so when we discovered a bigger bottle for a better price and it smells good.</li>
            <li>For real</li>
            <li>This is a very uplifting fragrance that&#x27;s very orangey.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already gone through my first bottle and will definitely buy another right away.</li>
            <li>My favorite part is that it is not common for other men to where it so, people always ask what it is?........</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend the product to anyone who like fruity type smells.</li>
            <li>, I just have to put on a little more then normal</li>
            <li>Smells great, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this cologne.</li>
            <li>(Which isn&#x27;t really a big deal since natural does not equal better).</li>
            <li>should really consider making a loner lasting EdP version of this - I would certainly consider getting a bottle of that.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely NOT musky and has a light citrus scent that isn&#x27;t offensive (and I don&#x27;t smell it on myself hours later).</li>
            <li>This is the kind of cologne that you can have for an entire life is big and you just need to spray a little bit and is on you for a whole day.</li>
            <li>not heavy.</li>
            <li>Even Cool Water which is far above this product, costs less.</li>
            <li>The scent is not heavy and lasts a long while.  </li>
            <li>There are at least 25 colognes with a similar clean scent.</li>
            <li>Stupid name but great cologne.</li>

            <li> Have been using it a long time.</li>
            <li> I got this as a christmas to gift and sad to say he already has a full bottle.</li>
            <li> I typically keep the larger sized bottle at home and the 1.7 oz.</li>
            <li> it is as expected buy a recomend them</li>
            <li> On time and what I expected.</li>
            <li> It is extremely affordable in comparison to designer colognes and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I saved a few bucks over what I would have spent at the mall AND never had to drive up there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sillage and longevity is average or less but this is something I can see myself wearing a lot during the summer,or just a day when i may need a little \\&quot;pick me up\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I wear it everyday for work and it lasts all day</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cologne for quite a few years.  </li>
            <li> My husband is not pleased with this smell...</li>
            <li> Little did I know returns were not available :(</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m a little disappointed.  </li>
            <li> It does have a orange/citrus scent, not at all unpleasant.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> exactly what i was looking for. clean fresh scent</li>
            <li> smells like a dream. Every girl will fall in love with you. They should guarantee that.. just a thought. For real</li>
            <li> The price was much better than I could get it anywhere locally.  The scent is not heavy and lasts a long while.  The scent is very fresh with a hint of citrus.</li>
            <li> I recomend this buyer it is quick and responsable and the thing a bought it is as expected buy a recomend them</li>
            <li> I have used Clinique Happy for Men for almost 14 years now. This is my staple, go-to cologne. It is extremely affordable in comparison to designer colognes and a little goes a long way. I would recommend using Happy in the Spring/Summer seasons as the scent is heavily citrus-based. I prefer a &#x27;darker&#x27; scented cologne in the Fall/Winter seasons (Burberry Touch, Ralph Lauren Romance, etc.) I typically keep the larger sized bottle at home and the 1.7 oz. in my desk. Countless women have complimented me when I wear Happy. Great gift for any guy who likes to smell great.</li>
            <li> Great price, quick shipping, &amp; I love the cologne.</li>
            <li> This cologne smells clean and not too strong. I wear it everyday for work and it lasts all day, I can still smell it after playing football.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely buy this cologne again.</li>
            <li> smells like heaven &amp; sex.</li>
            <li> Some cologne you cant wash off. Happy does not ware on you with its scent. It is strong enough. You dont smell it in a room like some cologne that knocks the paint off the walls, men know what I am talking about. Have been using it a long time.</li>
            <li> we bought this from Amazon because all of the other stores were too much money for smaller bottles, so when we discovered a bigger bottle for a better price and it smells good.</li>
            <li> This is a very pleasing scent that does last most of the day. It is fruity and clean with a strong tone so its perfect for daily use. This is great for being around people so, you smell clean, fresh and are pleasing to be around, not over powering. My favorite part is that it is not common for other men to where it so, people always ask what it is?........It&#x27;s Happy!!</li>
            <li> This is a very uplifting fragrance that&#x27;s very orangey. I smell a lot of tangerine and green base,it&#x27;s very refreshing. I stumbled on it years ago @ Belk and couldnt wait to make it part of my colonge collection. It&#x27;s light, fresh and very citrusy despite it not smelling natural (Which isn&#x27;t really a big deal since natural does not equal better). Sillage and longevity is average or less but this is something I can see myself wearing a lot during the summer,or just a day when i may need a little \\&quot;pick me up\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I just love this cologne. its very refreshing and not to over powefull when it come to the smell.  ~G.Jermaine</li>
            <li> This was the first time I have purchased Happy for men... Smells so good on him and he likes it too!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best fragrances that has come in a while.Very fresh, refreshing, tangy and musculine smell. Easy on the senses.Highly recommended. It has even generated imitations by big names like Boss !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this cologne for years now and still takes the cake. The ladies, love it. Clinique Happy all day.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing ! Would buy Another bottle! Great lady pickeruper! Satisfied very much so! Recommended for any one else that likes to smell good!</li>
            <li> Smells great, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this cologne. I always hit the double pits to chesty before I get my day started. Prepare yourself for compliments ;)</li>
            <li> This is a great addition for Spring and Summer.  It&#x27;s clean and fresh and a great simple fragrance to have on hand.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say much besides being a great smelling item! The product was in great shape and authentic Clinque.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance, nice and mild but stands out,</li>
            <li> I like the way it smells.  Its not too strong and has a good fresh scent.  Good Stuff.</li>
            <li> I chose a five star rating because of the great smell. I would highly recommend the product to anyone who like fruity type smells.</li>
            <li> It arrived  fast still smell great and ladies love it .I should have got the gift set instead of this one.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite colognes that I wear. It&#x27;s very soft and smells great.  I bought this as a gift for my fiance and he loves it.</li>
            <li> I love happy by Clinique Amazon did a great job getting me my product and keeping me informed on its arvial thanks</li>
            <li> This is a 5 star scent, but it gets 1 star for longevity.  Upon initial application, it smells wonderful - the citrus is very light and sweet.  But sniff quickly - it begins to fade to nothingness quickly.  If you want a fruity citrus scent to last for a while, look elsewhere (Chanel, Hermes, etc.).  But for the short while it lasts, it is quite nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clinique should really consider making a loner lasting EdP version of this - I would certainly consider getting a bottle of that.  But this one, while I dont regret owning it, I would not re-purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cologne for quite a few years.  When I was running out of my last one and dreaded the thought of going to the local mall to buy at the fragrance counter, I thought why not check out Amazon.  I saved a few bucks over what I would have spent at the mall AND never had to drive up there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the cologne, I think it is a great, subtle fragrance for men and one of the reasons I keep using it is that I often am told by women that they like the fragrance.  It&#x27;s definitely NOT musky and has a light citrus scent that isn&#x27;t offensive (and I don&#x27;t smell it on myself hours later).</li>
            <li> This smells great and good price on here</li>
            <li> I still get compliments from the ladies when I wear this. I dont care for fads or the latest/newest fragrance, I love Happy.</li>
            <li> On time and what I expected.</li>
            <li> This cologne is just ok because the smell is very generic. There are at least 25 colognes with a similar clean scent. The problem with this product also lies with it&#x27;s price. This cologne is way overpriced for what it is. There are far better scents available for the same price, or up to $5 more. Even Cool Water which is far above this product, costs less. The people at Clinique are known for their skin products which are top-notch. But in the cologne market, they are not competitively priced to sell a lot of this scent. They probably don&#x27;t care because their meat and potatoes are the skin products they sell. But if you&#x27;re going to spend this much on a clean scent, you&#x27;d be better off trying R DeCappucci, Vetiver, Aqua Di Silva, Gendarme, or Terre D&#x27;Hermes. There are MANY others as well.</li>
            <li> Happy is to Women as Blood in the water is to a great white shark - buy some condoms</li>
            <li> love the smell ...... product as described!</li>
            <li> Stupid name but great cologne. It&#x27;s fresh and clean. I&#x27;ve already gone through my first bottle and will definitely buy another right away.</li>
            <li> I bought this based off the many 5 star reviews and, I have to admit, I&#x27;m a little disappointed.  First, let me say that the fragrance itself is not repulsive or too feminine.  It does have a orange/citrus scent, not at all unpleasant. It just isn&#x27;t what I (and my wife) like.  Also, the scent does not seem to last as long as I would like/expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ve learned my lesson on purchasing cologne off the Internet when I haven&#x27;t tested it in person prior.  Also, this cologne may be just perfect for someone else - it just doesn&#x27;t suit my taste.</li>
            <li> Great price! Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> I love this cologne, as it&#x27;s not overpowering and generic - it has a lighter sweeter scent. Works for me.</li>
            <li> the smell is just not as strong as the retail version of happy. I like it, I just have to put on a little more then normal</li>
            <li> Great scent, just as expected.</li>
            <li> I got this as a christmas to gift and sad to say he already has a full bottle. Little did I know returns were not available :( so im stuck with a bottle of men&#x27;s colgane that I can&#x27;t use.</li>
