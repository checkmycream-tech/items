            <li>it&#x27;s amazing one thing that bummed me out</li>
            <li>and i can honestly compare this range to the Clinique or Mac &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34; range of lipsticks, which run from $15-$45.&lt;br /&gt;i</li>
            <li>I love this color-it&#x27;s brighter than I anticipated, but in a good way.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s a nice matte...</li>
            <li>(that&#x27;s what I did, thinking I would purchase higher-end versions if I liked the color, and I ended up keeping and using all of them since they are so good!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It goes on nice and it gives you that matte look.</li>

            <li>Super pigmented and great product for the price.</li>

            <li>Its a great color, last for hours, doesnt bleed, goes on smooth, and you cant beat the price!!!</li>
            <li>This was a very nice lipstick and it came very fast.</li>
            <li>this color is bold and bright.</li>
            <li>and I love the color and how it looks on me; this is a beautiful bright red</li>
            <li>It glides on perfectly and is a super bright red</li>
            <li>Fairly pleased with megalast.</li>
            <li>glad I purchased this lipstick</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>was taken aback by the ammount in the tube, i turned out the tube when i recieved it and it was about an inch and a quarter of lipstick, and its a thinner stick than most.</li>
            <li>anyone from the Swamp Family :).</li>
            <li>I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT IT...</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT .</li>
            <li>Love the color</li>
            <li>Love this lipstick.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li>I love the color this gives.</li>
            <li>After searching for the perfect red lipstick, I finally came across this one, and it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li>I will most definitely buy this again ♥.</li>
            <li>This red shade is flawless.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Completely love it</li>
            <li>Love it lots of compliments</li>
            <li>I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>My husband even thought it was sexy.</li>
            <li>I wish I&#x27;d gotten more colors of this while it was a buck.</li>
            <li>I do need to add a another lipstick on top because it shows every line on your lips.</li>
            <li>Love the color on my lips</li>
            <li>I love this lipstick</li>
            <li>Great color, amazing lasting results.</li>
            <li>The price was low for a very good product.</li>
            <li>The result is a beautiful warm, true red</li>
            <li>Smears easily</li>
            <li>It does come off easily, which is a pro for me but may be a con for others.</li>
            <li>It arrived very quickly as well.</li>
            <li>It can get all over hands and smudges easily.</li>
            <li>One coat will just come off easily so you have to dab some off with a paper napkin, reapply, dab a bit and let it set.</li>
            <li>I also suggest using a liner first so that you get nice lip with no smudges.</li>
            <li>Smears easily - which is precisely what I did not want.</li>
            <li>but this is still pretty ok :)</li>
            <li>So inexpensive and free shipping..</li>
            <li>I would definitely say this would be great for a Bunny Meyer fan--</li>
            <li>, it would have been a fantastic colour.</li>
            <li>but I bought it really cheap</li>
            <li>Does not glide on smoothly, and does not blend well with my liner.</li>
            <li>The packaging was great but the lipstick was a bit crooked.</li>
            <li>Makes me look like snow white lol.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so cheap that you have nothing to lose.</li>
            <li>The spotlight red is beautiful and looks like the bright rich red color that we see celebrities wearing.</li>
            <li>Its so nice to be able to buy something you can actually afford and its not crap.</li>
            <li>After reading reviews for this one i was excited, however my excitement was met with dissatisfaction.  </li>
            <li>Its better than the higher end lipsticks.</li>
            <li>Nice color pigment and leaves nice stain but applies very dry.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok not the best the color is kina orange for me dpesnt last long at all</li>
            <li>I feel like wearing it right now!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for my super pale skin!</li>
            <li>I ate dinner and a bunch of candy at a movie and when I got back, six or seven hours after applying the lipstick, it was still completely bright and hadn&#x27;t smudged-</li>
            <li>This lipstick is true to color.</li>
            <li>Got this to see a good shade of red.</li>
            <li>I find that this lovely shade is very matte, almost a stain on the lips.</li>
            <li>NOT BAD</li>
            <li>so I rarely use a lip liner for this, I just carry a compact mirror and give my lips a quick check after eating, and use my pinky to smooth away any feathering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I finally found a perfect red!</li>
            <li>shipped quickly...</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s definitely good for a long night that you won&#x27;t get a chance to be fixing your makeup a lot.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite color.</li>
            <li>the only thing is that its pretty bright.</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping, Bright Red &amp; Stays On!</li>
            <li>Not that bright as expected.</li>
            <li>I am sure if it wasn&#x27;t stuck up inside the clear cover</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s blue based which really makes it a perfect pin-up Hollywood red.</li>
            <li>I love Wt and Wild lipstick.</li>
            <li>Still worth it at this price.</li>
            <li>, it went right on without a problem.</li>
            <li>Working on new tricks to prevent how easy it is transferred.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and the color is vibrant.</li>
            <li>Bright red with cool blue undertones,  it works greatly for my pale skin.</li>
            <li>6 days FREE shipping from California to New York?</li>
            <li>The color is super pigmented which means that just one coat covers the whole lip.</li>
            <li>A very in your face kind of red.</li>
            <li>It does not dry out my lips and does not feel sticky, like many drugstore lip colors can.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s true, because I don&#x27;t have them side by side to compare, but I can tell you that this is a gorgeous, creamy, opaque, red with a blue undertone.</li>
            <li>My sister in law loves it very much</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I am an avid user of higher end cosmetic brands</li>
            <li>and I will definitely order more when I run out.</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore this lipstick!</li>
            <li>Overall it was and okay product.</li>
            <li>so I always have to apply lip balm first which I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li>i think a darker red wouldve been better</li>
            <li>I was so surprised since its so cheap.</li>
            <li>LOVE this red!  </li>
            <li>Lasts greater than four hrs for only $2 at the pharmacy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a more blue-toned red</li>
            <li>I love this red lipstick.</li>
            <li>This lipstick does feather a little bit if you over-apply it, but that&#x27;s easily solved by either using a lip liner or by making sure you don&#x27;t over apply.</li>
            <li>as for the lipsticks, they are super highly pigmented.</li>
            <li>This was the first color I tried and it was so good, I went to my local drugstore and bought 6 different shades.</li>
            <li>I own about 25 red lipsticks, both drugstore and high-end, and this is my most-used and most-loved by FAR.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super bright-red, goes on smoothly, and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Its creamy and does not dry up the lip, it also applies smoothly.</li>
            <li>Quite sticky and definitely feathered around the lips, very quickly.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re new to red lipstick and maybe uncertain if you&#x27;ll look good with red lips, please give this a shot.</li>
            <li>non the less, the amount should last me the entire year, so it was an excellent buy!</li>
            <li>It must be pretty highly pigmented-</li>
            <li>The lipstick is very drying</li>
            <li>Moreover it lasts the whole day without any touch ups.</li>
            <li>I bought the doll house pink lipstick and I must say I love it.</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>SO MUCH .  </li>
            <li>Various liners give this lipstick many different, distinct looks.</li>
            <li>Guess you cant expect much for $3.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I just spent a couple bucks on it instead of trying MAC Ruby Woo, though, as it is supposed to be a dupe.  </li>
            <li>it looks more like a burgandy pink</li>
            <li>The whole lipstick fell out.</li>
            <li>The lipstick goes on really well</li>
            <li>,  i have never had that kind of experience with a wet n wild product.</li>
            <li>So if you want a true red lipstick color that is very affordable</li>
            <li>This lipstick is actually better than my other lipsticks!</li>
            <li>I am surprised it is sold so cheap, it works like a $15 -$20 big name lipstick brand.</li>
            <li>so it makes your teeth look super white.</li>
            <li>I needed a quick fix for a cheap red lipstick for a production of the little mermaid and this lipstick is very durable and lasted me the whole show, and was still on my lips after the cast party dinner.</li>
            <li>Opt for the $6 option of NYX Soft matte lip cream!!</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t the color I expected but very pretty!</li>
            <li>For a dressier look, I line with an orangy/red or golden red liner.</li>
            <li>Long lasting, lovely color.</li>
            <li>with a darker lip pencil it looks like a super classy retro red.</li>
            <li>Was looking for something like the MAC red and this is just right.</li>
            <li>I need to put Chapstick before I put it on because it is very dry its nice but not what I expected...</li>
            <li>It may last, but every time I&#x27;ve tried it (in 3-4 different colors), I can&#x27;t stand how it looks (even after applying shine and gloss over it) and wipe it off in favor of a competitor&#x27;s lipstick that applies smoothly and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>last thing is that it is more pink</li>
            <li>It goes on ok, smears everywhere, even when not touching the lips.  </li>
            <li>My lipstick came broken and I am not at all pleased!</li>
            <li>, it leaves a stain on you lips for a little while, but overall I love it</li>
            <li>It stands out without looking bright, and the color doesn&#x27;t go weird as it</li>
            <li>I have tried so many different expensive lipstick brands, these lipsticks by Wet &amp; Wild are just amazing.</li>
            <li>For daytime professional wear, I line my lips with an earthy bordeaux or plum liner.</li>
            <li>&#x27;N Wild discontinues it.</li>
            <li>It is very pigmented and lasts very long time.</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore red lipstick, and have used several brands.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the cheapest red lip I&#x27;ve ever purchased ($2-3 at most drugstores), and the lasting power is unbelievable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice lipstick don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that is is not colorstay and wipes off easily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super lazy</li>
            <li>I change my hair color frequently- from brown to red to blonde.</li>
            <li>Made a pretty big mess at my office party.</li>

            <li> anyone from the Swamp Family :).</li>
            <li> I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT IT...</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT .</li>
            <li> Love the color</li>
            <li> Love this lipstick.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li> I love the color this gives.</li>
            <li> After searching for the perfect red lipstick, I finally came across this one, and it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li> I will most definitely buy this again ♥.</li>
            <li> This red shade is flawless.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Completely love it</li>
            <li> Love it lots of compliments</li>
            <li> I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li> My husband even thought it was sexy.</li>
            <li> I wish I&#x27;d gotten more colors of this while it was a buck.</li>
            <li> I do need to add a another lipstick on top because it shows every line on your lips.</li>
            <li> Love the color on my lips</li>
            <li> I love this lipstick</li>
            <li> Great color, amazing lasting results.</li>
            <li> The price was low for a very good product.</li>
            <li> The result is a beautiful warm, true red</li>
            <li> Smears easily</li>
            <li> It does come off easily, which is a pro for me but may be a con for others.</li>
            <li> It arrived very quickly as well.</li>
            <li> It can get all over hands and smudges easily.</li>
            <li> One coat will just come off easily so you have to dab some off with a paper napkin, reapply, dab a bit and let it set.</li>
            <li> I also suggest using a liner first so that you get nice lip with no smudges.</li>
            <li> Smears easily - which is precisely what I did not want.</li>
            <li> but this is still pretty ok :)</li>
            <li> So inexpensive and free shipping..</li>
            <li> I would definitely say this would be great for a Bunny Meyer fan--</li>
            <li> , it would have been a fantastic colour.</li>
            <li> but I bought it really cheap</li>
            <li> Does not glide on smoothly, and does not blend well with my liner.</li>
            <li> The packaging was great but the lipstick was a bit crooked.</li>
            <li> Makes me look like snow white lol.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so cheap that you have nothing to lose.</li>
            <li> The spotlight red is beautiful and looks like the bright rich red color that we see celebrities wearing.</li>
            <li> Its so nice to be able to buy something you can actually afford and its not crap.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews for this one i was excited, however my excitement was met with dissatisfaction.  </li>
            <li> Its better than the higher end lipsticks.</li>
            <li> Nice color pigment and leaves nice stain but applies very dry.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok not the best the color is kina orange for me dpesnt last long at all</li>
            <li> I feel like wearing it right now!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for my super pale skin!</li>
            <li> I ate dinner and a bunch of candy at a movie and when I got back, six or seven hours after applying the lipstick, it was still completely bright and hadn&#x27;t smudged-</li>
            <li> This lipstick is true to color.</li>
            <li> Got this to see a good shade of red.</li>
            <li> I find that this lovely shade is very matte, almost a stain on the lips.</li>
            <li> NOT BAD</li>
            <li> so I rarely use a lip liner for this, I just carry a compact mirror and give my lips a quick check after eating, and use my pinky to smooth away any feathering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I finally found a perfect red!</li>
            <li> shipped quickly...</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s definitely good for a long night that you won&#x27;t get a chance to be fixing your makeup a lot.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite color.</li>
            <li> the only thing is that its pretty bright.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping, Bright Red &amp; Stays On!</li>
            <li> Not that bright as expected.</li>
            <li> I am sure if it wasn&#x27;t stuck up inside the clear cover</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s blue based which really makes it a perfect pin-up Hollywood red.</li>
            <li> I love Wt and Wild lipstick.</li>
            <li> Still worth it at this price.</li>
            <li> , it went right on without a problem.</li>
            <li> Working on new tricks to prevent how easy it is transferred.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and the color is vibrant.</li>
            <li> Bright red with cool blue undertones,  it works greatly for my pale skin.</li>
            <li> 6 days FREE shipping from California to New York?</li>
            <li> The color is super pigmented which means that just one coat covers the whole lip.</li>
            <li> A very in your face kind of red.</li>
            <li> It does not dry out my lips and does not feel sticky, like many drugstore lip colors can.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s true, because I don&#x27;t have them side by side to compare, but I can tell you that this is a gorgeous, creamy, opaque, red with a blue undertone.</li>
            <li> My sister in law loves it very much</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I am an avid user of higher end cosmetic brands</li>
            <li> and I will definitely order more when I run out.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this lipstick!</li>
            <li> Overall it was and okay product.</li>
            <li> so I always have to apply lip balm first which I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> i think a darker red wouldve been better</li>
            <li> I was so surprised since its so cheap.</li>
            <li> LOVE this red!  </li>
            <li> Lasts greater than four hrs for only $2 at the pharmacy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a more blue-toned red</li>
            <li> I love this red lipstick.</li>
            <li> This lipstick does feather a little bit if you over-apply it, but that&#x27;s easily solved by either using a lip liner or by making sure you don&#x27;t over apply.</li>
            <li> as for the lipsticks, they are super highly pigmented.</li>
            <li> This was the first color I tried and it was so good, I went to my local drugstore and bought 6 different shades.</li>
            <li> I own about 25 red lipsticks, both drugstore and high-end, and this is my most-used and most-loved by FAR.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super bright-red, goes on smoothly, and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Its creamy and does not dry up the lip, it also applies smoothly.</li>
            <li> Quite sticky and definitely feathered around the lips, very quickly.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re new to red lipstick and maybe uncertain if you&#x27;ll look good with red lips, please give this a shot.</li>
            <li> non the less, the amount should last me the entire year, so it was an excellent buy!</li>
            <li> It must be pretty highly pigmented-</li>
            <li> The lipstick is very drying</li>
            <li> Moreover it lasts the whole day without any touch ups.</li>
            <li> I bought the doll house pink lipstick and I must say I love it.</li>
            <li> THANKS</li>
            <li> SO MUCH .  </li>
            <li> Various liners give this lipstick many different, distinct looks.</li>
            <li> Guess you cant expect much for $3.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I just spent a couple bucks on it instead of trying MAC Ruby Woo, though, as it is supposed to be a dupe.  </li>
            <li> it looks more like a burgandy pink</li>
            <li> The whole lipstick fell out.</li>
            <li> The lipstick goes on really well</li>
            <li> ,  i have never had that kind of experience with a wet n wild product.</li>
            <li> So if you want a true red lipstick color that is very affordable</li>
            <li> This lipstick is actually better than my other lipsticks!</li>
            <li> I am surprised it is sold so cheap, it works like a $15 -$20 big name lipstick brand.</li>
            <li> so it makes your teeth look super white.</li>
            <li> I needed a quick fix for a cheap red lipstick for a production of the little mermaid and this lipstick is very durable and lasted me the whole show, and was still on my lips after the cast party dinner.</li>
            <li> Opt for the $6 option of NYX Soft matte lip cream!!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t the color I expected but very pretty!</li>
            <li> For a dressier look, I line with an orangy/red or golden red liner.</li>
            <li> Long lasting, lovely color.</li>
            <li> with a darker lip pencil it looks like a super classy retro red.</li>
            <li> Was looking for something like the MAC red and this is just right.</li>
            <li> I need to put Chapstick before I put it on because it is very dry its nice but not what I expected...</li>
            <li> It may last, but every time I&#x27;ve tried it (in 3-4 different colors), I can&#x27;t stand how it looks (even after applying shine and gloss over it) and wipe it off in favor of a competitor&#x27;s lipstick that applies smoothly and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> last thing is that it is more pink</li>
            <li> It goes on ok, smears everywhere, even when not touching the lips.  </li>
            <li> My lipstick came broken and I am not at all pleased!</li>
            <li> , it leaves a stain on you lips for a little while, but overall I love it</li>
            <li> It stands out without looking bright, and the color doesn&#x27;t go weird as it</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different expensive lipstick brands, these lipsticks by Wet &amp; Wild are just amazing.</li>
            <li> For daytime professional wear, I line my lips with an earthy bordeaux or plum liner.</li>
            <li> &#x27;N Wild discontinues it.</li>
            <li> It is very pigmented and lasts very long time.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore red lipstick, and have used several brands.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the cheapest red lip I&#x27;ve ever purchased ($2-3 at most drugstores), and the lasting power is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice lipstick don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that is is not colorstay and wipes off easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super lazy</li>
            <li> I change my hair color frequently- from brown to red to blonde.</li>
            <li> Made a pretty big mess at my office party.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t use Wet n Wild makeup, but I bought this lipstick when I noticed my Covergirl ones weren&#x27;t staying on very well.</li>
            <li> Question asked, How long does it last and the option I selected was It needs to be reapplied occasionally</li>
            <li> (I know that sounds cheesy, but it&#x27;s true!).</li>
            <li> This red has a creamy blue base but also, just enough orange/bronze to warm the red.</li>
            <li> It lasts all day, just as long if not LONGER than my Mac lipsticks.</li>
            <li> It smugged extremely easly and did not last long,  but it did stain my lips.  </li>
            <li> And I didn&#x27;t notice it being too dry or pasty or anything</li>
            <li> but I only select that option because the actual option was not available.  </li>
            <li> then i expected its like a pink red.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s me, but I find this lipstick to go on very dry and pasty.</li>
            <li> I have lots of red/plum but not a true red.</li>
            <li> The only con to it is that it&#x27;s a little bit hard to get completely off</li>
            <li> Once I tried it, I had to stock up on it before Wet</li>
            <li> Every time I open and close it, the cap would get messy and have lipstick all over.</li>
            <li> Have to be careful when opening and closing this.</li>
            <li> Its not at all what i expected from this lipstick</li>
            <li> Even when you eat and drink there is minimal fading.&lt;br</li>
            <li> toned down enough for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> The color comes across a little orange-ier than I expected, but once it fades a bit</li>
            <li> I am a red lipstick fanatic.</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t go wrong with Wet N Wild or NYX.</li>
            <li> Gets caught in crevices of slightly chapped lips</li>
            <li> And there&#x27;s no strong chemical smell that some other lipsticks have.</li>
            <li> I have very pale, almost translucent skin with pink undertones.</li>
            <li> This is a little drying</li>
            <li> , but beware: the rest of Wet N Wild&#x27;s lipstick lines are pretty terrible.</li>
            <li> just messy.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;d come off in less than a couple of hours, and I didn&#x27;t always have time to reapply as I was usually wearing it to work.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> The packaging was a little excessive as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This feels thick as it is applied, but it looks like you need to reapply it with in a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> The lipstick itself is hard and not at all creamy.</li>
            <li> it was hard to get off.</li>
            <li> And the price is unbelievable for the quality!</li>
            <li> issue is with how difficult it is to apply.</li>
            <li> Had to reapply up to 7 times in 8 hours, so that I didn&#x27;t look like a crazy person</li>
            <li> Although paired with a jelly gloss, the highly-pigmented color pops like crazy, making your lips a topic of conversation and admiration.</li>

            <li> This lipstick is true to color. The lipstick is very drying</li>
            <li> This was a very nice lipstick and it came very fast.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different expensive lipstick brands, these lipsticks by Wet &amp; Wild are just amazing. This was the first color I tried and it was so good, I went to my local drugstore and bought 6 different shades. I did notice that you can buy these lipsticks at a CVS for only $1.87. I cannot begin to tell you how good these lipsticks are. The color is super pigmented which means that just one coat covers the whole lip. Its creamy and does not dry up the lip, it also applies smoothly. Moreover it lasts the whole day without any touch ups. The spotlight red is beautiful and looks like the bright rich red color that we see celebrities wearing. I totally recommend this product. I am surprised it is sold so cheap, it works like a $15 -$20 big name lipstick brand.</li>
            <li> Smears easily&lt;br /&gt;But i like it&lt;br /&gt;Bright red&lt;br /&gt;Glossy&lt;br /&gt;Cutee in selfies&lt;br /&gt;^-^</li>
            <li> Love the red , very beautiful color, and the best part about it is that it&#x27;s cheap!!! So if you want a true red lipstick color that is very affordable I recommend wet n wild spotlight red !!!</li>
            <li> Fairly pleased with megalast.</li>
            <li> I bought the doll house pink lipstick and I must say I love it. It&#x27;s matte &amp; last and lasts&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I purchased this lipstick</li>
            <li> Thank you no comments</li>
            <li> The color is absolutely beautiful! It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for. It goes on smooth and the color is vibrant. It does come off easily, which is a pro for me but may be a con for others.</li>
            <li> great. just messy. get everywhere</li>
            <li> My sister in law loves it very much</li>
            <li> This is a great color! I have lots of red/plum but not a true red. Love it.  Also, Wet N Wild lipstick stays on..I do not have to reapply all the time.  So inexpensive and free shipping..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not matte but if you dab it with a tissue its a beautiful color! It&#x27;s actually shiny so I don&#x27;t know how some people said it&#x27;s so matte!</li>
            <li> So i placed my order for two lipsticks on the 16th Jan, i recieved them today, - the 22nd jan. 6 days FREE shipping from California to New York? NOT BAD AT ALL! as for the lipsticks, they are super highly pigmented. I am an avid user of higher end cosmetic brands and i can honestly compare this range to the Clinique or Mac &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34; range of lipsticks, which run from $15-$45.&lt;br /&gt;i was taken aback by the ammount in the tube, i turned out the tube when i recieved it and it was about an inch and a quarter of lipstick, and its a thinner stick than most. non the less, the amount should last me the entire year, so it was an excellent buy!</li>
            <li> Question asked, How long does it last and the option I selected was It needs to be reapplied occasionally but I only select that option because the actual option was not available.  I only have to reapply once and that&#x27;s after lunch in my 8 hour work day.</li>
            <li> Smears easily - which is precisely what I did not want.</li>
            <li> This is BRIGHT!!! I would definitely say this would be great for a Bunny Meyer fan-- anyone from the Swamp Family :). A very in your face kind of red.</li>
            <li> I GIVE THIS 5 STAR... &amp;#60;3 I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT IT... THANKS YOU SO MUCH .  I LOVE IT .</li>
            <li> Amazing! This lipstick is actually better than my other lipsticks! It&#x27;s super bright-red, goes on smoothly, and lasts a long time. And there&#x27;s no strong chemical smell that some other lipsticks have. The only con to it is that it&#x27;s a little bit hard to get completely off, it leaves a stain on you lips for a little while, but overall I love it and I will definitely order more when I run out.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s me, but I find this lipstick to go on very dry and pasty. The lipstick itself is hard and not at all creamy. It may last, but every time I&#x27;ve tried it (in 3-4 different colors), I can&#x27;t stand how it looks (even after applying shine and gloss over it) and wipe it off in favor of a competitor&#x27;s lipstick that applies smoothly and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> My lipstick came broken and I am not at all pleased! Hence the reason for the 1 star. I am sure if it wasn&#x27;t stuck up inside the clear cover and I was actually afforded the opportunity to use it, it would have been a fantastic colour.</li>
            <li> I finally found a perfect red! This red has a creamy blue base but also, just enough orange/bronze to warm the red. The result is a beautiful warm, true red that&#x27;s perfect for the holidays, evening wear, but also toned down enough for everyday wear. For daytime professional wear, I line my lips with an earthy bordeaux or plum liner. For a dressier look, I line with an orangy/red or golden red liner. Various liners give this lipstick many different, distinct looks. This is my new favorite color. After tossing tons of reds, I finally found a sinner!</li>
            <li> Cheap and a great product! Love the color</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this lipstick! It glides on perfectly and is a super bright red (: Definitely will buy again!</li>
            <li> Love this lipstick. Was looking for something like the MAC red and this is just right. Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok not the best the color is kina orange for me dpesnt last long at all but I bought it really cheap so u get what u pay for</li>
            <li> I love this color-it&#x27;s brighter than I anticipated, but in a good way. Bought this as a dupe for a pricier brand, and the color was spot-on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My issue is with how difficult it is to apply. Does not glide on smoothly, and does not blend well with my liner. Overall, fussy to apply.</li>
            <li> The lipstick is great but, the color is brighter than the picture displayed. Shipping was great. The package came the next day after ordering. The packaging was great but the lipstick was a bit crooked. Overall it was and okay product.</li>
            <li> Too pasty. Guess you cant expect much for $3.</li>
            <li> I love the color this gives. It&#x27;s perfect for my super pale skin! And I didn&#x27;t notice it being too dry or pasty or anything, it went right on without a problem.</li>
            <li> It goes on ok, smears everywhere, even when not touching the lips.  Quite sticky and definitely feathered around the lips, very quickly.  Had to reapply up to 7 times in 8 hours, so that I didn&#x27;t look like a crazy person w/ red lipstick smeared all over my face.  Boo! Opt for the $6 option of NYX Soft matte lip cream!!</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t use Wet n Wild makeup, but I bought this lipstick when I noticed my Covergirl ones weren&#x27;t staying on very well. They&#x27;d come off in less than a couple of hours, and I didn&#x27;t always have time to reapply as I was usually wearing it to work.&lt;br /&gt;This lipstick lasts all day, and looks great. You can be confident that your lips will still look gorgeous at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> After searching for the perfect red lipstick, I finally came across this one, and it&#x27;s perfect! Bright red with cool blue undertones,  it works greatly for my pale skin. Makes me look like snow white lol. It arrived very quickly as well. I will most definitely buy this again ♥.</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t go wrong with Wet N Wild or NYX. The quality is great and the price is right</li>
            <li> Does not stay on AT ALL and it does not stay red either. Made a pretty big mess at my office party. Will not purchase Wet N Wild lipsticks again.</li>
            <li> Long lasting, lovely color. I would definitely recommend to others.</li>
            <li> Great color, amazing lasting results.</li>
            <li> This red shade is flawless. Once I tried it, I had to stock up on it before Wet &#x27;N Wild discontinues it. If you are a red lipstick lover like me, give this a try! You won&#x27;t regret it (I know that sounds cheesy, but it&#x27;s true!). It&#x27;s blue based which really makes it a perfect pin-up Hollywood red. Gorgeous! I feel like wearing it right now! Lol.</li>
            <li> Super pigmented and great product for the price. This is a little drying so I always have to apply lip balm first which I don&#x27;t mind. The only thing that concerns me is the packaging, especially the cap. Every time I open and close it, the cap would get messy and have lipstick all over. Have to be careful when opening and closing this.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color, right price, and shipped quickly...I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> Nice color pigment and leaves nice stain but applies very dry. Gets caught in crevices of slightly chapped lips</li>
            <li> It can get all over hands and smudges easily. But the colour is awesome. Working on new tricks to prevent how easy it is transferred.</li>
            <li> I like how this is a matte lipstick and I love the color and how it looks on me; this is a beautiful bright red</li>
            <li> People say this looks universally good on everyone.  Guess they haven&#x27;t met me.  Eeek.  I&#x27;d never wear it in public. I&#x27;m glad I just spent a couple bucks on it instead of trying MAC Ruby Woo, though, as it is supposed to be a dupe.  It must be pretty highly pigmented-it was hard to get off.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping, Bright Red &amp; Stays On!</li>
            <li> its a really nice colot the only thing is that its pretty bright. i think a darker red wouldve been better but this is still pretty ok :)</li>
            <li> I bought this lipstick after seeing it compared to MAC Ruby Woo. It is a beautiful color that lasted all evening. Very impressed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice lipstick don&#x27;t get me wrong but when I ordered spot lightred it wasn&#x27;t red at all it looks more like a burgandy pink it&#x27;s also alittle to pasty I need to put Chapstick before I put it on because it is very dry its nice but not what I expected...</li>
            <li> I bought the spotlight red wet n wild megalast lip stick and I absolutely love it. Its a great color, last for hours, doesnt bleed, goes on smooth, and you cant beat the price!!! Great quality, Great product, especially for those of us that are on a strict budget! Its so nice to be able to buy something you can actually afford and its not crap. I would recommend and I would buy again and again.</li>
            <li> Got this to see a good shade of red. Completely love it and it&#x27;s awesome with my skin tone</li>
            <li> I have never found a red that works well with my skin tone. I have very pale, almost translucent skin with pink undertones. This lipsticks looks great. I change my hair color frequently- from brown to red to blonde. It looks great with any hair color. It does not dry out my lips and does not feel sticky, like many drugstore lip colors can. My only complaint is that is is not colorstay and wipes off easily.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore red lipstick, and have used several brands. After reading reviews for this one i was excited, however my excitement was met with dissatisfaction.  This feels thick as it is applied, but it looks like you need to reapply it with in a few minutes.  It smugged extremely easly and did not last long,  but it did stain my lips.  Its not at all what i expected from this lipstick,  i have never had that kind of experience with a wet n wild product. The packaging was a little excessive as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last thing is that it is more pink then i expected its like a pink red. Not that bright as expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s chalky and I don&#x27;t like</li>
            <li> Love it lots of compliments</li>
            <li> I love Wt and Wild lipstick. It is very pigmented and lasts very long time. I was so surprised since its so cheap. Its better than the higher end lipsticks. Will continue buying.</li>
            <li> LOVE this red!  When used with a lip pencil and a bit of powder underneath it can last all day.</li>
            <li> I bought this because people say it&#x27;s a dupe of MAC&#x27;s Russian Red. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s true, because I don&#x27;t have them side by side to compare, but I can tell you that this is a gorgeous, creamy, opaque, red with a blue undertone. It stands out without looking bright, and the color doesn&#x27;t go weird as it fades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying more of this one!</li>
            <li> This lipstick is awesome. Lasts greater than four hrs for only $2 at the pharmacy. I love mac but can&#x27;t beat great quality at that price and color payoff. Perfect red.soooooo sexy.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t the color I expected but very pretty!</li>
            <li> this color is bold and bright. it&#x27;s nice but i prefer my ruby woo over any red but this would do for my on the run days. I like it, its alright.</li>
            <li> I wanted a pop of color and I haven&#x27;t always been a big fan of lipsticks but these were a dollar on sale at my drugstore so I gave it a shot. I am so glad I did. My husband even thought it was sexy. One coat will just come off easily so you have to dab some off with a paper napkin, reapply, dab a bit and let it set. I also suggest using a liner first so that you get nice lip with no smudges. I wish I&#x27;d gotten more colors of this while it was a buck.</li>
            <li> This lipstick would be perfect if it were not so dry.&lt;br /&gt;The color is great!&lt;br /&gt;But I do need to add a another lipstick on top because it shows every line on your lips. Still worth it at this price.</li>
            <li> It broke after 3 days. The whole lipstick fell out.</li>
            <li> Love the color on my lips</li>
            <li> The color comes across a little orange-ier than I expected, but once it fades a bit it&#x27;s quite nice. The lipstick goes on really well and it stays on for ages. I ate dinner and a bunch of candy at a movie and when I got back, six or seven hours after applying the lipstick, it was still completely bright and hadn&#x27;t smudged- it kind of stains. It was even still there the next morning! So it&#x27;s definitely good for a long night that you won&#x27;t get a chance to be fixing your makeup a lot. It&#x27;s a nice matte...I&#x27;d like it a bit darker, but with a darker lip pencil it looks like a super classy retro red.</li>
            <li> I own about 25 red lipsticks, both drugstore and high-end, and this is my most-used and most-loved by FAR. It&#x27;s the cheapest red lip I&#x27;ve ever purchased ($2-3 at most drugstores), and the lasting power is unbelievable. It lasts all day, just as long if not LONGER than my Mac lipsticks. Even when you eat and drink there is minimal fading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing is that this lipstick actually stains your lips, so that even when it starts to wear away, your lips still look red. This lipstick does feather a little bit if you over-apply it, but that&#x27;s easily solved by either using a lip liner or by making sure you don&#x27;t over apply. I&#x27;m super lazy so I rarely use a lip liner for this, I just carry a compact mirror and give my lips a quick check after eating, and use my pinky to smooth away any feathering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a more blue-toned red so it makes your teeth look super white. If you&#x27;re new to red lipstick and maybe uncertain if you&#x27;ll look good with red lips, please give this a shot. It&#x27;s so cheap that you have nothing to lose. I also recommend just getting all the shades they offer in this line, so you can see what colors look good on you (that&#x27;s what I did, thinking I would purchase higher-end versions if I liked the color, and I ended up keeping and using all of them since they are so good!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, but beware: the rest of Wet N Wild&#x27;s lipstick lines are pretty terrible. I&#x27;ve tried them all and they suck, with the exception of the Megalast line, which is incredible. Stick with the Megalasts and you can&#x27;t go wrong :)</li>
            <li> I am a red lipstick fanatic. I wear a lot of vintage-inspired clothing, so red lipstick is a must-have. If it bleeds, it&#x27;s not in my make-up box. I find that this lovely shade is very matte, almost a stain on the lips. Although paired with a jelly gloss, the highly-pigmented color pops like crazy, making your lips a topic of conversation and admiration. And the price is unbelievable for the quality! Grab it up while you can! ♥</li>
            <li> I needed a quick fix for a cheap red lipstick for a production of the little mermaid and this lipstick is very durable and lasted me the whole show, and was still on my lips after the cast party dinner. For the price, this is perfect</li>
            <li> I love this red lipstick. It goes on nice and it gives you that matte look. What I especially like about this lipstick is its price. The price was low for a very good product.</li>
            <li> I love this lipstick it&#x27;s amazing one thing that bummed me out was finding it $2 cheaper at another store. As for the lipstick it looks great, stays on all day what more can you ask for.</li>
