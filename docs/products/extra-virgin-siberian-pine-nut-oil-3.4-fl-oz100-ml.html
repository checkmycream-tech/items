            <li> Was just what I expected. Wish it came I gallon size</li>
            <li> Was very disappointed</li>
            <li> It workerd for a while but then after a month it stopped working. I had to go back to Prevacid.&lt;br /&gt;Too bad. I had so much hope for this oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been taking it for a week for acid reflux (heartburn). I think it is working because after taking the oil it seems to be soothing the LES where the acid has been burning my Esophagus. It feels &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; in that area, like the oil coating is doing something. I Just hope it is healing the burned area down there where the Esophagus joins the stomach.  Will continue to use and will update if any reflux relief occurs.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the health benefits I read about drinking this oil. I found this to be the cheapest on Amazon so I went ahead and purchased. I have not used this religiously so I can not claim any personal health claim, but the oil tastes fresh, not rancid. The oil is easy to go down, pretty much tastes like other oils but very mild and smooth. This came very fast upon delivery and packaging was good. It is still a little expensive but I found none out there cheaper</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the product! I feel it was very helpful for the gastric disturbance.</li>
            <li> It was not a quick cure for ulcer symptoms.</li>
            <li> I cannot tell it helped acid reflux. It was tasteless and easy to swallow.</li>
            <li> The taste was very mild and not at all disagreeable.  It seems to be helping my digestive problems very effectively! Thank you.</li>
            <li> I found that it helps with my acid reflux.</li>
            <li> Had little or no effect.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff!  My husband has suffered from acid reflux for years.  Most nights he had to start out sleeping upright in a chair.  A nurse told him about Extra virgin pine nut oil, which was new to both of us.  Amazingly enough, it worked even the very first night.  He has had only one bad night since taking this oil, and that was after eating spicy Tex-mex for dinner.  We think this is a small miracle.</li>
            <li> It tastes just like pine nuts. It works. Will order again from this company.</li>
            <li> Love it! It feels good on the stomach. Great pine nut taste.</li>
            <li> took all my pain away</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good except no English instruction</li>
            <li> appears to work on my finacees atorphic gastritis. her symptoms are gone after using this taking one teaspoon a day for two weeks. I ordered  12 and the price was very reasonable. According to the holistic treatment sites she should take this for 6 months</li>
            <li> This is disappointing for me the quality is very nice smelling and not that bad of a taste it is mellow tasting. UnfortunatelyÂ  it makes my stomach hurt more but I am not going to give up on it. I will keep trying it but only every other day to see if maybe it could help.</li>
            <li> It was not in English where one that does not speak Russian could understand instructions!! If in America It should be  in English!!</li>
            <li> It tastes so very fresh and healthy. I loved it. And I think it helped me too. But, the bottle was very small... didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. It did not help me but because my stomach problems were different than thought. It did help out some of my other family members.</li>
            <li> Got it very fast. Great pine nut oil taste.  Expiration date is good.  My husband takes it every morning 1 tbs with a meal , or you can take  3 tsp 3x a day.  Great health benefits.  My husband takes it for his stomach acid reflux. Will buy it again</li>
