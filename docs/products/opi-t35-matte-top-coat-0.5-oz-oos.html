            <li>I love O.P.I products, and China Glaze products!</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I purchased this item!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with matte finish!</li>
            <li>This is easy to use and there are some great tutorials online, through Sephora and YouTube.  </li>
            <li>and it was amazing...</li>
            <li>I just used it and it works amazingly</li>
            <li>It is amazing.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s still amazing</li>
            <li>works amazing and turns anything into matte.</li>
            <li>Creates a nice matte effect though.</li>
            <li>The texture kind of just rubs off.  </li>
            <li>with the kind of polishes you prefer it over.  </li>
            <li>It works great and goes on nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>Just note that you can&#x27;t put a topcoat over it, but it kind of acts as a topcoat anyway.</li>
            <li>This really does a great job of mattifying!</li>
            <li>The nice matte look I was going for lasted about a day.</li>
            <li>You can honestly make any polish matte.</li>
            <li>Nice packaging and sleek look.</li>
            <li>LOOVEE i&#x27;m matteing even my own nail without polish.  </li>
            <li>I really liked how it made my nails look.</li>
            <li>and she liked it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>The matte finish is beautiful and it dries really quick.</li>
            <li>Normally it starts chipping after a day even if a use the best top coats!</li>
            <li>received my stuff super quick!!!!</li>
            <li>the surface becomes brittle and the nail color chips VERY easily.</li>
            <li>it chips very easily.</li>
            <li>Will most def order more of this when I run out!</li>
            <li>Love this top coat!</li>
            <li>Loving it my daughter&#x27;s just so love it</li>
            <li>Regardless of the kind of polish I use, when I put this top coat on, it pulls the color off my nails, &amp; then the brush gets stained.  </li>
            <li>I loved the result, even when tried on a light pastel color which lots of people say matte won&#x27;t work for.</li>
            <li>oh my gosh its go amazing and stylish</li>
            <li>This matte top coat is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>It works best with dark colors though because you can&#x27;t really tell it&#x27;s on when you put it over a bright color, but it does (surprisingly) look good with bright orange :)</li>
            <li>Love love love!</li>
            <li>Use to love shinny nails but this matte look is awesome people try it you will be surprised.  </li>
            <li>I am pretty experienced using nail polish and even worked for Ulta</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect to tone down polish that might be too bright.  </li>
            <li>I could not stop staring at my nails the first time I used it over Jade Diamond Velvet, an amazing purple duochrome that I loved without the top coat</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping will buy more thank you!!!!!!</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Toes still love lovely</li>
            <li>the whole baking soda or powder trick lol.</li>
            <li>(: so much better then</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s the best matte top coat I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s better to wipe it off.</li>
            <li>I love the way this top coat looks and haven&#x27;t had chipping problems.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Being that it is a top coat, I feel that it should stay.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Still love it though.</li>
            <li>MORE.  </li>
            <li>YES I LOVE THIS TOP COAT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I think I love even more with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it, works just as it should.</li>
            <li>Love the color of this.</li>
            <li>But I do like how the top coat turns out.  </li>
            <li>I love that I can make all my polish matte look now.</li>
            <li>Make sure you paint corectly or you will see lines</li>
            <li>There are SO many things that can be done with this topcoat.  </li>
            <li>Before this purchase I had tried home made recipes of matte top coats.</li>
            <li>Matte for sure.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this matte top coat.</li>
            <li>Love it...</li>
            <li>i noticed that removing a lot of the excess top coat from the brush caused the color to streak.</li>
            <li>Matte means matte and this top coat do what need to do in that way</li>
            <li>I get a lot of great compliments about it very often.</li>
            <li>absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>And I typically love OPI products-</li>
            <li>I must say, this polish could be better at NOT chipping.</li>
            <li>Yes, I love OPI polishes.  </li>
            <li>Plus the bottle is soo cute.</li>
            <li>I love the matte top coat it gives my nails a chalky look without dulling out the color.</li>
            <li>Love this nail polish.</li>
            <li>but then after about 12 hours or so the top coat looked as if it was rubbing off.</li>
            <li>One bit of advice is to put your top coat on before using this matte top coat encase</li>
            <li>i absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this nail polish.</li>
            <li>It just gives that sophisticated matte look.</li>
            <li>Put it on and I love it.</li>
            <li>Love the brand</li>
            <li>I will probably buy it again :)</li>
            <li>This really works great.</li>
            <li>It was a gift for my granddaughter and I am sure she will like it.  </li>
            <li>i love doing my nails</li>
            <li>this opi one probably does a better job because it dries up faster.</li>
            <li>... Love the look of matte.</li>
            <li>After 3 days there started to be some wear on my nail tips and it started looking more satin in appearance.  </li>
            <li>Overall, another great product from OPI, you won&#x27;t regret this purchase!</li>
            <li>I love this product a lot, I just wish it lasted longer.</li>
            <li>i always wanted a matte top coat</li>
            <li>The top coat makes my polish crack after two or three days.</li>
            <li>and then this matte finish top coat.</li>
            <li>Was expecting more from OPI.</li>
            <li>This matte coat is fantastic!</li>
            <li>Safely bubble wrapped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love OPI and this matte top coat</li>
            <li>then again, so are most OPI products.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with it.</li>
            <li>i love matte colors</li>
            <li>i love,</li>
            <li>lovely and works well.</li>
            <li>(one picture is after you put on the top coat and after ive worn it all day).</li>
            <li>i dont know if this requires more coats to stay matte???</li>
            <li>i would advise against wasting your money on this and buy a better product.</li>
            <li>Now I just need more colors to try it on.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if a top coat would perform as well as a matte color.</li>
            <li>Love this nail polish</li>
            <li>As a top coat it doesn&#x27;t seal in as well so becareful of water.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty nice top coat!</li>
            <li>Check them out and you will find some very sophisticated designs that are demure for the office but still artistic.</li>
            <li>Very worth it!</li>
            <li>Nice matte finish,dries quickly.</li>
            <li>The matte top coat also dries very quickly.</li>
            <li>I love the look of the matte finish, but WHOA, it chips SO easily.  </li>
            <li>however it chips easily but still looks cute.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;d look better if I were better on putting on nail polish (unsteady hands don&#x27;t help), but it looks so cool.</li>
            <li>works great and dries super fast!</li>
            <li>I found that I was able to paint over it just fine</li>
            <li>It goes on easy, dries quickly, and leaves a nice matte</li>
            <li>It is magnificent, fine as on the Picture, corresponds to the Description, fast Delivery, high Quality of a product, I am completely satisfied with Purchase</li>
            <li>The product is actually very full.</li>
            <li>I think it works wonderfully, I haven&#x27;t had any of the other problems I see people reporting.</li>
            <li>In all other cases it&#x27;s the best product ever!    </li>
            <li>very quick and easy coat, just makes it easier to chip though.</li>
            <li>I did a bunch of research on the best matte top coat and came to the conclusion, based on mattifying comparisons (this one &amp;#34;matted&amp;#34; very well, while some only to a satin or rubbery look) and price here on Amazon, I decided, heck, why not?!</li>
            <li>It look nice when you first put it on, but the matte in it goes away after a couple of days.</li>
            <li>This polish is really cool, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to work too well as a top coat.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a super fun look for all my favorite colors!</li>
            <li>It is light and dries ver easy.</li>
            <li>It works fine.  </li>
            <li>and it dries really quickly!</li>
            <li>Great for nail designs and to just do something a little more interesting with your mani.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m very satisfied with it, and it looks great over hot pink.</li>
            <li>Great for putting a twist on your current nail polished.</li>
            <li>Every matte chips after a few days, but this one is the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Bottles wrapped and packaged securely to avoid breakage.</li>
            <li>I love this product, on my last manicure we used the matte coat over an emerald color and just loved it.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Smooth to apply, quick dry, protects nail polish from chipping, it is a very good product</li>
            <li>Chips almost right away... not my favorite.</li>
            <li>I purchased 6 of these since they rock so much!!!  </li>
            <li>Who needs different colors of matte nail polish when you can do with this fantastic item!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a good matte top coat for a long time.  </li>
            <li>It dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t seem to chip easily.</li>
            <li>easy to use, dries fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>I tested it out on one of my nails and it dried quickly and was perfect!</li>
            <li>I am an avid OPI fan, so I was stoked to see a Matte Top Coat from OPI.</li>
            <li>Have fun!</li>
            <li>I included a pic of my Halloween nails because that&#x27;s what I first used the matte top coat on</li>
            <li>This is so nice to have instead of having to buy a bunch of different colors of matte, I can apply just this top coat  and any of my polishes can be matte.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to get a really chic look with this top coat.</li>
            <li>so I even know the techniques and tricks when applying special nail polishes like this one but</li>
            <li>I like how easily this top coat goes on and how fast it dries, but like others have said, it makes the paint very brittle and then it chips off very quickly.</li>
            <li>It came a day before expected delivery and works great.</li>
            <li>Definitely a cool effect for someone who isn&#x27;t a nail expert.</li>
            <li>This product held up a bit better than that, but not by much.  </li>
            <li>It is perfect but gave 3 stars since it was 2 days late.</li>
            <li>I used it to do this cool nail design.</li>
            <li>i love this product, makes my at home manicure looked polished and ready to go.highly recommend this product to anyone</li>
            <li>Love it so much</li>
            <li>Apply good solid layer at once</li>
            <li>This top coat really does work.</li>
            <li>Not bad though.</li>
            <li>Great product ... gives a new touch to old  colors.</li>
            <li>never thought id like matte so much and especially on top of black nail polish</li>
            <li>Seriously, this stuff is awesome.</li>
            <li>We tried three different matte top coats and this was our favorite out of all of them.  </li>
            <li>But if you used your hands a lot don&#x27;t expect it to stay super flat.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one does the job, it is matte and it dries quick.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and there wasn&#x27;t any damage or anything to the bottle.</li>
            <li>how ever if you touch a lot of oil and hair products, it will begin to fade quickly</li>
            <li>I love having a matte top coat because it totally changes the color of the polish.</li>
            <li>and I found that it dries relatively quickly, too.  </li>
            <li>I use it in patterns and a top many different colors.</li>
            <li>When using this product it dries quickly.</li>
            <li>Makes my bright colors a little more muted, which is fun for fall.</li>
            <li>It chips easier than a normal shiny top coat, but if you do a couple layers, it lasts longer.</li>
            <li>I have to do a normal top coat</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re hooked on LED gels like me, this polish works great to matte down the ultra-wet appearance of LED-cured gel polishes.</li>
            <li>this is great for a less shiny nail color.</li>
            <li>Super useful, it turns any color polish into a matte color.</li>
            <li>Dries fast and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It works very well!!</li>
            <li>it looks great and does dry really fast.</li>
            <li>Only problem is it seems to make the nail polish chip more easily.</li>
            <li>The matte coating lasted a week or so before it started chipping off - which is pretty standard for me anyway, so the reviews mentioning chipping more easily didn&#x27;t ring true for me.</li>
            <li>And super bonus - it dries super fast!</li>
            <li>I have used it plenty of times and it&#x27;s still pretty full.</li>
            <li>This is not the absolute matte-est topcoat out there, but the formula is consistently great (as is to be expected from O.P.I.).</li>
            <li>I should note I have never bought a matte top coat before, and I was extremely surprised at how well it worked.</li>
            <li>I did not think this would be worth it</li>
            <li>it dries fairly fast and is really matte top.</li>
            <li>Its well worth the money</li>
            <li>worth purchasing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was kind of skeptical about this top coat because 1) I&#x27;ve never used any kind of matte polish before and 2)</li>
            <li>Since I had a giftcard, I thought why not give it a go...and it was totally worth</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m a do it yourself kinda gal when it comes to my manicures and pedicures, so I was thrilled to see this not only on Amazon but in the OPI brand!  </li>
            <li>Also dries pretty quick as well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, if you paint over one color and do so smoothly, this matte coat will work wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: It works well with the small details if you put on a top coat, and that seems to solve the streaking as well :)</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t prevent chipping very well compared to their normal top coat.  </li>
            <li>Great polish and great look, especially if your looking for something a little different.</li>
            <li>Looks pretty at first though!</li>
            <li>It was a bit less matte than I was expecting, but if you put it over a really glossy nail polish, it looks great.</li>
            <li>It looks sweet and dries fast.</li>
            <li>cool stuff, shipped fast</li>
            <li>After about 2 days, you can barely tell you used this top coat.</li>
            <li>That said, not all colors look good in matte, but that is not why I have docked it down to 4 stars out of 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The top coat created a nice flat matte (not satin) topcoat with a tiny bit of a milky or foggy look to it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it over a matte polish and a non-matte water decal, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>Looks pretty cool really.</li>
            <li>Having said that, the OPI matte top coat lasts just as long and reapplies better than most other matte tops</li>
            <li>Very fortunate to have found this at such a price online!</li>
            <li>It was fast delivery and exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>But I wanted to test it out first</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>but my regular OPI top coat lasts much longer!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely a matte product, and protects somewhat as a top coat.</li>
            <li>I think having to do two coats of the matte made them especially brittle and more prone to chipping.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantabulously dumure and sexy at the same time!  </li>
            <li>like it and come back for more</li>
            <li>Does exactly what I had hoped.</li>
            <li>At first, it was so pretty</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t love this product enough.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I took it off after 5 days of wear because my tips were looking pretty shabby.  </li>
            <li>It was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it&#x27;s intended to do.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>AND it dries fast!</li>
            <li>Whenever I take a hot shower it starts to peel off.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I unfortunately do not recommend this product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;m ever posting review about anything on amazon.  </li>
            <li>3) Use in only one direction from the bottom to the top or it will leave traces  4)</li>
            <li>and I loved how the neon orange and black looked afterward!</li>
            <li>That should probably be expected, since the nail polishes rely on light to cause their effects, and this diminishes the brightness of light and removes the shine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It definitely gives the nail a different texture and it seems like it might chip more easily, but I think that&#x27;s just how matte is.</li>
            <li>I used that top coat all time I&#x27;m ready to buy my second one.</li>
            <li>Love the edgy look this polish top coat creates.</li>
            <li>Overall, this isn&#x27;t a huge inconvenience--I just throw a coat of Seche Vite on and then put the matte coat on top a couple of minutes later.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll start off by saying all matte top coats are porous, so by their nature they won&#x27;t wear as long as glossy polish.</li>
            <li>This top coat went on for me just like any other top coat would and dried very quickly.</li>
            <li>If you want to try a different look then I highly suggest this matte top coat over any color.</li>
            <li>I use it all the time and it creates such a cool effect!</li>
            <li>This topcoat gives my mani a fresh new look.</li>
            <li>Easy way to make it look like you expanded your color collection by only adding one bottle.</li>
            <li>The ones I have tried have always chipped so easily, sometimes the very same day.  </li>
            <li>It goes on easy and instantly mattes, not problem.  </li>
            <li>it goes on so easy and dries instantly.  </li>
            <li>This top coat doubles ever single nail polish you already have.  </li>
            <li>Looks best on dark colors like black or navy!</li>
            <li>I love the smooth application and long lasting power of OPI nail lacquers.  </li>
            <li>Overall, easy to receive and fast.</li>
            <li>Word to the wise though, make sure your polish is at least 92% dry!</li>
            <li>I really like the look of a matte finish, but am looking to try another brand.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a cashier and that being said I can&#x27;t complain about it to much.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so reasonably priced</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t like it as much as over the chrome,</li>
            <li>I much prefer that over shiny.</li>
            <li>Works like it should, really.</li>
            <li>it catches on the nails really well, but peels fast</li>
            <li>The product works very well.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t chip the day you use it, but I expected a bit more time with the mani, with this product coming from OPI</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I have found so much to do with it.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t use it on the whole nail....</li>
            <li>It came in a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li>and they both get the job done really well.</li>
            <li>shipping was extremely fast as well..</li>
            <li>but after a shower the matte would basically be gine and there was much to it.</li>
            <li>and it also came fast</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing it really dries the polish out to get that matte finish</li>
            <li>So when it dries it covers the whole nail.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t have to spend as much as the salon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried mattes in a few other brands, and this OPI is the best so far!</li>
            <li>shipped really fast and product came well</li>
            <li>We then used a clear on the top like a french manicure.</li>
            <li>So naturally I wanted to try a matte top coat to basically double the amount of looks that I could do with each polish.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Usually that would be a good thing, but it&#x27;s so heavy that I can never fill my whole nail in one dip and by the time I dip it again to fill in more of my nail, the first swipe is already drying.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had to do that with any other matte top coat.</li>
            <li>Until it dries it looks like any other shiny top coat, but I like the change of texture.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have this issue with other top coats that I use</li>
            <li>Just be sure to completely dry nails before applying!!!</li>
            <li>Such a cool look.</li>
            <li>may try using a thin clear top coat and -then- going over with matte top coat and hoping that works.</li>
            <li>If you want the look of completely nude nails for any reason (fashion, dress code, acting, etc), but you don&#x27;t want to sacrifice that protective shield of your super-strong gel manicures, try applying OPI Matte Top Coat over your clear OPI LED-cured manicure.</li>
            <li>I love the matte look and it actually seems to last longer than my usual polish without the matte on top!</li>
            <li>Overall, not bad, but pass if you&#x27;re picky like me.</li>
            <li>and it just took the manicure look to a whole new dimension...</li>
            <li>have tried NO base coat, one layer of color, allowed to dry and</li>
            <li>Just make sure each coat of your nail polish of choice is completely dry, or at least very close (about 10 minutes), before applying the Matte Top Coat.</li>
            <li>Ive used it on several different glossy nail jobs and it always comes out looking fantastic and MATTE!</li>
            <li>I tried applying this top coat multiple times, with multiple brands of nail color, and had my nails chip within a day each time.  </li>
            <li>They are actually being discontinued, buy as many as possible!  </li>
            <li>Ive used it on several different glossy nail jobs and it always comes out looking fantastic and MATTE!</li>
            <li>Since it is a matte top coat, you double the looks you can achieve with your current nail polish collection with one bottle.</li>
            <li>You must have a steady hand to use this as well and make sure you put down very even layers; it does not seem to \\&quot;settle\\&quot; like other nail polishes and won&#x27;t smooth out on its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only thing I would change if I could is that I have to put a normal top coat on my polish prior to using this one because otherwise the brush pulls the color off the nail.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>This polish lives up to OPI&#x27;s high standards.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>It turns things from tacky to classy real fast.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But a lot of the swatches I had seen on my fave nail polish blogs looked just so sleek, modern, and classy that I had to give it a shot.  </li>
            <li>But once it dried, I fell in love.</li>
            <li>Whether it&#x27;s to the whole nail or a mock french manicure I really like this product to change it up!</li>
            <li>This product makes polishes sooooo versatile, and pretty much gives you a brand new color with just a simple step!</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t even worth sending it back for a new one.</li>
            <li>THEN I even tried no base coat, two layers of color, allowed to dry for 24 hours, applied Matte coat sparingly, epic failure.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After experimenting a little I found an application method that worked for me (wait for the top coat to be completely and totally dry, then quick up-and-down strokes to apply this, no side to side).</li>
            <li>then the Matte coat, epic failure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried NO base coat, two layers of color, allowed to dry, applied Matte coat, epic failure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only polish that I haven&#x27;t really seen too much of a &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34;ness is on the metallic ones.</li>
            <li>It made my navy blue nail look fantastic and as soon as It cools off enough</li>
            <li>Wow every time I use this as a top coat it acts as a remover and my initial polish comes off and yes I waited for them to completely dry..</li>
            <li>/&gt;OPI is quality and I love their wide and flat brushes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;OPI is quality and I love their wide and flat brushes.</li>
            <li>The application was smooth and it dried really quickly (always a plus with a 2 month old baby, I really don&#x27;t have time to wait for my nails to dry!)</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know what to expect when I ordered this product but was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>Quick dry matte polish!</li>
            <li>I guess I was hoping for a touch more shine or maybe a slight white color.</li>
            <li>The only complaint I have about this product, like many other reviewers, is that it chips fairly easily.</li>
            <li>It goes on clear and shiny (like a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; topcoat, and then dries to a matte finish.</li>
            <li>I have only used this with one color so far, but I really like how it looks.</li>
            <li>Wow, I&#x27;ve never used anything like this product for nail polish before.  </li>
            <li>It makes the polish extremely soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li>It definitely makes your nails really stand out.</li>
            <li>So far, this works like a dream.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re all thumbs, then go to salon and ask a professional to do your nails.</li>
            <li>Yes, It is a bit more expensive than some of the others, but it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>It absolutely works; it took the sheen right out of the green.</li>
            <li>It took a very long time to dry completely and once it had I felt like my nail color chipped more quickly than usual.</li>
            <li>It leaves little white spots and it chips really easily.</li>
            <li>This actually works and looks very pretty, but the only problem is it makes my polish cop by the next day.</li>
            <li>How this got such high reviews I am unsure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first one I&#x27;ve ever bought and I wouldn&#x27;t try any other.</li>
            <li>Flat black &amp; flat white are my favorite colors.  </li>
            <li>It sort of looks a little too matte if that&#x27;s even possible, but just on an accent nail it looks really cool.</li>
            <li>My only problem is that it doesn&#x27;t stay matte, completely.  </li>
            <li>I must say though you must apply carefully as to not leave streaks.</li>
            <li>However, this being the only complaint I have, I would definitely recommend this top coat.</li>
            <li>Fast dry and ut actually works.</li>
            <li>It dried quick and I only needed one coat.</li>
            <li>when i first started going over my black color</li>
            <li>This nailpolish does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to--it makes your typical nailpolish colors matte.</li>
            <li>Not bad considering how hard I am on my nails.</li>
            <li>/&gt;you can use it on any color but be careful the first color needs to be very dry if not the mate will take the color off.</li>
            <li>It was dry to the touch after about 30 seconds and no longer soft after 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li>biggest complaint about this is that it dries so quickly.</li>
            <li>but i think the price is a little too much.</li>

            <li> Everything OK!</li>
            <li> and i love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love O.P.I products, and China Glaze products!</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I purchased this item!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with matte finish!</li>
            <li> This is easy to use and there are some great tutorials online, through Sephora and YouTube.  </li>
            <li> and it was amazing...</li>
            <li> I just used it and it works amazingly</li>
            <li> It is amazing.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s still amazing</li>
            <li> works amazing and turns anything into matte.</li>
            <li> Creates a nice matte effect though.</li>
            <li> The texture kind of just rubs off.  </li>
            <li> with the kind of polishes you prefer it over.  </li>
            <li> It works great and goes on nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> Just note that you can&#x27;t put a topcoat over it, but it kind of acts as a topcoat anyway.</li>
            <li> This really does a great job of mattifying!</li>
            <li> The nice matte look I was going for lasted about a day.</li>
            <li> You can honestly make any polish matte.</li>
            <li> Nice packaging and sleek look.</li>
            <li> LOOVEE i&#x27;m matteing even my own nail without polish.  </li>
            <li> I really liked how it made my nails look.</li>
            <li> and she liked it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The matte finish is beautiful and it dries really quick.</li>
            <li> Normally it starts chipping after a day even if a use the best top coats!</li>
            <li> received my stuff super quick!!!!</li>
            <li> the surface becomes brittle and the nail color chips VERY easily.</li>
            <li> it chips very easily.</li>
            <li> Will most def order more of this when I run out!</li>
            <li> Love this top coat!</li>
            <li> Loving it my daughter&#x27;s just so love it</li>
            <li> Regardless of the kind of polish I use, when I put this top coat on, it pulls the color off my nails, &amp; then the brush gets stained.  </li>
            <li> I loved the result, even when tried on a light pastel color which lots of people say matte won&#x27;t work for.</li>
            <li> oh my gosh its go amazing and stylish</li>
            <li> This matte top coat is AMAZING.</li>
            <li> It works best with dark colors though because you can&#x27;t really tell it&#x27;s on when you put it over a bright color, but it does (surprisingly) look good with bright orange :)</li>
            <li> Love love love!</li>
            <li> Use to love shinny nails but this matte look is awesome people try it you will be surprised.  </li>
            <li> I am pretty experienced using nail polish and even worked for Ulta</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect to tone down polish that might be too bright.  </li>
            <li> I could not stop staring at my nails the first time I used it over Jade Diamond Velvet, an amazing purple duochrome that I loved without the top coat</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping will buy more thank you!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> Toes still love lovely</li>
            <li> the whole baking soda or powder trick lol.</li>
            <li> (: so much better then</li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s the best matte top coat I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s better to wipe it off.</li>
            <li> I love the way this top coat looks and haven&#x27;t had chipping problems.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Being that it is a top coat, I feel that it should stay.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Still love it though.</li>
            <li> MORE.  </li>
            <li> YES I LOVE THIS TOP COAT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I think I love even more with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love it, works just as it should.</li>
            <li> Love the color of this.</li>
            <li> But I do like how the top coat turns out.  </li>
            <li> I love that I can make all my polish matte look now.</li>
            <li> Make sure you paint corectly or you will see lines</li>
            <li> There are SO many things that can be done with this topcoat.  </li>
            <li> Before this purchase I had tried home made recipes of matte top coats.</li>
            <li> Matte for sure.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this matte top coat.</li>
            <li> Love it...</li>
            <li> i noticed that removing a lot of the excess top coat from the brush caused the color to streak.</li>
            <li> Matte means matte and this top coat do what need to do in that way</li>
            <li> I get a lot of great compliments about it very often.</li>
            <li> absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> And I typically love OPI products-</li>
            <li> I must say, this polish could be better at NOT chipping.</li>
            <li> Yes, I love OPI polishes.  </li>
            <li> Plus the bottle is soo cute.</li>
            <li> I love the matte top coat it gives my nails a chalky look without dulling out the color.</li>
            <li> Love this nail polish.</li>
            <li> but then after about 12 hours or so the top coat looked as if it was rubbing off.</li>
            <li> One bit of advice is to put your top coat on before using this matte top coat encase</li>
            <li> i absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> I love this nail polish.</li>
            <li> It just gives that sophisticated matte look.</li>
            <li> Put it on and I love it.</li>
            <li> Love the brand</li>
            <li> I will probably buy it again :)</li>
            <li> This really works great.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my granddaughter and I am sure she will like it.  </li>
            <li> i love doing my nails</li>
            <li> this opi one probably does a better job because it dries up faster.</li>
            <li> ... Love the look of matte.</li>
            <li> After 3 days there started to be some wear on my nail tips and it started looking more satin in appearance.  </li>
            <li> Overall, another great product from OPI, you won&#x27;t regret this purchase!</li>
            <li> I love this product a lot, I just wish it lasted longer.</li>
            <li> i always wanted a matte top coat</li>
            <li> The top coat makes my polish crack after two or three days.</li>
            <li> and then this matte finish top coat.</li>
            <li> Was expecting more from OPI.</li>
            <li> This matte coat is fantastic!</li>
            <li> Safely bubble wrapped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love OPI and this matte top coat</li>
            <li> then again, so are most OPI products.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with it.</li>
            <li> i love matte colors</li>
            <li> i love,</li>
            <li> lovely and works well.</li>
            <li> (one picture is after you put on the top coat and after ive worn it all day).</li>
            <li> i dont know if this requires more coats to stay matte???</li>
            <li> i would advise against wasting your money on this and buy a better product.</li>
            <li> Now I just need more colors to try it on.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if a top coat would perform as well as a matte color.</li>
            <li> Love this nail polish</li>
            <li> As a top coat it doesn&#x27;t seal in as well so becareful of water.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty nice top coat!</li>
            <li> Check them out and you will find some very sophisticated designs that are demure for the office but still artistic.</li>
            <li> Very worth it!</li>
            <li> Nice matte finish,dries quickly.</li>
            <li> The matte top coat also dries very quickly.</li>
            <li> I love the look of the matte finish, but WHOA, it chips SO easily.  </li>
            <li> however it chips easily but still looks cute.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;d look better if I were better on putting on nail polish (unsteady hands don&#x27;t help), but it looks so cool.</li>
            <li> works great and dries super fast!</li>
            <li> I found that I was able to paint over it just fine</li>
            <li> It goes on easy, dries quickly, and leaves a nice matte</li>
            <li> It is magnificent, fine as on the Picture, corresponds to the Description, fast Delivery, high Quality of a product, I am completely satisfied with Purchase</li>
            <li> The product is actually very full.</li>
            <li> I think it works wonderfully, I haven&#x27;t had any of the other problems I see people reporting.</li>
            <li> In all other cases it&#x27;s the best product ever!    </li>
            <li> very quick and easy coat, just makes it easier to chip though.</li>
            <li> I did a bunch of research on the best matte top coat and came to the conclusion, based on mattifying comparisons (this one &amp;#34;matted&amp;#34; very well, while some only to a satin or rubbery look) and price here on Amazon, I decided, heck, why not?!</li>
            <li> It look nice when you first put it on, but the matte in it goes away after a couple of days.</li>
            <li> This polish is really cool, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to work too well as a top coat.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a super fun look for all my favorite colors!</li>
            <li> It is light and dries ver easy.</li>
            <li> It works fine.  </li>
            <li> and it dries really quickly!</li>
            <li> Great for nail designs and to just do something a little more interesting with your mani.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m very satisfied with it, and it looks great over hot pink.</li>
            <li> Great for putting a twist on your current nail polished.</li>
            <li> Every matte chips after a few days, but this one is the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Bottles wrapped and packaged securely to avoid breakage.</li>
            <li> I love this product, on my last manicure we used the matte coat over an emerald color and just loved it.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Smooth to apply, quick dry, protects nail polish from chipping, it is a very good product</li>
            <li> Chips almost right away... not my favorite.</li>
            <li> I purchased 6 of these since they rock so much!!!  </li>
            <li> Who needs different colors of matte nail polish when you can do with this fantastic item!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good matte top coat for a long time.  </li>
            <li> It dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t seem to chip easily.</li>
            <li> easy to use, dries fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> I tested it out on one of my nails and it dried quickly and was perfect!</li>
            <li> I am an avid OPI fan, so I was stoked to see a Matte Top Coat from OPI.</li>
            <li> Have fun!</li>
            <li> I included a pic of my Halloween nails because that&#x27;s what I first used the matte top coat on</li>
            <li> This is so nice to have instead of having to buy a bunch of different colors of matte, I can apply just this top coat  and any of my polishes can be matte.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy to get a really chic look with this top coat.</li>
            <li> so I even know the techniques and tricks when applying special nail polishes like this one but</li>
            <li> I like how easily this top coat goes on and how fast it dries, but like others have said, it makes the paint very brittle and then it chips off very quickly.</li>
            <li> It came a day before expected delivery and works great.</li>
            <li> Definitely a cool effect for someone who isn&#x27;t a nail expert.</li>
            <li> This product held up a bit better than that, but not by much.  </li>
            <li> It is perfect but gave 3 stars since it was 2 days late.</li>
            <li> I used it to do this cool nail design.</li>
            <li> i love this product, makes my at home manicure looked polished and ready to go.highly recommend this product to anyone</li>
            <li> Love it so much</li>
            <li> Apply good solid layer at once</li>
            <li> This top coat really does work.</li>
            <li> Not bad though.</li>
            <li> Great product ... gives a new touch to old  colors.</li>
            <li> never thought id like matte so much and especially on top of black nail polish</li>
            <li> Seriously, this stuff is awesome.</li>
            <li> We tried three different matte top coats and this was our favorite out of all of them.  </li>
            <li> But if you used your hands a lot don&#x27;t expect it to stay super flat.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one does the job, it is matte and it dries quick.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and there wasn&#x27;t any damage or anything to the bottle.</li>
            <li> how ever if you touch a lot of oil and hair products, it will begin to fade quickly</li>
            <li> I love having a matte top coat because it totally changes the color of the polish.</li>
            <li> and I found that it dries relatively quickly, too.  </li>
            <li> I use it in patterns and a top many different colors.</li>
            <li> When using this product it dries quickly.</li>
            <li> Makes my bright colors a little more muted, which is fun for fall.</li>
            <li> It chips easier than a normal shiny top coat, but if you do a couple layers, it lasts longer.</li>
            <li> I have to do a normal top coat</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re hooked on LED gels like me, this polish works great to matte down the ultra-wet appearance of LED-cured gel polishes.</li>
            <li> this is great for a less shiny nail color.</li>
            <li> Super useful, it turns any color polish into a matte color.</li>
            <li> Dries fast and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It works very well!!</li>
            <li> it looks great and does dry really fast.</li>
            <li> Only problem is it seems to make the nail polish chip more easily.</li>
            <li> The matte coating lasted a week or so before it started chipping off - which is pretty standard for me anyway, so the reviews mentioning chipping more easily didn&#x27;t ring true for me.</li>
            <li> And super bonus - it dries super fast!</li>
            <li> I have used it plenty of times and it&#x27;s still pretty full.</li>
            <li> This is not the absolute matte-est topcoat out there, but the formula is consistently great (as is to be expected from O.P.I.).</li>
            <li> I should note I have never bought a matte top coat before, and I was extremely surprised at how well it worked.</li>
            <li> I did not think this would be worth it</li>
            <li> it dries fairly fast and is really matte top.</li>
            <li> Its well worth the money</li>
            <li> worth purchasing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was kind of skeptical about this top coat because 1) I&#x27;ve never used any kind of matte polish before and 2)</li>
            <li> Since I had a giftcard, I thought why not give it a go...and it was totally worth</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m a do it yourself kinda gal when it comes to my manicures and pedicures, so I was thrilled to see this not only on Amazon but in the OPI brand!  </li>
            <li> Also dries pretty quick as well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, if you paint over one color and do so smoothly, this matte coat will work wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: It works well with the small details if you put on a top coat, and that seems to solve the streaking as well :)</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t prevent chipping very well compared to their normal top coat.  </li>
            <li> Great polish and great look, especially if your looking for something a little different.</li>
            <li> Looks pretty at first though!</li>
            <li> It was a bit less matte than I was expecting, but if you put it over a really glossy nail polish, it looks great.</li>
            <li> It looks sweet and dries fast.</li>
            <li> cool stuff, shipped fast</li>
            <li> After about 2 days, you can barely tell you used this top coat.</li>
            <li> That said, not all colors look good in matte, but that is not why I have docked it down to 4 stars out of 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The top coat created a nice flat matte (not satin) topcoat with a tiny bit of a milky or foggy look to it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it over a matte polish and a non-matte water decal, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> Looks pretty cool really.</li>
            <li> Having said that, the OPI matte top coat lasts just as long and reapplies better than most other matte tops</li>
            <li> Very fortunate to have found this at such a price online!</li>
            <li> It was fast delivery and exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> But I wanted to test it out first</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> but my regular OPI top coat lasts much longer!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely a matte product, and protects somewhat as a top coat.</li>
            <li> I think having to do two coats of the matte made them especially brittle and more prone to chipping.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantabulously dumure and sexy at the same time!  </li>
            <li> like it and come back for more</li>
            <li> Does exactly what I had hoped.</li>
            <li> At first, it was so pretty</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t love this product enough.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I took it off after 5 days of wear because my tips were looking pretty shabby.  </li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it&#x27;s intended to do.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> AND it dries fast!</li>
            <li> Whenever I take a hot shower it starts to peel off.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I unfortunately do not recommend this product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;m ever posting review about anything on amazon.  </li>
            <li> 3) Use in only one direction from the bottom to the top or it will leave traces  4)</li>
            <li> and I loved how the neon orange and black looked afterward!</li>
            <li> That should probably be expected, since the nail polishes rely on light to cause their effects, and this diminishes the brightness of light and removes the shine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It definitely gives the nail a different texture and it seems like it might chip more easily, but I think that&#x27;s just how matte is.</li>
            <li> I used that top coat all time I&#x27;m ready to buy my second one.</li>
            <li> Love the edgy look this polish top coat creates.</li>
            <li> Overall, this isn&#x27;t a huge inconvenience--I just throw a coat of Seche Vite on and then put the matte coat on top a couple of minutes later.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start off by saying all matte top coats are porous, so by their nature they won&#x27;t wear as long as glossy polish.</li>
            <li> This top coat went on for me just like any other top coat would and dried very quickly.</li>
            <li> If you want to try a different look then I highly suggest this matte top coat over any color.</li>
            <li> I use it all the time and it creates such a cool effect!</li>
            <li> This topcoat gives my mani a fresh new look.</li>
            <li> Easy way to make it look like you expanded your color collection by only adding one bottle.</li>
            <li> The ones I have tried have always chipped so easily, sometimes the very same day.  </li>
            <li> It goes on easy and instantly mattes, not problem.  </li>
            <li> it goes on so easy and dries instantly.  </li>
            <li> This top coat doubles ever single nail polish you already have.  </li>
            <li> Looks best on dark colors like black or navy!</li>
            <li> I love the smooth application and long lasting power of OPI nail lacquers.  </li>
            <li> Overall, easy to receive and fast.</li>
            <li> Word to the wise though, make sure your polish is at least 92% dry!</li>
            <li> I really like the look of a matte finish, but am looking to try another brand.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a cashier and that being said I can&#x27;t complain about it to much.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so reasonably priced</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t like it as much as over the chrome,</li>
            <li> I much prefer that over shiny.</li>
            <li> Works like it should, really.</li>
            <li> it catches on the nails really well, but peels fast</li>
            <li> The product works very well.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t chip the day you use it, but I expected a bit more time with the mani, with this product coming from OPI</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I have found so much to do with it.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t use it on the whole nail....</li>
            <li> It came in a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> and they both get the job done really well.</li>
            <li> shipping was extremely fast as well..</li>
            <li> but after a shower the matte would basically be gine and there was much to it.</li>
            <li> and it also came fast</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing it really dries the polish out to get that matte finish</li>
            <li> So when it dries it covers the whole nail.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t have to spend as much as the salon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried mattes in a few other brands, and this OPI is the best so far!</li>
            <li> shipped really fast and product came well</li>
            <li> We then used a clear on the top like a french manicure.</li>
            <li> So naturally I wanted to try a matte top coat to basically double the amount of looks that I could do with each polish.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Usually that would be a good thing, but it&#x27;s so heavy that I can never fill my whole nail in one dip and by the time I dip it again to fill in more of my nail, the first swipe is already drying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had to do that with any other matte top coat.</li>
            <li> Until it dries it looks like any other shiny top coat, but I like the change of texture.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have this issue with other top coats that I use</li>
            <li> Just be sure to completely dry nails before applying!!!</li>
            <li> Such a cool look.</li>
            <li> may try using a thin clear top coat and -then- going over with matte top coat and hoping that works.</li>
            <li> If you want the look of completely nude nails for any reason (fashion, dress code, acting, etc), but you don&#x27;t want to sacrifice that protective shield of your super-strong gel manicures, try applying OPI Matte Top Coat over your clear OPI LED-cured manicure.</li>
            <li> I love the matte look and it actually seems to last longer than my usual polish without the matte on top!</li>
            <li> Overall, not bad, but pass if you&#x27;re picky like me.</li>
            <li> and it just took the manicure look to a whole new dimension...</li>
            <li> have tried NO base coat, one layer of color, allowed to dry and</li>
            <li> Just make sure each coat of your nail polish of choice is completely dry, or at least very close (about 10 minutes), before applying the Matte Top Coat.</li>
            <li> Ive used it on several different glossy nail jobs and it always comes out looking fantastic and MATTE!</li>
            <li> I tried applying this top coat multiple times, with multiple brands of nail color, and had my nails chip within a day each time.  </li>
            <li> They are actually being discontinued, buy as many as possible!  </li>
            <li> Ive used it on several different glossy nail jobs and it always comes out looking fantastic and MATTE!</li>
            <li> Since it is a matte top coat, you double the looks you can achieve with your current nail polish collection with one bottle.</li>
            <li> You must have a steady hand to use this as well and make sure you put down very even layers; it does not seem to \\&quot;settle\\&quot; like other nail polishes and won&#x27;t smooth out on its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only thing I would change if I could is that I have to put a normal top coat on my polish prior to using this one because otherwise the brush pulls the color off the nail.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This polish lives up to OPI&#x27;s high standards.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> It turns things from tacky to classy real fast.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But a lot of the swatches I had seen on my fave nail polish blogs looked just so sleek, modern, and classy that I had to give it a shot.  </li>
            <li> But once it dried, I fell in love.</li>
            <li> Whether it&#x27;s to the whole nail or a mock french manicure I really like this product to change it up!</li>
            <li> This product makes polishes sooooo versatile, and pretty much gives you a brand new color with just a simple step!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t even worth sending it back for a new one.</li>
            <li> THEN I even tried no base coat, two layers of color, allowed to dry for 24 hours, applied Matte coat sparingly, epic failure.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After experimenting a little I found an application method that worked for me (wait for the top coat to be completely and totally dry, then quick up-and-down strokes to apply this, no side to side).</li>
            <li> then the Matte coat, epic failure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried NO base coat, two layers of color, allowed to dry, applied Matte coat, epic failure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only polish that I haven&#x27;t really seen too much of a &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34;ness is on the metallic ones.</li>
            <li> It made my navy blue nail look fantastic and as soon as It cools off enough</li>
            <li> Wow every time I use this as a top coat it acts as a remover and my initial polish comes off and yes I waited for them to completely dry..</li>
            <li> /&gt;OPI is quality and I love their wide and flat brushes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;OPI is quality and I love their wide and flat brushes.</li>
            <li> The application was smooth and it dried really quickly (always a plus with a 2 month old baby, I really don&#x27;t have time to wait for my nails to dry!)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect when I ordered this product but was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> Quick dry matte polish!</li>
            <li> I guess I was hoping for a touch more shine or maybe a slight white color.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have about this product, like many other reviewers, is that it chips fairly easily.</li>
            <li> It goes on clear and shiny (like a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; topcoat, and then dries to a matte finish.</li>
            <li> I have only used this with one color so far, but I really like how it looks.</li>
            <li> Wow, I&#x27;ve never used anything like this product for nail polish before.  </li>
            <li> It makes the polish extremely soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li> It definitely makes your nails really stand out.</li>
            <li> So far, this works like a dream.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re all thumbs, then go to salon and ask a professional to do your nails.</li>
            <li> Yes, It is a bit more expensive than some of the others, but it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> It absolutely works; it took the sheen right out of the green.</li>
            <li> It took a very long time to dry completely and once it had I felt like my nail color chipped more quickly than usual.</li>
            <li> It leaves little white spots and it chips really easily.</li>
            <li> This actually works and looks very pretty, but the only problem is it makes my polish cop by the next day.</li>
            <li> How this got such high reviews I am unsure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first one I&#x27;ve ever bought and I wouldn&#x27;t try any other.</li>
            <li> Flat black &amp; flat white are my favorite colors.  </li>
            <li> It sort of looks a little too matte if that&#x27;s even possible, but just on an accent nail it looks really cool.</li>
            <li> My only problem is that it doesn&#x27;t stay matte, completely.  </li>
            <li> I must say though you must apply carefully as to not leave streaks.</li>
            <li> However, this being the only complaint I have, I would definitely recommend this top coat.</li>
            <li> Fast dry and ut actually works.</li>
            <li> It dried quick and I only needed one coat.</li>
            <li> when i first started going over my black color</li>
            <li> This nailpolish does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to--it makes your typical nailpolish colors matte.</li>
            <li> Not bad considering how hard I am on my nails.</li>
            <li> /&gt;you can use it on any color but be careful the first color needs to be very dry if not the mate will take the color off.</li>
            <li> It was dry to the touch after about 30 seconds and no longer soft after 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> biggest complaint about this is that it dries so quickly.</li>
            <li> but i think the price is a little too much.</li>
            <li> As you can see, it&#x27;s not clear in the bottle, so it doesn&#x27;t dry perfectly clear either.</li>
            <li> Probably not dry enough to do the dishes but dry enough to put on a jacket and get into the car without ruining them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure what it does to the polish, but it obviously makes it very brittle.  </li>
            <li> The liquid is a little thick, but it&#x27;s really easy to apply</li>
            <li> I tried it on my fingernail at first and man is this stuff hard.</li>
            <li> It does stay some what flat</li>
            <li> You paint it over the finished nail and it makes the color flat and matte.  </li>
            <li> so I could just leave it out as long as possible to see if it was my problem or the polish.</li>
            <li> I like to use it to add a nail design or a feature nail as the color is very flat once the topcoat is applied.</li>
            <li> But I didn&#x27;t try to touch it until after a couple minutes, and it felt dry enough for me to move on to something else.  </li>
            <li> I also like mattifying black nail polish and then stamping with a black or white shiny polish, very classy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also like mattifying black nail polish and then stamping with a black or white shiny polish, very classy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only complaint is that if your polish brush strokes are not perfect on the underlying coats, the brush lines show through more clearly than with a shiny topcoat.</li>
            <li> This gave me the look that I was going for, but only for a very limited amount of time.</li>
            <li> They looked gorgeous after this, and I totally recommend using a black polish with this to get a neat charcoal color, but after a day and a half they chipped like crazy.  </li>
            <li> This works but does not stay on long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been intrigued by matte nail polish for a while but was put off by a lot of negative views I had read on the look of matte nails, saying that it&#x27;s ugly, and it takes way longer to dry vs. quick dry shiny top coats, etc.</li>
            <li> (I tried a thin coat, a thick coat and even two coats of the top coat) but they were chipping the next day.  </li>
            <li> matter what, no matter how much or how little I tried to work this Matte coat, it is truly an epic failure.</li>
            <li> It took me a few tries to figure out how to apply this; at first, it looked a little streaky/dirty.</li>
            <li> feel like it flakes off a bit faster than other polishes, but it still last a while</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it leaves behind that strong nail polish smell for quite a while after it dries.</li>
            <li> but normally I would have at least one chip or two - but not with my ever trusted OPI.</li>
            <li> It turns a beautiful shiny polish into a rather boring color.  </li>
            <li> It seemed to dry almost immediately, as you could see the matte effect morph from wet to dry within seconds on the nail.  </li>
            <li> At first I was a little weary when I put it on because I expected it to dull the color immediately.</li>
            <li> I used it over my OPI black polish and 5 nails where chipped the next day.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, there were these weird white specs that came off with it, and there was no way to get rid of them except to redo the nail and hope it didn&#x27;t happen again.</li>
            <li> And it not super streaky, just a bit more-so than the regular polish.</li>
            <li> I immediately removed what I was wearing and did a black matte finish french manicure.</li>
            <li> I received a ton of compliments and the color lasted all week without one single chip!</li>
            <li> its pretty cool, you just blow on it and it instantly turns your base color matte!</li>
            <li> Arrived in two days, sooner than expected.  </li>
            <li> it dont even last a day and chips and peals with in a few hr&#x27;s even on your toe&#x27;s</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, this product wrecks the nail polish color and leaves behind a streaky uneven mess, it literally pulls the color right off.</li>
            <li> the other ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> In the past 6 months or so I have become a nail polish-o-holic, my collection at the moment has about 100 bottles of all sorts of polish: textured, holo, cremes, chromes, thermals, glitters, jellys, indie brands, mainstream brands, no name brands...</li>
            <li> Not sure if I will ever go back to shinny again.  </li>
            <li> The brush can get a bit of the color on the tip but does not bleed into other colors.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Apparently due to what is needed to make the formula matte (cornstarch)</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it makes the base polish chip but is great for last minute diy paint job.</li>
            <li> I will say though, and I can&#x27;t tell if this is due to my lack of talent at painting nails or not, but it does seem a bit streaky.</li>
            <li> Also expect it to be a little hard to see when removing, just like clear nail polish.</li>
            <li> For this reason it usually drags, applies unevenly, pulls nail polish under it off, or ends up being very thick and goopy if you aren&#x27;t quick about it.</li>
            <li> But a little advance it does take some time to dry.</li>
            <li> It can be used for lots of fun nail art designs -- I like to put on a coat of this and then paint on delicate designs with a thin, ultra-shiny topcoat for contrast.</li>
            <li> For dark painted nails you may have to use it twice.  </li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s the ONLY negative remark I have.</li>
            <li> Money WELL spent!!</li>
            <li> then it looks odd.</li>
            <li> Plus the price I paid is less than I would at target for opi nail polish.</li>
            <li> I figured that perhaps I had not waited long enough, so I painted half of a fake nail</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to use this, even after buying because who doesn&#x27;t like shiny nails?  </li>
            <li> expect a little cloudiness.</li>
            <li> a little trick I learned...</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s really not that hard to replicate.</li>
            <li> Gotta try a few others.</li>
            <li> I have tried this over a few kinds of nail polish (OPI, Sally Hansen, Revlon, Rimmel, Nicole, &amp; Nails Inc.).  </li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t understand why some people had so much trouble with it.</li>
            <li> it dried in seconds.</li>
            <li> You do have to reapply every few days to keep the matte look.</li>
            <li> The foggy look lessened after a few hours.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it on for a few days and done dishes without any chipping or change in the appearance.</li>
            <li> I like putting this on my raw nails because it gives the neat effect that my nails are thicker and softer.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> just what i wanted, and a thin layer over a dark polish, like black, gives a nique look</li>
            <li> (My usual decision making process on whether or not I should by a nail</li>
            <li> I do not recommend. :/</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty disappointed in this product.  </li>
            <li> have tried a base coat with one layer of color, allowed to dry and then the Matte coat, epic failure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> have tried a base coat, two layers of color, allowed to dry, applied Matte coat, epic failure.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sucks.</li>
            <li> It only lasts a couple days before it starts chipping like crazy.</li>
            <li> Not worth the price, I will definitely not be repurchasing :(</li>
            <li> I have seen this matte finish manicure all over the place lately-</li>
            <li> It dries fast, doesn&#x27;t discolor or alter the color of the base coat, and it creates a matte finish.</li>
            <li> Tips:  1) Use it only after your base color is absolutely dry!!</li>
            <li> I tried doing a small design on a nail to attempt something I saw online and painted over it with matte, and ended up having to redo the entire nail because it streaked so bad.</li>
            <li> (especially black)</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s also a classy way to make tips on a creamy base.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t painted my nails in FOREVER because I am VERY impatient and hate waiting for them to dry, but this is a problem solver.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a little bit disappointing.</li>
            <li> It arrived with bottle broken and nail polish was hardened.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to stand behind my 5 stars anyway, because I can&#x27;t prove if it&#x27;s me or not, but if someone with talent says it&#x27;s streaky</li>
            <li> I added another coat and now the black looks cloudy and ugly.</li>
            <li> Would give it 5 stars, but unfortunately it weakens your nailpolish and makes it chip after a day or two.</li>
            <li> Thus, unless I run out of nail polish remover,  this stuff is useless.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ll be getting bored with any of my polishes for a while.</li>
            <li> You cant really go wrong with opi.</li>
            <li> Im obsessed.  </li>
            <li> However, I wouldn&#x27;t do anything crazy that could ruin your nails for a while after just in case.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve seen your manicurist do it for you, don&#x27;t be afraid to do it yourself</li>
            <li> If it didn&#x27;t work out on you chances are you are doing it wrong!</li>
            <li> I have nothing bad to say about this.</li>
            <li> Too bad</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed when I used this!&lt;br</li>
            <li> im very disappointed with this.</li>
            <li> I dont recommend using it with anything sparkly because it looks awful.</li>
            <li> Again, I&#x27;m terrible at painting nails, so it could be me.</li>

            <li> I love it I order this for my prom cause I want matte nails. But I wanted to test it out first and it was amazing... Toes still love lovely can&#x27;t wait to test it out for prom!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product at Sally&#x27;s. It dries fast, doesn&#x27;t discolor or alter the color of the base coat, and it creates a matte finish.</li>
            <li> DID NOT WORK IN ANY WAY</li>
            <li> This is so nice to have instead of having to buy a bunch of different colors of matte, I can apply just this top coat  and any of my polishes can be matte.</li>
            <li> Great way to be creative with nail polish at home.  The Matte does start to chip after a week.  I change my color each week anyway or sooner if I have the time so it works for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever NOT use this. Grays and reds are my favourite to use with this. Definitely a cool effect for someone who isn&#x27;t a nail expert.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stop using this on all my polishes. It turns things from tacky to classy real fast.&lt;br /&gt;I feel like it flakes off a bit faster than other polishes, but it still last a while and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Super useful, it turns any color polish into a matte color. I love it! It chips easier than a normal shiny top coat, but if you do a couple layers, it lasts longer. Great purchase.</li>
            <li> Wow, I&#x27;ve never used anything like this product for nail polish before.  It goes on clear and shiny (like a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; topcoat, and then dries to a matte finish. The only complaint is that if your polish brush strokes are not perfect on the underlying coats, the brush lines show through more clearly than with a shiny topcoat.</li>
            <li> Does the job. Gotta try a few others. Getting anything oily takes the matte(ness) away. Easier than doing the whole baking soda or powder trick lol.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome! It looks sweet and dries fast. I&#x27;m in love! ;)</li>
            <li> We tried three different matte top coats and this was our favorite out of all of them.  It&#x27;s perfect to tone down polish that might be too bright.  It makes the polish extremely soft to the touch.  It doesn&#x27;t prevent chipping very well compared to their normal top coat.  Easy way to make it look like you expanded your color collection by only adding one bottle.</li>
            <li> This top coat is great. It definitely makes your nails really stand out. Very worth it!</li>
            <li> Ive used it on several different glossy nail jobs and it always comes out looking fantastic and MATTE!</li>
            <li> Perfect matte, exactly what I need</li>
            <li> I really like the look of a matte finish, but am looking to try another brand.  I tried applying this top coat multiple times, with multiple brands of nail color, and had my nails chip within a day each time.  I admittedly work with my hands a lot but my regular OPI top coat lasts much longer!</li>
            <li> When I ordered it, the estimated delivery date was January 23-28 and it came amazingly packaged on the 22nd! I just used it and it works amazingly(: so much better then the other ones I&#x27;ve tried. Definitley gonna keep buying!</li>
            <li> It took quite a while to get here but I wasn&#x27;t in a hurry for it.... Other than that it&#x27;s the best matte top coat I&#x27;ve tried! I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Nice matte finish,dries quickly.</li>
            <li> The product is actually very full. A lot of liquid is on the brush as you pull it out so it&#x27;s better to wipe it off. Not a lot of liquid is required to actually get a matte. I have used it plenty of times and it&#x27;s still pretty full.</li>
            <li> Would give it 5 stars, but unfortunately it weakens your nailpolish and makes it chip after a day or two. Creates a nice matte effect though.</li>
            <li> I love the way this top coat looks and haven&#x27;t had chipping problems. The only thing I would change if I could is that I have to put a normal top coat on my polish prior to using this one because otherwise the brush pulls the color off the nail. (This might be user error.) Overall, this isn&#x27;t a huge inconvenience--I just throw a coat of Seche Vite on and then put the matte coat on top a couple of minutes later. The matte top coat also dries very quickly.</li>
            <li> Loving it my daughter&#x27;s just so love it</li>
            <li> I love this product, on my last manicure we used the matte coat over an emerald color and just loved it. We then used a clear on the top like a french manicure. If you want to try a different look then I highly suggest this matte top coat over any color.</li>
            <li> all I can say is PERFECT!</li>
            <li> Best matte nail polish</li>
            <li> So far, this works like a dream. It&#x27;s definitely a matte product, and protects somewhat as a top coat. I&#x27;ve only used it over a matte polish and a non-matte water decal, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> This works but does not stay on long. I used it over my OPI black polish and 5 nails where chipped the next day. But it does leave a matte finish..</li>
            <li> I have tried this over a few kinds of nail polish (OPI, Sally Hansen, Revlon, Rimmel, Nicole, &amp; Nails Inc.).  Regardless of the kind of polish I use, when I put this top coat on, it pulls the color off my nails, &amp; then the brush gets stained.  Thus, unless I run out of nail polish remover,  this stuff is useless.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favs!  I purchased 6 of these since they rock so much!!!  They are actually being discontinued, buy as many as possible!  Flat black &amp; flat white are my favorite colors.  Super awesome product.  received my stuff super quick!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good matte top coat for a long time.  The ones I have tried have always chipped so easily, sometimes the very same day.  This product held up a bit better than that, but not by much.  The first time I used it, there were these weird white specs that came off with it, and there was no way to get rid of them except to redo the nail and hope it didn&#x27;t happen again. Also, with one coat the nail looked streaky, like some of the shine was trying to come through, so I had to do two coats. I&#x27;ve never had to do that with any other matte top coat. They looked gorgeous after this, and I totally recommend using a black polish with this to get a neat charcoal color, but after a day and a half they chipped like crazy.  I think having to do two coats of the matte made them especially brittle and more prone to chipping. Overall, not bad, but pass if you&#x27;re picky like me.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It goes on easy and instantly mattes, not problem.  My only problem is that it doesn&#x27;t stay matte, completely.  I&#x27;m a cashier and that being said I can&#x27;t complain about it to much.  I use my hands and wash them A LOT! The texture kind of just rubs off.  It does stay some what flat but there is still a bit of shine.  Being that it is a top coat, I feel that it should stay.  But if you used your hands a lot don&#x27;t expect it to stay super flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still love it though.</li>
            <li> It is perfect but gave 3 stars since it was 2 days late.</li>
            <li> matte topcoat is great because I don&#x27;t like having shiny paint on my nails. It&#x27;s a topcoat, it&#x27;s not shiny, I like it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS! I was hesitant to buy this because I thought, &amp;#34;Oh it&#x27;s OPI and it&#x27;s so reasonably priced, I might get jiped&amp;#34; but I didn&#x27;t. It came a day before expected delivery and works great. I wasn&#x27;t a fan of matte manicures until I tried this out for myself. It&#x27;s a STEAL. It was packaged impeccably,  in a bubble wrap envelope, wrapped in bubble wrap. I have nothing bad to say about this.</li>
            <li> In the past 6 months or so I have become a nail polish-o-holic, my collection at the moment has about 100 bottles of all sorts of polish: textured, holo, cremes, chromes, thermals, glitters, jellys, indie brands, mainstream brands, no name brands...and I MUST. HAVE. MORE.  So naturally I wanted to try a matte top coat to basically double the amount of looks that I could do with each polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been intrigued by matte nail polish for a while but was put off by a lot of negative views I had read on the look of matte nails, saying that it&#x27;s ugly, and it takes way longer to dry vs. quick dry shiny top coats, etc. But a lot of the swatches I had seen on my fave nail polish blogs looked just so sleek, modern, and classy that I had to give it a shot.  I did a bunch of research on the best matte top coat and came to the conclusion, based on mattifying comparisons (this one &amp;#34;matted&amp;#34; very well, while some only to a satin or rubbery look) and price here on Amazon, I decided, heck, why not?! (My usual decision making process on whether or not I should by a nail polish).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HECK YES I LOVE THIS TOP COAT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it ugly?&lt;br /&gt;F*NO! It&#x27;s fantabulously dumure and sexy at the same time!  I could not stop staring at my nails the first time I used it over Jade Diamond Velvet, an amazing purple duochrome that I loved without the top coat but I think I love even more with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it take forever to dry?&lt;br /&gt;F*NO! This dried SURPRISINGLY FAST.  It seemed to dry almost immediately, as you could see the matte effect morph from wet to dry within seconds on the nail.  But I didn&#x27;t try to touch it until after a couple minutes, and it felt dry enough for me to move on to something else.  Probably not dry enough to do the dishes but dry enough to put on a jacket and get into the car without ruining them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it again over a deep blue-green creme and I didn&#x27;t like it as much as over the chrome, so YMMV with the kind of polishes you prefer it over.  I have heard and seen that it looks great over a glitter, but I have yet to try (but soon!)  I also like mattifying black nail polish and then stamping with a black or white shiny polish, very classy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OPI is quality and I love their wide and flat brushes. BUY THIS POLISH!  You won&#x27;t regret it.prefer it over.  I have heard and seen that it looks great over a glitter, but I have yet to try (but soon!)

            <li> This matte coat works like a charm with every nail polish!! I&#x27;ve always thought that matte crayola nails come with the price of chalk like roughness on the surface of the nail - this coat takes all the tacky nail polish shine away and gives the smoothest &amp; softest finish!! 5/5</li>
            <li> I love this matte coat! Looks best on dark colors like black or navy! I must say though you must apply carefully as to not leave streaks.</li>
            <li> Love it, works just as it should. Dont see what the complaints were about. only used one application to get the matte finish and my nails look great.</li>
            <li> Love the color of this. It only takes two coats.</li>
            <li> It works very well!! And cheaper then if you bought it in stores. Word to the wise though, make sure your polish is at least 92% dry!</li>
            <li> At first I was a little weary when I put it on because I expected it to dull the color immediately. But once it dried, I fell in love. It works great and goes on nice and smooth. Yes, It is a bit more expensive than some of the others, but it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> This topcoat gives my mani a fresh new look. It dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t seem to chip easily. Just note that you can&#x27;t put a topcoat over it, but it kind of acts as a topcoat anyway. It&#x27;s a super fun look for all my favorite colors!</li>
            <li> I have been using this ever since I purchased it and I have not gone back to the shiny topcoat. I think it works wonderfully, I haven&#x27;t had any of the other problems I see people reporting. Maybe it just depends.</li>
            <li> Whether it&#x27;s to the whole nail or a mock french manicure I really like this product to change it up!</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to use this, even after buying because who doesn&#x27;t like shiny nails?  But I do like how the top coat turns out.  Until it dries it looks like any other shiny top coat, but I like the change of texture.  Makes my bright colors a little more muted, which is fun for fall.</li>
            <li> Love it! Works perfectly. It turns all my shiny polish to matte finish, save a lot of bucks. I would recomend this product</li>
            <li> Sucks. Only lasts  a day or so. I have  to reapply every day. If I dont it turns my nails white and causes a pasty look.</li>
            <li> its pretty cool, you just blow on it and it instantly turns your base color matte! great buy and inexpensive. love the bottle too lol</li>
            <li> I love that I can make all my polish matte look now. I much prefer that over shiny. And this lasts a good while.</li>
            <li> Goes on the nail color and finishes it in a beautiful Matte finish that has an almost suede appeal. I saw this in an Essence magazine and needed this look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Put it over red only on the tip... and it just took the manicure look to a whole new dimension... Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I rated this product a 5 star because it works on any nail polish. It is amazing. This is a &amp;#34;must buy&amp;#34; product !</li>
            <li> It arrived with bottle broken and nail polish was hardened.  Wasn&#x27;t even worth sending it back for a new one.</li>
            <li> Use to love shinny nails but this matte look is awesome people try it you will be surprised.  Not sure if I will ever go back to shinny again.  Just my preference.</li>
            <li> Great product  I recommend this ! Great for nails and toes. Make sure you paint corectly or you will see lines</li>
            <li> I brought this after seeing photos of how this looks when applied.  I took it to my nail salon and told them what I wanted. I am very pleased.  There are SO many things that can be done with this topcoat.  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Ive used it on several different glossy nail jobs and it always comes out looking fantastic and MATTE!</li>
            <li> Used it for acrylic nails and I love it! Dries fast and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> This really does a great job of mattifying! It&#x27;s super easy to get a really chic look with this top coat. It sort of looks a little too matte if that&#x27;s even possible, but just on an accent nail it looks really cool. I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> The matte finish is beautiful and it dries really quick. The brush can get a bit of the color on the tip but does not bleed into other colors. It is a great product</li>
            <li> Before this purchase I had tried home made recipes of matte top coats. It did not work. This one does the job, it is matte and it dries quick.</li>
            <li> Matte for sure. I needed to fix up a chip in some paint on my bike with matte finish. I tried it on my fingernail at first and man is this stuff hard. Even scratching at it deliberately for the next couple days, it took a while to remove. Excellent quality, even if you&#x27;re not looking to use it for cosmetic purposes.</li>
            <li> OPI! I absolutely love this matte top coat. It is light and dries ver easy. It is a must for pastels and spring/summer colors!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this matte finish! It&#x27;s different have not used any others! I saw a example on pinterest and wanted to try it!  The suggestion on Pinterest did not work for me so thought I&#x27;d just buy a bottle !</li>
            <li> Such a cool look. Loads of compliments!</li>
            <li> I am cray for nail art. so matte color gives different look to your nail. i preferred to have one of this.</li>
            <li> Great product ... gives a new touch to old  colors. Love it... world&#x27;s great as a top coat and as a mail hardener.</li>
            <li> Save me lots of money when I got to my nail tech.</li>
            <li> i loved this. i don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ll be getting bored with any of my polishes for a while. i don&#x27;t understand why some people had so much trouble with it. i did notice that to keep from streaking the nail color (especially black) i needed to use it generously. when i first started going over my black color i noticed that removing a lot of the excess top coat from the brush caused the color to streak. it dried in seconds. i&#x27;m very satisfied with it, and it looks great over hot pink.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty nice top coat! However after numerous manicures m nails began to chip after only two days. I don&#x27;t have this issue with other top coats that I use so it&#x27;s a little bit disappointing.</li>
            <li> Matte means matte and this top coat do what need to do in that way&lt;br /&gt;and have the good quality the Opi products have&lt;br /&gt;I like it and come back for more</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of wearing this alone. It looked like I had nothing on at all. I guess I was hoping for a touch more shine or maybe a slight white color.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what I had hoped. Great for putting a twist on your current nail polished. Highly recommend. It actually helped my nail polish stay on longer.</li>
            <li> This Top Coat Makes Any Manicure/Pedicure Look Amazing!! I Would Surely Buy This Again! A Lot Cheaper Than Store Prices!</li>
            <li> It was great! I used that top coat all time I&#x27;m ready to buy my second one. I get a lot of great compliments about it very often. Lol IM WEARING IT NOW! Buy it trust me it&#x27;s not a mistake&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One tiny downside&lt;br /&gt;It leaves white spots sometimes&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s still amazing</li>
            <li> Works like it should, really. I like putting this on my raw nails because it gives the neat effect that my nails are thicker and softer.&lt;br /&gt;It DOESN&#x27;T work well on multichromes or holographic nail polish. That should probably be expected, since the nail polishes rely on light to cause their effects, and this diminishes the brightness of light and removes the shine.&lt;br /&gt;My biggest complaint about this is that it dries so quickly. Usually that would be a good thing, but it&#x27;s so heavy that I can never fill my whole nail in one dip and by the time I dip it again to fill in more of my nail, the first swipe is already drying. For this reason it usually drags, applies unevenly, pulls nail polish under it off, or ends up being very thick and goopy if you aren&#x27;t quick about it. You have to get the perfect amount of the polish on the brush before you apply it, and then try to apply it all in one swipe. If you can do that, it works perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;Also expect a little cloudiness. As you can see, it&#x27;s not clear in the bottle, so it doesn&#x27;t dry perfectly clear either. It has a low-opacity white, cloudy effect. Also expect it to be a little hard to see when removing, just like clear nail polish.</li>
            <li> very good product but i think the price is a little too much. it catches on the nails really well, but peels fast and i am staying home for now.</li>
            <li> This gave me the look that I was going for, but only for a very limited amount of time. It took a very long time to dry completely and once it had I felt like my nail color chipped more quickly than usual. The nice matte look I was going for lasted about a day.</li>
            <li> absolutely love it. Fast dry and ut actually works.</li>
            <li> This top coat went on for me just like any other top coat would and dried very quickly. I loved the result, even when tried on a light pastel color which lots of people say matte won&#x27;t work for. My only complaint is that it leaves behind that strong nail polish smell for quite a while after it dries.</li>
            <li> Great for nail designs and to just do something a little more interesting with your mani. Also dries pretty quick as well.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! It works perfectly and looks so cool! I use it all the time and it creates such a cool effect!</li>
            <li> Works perfect and makes nails look great.</li>
            <li> The product works very well. You can honestly make any polish matte. And I typically love OPI products- they are the best. I must say, this polish could be better at NOT chipping. It doesn&#x27;t chip the day you use it, but I expected a bit more time with the mani, with this product coming from OPI</li>
            <li> I love it and it works great!</li>
            <li> Great product! Must reapply here and again but it works great!</li>
            <li> It gets the job done. You do have to reapply every few days to keep the matte look.</li>
            <li> Loved it. Fast shipping. Looked great on</li>
            <li> Yes, I love OPI polishes.  This one makes any polish matte.  It works fine.  But I&#x27;ve realized I&#x27;m not a matte girl.  It turns a beautiful shiny polish into a rather boring color.  Just saying . ..</li>
            <li> works amazing and turns anything into matte. Plus the bottle is soo cute. I dont recommend using it with anything sparkly because it looks awful.</li>
            <li> I love the matte top coat it gives my nails a chalky look without dulling out the color. It works best with dark colors though because you can&#x27;t really tell it&#x27;s on when you put it over a bright color, but it does (surprisingly) look good with bright orange :)</li>
            <li> Smooth to apply, quick dry, protects nail polish from chipping, it is a very good product and I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love this nail polish. Since it is a matte top coat, you double the looks you can achieve with your current nail polish collection with one bottle.</li>
            <li> This is not the absolute matte-est topcoat out there, but the formula is consistently great (as is to be expected from O.P.I.). It can be used for lots of fun nail art designs -- I like to put on a coat of this and then paint on delicate designs with a thin, ultra-shiny topcoat for contrast. Looks excellent over dense micro-glitters.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to use this product because of the awesome look. At first, it was so pretty but then after about 12 hours or so the top coat looked as if it was rubbing off. Now its the next day and my nails are shiny again. I added another coat and now the black looks cloudy and ugly. Too bad</li>
            <li> I love this nail polish! It dried quick and I only needed one coat. You cant really go wrong with opi.</li>
            <li> Love the edgy look this polish top coat creates. Nice packaging and sleek look. Cant wait to try this on all sorts of colors</li>
            <li> It is what is says.  You paint it over the finished nail and it makes the color flat and matte.  I like to use it to add a nail design or a feature nail as the color is very flat once the topcoat is applied.</li>
            <li> This is such a neat polish. I have found so much to do with it. One bit of advice is to put your top coat on before using this matte top coat encase you don&#x27;t use it on the whole nail....a little trick I learned...</li>
            <li> LOOVEE i&#x27;m matteing even my own nail without polish.  i absolutely love it.  once i runs out i&#x27;m buying another one. dasss it</li>
            <li> I bought this after seeing several nail designs on Sephora using the matte/glossy combination.  This is easy to use and there are some great tutorials online, through Sephora and YouTube.  Check them out and you will find some very sophisticated designs that are demure for the office but still artistic.</li>
            <li> I love this nail polish. It just gives that sophisticated matte look. It&#x27;s perfect. But a little advance it does take some time to dry. But over all it&#x27;s great :)</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE. !!! Work&#x27;s great, but you have to re apply in a couple of day because my nails started chipping.</li>
            <li> Got it when it said. Put it on and I love it. Will most def order more of this when I run out!</li>
            <li> Works great! Love the brand and it was a good price! Arrived quickly and there wasn&#x27;t any damage or anything to the bottle.</li>
            <li> Opi is great and this matte top coat does what it claims.</li>
            <li> It chips quite a lot. Looks pretty at first though!</li>
            <li> If you know how to work it, It&#x27;s super awesome!</li>
            <li> This is the best purchase ever ! It is good I just used to do my nails and they look awesome...</li>
            <li> I like how easily this top coat goes on and how fast it dries, but like others have said, it makes the paint very brittle and then it chips off very quickly. It only lasts a couple days before it starts chipping like crazy.</li>
            <li> It look nice when you first put it on, but the matte in it goes away after a couple of days. It leaves little white spots and it chips really easily.</li>
            <li> I should note I have never bought a matte top coat before, and I was extremely surprised at how well it worked. I would not have thought it possible to turn my glimmery nail polishes into those neat matte finishes without buying every color over again in matte. That said, not all colors look good in matte, but that is not why I have docked it down to 4 stars out of 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Matte coat does not work well if you are going to use two colors. I tried doing a small design on a nail to attempt something I saw online and painted over it with matte, and ended up having to redo the entire nail because it streaked so bad. I figured that perhaps I had not waited long enough, so I painted half of a fake nail so I could just leave it out as long as possible to see if it was my problem or the polish. The next morning, I painted the matte coat over and it -still- streaked! As if it somehow re-wet the nail polish and dragged it across the nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may try using a thin clear top coat and -then- going over with matte top coat and hoping that works. You must have a steady hand to use this as well and make sure you put down very even layers; it does not seem to \\&quot;settle\\&quot; like other nail polishes and won&#x27;t smooth out on its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if you paint over one color and do so smoothly, this matte coat will work wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: It works well with the small details if you put on a top coat, and that seems to solve the streaking as well :)</li>
            <li> I was so excited to use this!!! I was so disappointed when I used this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently due to what is needed to make the formula matte (cornstarch) the surface becomes brittle and the nail color chips VERY easily.</li>
            <li> This product makes polishes sooooo versatile, and pretty much gives you a brand new color with just a simple step! Totally recommend this product~</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Works perfectly. Every nail polish I have becomes matte in several seconds. That&#x27;s wonderful. I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> It took me a few tries to figure out how to apply this; at first, it looked a little streaky/dirty. After experimenting a little I found an application method that worked for me (wait for the top coat to be completely and totally dry, then quick up-and-down strokes to apply this, no side to side).</li>
            <li> I am an avid OPI fan, so I was stoked to see a Matte Top Coat from OPI. HOWEVER, this product wrecks the nail polish color and leaves behind a streaky uneven mess, it literally pulls the color right off. I am pretty experienced using nail polish and even worked for Ulta so I even know the techniques and tricks when applying special nail polishes like this one but every technique I have tried has failed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a base coat with one layer of color, allowed to dry and then the Matte coat, epic failure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a base coat, two layers of color, allowed to dry, applied Matte coat, epic failure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried NO base coat, one layer of color, allowed to dry and then the Matte coat, epic failure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried NO base coat, two layers of color, allowed to dry, applied Matte coat, epic failure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AND THEN I even tried no base coat, two layers of color, allowed to dry for 24 hours, applied Matte coat sparingly, epic failure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No matter what, no matter how much or how little I tried to work this Matte coat, it is truly an epic failure. How this got such high reviews I am unsure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep giving this a try and when I finally perfect a technique that seems tangible I will place a follow-up post for others to use!</li>
            <li> So far so good. I&#x27;m just trying it out on all types of polish and art. Looks pretty cool really. The only polish that I haven&#x27;t really seen too much of a &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34;ness is on the metallic ones. Not bad though. I will probably buy it again :)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t love this product enough. It is so gorgeous.</li>
            <li> cool stuff, shipped fast</li>
            <li> This really works great. I loved it. I don&#x27;t have any issues with it at all and I would recommend buying. I used it to do this cool nail design. Have fun!</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my granddaughter and I am sure she will like it.  It came in a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> Really awesome top coat and it dries really quickly! I really liked how it made my nails look. Only downside is that it will fade away and your nails will be shiny again in a couple of days. If you don&#x27;t mind, then I&#x27;d definitely recommend buying this!</li>
            <li> never thought id like matte so much and especially on top of black nail polish oh my gosh its go amazing and stylish</li>
            <li> Matte wears off within a day.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! Great product!</li>
            <li> i love doing my nails matte so i got this nail polish and an orly one and they both get the job done really well. this opi one probably does a better job because it dries up faster.</li>
            <li> Love!  Great service!</li>
            <li> Excellent... Love the look of matte. Just be sure to completely dry nails before applying!!!</li>
            <li> i love this product, makes my at home manicure looked polished and ready to go.highly recommend this product to anyone</li>
            <li> THIS TOP COAT IS PERFECT. IT DRIES INSTANTLY &amp; YOU SEE RESULTS INSTANTLY!</li>
            <li> I love the smooth application and long lasting power of OPI nail lacquers.  This polish lives up to OPI&#x27;s high standards.  The application was smooth and it dried really quickly (always a plus with a 2 month old baby, I really don&#x27;t have time to wait for my nails to dry!) It was dry to the touch after about 30 seconds and no longer soft after 5 minutes.  However, I wouldn&#x27;t do anything crazy that could ruin your nails for a while after just in case. The top coat created a nice flat matte (not satin) topcoat with a tiny bit of a milky or foggy look to it.  The foggy look lessened after a few hours.  After 3 days there started to be some wear on my nail tips and it started looking more satin in appearance.  I took it off after 5 days of wear because my tips were looking pretty shabby.  Not bad considering how hard I am on my nails. Overall, another great product from OPI, you won&#x27;t regret this purchase!</li>
            <li> love this matte ! easy to use, dries fairly quickly. Unfortunately it makes the base polish chip but is great for last minute diy paint job.</li>
            <li> I would recomend this product to everyone who is looking for that matte color finish! It was exactly what I wanted. shipping was extremely fast as well.. Money WELL spent!!</li>
            <li> Love love love! Transforms any polish you have into a sleek, matte manicure! Will definitely be ordering aagain.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, the finish is a  beautiful matte, You can create a lot of cute designs using this matte coat.I did not think this would be worth it but I&#x27;am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I like this and it works, how ever if you touch a lot of oil and hair products, it will begin to fade quickly</li>
            <li> Seriously, this stuff is awesome. It works great. I used it over my gold Ice nail polish and it instantly turned matte. Dries within seconds as well. A must have if you like the matte look!</li>
            <li> Every matte chips after a few days, but this one is the best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> this is great for a less shiny nail color. unless you have brown nail polish then it looks odd.</li>
            <li> I love this product a lot, I just wish it lasted longer. After about 2 days, you can barely tell you used this top coat.</li>
            <li> I tried this out on a variety of styles, and I love them all! It was a bit less matte than I was expecting, but if you put it over a really glossy nail polish, it looks great.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it&#x27;s intended to do. Bottles wrapped and packaged securely to avoid breakage.</li>
            <li> Nice topcoat that gives your a matte look, very nice if you don&#x27;t want to go ut &amp; buy all colored matte nailpolish.</li>
            <li> It is magnificent, fine as on the Picture, corresponds to the Description, fast Delivery, high Quality of a product, I am completely satisfied with Purchase</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect when I ordered this product but was pleasantly surprised! The matte coating lasted a week or so before it started chipping off - which is pretty standard for me anyway, so the reviews mentioning chipping more easily didn&#x27;t ring true for me. I love having a matte top coat because it totally changes the color of the polish. I included a pic of my Halloween nails because that&#x27;s what I first used the matte top coat on and I loved how the neon orange and black looked afterward!</li>
            <li> JUS WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR A TOP COAT THAT TURNS ANY POLISH TO MATTE!!!!!! Super fast shipping will buy more thank you!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This nailpolish does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to--it makes your typical nailpolish colors matte. I found that I was able to paint over it just fine if I wanted to add details, as well. I think it was definitely a good buy.</li>
            <li> I bought this in preparation for this coming fall, 2013, and couldn&#x27;t be happier! I couldn&#x27;t help but try it out already. It made my navy blue nail look fantastic and as soon as It cools off enough I am going to rock some matte oxblood.</li>
            <li> The liquid is a little thick, but it&#x27;s really easy to apply and I found that it dries relatively quickly, too.  I&#x27;ve had it on for a few days and done dishes without any chipping or change in the appearance.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what I wanted. It is a awesome MATTE top coat. Makes any color have a matte finish AND it dries fast! PERFECT!</li>
            <li> i always wanted a matte top coat and i finally decided on this one! i love it!! its great&lt;br /&gt;one coat is enough to get the matte look&lt;br /&gt;highly recommend to others!!</li>
            <li> when i put it over my nail polish it would matte and look great. but after a shower the matte would basically be gine and there was much to it. it works but doesn&#x27;t stay.. so basically its pointles</li>
            <li> The top coat makes my polish crack after two or three days. Otherwise, good product.</li>
            <li> This polish is really cool, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to work too well as a top coat. Whenever I take a hot shower it starts to peel off. I have to do a normal top coat and then this matte finish top coat. Was expecting more from OPI.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Love it so much</li>
            <li> Maybe its just because I&#x27;ve never tried the matte look before, but it didn&#x27;t look good. Just looked like unfinished nail polish.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 18 and I do my nails just about once a week. This matte coat is fantastic! It&#x27;s the first one I&#x27;ve ever bought and I wouldn&#x27;t try any other. Plus the price I paid is less than I would at target for opi nail polish. I recommend this for darker colors only.</li>
            <li> i love this!!! it is a great brand of matte top coat! it dries fairly fast and is really matte top. and it also came fast</li>
            <li> Everything OK! Recommended</li>
            <li> It was fast delivery and exactly what I wanted! I tested it out on one of my nails and it dried quickly and was perfect! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Arrived in two days, sooner than expected.  Safely bubble wrapped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I immediately tried it out with great results.  I like it best as an accent nail but it&#x27;s also a classy way to make tips on a creamy base.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s freakin  awesome !!makes every color matte and i love it!</li>
            <li> This polish is good for changing an existing color and dulling the polish so it&#x27;s not so shiny. I use it to create a neat look with darker colors.</li>
            <li> This top coat doubles ever single nail polish you already have.  Im obsessed.  I dropped it and broke it when I was in the airport, had another one ordered before I even got on the plane.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I got the results I was expecting every time I use this product. Its well worth the money</li>
            <li> Has a lot of utility and quality contents. even at 0.5 oz, this product feels like it has a lot of coating inside it.</li>
            <li> I love the look of the matte finish, but WHOA, it chips SO easily.  Both time I used it, the product chipped off within a day.  Not sure what it does to the polish, but it obviously makes it very brittle.  I do not recommend. :/</li>
            <li> Works with any nail polish... Love it! I love OPI and this matte top coat does wonders. I use it when I want that matte finish look</li>
            <li> It goes on easy, dries quickly, and leaves a nice matte finish.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;But then again, so are most OPI products.</li>
            <li> it looks great and does dry really fast. however it chips easily but still looks cute. i like the matte look</li>
            <li> This matte nail polish actually works. I love it. I use it in patterns and a top many different colors. I&#x27;m in love with it.</li>
            <li> Awesome formula love it!</li>
            <li> bought it to my girlfriend and she liked it!&lt;br /&gt;you can use it on any color but be careful the first color needs to be very dry if not the mate will take the color off.</li>
            <li> Great product! Works great! I love O.P.I products, and China Glaze products! Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start off by saying all matte top coats are porous, so by their nature they won&#x27;t wear as long as glossy polish. Having said that, the OPI matte top coat lasts just as long and reapplies better than most other matte tops I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works great on top of gel manicures! If you&#x27;re hooked on LED gels like me, this polish works great to matte down the ultra-wet appearance of LED-cured gel polishes. If you want the look of completely nude nails for any reason (fashion, dress code, acting, etc), but you don&#x27;t want to sacrifice that protective shield of your super-strong gel manicures, try applying OPI Matte Top Coat over your clear OPI LED-cured manicure. No one will ever know your nails aren&#x27;t nude, and they won&#x27;t chip on every doorknob or keyboard. Added a photo:</li>
            <li> Does what it says, creates a matte finish! Only problem is it seems to make the nail polish chip more easily.</li>
            <li> i love matte colors so i knew i had to try this.  it goes on so easy and dries instantly.  the only issue is...like others have said...it chips very easily.</li>
            <li> just what i wanted, and a thin layer over a dark polish, like black, gives a nique look i love,</li>
            <li> This actually works and looks very pretty, but the only problem is it makes my polish cop by the next day. I&#x27;m guessing it really dries the polish out to get that matte finish</li>
            <li> dont wast your money.. it dont even last a day and chips and peals with in a few hr&#x27;s even on your toe&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Awesome matte top coat. The best I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> Its gives any nail polish matte look and my nails go chipfree for four days!!! Normally it starts chipping after a day even if a use the best top coats!</li>
            <li> Love this top coat! makes any color seem matte!</li>
            <li> Quick dry matte polish! Great finish!</li>
            <li> Chips almost right away... not my favorite.</li>
            <li> Wow every time I use this as a top coat it acts as a remover and my initial polish comes off and yes I waited for them to completely dry.. I unfortunately do not recommend this product</li>
            <li> lovely and works well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;m ever posting review about anything on amazon.  This matte top coat is AMAZING. If it didn&#x27;t work out on you chances are you are doing it wrong! If you&#x27;re all thumbs, then go to salon and ask a professional to do your nails. In all other cases it&#x27;s the best product ever!    Dries instantly!!     Tips:  1) Use it only after your base color is absolutely dry!! And apply it all over your finger. Even on skin. So when it dries it covers the whole nail. It doesn&#x27;t leave anything on your skin.  2) For dark painted nails you may have to use it twice.  3) Use in only one direction from the bottom to the top or it will leave traces  4) Apply good solid layer at once</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Gives a great matte coverage.</li>
            <li> (one picture is after you put on the top coat and after ive worn it all day). im very disappointed with this. the matte finish wears off and is shiny within hours. i dont know if this requires more coats to stay matte??? but i painted my nails last night and this morning after my shower they were prettu shiny. i would advise against wasting your money on this and buy a better product.</li>
            <li> very quick and easy coat, just makes it easier to chip though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty disappointed in this product.  Not only are my nails still shiny (I tried a thin coat, a thick coat and even two coats of the top coat) but they were chipping the next day.  Not worth the price, I will definitely not be repurchasing :(</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I purchased this item! Now I just need more colors to try it on. Any suggestions?</li>
            <li> I was kind of skeptical about this top coat because 1) I&#x27;ve never used any kind of matte polish before and 2) I wasn&#x27;t sure if a top coat would perform as well as a matte color. Since I had a giftcard, I thought why not give it a go...and it was totally worth it!&lt;br /&gt;I used it on my toes over Ulta&#x27;s Envy nail color, and it looks great. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;d look better if I were better on putting on nail polish (unsteady hands don&#x27;t help), but it looks so cool. It absolutely works; it took the sheen right out of the green. It definitely gives the nail a different texture and it seems like it might chip more easily, but I think that&#x27;s just how matte is. Nothing has chipped yet, so I&#x27;m definitely giving this 5 stars. I will say though, and I can&#x27;t tell if this is due to my lack of talent at painting nails or not, but it does seem a bit streaky. I&#x27;m going to stand behind my 5 stars anyway, because I can&#x27;t prove if it&#x27;s me or not, but if someone with talent says it&#x27;s streaky, that&#x27;s the ONLY negative remark I have. And it not super streaky, just a bit more-so than the regular polish. Again, I&#x27;m terrible at painting nails, so it could be me. If you&#x27;re thinking about trying it, give it a go!</li>
            <li> This is a great product and price. I can use any nail polish and make it matte. I won&#x27;t have to spend as much as the salon.</li>
            <li> This matte top coat is great. I&#x27;ve tried mattes in a few other brands, and this OPI is the best so far!</li>
            <li> works great. but only meant to last one day, if that! Very easy to chip! Im done with the matte look!</li>
            <li> This matte top coat is so awesome and effective! Who needs different colors of matte nail polish when you can do with this fantastic item!!!</li>
            <li> Does it&#x27;s job, definitely mattifies any nail polish you put on.  I bought this because I heard it helps remove streaks from nail polish you apply and it definitely helps a lot.  I wouldn&#x27;t say it removes all streaks totally but it&#x27;s a big enough of a difference that I will continue to use this product for.  I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Love this nail polish</li>
            <li> works great and dries super fast!</li>
            <li> I have only used this with one color so far, but I really like how it looks. I haven&#x27;t painted my nails in FOREVER because I am VERY impatient and hate waiting for them to dry, but this is a problem solver. It dries within just a couple of minutes. Just make sure each coat of your nail polish of choice is completely dry, or at least very close (about 10 minutes), before applying the Matte Top Coat. The only complaint I have about this product, like many other reviewers, is that it chips fairly easily. The nail polish even starts to crack after about 2 days. However, this being the only complaint I have, I would definitely recommend this top coat.</li>
            <li> When using this product it dries quickly. As a top coat it doesn&#x27;t seal in as well so becareful of water. Also this type of product shouldn&#x27;t be used with a nude color. Overall, easy to receive and fast. Very fortunate to have found this at such a price online!</li>
            <li> shipped really fast and product came well</li>
            <li> I have seen this matte finish manicure all over the place lately- and I&#x27;m a do it yourself kinda gal when it comes to my manicures and pedicures, so I was thrilled to see this not only on Amazon but in the OPI brand!  I immediately removed what I was wearing and did a black matte finish french manicure. I received a ton of compliments and the color lasted all week without one single chip! I didn&#x27;t do any &amp;#34;deep&amp;#34; household cleaning this week - I thought I needed to &amp;#34;come clean&amp;#34; (ha, ha) about that - but normally I would have at least one chip or two - but not with my ever trusted OPI. Great polish and great look, especially if your looking for something a little different. If you&#x27;ve seen your manicurist do it for you, don&#x27;t be afraid to do it yourself, it&#x27;s really not that hard to replicate. And super bonus - it dries super fast! I&#x27;m in love with matte finish!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. This top coat really does work. When I use it I totally get the matte look I was going for.</li>
            <li> I love the matte look and it actually seems to last longer than my usual polish without the matte on top!</li>
