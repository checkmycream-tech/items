            <li>We have given some of the bars to friends and they love them.</li>

            <li>This is a perfect soap for my dry dehydrated skin ...</li>
            <li>This soap was what I expected, and arrived rapidly and in excellent condition.</li>
            <li>The scent was so strong I could smell it in another room.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it will make them feel special.</li>
            <li>Perfect little &amp;#34;hotel size&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I love the fresh scent of the Eartherapy</li>
            <li>Light, pine/refreshing scent.  </li>
            <li>my skin has never felt so smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Used this soap at a resort I recently visited, great scent</li>
            <li>The smell is a very fresh clean smell</li>
            <li>Clean scent, not perfumey.  </li>
            <li>The hotel version was a bit larger, although this size bar lasted a week, so I&#x27;m good.</li>
            <li>We really appreciated the soaps slight herbal odor and excellent lather.  </li>
            <li>Worth the 20 pack.</li>
            <li>and I really feel clean after using it.</li>
            <li>Great soap, even the small bars last long and smell great.  </li>
            <li>Love this soap...used it on our recent vacations at Wyndham resorts...</li>
            <li>First found these while staying at a hotel in California.  </li>
            <li>Never use hot water if your have a skin problem ..</li>
            <li>Good soap, but too small.</li>
            <li>We would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to scented things</li>

            <li>it accually arrived a day or two early</li>
            <li>the soap is a off white, nice thick block - it&#x27;s 1.5 oz and probably too big for our needs, some guests leave the bar behind, hardly used - I would be happy with a product less than 1oz, but there aren&#x27;t many quality options - so we will continue to purchase this one.</li>
            <li>I only wish they made it in a full size bar because 1.5 oz does not last very long foe showers.</li>
            <li>Having sensitive skin all my life, I&#x27;ve finally found what works for me!!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this soap. The smell is a very fresh clean smell</li>
            <li> I love the fresh scent of the Eartherapy products.&lt;br /&gt;I had used some when I traveled last and the bar was bigger-like a 3 oz.&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t see anywhere to order a bar that size?&lt;br /&gt;The smaller ones work - just thinking was getting more for my money in terms&lt;br /&gt;of the size?</li>
            <li> Perfect little &amp;#34;hotel size&amp;#34; soaps for our AirBnb apartment.  Light, pine/refreshing scent.  Clean scent, not perfumey.  I chose this soap for the reviews and the packaging. I don&#x27;t like the cellophane plastic wrappers, wanted something of quality.  the soap is a off white, nice thick block - it&#x27;s 1.5 oz and probably too big for our needs, some guests leave the bar behind, hardly used - I would be happy with a product less than 1oz, but there aren&#x27;t many quality options - so we will continue to purchase this one.</li>
            <li> Love this soap...used it on our recent vacations at Wyndham resorts...my skin has never felt so smooth and moisturized. ..the scent is soothing and addictive. Bars are a wee bit bigger than the guest bars at the resort. ❤️</li>
            <li> Good soap, but too small.</li>
            <li> Excellent soap,aromatic.a good buy.</li>
            <li> Eartherapy has the most wonderful smell. We found it being supplied by a hotel in Williamsburg Va. I went online and found it. Ordered enough for my sister and me. I wish it came in larger sizes.</li>
            <li> best smelling soap ever</li>
            <li> This may be the worse smelling soap ever.  I could not imagine using this for guests.  The scent was so strong I could smell it in another room.</li>
            <li> Used this soap at a resort I recently visited, great scent and I really feel clean after using it. I wish the bars were bigger but I miss read the sizes, lesson well learned.  Still a great soap.</li>
            <li> My husband and I stayed at our timeshare a few weeks ago and this was one of the few &amp;#34;upgrades&amp;#34; that we were given. We love the scent.

            <li> Smells so good!  hard cake lasts a while, yet lathers well.</li>
            <li> Having sensitive skin all my life, I&#x27;ve finally found what works for me!! However, I wish the bars were 1.7oz, then I wouldn&#x27;t need to order them so frequently...&lt;br /&gt;But I Love this product!!!</li>
            <li> The soap bars have an outstanding pine - like scent.  I only wish they made it in a full size bar because 1.5 oz does not last very long foe showers.</li>
            <li> Great soap, even the small bars last long and smell great.  Some of the nicer hotels are using this soap and we bought this package to have at home.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for this then you know what it is. Worth the 20 pack.</li>
            <li> I took a chance, hoping that this was the scent of soap found at WorldMark resorts everywhere, which many people comment about. It&#x27;s not. It has a milder scent that&#x27;s still fresh but not delicious and pine-y like the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh well!</li>
            <li> Went to one of my time share resort in January of 2014.the hotel uses eartherapy products and after my wife and I used the soap we both agreed it was a soap we would like to use from now on.It smelled great,it makes your body feels very clean.We love this soap alot.</li>
            <li> First found these while staying at a hotel in California.  I loved the scent so much I saved the wrapper and found them on Amazon!  Very nice to tuck in with towels and sheets before I use them as soap.</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful. We first experienced Eartherapy body soap at our Wyndham resorts we visited. These are fantastic - they suds up well, smell like piney woods and are great in all respects. We have given some of the bars to friends and they love them.</li>
            <li> This soap was what I expected, and arrived rapidly and in excellent condition. My wife and I had an opportunity to sample the Eartherapy soap during a recent stay in San Francisco at the Donatello Hotel.  We really appreciated the soaps slight herbal odor and excellent lather.  We would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This was what was supplied at a hotel where I stayed.  The hotel version was a bit larger, although this size bar lasted a week, so I&#x27;m good. Smells nice, too.</li>
            <li> I found this soap at a resort ..I had  forgotten my usual soap .I have a real problem with hard water and soaps that dry ...This is a perfect soap for my dry dehydrated skin ...I use it with lukewarm water  and its perfect ...Never use hot water if your have a skin problem ..</li>
            <li> I was very happy with my order it accually arrived a day or two early so I was very happy</li>
            <li> The product is okay. I started to send it back but decided I would use as an anti bacterial soap to wash my hands.  I was hoping that it was Eartherapy Savon Soap which I had the pleasure of using while I was at a resort a few weeks ago. The Savon Aroma is so soothing to the senses. It comes in a 1.76oz bar.</li>
