            <li>It was very easy to wash off with water and non-irritating to skin.</li>

            <li>I thought the stickiness might bother me or my skin, but I forgot about it and felt comfortable all day!</li>
            <li>I would say that this is more a tool to keep socks in place.</li>
            <li>I love this roll on to keep my thigh-high stockings up.</li>
            <li>works as described, pleased with product.</li>
            <li>This product works like magic.</li>
            <li>But I still love this.</li>
            <li>I imagine it would work anywhere but very much love for competitive gymnastics.</li>
            <li>I love this for using on lace front wigs.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for many years.  </li>
            <li>Have been using this product for many years.</li>
            <li>I love how it rolls on my skin smoothly.</li>
            <li>It certainly is not the best product for that because it doesn&#x27;t  hold the weight of the forms.  </li>
            <li>Washes out easily with water.  </li>
            <li>Does not irritate the skin and is easy to remove.</li>
            <li>After she&#x27;s done it&#x27;s easily washed off with no skin irritation.  </li>
            <li>liquid washes off easily.</li>
            <li>It easily washes off with water in the shower.</li>
            <li>Yes it&#x27;s suuuuper sticky and according to my daughter and friends-not a great experience when pulling said fabric back off to remove costume, but it solves the costume problems many of us were experiencing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and washes off with soap and water.</li>
            <li>I am sure it would be great for other more lightweight usages.  </li>
            <li>Product seems to work fine.</li>
            <li>The adhesive works great, the product bottle is different from the picture.</li>
            <li>The adhesive roll-on glues the fabric to my skin, keeping the stockings comfortably in place.</li>
            <li>I actually bought this product to keep a wig in place and it worked great.</li>
            <li>my daughter used a friends who had something similar and it worked great.</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>It Stays&amp;#34; to securely glue wigs onto my scalp.</li>
            <li>When it came, I was so excited.</li>
            <li>Love this product ;-)</li>
            <li>This is great, The smell isnt bad and the stickiness is awesome.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work as good as I had hoped but for simple light weight things</li>
            <li>This seems to work pretty well, but if you&#x27;re hoping it will help keep up socks that don&#x27;t really stay up on their own</li>
            <li>I&#x27;very used this for many years.  </li>
            <li>Cleans off pretty easy too.</li>
            <li>A quick squirt of water on it, will take it off.  </li>
            <li>Older formula is better but this works well</li>
            <li>and it really works well and washes off easily.</li>
            <li>IT DOES EXACTLY WHAT IT ADVERTISES!  </li>
            <li>I have been wearing a thigh high compression stocking for many years and the only way that it stays up comfortably throughout the day is by using this glue at the top of the thigh to keep it up.  </li>
            <li>First time having a clean package&lt;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not afraid to hug people or go out in the wind anymore .</li>
            <li>br /&gt;noo leaking, is worth my time and money.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but it is worth it if you wear a wig and prefer not to have it slip.</li>
            <li>All in all, I have had a very positive experience  with this product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s job and sticks things to your skin, however, at the slightest mention of sweat, everything slides right off.</li>
            <li>the hold doesn&#x27;t seem quite right</li>
            <li>If it says &amp;#34;It Stays&amp;#34;, you&#x27;ve got the right stuff regardless of who the distributor may be.</li>
            <li>and it comes right off.  </li>
            <li>Also, comes right off when you wash your hose by hand or in the washer.</li>
            <li>Clear, easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>A quick swipe of this glue, and it really IT STAYS.  </li>
            <li>Works pretty well could be stronger</li>
            <li>Her source doubled the price which was already higher than Amazon&#x27;s</li>
            <li>It holds and is not uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li>First off, when I received the package, the adhesive was everywhere, the lid was still sealed, but it was seeping out of the sides and was just all over the place.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to, and it does it well.</li>
            <li>WAY better than the double sided tapes.</li>
            <li>I have been using It Stays, or various rebranding of it, for many years.</li>
            <li>Only tried once so far...but seemed to stick and washes off your skin easily.</li>
            <li>This is a cheap imitation and NOT the original product shown in the photo.</li>
            <li>There is another company called the Drug Supply Store that sells the real deal.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Again thanks for sending me your products intact</li>
            <li>This stuff really works and it&#x27;s water-soluble.  </li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>Holds clothes very well</li>
            <li>It keeps clothing in place very well.  </li>
            <li>This product works very well with my thigh compression sleeve.  </li>
            <li>I used this for thigh highs and it really did keep them up.</li>
            <li>Really.  </li>
            <li>When still wet, it has a strong alcohol smell, and If you have not used it before, you might want to be aware that is has a different, but also strong and very specific, though not necessarily unpleasant, lingering odor.</li>
            <li>The roller works well and keeps things clean and simple</li>
            <li>The good news is that to reapply isn&#x27;t a big deal ...just roll it over the area again and press down.</li>
            <li>It works beautifully, yet is not at all difficult to loosen when time to remove the hosiery.  </li>
            <li>For first time users, I would recommend letting the site dry thoroughly before putting anything else over the place where you applied the adhesive and the piece of clothing you are trying to make stay in one place, as this stuff is super sticky until dry.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It Stays was loaned to me by a friend because we were talking about keeping my knee high hose up.  </li>
            <li>She had found out about it from someone that wears thigh high nylons.  </li>
            <li>This product really works keeping her covered and modest even in shorter outfits.</li>
            <li>no more leotard creeping up (in a most inappropriate way)or top slouching down.</li>
            <li>I understand that this is because the adhesive washes off with water, but I do not typically sweat much</li>
            <li>This new bottle -</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t be without and if I can find it at a lesser price than local medical supply stores, well, that just makes it even better.</li>
            <li>Sometimes if you dry the area a bit and press in place it will stick again, but might need something stronger if in a moist climate area (although I did fine at a moderate temperature beach one day).</li>
            <li>She had a problem which resulted in the loss of her natural hair.</li>
            <li>That was nearly a quarter of the product gone already.</li>
            <li>When I received it was in a soft envelop.  </li>
            <li>When you get through wearing it, it wipes right off with your bath or shower or you can take a wet paper towel or wash cloth</li>
            <li>The roll still works just as it should, and I personally love the product otherwise, but this bottle in particular is broken.</li>
            <li>The generic versions are exactly the same as the name brands, except for the fonts and colors of the label and cap.</li>
            <li>Due to it&#x27;s solubility in water, It may not work well if you are sweating in a hot and humid environment.</li>
            <li>The ball inside doesn&#x27;t roll very well at all and the product stays to wet to create the stick needed to make the bra work.  </li>
            <li>Works fantastic at keeping my socks from riding down into my tennis shoes!!!</li>
            <li>the roller ball doesn&#x27;t roll very well, and the adhesive seems to have less &amp;#34;staying power&amp;#34;.</li>

            <li> It Stays was loaned to me by a friend because we were talking about keeping my knee high hose up.  </li>
            <li> She had found out about it from someone that wears thigh high nylons.  </li>
            <li> This product really works keeping her covered and modest even in shorter outfits.</li>
            <li> no more leotard creeping up (in a most inappropriate way)or top slouching down.</li>
            <li> I understand that this is because the adhesive washes off with water, but I do not typically sweat much</li>
            <li> This new bottle -</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t be without and if I can find it at a lesser price than local medical supply stores, well, that just makes it even better.</li>
            <li> Sometimes if you dry the area a bit and press in place it will stick again, but might need something stronger if in a moist climate area (although I did fine at a moderate temperature beach one day).</li>
            <li> She had a problem which resulted in the loss of her natural hair.</li>
            <li> That was nearly a quarter of the product gone already.</li>
            <li> When I received it was in a soft envelop.  </li>
            <li> When you get through wearing it, it wipes right off with your bath or shower or you can take a wet paper towel or wash cloth</li>
            <li> The roll still works just as it should, and I personally love the product otherwise, but this bottle in particular is broken.</li>
            <li> The generic versions are exactly the same as the name brands, except for the fonts and colors of the label and cap.</li>
            <li> Due to it&#x27;s solubility in water, It may not work well if you are sweating in a hot and humid environment.</li>
            <li> The ball inside doesn&#x27;t roll very well at all and the product stays to wet to create the stick needed to make the bra work.  </li>
            <li> Works fantastic at keeping my socks from riding down into my tennis shoes!!!</li>
            <li> the roller ball doesn&#x27;t roll very well, and the adhesive seems to have less &amp;#34;staying power&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It was a true game changer in how I felt while wearing my cranial prosthesis.</li>
            <li> It really does wash off with plain water!</li>
            <li> It stays put for long time.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had it very long</li>
            <li> Keeps wigs in place all day long without any slipping.</li>
            <li> A loose bra, loose bra strap, a loose stocking.  </li>
            <li> I use it to keep my wig down in the back.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s difficult to keep the top band in place, a few strokes of this adhesive applied to the bank will end the problem!  </li>
            <li> but when it arrived the safety seal was broken and the bottle was leaking slightly and now the lid does not fit securely.</li>
            <li> The younger girls wear white &amp;#34;poodle socks&amp;#34; and you can imagine how hard it would be to keep them up without &amp;#34;sock glue&amp;#34; as they call it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for my intended purpose, but has other stated applications as well.</li>
            <li> Maybe other this it would work for but not wigs</li>
            <li> So then I have a dark pink mark on my skin.</li>
            <li> While experiencing temporary baldness due to chemotherapy, I used this product &amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve taken to putting the bottle in a Ziploc bag to keep it from gooping up other items.</li>
            <li> The adhesive stays wet and makes it a sticky mess.</li>
            <li> The only negative is that it tends to sometimes leak if the bottle is tipped and can make the bottle a bit sticky.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me, tried to glue down a wig,  was unsuccessful.  </li>
            <li> I use it to keep clothing from rolling down (or up).  </li>
            <li> in no time the one without was falling down my leg.</li>
            <li> I wear compression stockings and I use this to keep the stockings from falling down from just below the knee.</li>
            <li> The bottle was covered with product and about half of it had leaked out.  </li>
            <li> Around the ball of the glue, it is a sticky mess even if I have never touched it or have the glue on there.</li>
            <li> so I feel it should have lasted a little longer.</li>
            <li> During shipping it did leak a little.</li>
            <li> Although, I don&#x27;t like how it gets a little bit messy after I use it.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday under my bra straps to keep them from sliding off.  </li>
            <li> despite being a roll on it is rather messy to apply amd</li>
            <li> I had no choice as my pageant was days away, it worked that night but was messy.</li>
            <li> Narrow shoulders, get for holding those straps in place.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Having experiened hair loss, I need to wear wigs, presently, and was very unhappy when this product failed to hold in hot weather, last summer.</li>
            <li> Not to mention, if you do get a bit sweaty and it starts to slide off, you are now slimy and there is just a sticky mess everywhere!</li>
            <li> I have bought It-Stays in the past.  </li>
            <li> I FIND IT LOSES ITS GRIP AFTER A FEW HOURS...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s in a small bottle</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it happened in shipping or not, but the bottle seems to have a leak, and wherever I place it, it gets a ring of glue around it on the shelf.</li>
            <li> No more sagging hose.  </li>
            <li> Being of short stature, the elastic tops of the stocking roll down past my knees, putting painful pressure on the knee replacement hardware below the knee caps.</li>
            <li> It stays in place and rinses out easily from the wig afterwards..not terribly sticky like some.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have to roll it HARD because the sticky ball gets stuck.  </li>
            <li> I have to wear knee high support hose and hated them till  </li>
            <li> So, in conclusion, buy this product from a store, not online, and only use it on cold days, then it will work just as intended!</li>
            <li> it wasnt broken it just leaks from the roller ball.</li>
            <li> All in all I am not happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> It is awful, watery stuff that does not hold, especially if one perspires.</li>
            <li> only thing I don&#x27;t like about this product is it smells awful.  </li>
            <li> It would forever slip and or roll over and was very annoying until I got this product.</li>
            <li> and it smelled AWFUL</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works pretty well could be stronger</li>
            <li> My wife uses this for her support hose, she uses it all the time.</li>
            <li> I have worn a compression stocking for the last 4 years and the second month I had it I was introduced to &amp;#34;IT STAYS&amp;#34;, the best product for this type of garment. It would forever slip and or roll over and was very annoying until I got this product. Won&#x27;t be without and if I can find it at a lesser price than local medical supply stores, well, that just makes it even better.</li>
            <li> It stayed! Worked great.</li>
            <li> This is a cheap imitation and NOT the original product shown in the photo. It is awful, watery stuff that does not hold, especially if one perspires. Having experiened hair loss, I need to wear wigs, presently, and was very unhappy when this product failed to hold in hot weather, last summer. There is another company called the Drug Supply Store that sells the real deal. www.drugsupplystore.com Do not settle for imitations, if you require an adhesive that STAYS!</li>
            <li> My sister recommended this body adhesive.  It holds all day and keeps up those blouses that slip off the shoulders.  I thought the stickiness might bother me or my skin, but I forgot about it and felt comfortable all day!</li>
            <li> This seems to work pretty well, but if you&#x27;re hoping it will help keep up socks that don&#x27;t really stay up on their own you&#x27;re out of luck. I would say that this is more a tool to keep socks in place. It isn&#x27;t a replacement for a garter belt and some straps.</li>
            <li> Only tried once so far...but seemed to stick and washes off your skin easily.</li>
            <li> Dods not stck when sweating.</li>
            <li> great keeps everything in place</li>
            <li> I love this roll on to keep my thigh-high stockings up. I bought a bottle 1 1/2 years ago, loved it, worked perfect.  This new bottle - the roller ball doesn&#x27;t roll very well, and the adhesive seems to have less &amp;#34;staying power&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for my intended purpose, but has other stated applications as well. and eh.. Kind of leaks once in a while</li>
            <li> My dancers used it to keep their leotards in place. Sticky but not too sticky. And it washes out. Perfect when you&#x27;re renting costumes from another company.</li>
            <li> I have bought It-Stays in the past.  I would buy it again.  Works great!</li>
            <li> It works just like the label says. For first time users, I would recommend letting the site dry thoroughly before putting anything else over the place where you applied the adhesive and the piece of clothing you are trying to make stay in one place, as this stuff is super sticky until dry.&lt;br /&gt;I had no problems with a leaky bottle, or the product being damaged upon its arrival by mail. All in all, I have had a very positive experience  with this product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for a wig. She had a problem which resulted in the loss of her natural hair. She will only use this product and has been using it for years. Her source doubled the price which was already higher than Amazon&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I GAVE IT A FOUR BECAUSE BECAUSE ALTHOUGH IT IS GOOD I FIND IT LOSES ITS GRIP AFTER A FEW HOURS...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;very used this for many years.  I do like it.</li>
            <li> works as described, pleased with product.</li>
            <li> This stuff actually works!  Washes out easily with water.  I&#x27;m not afraid to hug people or go out in the wind anymore .</li>
            <li> I am satified with this product.  I use it to keep my wig down in the back.  It works well.</li>
            <li> THIS WAS SUGGESTED BY A FRIEND TO HOLD MY BRA STRAPS  ON MY SHOULDERS INSTEAD OF ALWAYS FALLING . IT DOES EXACTLY WHAT IT ADVERTISES!  IT WASHES OFF WITH SOAP AND WATER AND DOES NOT STAIN THE CLOTHES.  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> First time having a clean package&lt;br /&gt;noo leaking, is worth my time and money.&lt;br /&gt;I get pissed off when I get scammed.&lt;br /&gt;Again thanks for sending me your products intact</li>
            <li> I use this everyday under my bra straps to keep them from sliding off.  Have used this product for some time and it really works well and washes off easily.</li>
            <li> i like this product. it holds up my thigh highs. my biggest beef with it, though, is that it has a leak in the bottle that i can&#x27;t find. since the second day i&#x27;ve owned it, it&#x27;s been stored in a plastic ziploc bag so that the glue doesn&#x27;t get everywhere. however, it seems to be even leaking out of the ziploc, too, into the rest of my drawer.</li>
            <li> The adhesive works great, the product bottle is different from the picture.</li>
            <li> This product works like magic. When it came, I was so excited. I tried it out at my gymnastics meet and it worked! It holds my leotard in place properly and my leo doesn&#x27;t ride up. I love how it rolls on my skin smoothly. Although, I don&#x27;t like how it gets a little bit messy after I use it. Around the ball of the glue, it is a sticky mess even if I have never touched it or have the glue on there. But I still love this. It is amazing.</li>
            <li> Excellent to keeps those leos out of the butt!  It holds and is not uncomfortable.  Clear, easy to apply.  I imagine it would work anywhere but very much love for competitive gymnastics.</li>
            <li> the bottle was leaking when i arrived at my house. it wasnt broken it just leaks from the roller ball. but the stuff works.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me, tried to glue down a wig,  was unsuccessful.  Maybe other this it would work for but not wigs</li>
            <li> Works great for holding panties in place while competing in Gymnastics routines. Does not irritate the skin and is easy to remove.</li>
            <li> This is great, The smell isnt bad and the stickiness is awesome. I used it to hold athletic tape into place and It worked great</li>
            <li> I purchased this product in hopes that it would help make my adhesive bra sticky again.  The ball inside doesn&#x27;t roll very well at all and the product stays to wet to create the stick needed to make the bra work.  It also makes my skin sticky when I take the bra off.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter who is a competitive dancer. It works great to keep costumes in while she is dancing. After she&#x27;s done it&#x27;s easily washed off with no skin irritation.  It&#x27;s in a small bottle so we can keep it with us and have it whenever we need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this product is it smells awful.  Use in a well ventilated area if possible.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works and it&#x27;s water-soluble.  Washes off very easily.  My only gripe is that it&#x27;s a roll-on and I have to roll it HARD because the sticky ball gets stuck.  So then I have a dark pink mark on my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it happened in shipping or not, but the bottle seems to have a leak, and wherever I place it, it gets a ring of glue around it on the shelf. Thankfully it&#x27;s washable, but it&#x27;s still bothersome. The roll still works just as it should, and I personally love the product otherwise, but this bottle in particular is broken.</li>
            <li> I require the use of compression stockings to help manage venous insufficiency in both of my lower legs.  Being of short stature, the elastic tops of the stocking roll down past my knees, putting painful pressure on the knee replacement hardware below the knee caps. The adhesive roll-on glues the fabric to my skin, keeping the stockings comfortably in place. The roll-on liquid washes off easily. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and have used it since my bilateral surgery surgery in 2005.</li>
            <li> Wife said she likes it and does what she wanted it for and as it was described.</li>
            <li> Definitely keeps things in place!</li>
            <li> I use to order Body Glue from Beauty Control, but it looks like they discontinued the product, so I ordered this.  It seems to work about the same, maybe not as sticky as I would like though, but it works.  I use it to keep my bra straps up since they are CONSTANTLY sliding off my shoulders.</li>
            <li> I really like it. Holds clothes very well</li>
            <li> I actually bought this product to keep a wig in place and it worked great. Admittedly you will have to wash your hair after using it but it is worth it if you wear a wig and prefer not to have it slip.</li>
            <li> Tried to use for silicone pasties. Didn&#x27;t stay at all and it smelled AWFUL</li>
            <li> I love this for using on lace front wigs. It stays in place and rinses out easily from the wig afterwards..not terribly sticky like some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that if you perspire it loosens up. Sometimes if you dry the area a bit and press in place it will stick again, but might need something stronger if in a moist climate area (although I did fine at a moderate temperature beach one day). The good news is that to reapply isn&#x27;t a big deal ...just roll it over the area again and press down.</li>
            <li> This product did not work at all. I bought it because for winter ball my daughter used a friends who had something similar and it worked great. The girl takes gymnastics and buys it where she gets her leatards. Looks like I will be going to a gymnastics shop to buy it for next time.</li>
            <li> First off, when I received the package, the adhesive was everywhere, the lid was still sealed, but it was seeping out of the sides and was just all over the place. That was nearly a quarter of the product gone already. The roller works well and keeps things clean and simple (after you&#x27;ve already cleaned up all the spilt adhesive, that is) and the adhesive does it&#x27;s job and sticks things to your skin, however, at the slightest mention of sweat, everything slides right off. I understand that this is because the adhesive washes off with water, but I do not typically sweat much so I feel it should have lasted a little longer. Not to mention, if you do get a bit sweaty and it starts to slide off, you are now slimy and there is just a sticky mess everywhere! So, in conclusion, buy this product from a store, not online, and only use it on cold days, then it will work just as intended!</li>
            <li> maybe it&#x27;s just me but i dont like the way it works. despite being a roll on it is rather messy to apply amd the hold doesn&#x27;t seem quite right</li>
            <li> It does what it is supposed to do, but by the time I received this, it had already leaked in the package. I had no choice as my pageant was days away, it worked that night but was messy. Threw it out afterwards.</li>
            <li> Works great to keep your undertakings in place without having to readjust fit.  No tugging things back up into place</li>
            <li> Have been using this for years. I use it to keep clothing from rolling down (or up).  It keeps clothing in place very well.  It really does wash off with plain water! Also I tend to react to things but my skin has never reacted to this product. I love it!</li>
            <li> It is a lifesaver for holding up support knee-high hose.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years- it is truly the only way to keep your compression stockings in place.</li>
            <li> it is so sticky the roller ball won&#x27;t work well.  The adhesive stays wet and makes it a sticky mess.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use for breast forms.  It certainly is not the best product for that because it doesn&#x27;t  hold the weight of the forms.  I am sure it would be great for other more lightweight usages.  When I received it was in a soft envelop.  The bottle was covered with product and about half of it had leaked out.  All in all I am not happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This product works very well with my thigh compression sleeve.  The compression sleeve couldn&#x27;t stay in place without &amp;#34;It Stays&amp;#34; adhesive and wasn&#x27;t doing any good hula-hooping my ankle.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing a thigh high compression stocking for many years and the only way that it stays up comfortably throughout the day is by using this glue at the top of the thigh to keep it up.  This glue is amazing!!  I also use a dab of glue to keep my bra straps in place.  Works like a charm and the glue comes off with water.  I have used this product for many years.  The only negative is that it tends to sometimes leak if the bottle is tipped and can make the bottle a bit sticky.</li>
            <li> Product does what it is supposed to do: hold up my support stocking. Have been using this product for many years.</li>
            <li> I have a dancer for a daughter and sometimes those booty shorts need to be controlled! This product really works keeping her covered and modest even in shorter outfits.</li>
            <li> What can I say? It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to, and it does it well. I have used that same product from bottles in different shapes, with different labels and different prices. If it says &amp;#34;It Stays&amp;#34;, you&#x27;ve got the right stuff regardless of who the distributor may be. The generic versions are exactly the same as the name brands, except for the fonts and colors of the label and cap. Due to it&#x27;s solubility in water, It may not work well if you are sweating in a hot and humid environment. When still wet, it has a strong alcohol smell, and If you have not used it before, you might want to be aware that is has a different, but also strong and very specific, though not necessarily unpleasant, lingering odor.</li>
            <li> This is a very good staff to keep lymphedema stockings in place.  Easy to use and effective</li>
            <li> Keeps the girls in place! WAY better than the double sided tapes.</li>
            <li> I used this for thigh highs and it really did keep them up. I wore one leg with and one without. in no time the one without was falling down my leg. the one with stayed up till I took hose off. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> This is the best  glue for people to use on clothing.  You stick it on a sock, and it stays.  Really.  A quick squirt of water on it, will take it off.  A loose bra, loose bra strap, a loose stocking.  A quick swipe of this glue, and it really IT STAYS.  The only way to get it off is a squirt of water.  What a wonderful stuff.  Phyllis</li>
            <li> it does what it said it would  very happy</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic.  Keeps wigs in place all day long without any slipping.</li>
            <li> While experiencing temporary baldness due to chemotherapy, I used this product &amp;#34; It Stays&amp;#34; to securely glue wigs onto my scalp. It easily washes off with water in the shower. It was a true game changer in how I felt while wearing my cranial prosthesis. I recommend it to all wig wearers!</li>
            <li> The product works great but when it arrived the safety seal was broken and the bottle was leaking slightly and now the lid does not fit securely.</li>
            <li> Narrow shoulders, get for holding those straps in place.  I purchased a bottle at a drugstore where I was working as a substitute pharmacist.  When I ran out I was unsure how I was going to get some.  I checked with Amazon and there it was for purchase.  If you need a bra strap holder, or any thing else that you need to hold in place, this is the product.</li>
            <li> My nephew told me about this stuff,its great.I use it to keep my boots from eating my socks,a must get if you have that problem.</li>
            <li> I learned about this product when my daughter was in Irish Dance competitions. The younger girls wear white &amp;#34;poodle socks&amp;#34; and you can imagine how hard it would be to keep them up without &amp;#34;sock glue&amp;#34; as they call it. At one competition, my dancer put on her socks in the morning, and, after a day of dancing, fell into bed without taking them off. They were still in place the next morning! This is sold by vendors at competitions and every girl uses it.  I agree that the bottle could use some redesign to keep if from leaking especially for those who have to pack it for away from home use.</li>
            <li> If your knee-or-thigh-high hosiery tends to slip, or only occasionally slips so it&#x27;s difficult to keep the top band in place, a few strokes of this adhesive applied to the bank will end the problem!  It works beautifully, yet is not at all difficult to loosen when time to remove the hosiery.  I keep this product on hand at all times.</li>
            <li> Older formula is better but this works well</li>
            <li> I have to wear knee high support hose and hated them till  I found it stays adhesive roll on. It keeps them up.</li>
            <li> Works fantastic at keeping my socks from riding down into my tennis shoes!!! Love this product ;-) It  is the best!</li>
            <li> It works as advertised. I tried it on hosiery and it stayed. I tried it on breast forms and they stayed but of course if you sweat it doesn&#x27;t stay.</li>
            <li> The product works really good! During shipping it did leak a little. Maybe ship in a box?</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> It Stays was loaned to me by a friend because we were talking about keeping my knee high hose up.  She told me about the product and had an extra bottle and loaned it to me.  Oh, it works beautifully.  No more sagging hose.  She had found out about it from someone that wears thigh high nylons.  It works great for them also.  When you get through wearing it, it wipes right off with your bath or shower or you can take a wet paper towel or wash cloth and it comes right off.  Also, comes right off when you wash your hose by hand or in the washer.</li>
            <li> After I&#x27;d purchased for my daughter last year and 2 bottles for dance studio friends, we now have the entire dance studio purchasing and sharing with one another. Definitely helps to avoid &amp;#34;wardrobe malfunctions,&amp;#34; with costumes during competition.  Roll on like deodorant to the skin, press fabric against it and, voila!....no more leotard creeping up (in a most inappropriate way)or top slouching down. Yes it&#x27;s suuuuper sticky and according to my daughter and friends-not a great experience when pulling said fabric back off to remove costume, but it solves the costume problems many of us were experiencing.</li>
            <li> I have been using It Stays, or various rebranding of it, for many years. I wear compression stockings and I use this to keep the stockings from falling down from just below the knee. It&#x27;s easy to apply and washes off with soap and water. Perhaps my only gripe is that the bottle tends to leak a bit when not kept upright, which happens when I pack it for travel. I&#x27;ve taken to putting the bottle in a Ziploc bag to keep it from gooping up other items.</li>
            <li> This product is very good and securely holds.  Will purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Product seems to work fine. Haven&#x27;t had it very long but it seems sticky. It was very easy to wash off with water and non-irritating to skin.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as good as I had hoped but for simple light weight things it&#x27;s good</li>
            <li> This is the best. My husband uses it to hold up his support socks.</li>
            <li> Use this to keep my longer socks on. It stays put for long time. Cleans off pretty easy too.</li>
