            <li>I LOVE THIS STUFF!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>and I have never EVER repurchased a moisturizer of any kind, high-end or drugstore.  </li>
            <li>I swear my moisturizer is more effective .&lt;br</li>
            <li>It arrived on time and nice and safe.  </li>
            <li>This is the most effective product for my acne marks, discoloration, and redness.</li>
            <li>I recently started scaring from my acne and this product is honestly the holy grail, it also helped with smoothing the skin texture and is perfect for oily and combination skin.</li>
            <li>Aloe vera is much better if you&#x27;re looking for a gel type product.</li>
            <li>My gosh I LOVE</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this.  </li>
            <li>it is lovely.  </li>
            <li>After reading so many people over on reddit/Asian beauty giving it holy grail status I had to give it a try</li>
            <li>This is such a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>These products are so much better than anything I&#x27;ve used in the states.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>This is an HG moisturizer for many, but not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I might need something a bit more moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS</li>
            <li>AND I LOVE SNAILS</li>
            <li>This gel cream is more gel than cream, and it&#x27;s basically miracle in a tube.</li>
            <li>My hands were getting the benefit of my face treatments, including this cream, and the speedy healing was sure mostly to this product.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>THE PRECIOUS.</li>
            <li>I had many pimples growing and withing three days of using this product, the pimples reduced and are gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love the results of the gel cream.</li>
            <li>I do layer my spf moisturizer on top of it because it does not provide tons of hydration, plus I need my sun protection :)</li>
            <li>Probably more like a nickel&#x27;s amount than a dime.</li>
            <li>I have pretty balanced skin that leans more combination in the summer, so I don&#x27;t need something heavier, and in the summer it blends into my skin really nicely.</li>
            <li>My best estimate is if using this twice a day, one tube will last one month or 6 weeks at best, depending on how heavy you put it on.</li>
            <li>Love this light gel -- helps me see improvement.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of my favorite products to use its lightly moisturizing but more importantly,  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to continue to use and see if it really works as good as they say</li>
            <li>This coats your skin and dries to a smooth layer.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any fabulous improvement in my skin but</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great on open acne spots and even seems to work a bit as a makeup primer.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Cheap, effective, and really keeps in the moisture from my sheet masks too.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin so this is important to me.</li>
            <li>a great product that delivers fast results for a reasonable cost.  </li>
            <li>Since using this gel I have not had any significant acne</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light and soaks into my skin fast.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this gel.</li>
            <li>A quick rinse of your hands takes care of that feeling.</li>
            <li>This gel absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Now, not only does my skin look brighter, but I haven&#x27;t been breaking out as much as I used to, and my face feels moisturized and nice all night!</li>
            <li>The cream is light and works very well.</li>
            <li>So far I notice my face looks better &amp; brighter.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the perfect final step to seal all the previous steps in.  </li>
            <li>Bizaroo ships from California and was super fast.</li>
            <li>Ms. Kim delivered this fast!</li>
            <li>:)  Overall</li>
            <li>I read so many good reviews about this product, but unfortunately I can&#x27;t say this product has done anything for my complexion.</li>
            <li>My face felt super soft.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin which is acne prone and has moderate rosacea and fine lines around the forehead and eye area.  </li>
            <li>Since using this product my rosacea has significantly lessened and my fine lines are much smoother and less noticeable.  </li>
            <li>Incredibly light, it goes on over my regular moisturizer without feeling like I&#x27;m wearing too much product.</li>
            <li>Very recommended</li>
            <li>I recommend using a lotion or cream after applying the gel, your skin will not get much moisturization from just the gel alone.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really see a difference but</li>
            <li>I feel like it could prevent anything put on after it from absorbing into your skin.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe this stuff is real.</li>
            <li>Absolutely adore this stuff.</li>
            <li>58 yr old Caucasian woman with fair skin, a bit of sun damage, a few scars.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I have learned to be more careful with application!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad price to try the product out especially if you have Prime, but for me it&#x27;s a bit of a bust.</li>
            <li>I feel it has helped keep my skin more matte than with my previous moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I do like the tube form of this cream because many Korean creams come in jar form, which I find to be less hygienic.</li>
            <li>that was horribly bright red and minor cuts and abrasions speeding up healing in only two days.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I had some scratches on my hand after interacting with a very salty kitty cat, and after a week I noticed the ones on my hands had completely disappeared, while the ones on my arm were still scabbed.</li>
            <li>, also the red spots have began to calm.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s about 3 or 4 inches from top to bottom and pretty thick all around.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and it is easily irritated by a ton of different creams/ lotions from all different companies.  </li>
            <li>Definitely underwhelmed is my first impression.</li>
            <li>This past week, my skin has been so clear I almost feel confident to go without foundation.  </li>
            <li>I would totally buy this again, but I also want to try the all in one snail cream from Mizon that has a little more of the snail filtrate.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been battling acne for nearly 20 years.</li>
            <li>simply cannot believe how much smoother and brighter</li>
            <li>I completely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I should add that I&#x27;m 65, have some old acne scars and brown spots.</li>
            <li>And I swear it has been lightening decade old acne scars.</li>
            <li>YES YES YES IT LEAVES MY SKIN SO SOFT</li>
            <li>This stuff, when used as the last step in my skincare routine, really seems to heal and take care of my skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll see how far I can stretch it.</li>
            <li>The only thing negative I can say about it is that sometimes I accidentally get it on my mouth and that kind of grosses me out because it&#x27;s like...</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a very thick texture, not unlike snail mucus, and is pretty easy to spread.</li>
            <li>It only takes a pea sized amount to cover your entire face and I use a little more to do my neck and chest.</li>
            <li>You only need a little and it spreads smoothly over skin.</li>
            <li>However, I did notice that when applied to a pretty deep scratch regularly, it healed much faster than expected.</li>
            <li>Someone with dry skin would probably not like this product as much as those with oily skin.</li>
            <li>I completely switched from my old moisturizer, and I only use that one is desperation, because my snail gel is here to stay.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve been using these products my rosascea is barely visible at all.  </li>
            <li>Helps to moisturize and heal at the same time leaving skin silky smooth, current blemishes redness and swelling reduce after a few hours.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t great as a stand alone moisturizer but applied under a skin cream this stuff is SICK.</li>
            <li>I applied it in a new pimple and now is the 3rd day and the pimple is dried healing fast</li>
            <li>I can only use this at night because it will make your makeup pill like crazy, so fair warning.</li>

            <li> I have a lot of acne dark marks and uneveness.  I use this product in combination with other Korean products.  My scars are fading at a rapid rate.  What used to take months, is now fading to almost gone in 2 weeks.  I find it also helped heal up acne without dry patchy spots that are difficult to cover.  The consistency seems thick, but it absorbs fully in about 30 seconds. I use about 2 peas for my entire face and neck.  I find I like to apply it after my toner and before my emulsion/moisturizer.  I would totally buy this again, but I also want to try the all in one snail cream from Mizon that has a little more of the snail filtrate.  This past week, my skin has been so clear I almost feel confident to go without foundation.  Korean products are the best and I&#x27;ve been battling acne for nearly 20 years.</li>
            <li> This coats your skin and dries to a smooth layer.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any fabulous improvement in my skin but perhaps just a small amount of protection from dryness.  Aloe vera is much better if you&#x27;re looking for a gel type product.</li>
            <li> My gosh I LOVE this.&lt;br /&gt;First the ugly stats: 58 yr old Caucasian woman with fair skin, a bit of sun damage, a few scars.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using this after cleansing, misting with rosewater, and before moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;I simply cannot believe how much smoother and brighter my complexion is.&lt;br /&gt;The icky white bumps are gone. I swear my moisturizer is more effective .&lt;br /&gt;No smell. No stings. It&#x27;s a clear gel that only takes a few minutes to absorb/dry.&lt;br /&gt;Seriously , try this out. It&#x27;s so inexpensive you won&#x27;t even be mad if, by some chance, you don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Very recommended</li>
            <li> Ms. Kim delivered this fast! It is all the way from South Korea. The cream is light and works very well. This is the second time that I purchase this from her. Awesome stuff!</li>
            <li> I love this.  It arrived on time and nice and safe.  I&#x27;ve been testing it out and after getting over the initial nervousness of the snail goo factor it is lovely.  It&#x27;s one of my favorite products to use its lightly moisturizing but more importantly,  it&#x27;s the perfect final step to seal all the previous steps in.  If you want to use it by itself it also helps to eat the skin.  I put it over a cut I received on my hand to put it to the test and the cut was healed with one day and gone within 3. After reading so many people over on reddit/Asian beauty giving it holy grail status I had to give it a try and it delivers. I completely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is such a wonderful product. Incredibly light, it goes on over my regular moisturizer without feeling like I&#x27;m wearing too much product. There&#x27;s the faintest of fragrance that goes away very quickly once applied, and if you&#x27;re used to heavier western moisturizers, your hands may feel a bit weird and sort of...tacky? Just a touch. A quick rinse of your hands takes care of that feeling. I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> This is the most effective product for my acne marks, discoloration, and redness. It shipped very quickly and was in perfect condition. My only issue is that it&#x27;s only 45ml, but a little goes a long way. I saw results after one use. Be careful, this isn&#x27;t a stand alone moisturizer! Along with this I use nature republic&#x27;s aloe vera gel</li>
            <li> I bought this from another supplier and wouldn&#x27;t want to be without it. It only takes a pea sized amount to cover your entire face and I use a little more to do my neck and chest. This makes my skin feel wonderful. My skin is looking lighter (my dark spots and scars as lighter.)  I&#x27;ve been using all Korean beauty products on my  face including bb primer, bb cream , powder. I added this last to my list but I just ordered a couple of different masks also. Someone else said you couldn&#x27;t use this under make up but I use it at night and in the morning, then I apply my primer and bb cream and it has never balled up. These products are so much better than anything I&#x27;ve used in the states. I should add that I&#x27;m 65, have some old acne scars and brown spots. I also have rosascea on my chin caused by sun damage. Since I&#x27;ve been using these products my rosascea is barely visible at all.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this gel. Love it.</li>
            <li> I read so many good reviews about this product, but unfortunately I can&#x27;t say this product has done anything for my complexion. However, I did notice that when applied to a pretty deep scratch regularly, it healed much faster than expected. I will definitely be applying this to any scratches, cuts, spots, etc in the future. I would recommend this if you have acne spots that you would like to heal faster.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it&#x27;s so bad</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have only used it for a month now and it has helped with the scaring around my nose(an accident ) that was horribly bright red and minor cuts and abrasions speeding up healing in only two days. Helps to moisturize and heal at the same time leaving skin silky smooth, current blemishes redness and swelling reduce after a few hours. I use this as a daytime moisturizer applying liberally through the day.</li>
            <li> Definitely underwhelmed is my first impression. This is an HG moisturizer for many, but not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a very thick texture, not unlike snail mucus, and is pretty easy to spread. I can only use this at night because it will make your makeup pill like crazy, so fair warning. It also leaves the skin looking shiny and a bit oily. It&#x27;s not super moisturizing, but it&#x27;s alright. I have combo skin so I might need something a bit more moisturizing. It&#x27;s not a bad price to try the product out especially if you have Prime, but for me it&#x27;s a bit of a bust.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. The size is not small like some have said on other reviews. It&#x27;s about 3 or 4 inches from top to bottom and pretty thick all around. I recommend using a lotion or cream after applying the gel, your skin will not get much moisturization from just the gel alone.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF! I wear it in the morning as a moisturizer and at night to seal in the rest of my routine. Clears up breakouts and reduces the redness in my face. Makes a great makeup primer. And I swear it has been lightening decade old acne scars.</li>
            <li> YES YES YES IT LEAVES MY SKIN SO SOFT I LOVE THIS AND I LOVE SNAILS</li>
            <li> After using it for a couple of nights, sorry, but I don&#x27;t see any changes.</li>
            <li> A great light-weight moisturizer. I have pretty balanced skin that leans more combination in the summer, so I don&#x27;t need something heavier, and in the summer it blends into my skin really nicely. It&#x27;s not a miracle product, but it does its job.</li>
            <li> Only had it a few days but it def makes my skin smoother.  It has a very light fragrance but doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all. Can&#x27;t wait to continue to use and see if it really works as good as they say</li>
            <li> Very great for oily control and a primer before makeup</li>
            <li> This gel is amazing!  I have oily skin which is acne prone and has moderate rosacea and fine lines around the forehead and eye area.  Since using this product my rosacea has significantly lessened and my fine lines are much smoother and less noticeable.  Since using this gel I have not had any significant acne and I don&#x27;t think my skin is so excessively oily.  I am so impressed with this product I am repurchasing and I have never EVER repurchased a moisturizer of any kind, high-end or drugstore.  The only thing negative I can say about it is that sometimes I accidentally get it on my mouth and that kind of grosses me out because it&#x27;s like... snail goo...  But I have learned to be more careful with application!  :)  Overall a great product that delivers fast results for a reasonable cost.  Love it!!</li>
            <li> I love it! I use it when I am at home not going out feel great. Fast shipping</li>
            <li> I recently started scaring from my acne and this product is honestly the holy grail, it also helped with smoothing the skin texture and is perfect for oily and combination skin. started seeing results in less than 2 weeks, the bottle is a little small but you only need a pea size to do the whole face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Repurchasing definitely and recommend to anyone !!!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to Elaine Mokk for recommending this product</li>
            <li> Hail the snail! This gel cream is more gel than cream, and it&#x27;s basically miracle in a tube. Soothes, slightly moisturizes, speeds healing. I had some scratches on my hand after interacting with a very salty kitty cat, and after a week I noticed the ones on my hands had completely disappeared, while the ones on my arm were still scabbed. My hands were getting the benefit of my face treatments, including this cream, and the speedy healing was sure mostly to this product.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for 2mos now. I just use once every night for a small amount. So far I notice my face looks better &amp; brighter. My skin used to be looking tired. I apply moisturizer after as it can be dry during application.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for the last 3 days and I feel confident to say that this gel is great, it soothes your skin and it doesn&#x27;t break you out. I applied it in a new pimple and now is the 3rd day and the pimple is dried healing fast, also the red spots have began to calm. I definitely recommend it to anyone who suffer from acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see a difference</li>
            <li> This made a difference within two days. My skin just looked brighter and my pores looked smaller. My face felt super soft. I did not have a drying problem. I have blotchy skin so there are some dry some oily areas. This product balanced both for me. I would repurchase. A pea-sized dot is plenty for your face. Dries matt.... so no greasy feeling. I love this.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really see a difference but still good I guess.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and it is easily irritated by a ton of different creams/ lotions from all different companies.  This one did not cause irritation at all.  Great under makeup too.</li>
            <li> This stuff, when used as the last step in my skincare routine, really seems to heal and take care of my skin.  It&#x27;s great on open acne spots and even seems to work a bit as a makeup primer.  Just be careful to use this last as it&#x27;s so thick I feel like it could prevent anything put on after it from absorbing into your skin.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe this stuff is real. I started using it about a week or so ago, and I was used to my face feeling greasy and tight before I went to bed after washing up and everything. Now, not only does my skin look brighter, but I haven&#x27;t been breaking out as much as I used to, and my face feels moisturized and nice all night! I completely switched from my old moisturizer, and I only use that one is desperation, because my snail gel is here to stay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheap, effective, and really keeps in the moisture from my sheet masks too. I&#x27;d marry this little tube if it wasn&#x27;t an inanimate object.</li>
            <li> You only need a little and it spreads smoothly over skin. Seems to provide a lot of moisture but doesn&#x27;t block pores. I have oily skin so this is important to me.</li>
            <li> THE PRECIOUS. Absolutely adore this stuff. Couldn&#x27;t recommend it highly enough. It isn&#x27;t great as a stand alone moisturizer but applied under a skin cream this stuff is SICK. Irritation? Gone. Blemishes? Healed. Scars? Faded. Slap some on in the morning and achieve total world domination by lunch.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, like a miracle for skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for ten days and it works well with acne. I had many pimples growing and withing three days of using this product, the pimples reduced and are gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have acne acres on the side of me cheeks and I&#x27;ve noticed that they&#x27;ve become less prominent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t seen progress in reducing redness or closing pores(although I have small pores), but I hope to start seeing results within the next week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely continue using this product and buy again.</li>
            <li> Love the results of the gel cream. I feel it has helped keep my skin more matte than with my previous moisturizer. I do layer my spf moisturizer on top of it because it does not provide tons of hydration, plus I need my sun protection :) Someone with dry skin would probably not like this product as much as those with oily skin. It&#x27;s very light and soaks into my skin fast. My only gripe with this product is I&#x27;ve only had it one week and have used half of it up (from what I can tell, since the tube isn&#x27;t see thru). I will have to repurchase so often. The tube is a little misleading because it&#x27;s mostly full of air and less product. I&#x27;ll see how far I can stretch it. As long as a seller is from the US (I&#x27;m from the US), frequent ordering might be practical, otherwise I&#x27;d recommend you just buy in bulk, because the Korean sellers are going to take an average of 2-3 weeks to get to your doorstep. Bizaroo ships from California and was super fast. My order arrived in 2-3 days with regular shipping. I&#x27;d hate to get hooked on this then run out before my new supply arrives. My best estimate is if using this twice a day, one tube will last one month or 6 weeks at best, depending on how heavy you put it on. I do admit I apply quite liberally. Probably more like a nickel&#x27;s amount than a dime. I do like the tube form of this cream because many Korean creams come in jar form, which I find to be less hygienic.</li>
            <li> Love this light gel -- helps me see improvement.</li>
            <li> Shipping was slow. This gel absorbs quickly. It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
