            <li>I love the product and the smell  </li>

            <li>Once you get some smellum in your hair, you&#x27;re gonna feel 100% better about yourself.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and the delivery was fast.</li>
            <li>Thank you!  :)</li>
            <li>This product styles well, however, the scent is not at all appealing to me.</li>
            <li>, I wanted to love this product.</li>
            <li>Thank you !! :-)</li>
            <li>but I still get the most out of getting to say &amp;#34;I&#x27;m a Dapper Dan man, damn it!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I have received several compliments on the wonderful smell.</li>
            <li>It smells great and holds really well.</li>
            <li>The shine is more than medium if the sun is beating on your head</li>
            <li>It smells pretty good too.</li>
            <li>Smells really good and is exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>I would say this is more if a strong hold.&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
            <li>&gt; -a life changing step to becoming a Dapper Man!&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Easy call 5 star.</li>
            <li>(fruity)&lt;br /&gt; -easy</li>
            <li>for all day&lt;br /&gt; -easy to reform (some water</li>
            <li>This product is still going strong.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping was fantastic, it wasn&#x27;t a geographical oddity and took two weeks, here in two days.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, clean, and holds.  </li>
            <li>As a fan of layrite original this pomade did not disappoint.</li>
            <li>I have been using Layrite original for a while</li>
            <li>Originally bought this as a gag gift for my boys 30 &amp; 33.....</li>
            <li>love this particular hair treatment, looks great once in, not like some where you look like you dunked your head in deep fryer sludge.</li>
            <li>A true asset to any gentleman.</li>
            <li>Tried all the old standards, Brylcream, etc, and some of the new ones, but this holds my hair and keeps it looking great.</li>
            <li>The smell is very pleasant, and when I get out of bed in the mornings, late or otherwise.</li>
            <li>Heck, you can even make some for pretty cheap too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you want a real medium hold get &amp;#34;Anchors Hair Co.&amp;#34; Original.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended and worth every penny!</li>
            <li>and like it very much, but figured I would give this a shot too.  </li>
            <li>so it holds it pretty well.</li>
            <li>The smell is fantastic, wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if I get a wookie on this deployment because of this stuff.</li>
            <li>However it&#x27;s pretty high on the dollar.</li>
            <li>sure your hair is wet when you put it in</li>
            <li>Got this for my boyfriend and her really likes it.</li>
            <li>I used waaayy too much.  </li>
            <li>really REALLY</li>
            <li>One tin has lasted me 5+ months, and probably will last nearly 2+ months more.</li>
            <li>It holds up well and strong and for a long time.</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d give water based one more chance, but I was let down again.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I should note, I DO have short hair, so long hair might need to buy more often.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it, but I am picky about when I use it because I do not want to let it go to waste.</li>
            <li>Does its job as advertised...a little strong for my likings</li>
            <li>/&gt;In general its an okay product, I will likely go back to American Crew pomade when my can of Dapper Dan runs out.</li>
            <li>I also like the old fashioned packaging.  </li>
            <li>and you apply wet but is fine for applying on dry</li>
            <li>You can often find many other pomades for far less.</li>
            <li>so it won&#x27;t stay in your hair for the whole day especially if you sweat or its humid outside.</li>
            <li>This completely controls his massive curls.  </li>

            <li> Even when I take my flight helmet off I can usually fix my hair with a wet comb.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I use a little, sometimes I use a lot.</li>
            <li> A little dab will do you.  </li>
            <li> Use dry with comb to get serious.</li>
            <li> Buy yourself a medium hold oil based true pomade and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

            <li> Smells great, feels great. I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> A great classic with a great smell.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want Fop g.d it....I&#x27;m a Dapper Dan man!</li>
            <li> Excellent....work amazingly</li>
            <li> As a fan of layrite original this pomade did not disappoint. It has a slightly stronger hold and volume when used in wet hair than layrite does. Dapper Dan has a pleasant smell to it that lasts throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;M a dapper Dan man!</li>
            <li> the pomade is awesome, it gives some shine and smells great. I will definitely continue buying Dapper Dan.</li>
            <li> Woww, I mean woww. What a pleasant smell :) Works really great. I will definitely buy this again. Wonderful product overall. Easy call 5 star.</li>
            <li> I would say this is more if a strong hold.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure your hair is wet when you put it in and once it&#x27;s dry it isn&#x27;t moving. If you want a real medium hold get &amp;#34;Anchors Hair Co.&amp;#34; Original.</li>

            <li> I like the smell of my hair treatment, the pleasing odor is half the point.</li>
            <li> I thought Pomade days ore so over but with Dapper Dan&#x27;s you can never go wrong. It holds up well and strong and for a long time. The shine is just right and the smell is perfect.</li>
            <li> As a big fan of &amp;#34;O&#x27; Brother Where Art Thou?&amp;#34; I just had to get this product. I wanted the Red tin, but I prefer a shinier finish and medium hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product works amazingly, looks great when combed, and stays in all day. Even if you&#x27;re not big into styling, a little pomade goes a long way to prevent excess frizz, &amp;#34;poofiness,&amp;#34; or curls. This particular pomade smells incredible, I should add.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only real complaint is the price. You can often find many other pomades for far less. Heck, you can even make some for pretty cheap too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Update Nov. 9, 2015: This product is still going strong. I use Dapper Dan pomade about 3 times a week, maybe more. Sometimes I use a little, sometimes I use a lot. One tin has lasted me 5+ months, and probably will last nearly 2+ months more. I should note, I DO have short hair, so long hair might need to buy more often. This product still dazzles my nose with its scent; I hope they never change it!)</li>
            <li> love this particular hair treatment, looks great once in, not like some where you look like you dunked your head in deep fryer sludge. The smell is very pleasant, and when I get out of bed in the mornings, late or otherwise. Just run a damp comb through my hair and you&#x27;re good to go. Perfect when you&#x27;re in a tight-spot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fantastic, it wasn&#x27;t a geographical oddity and took two weeks, here in two days. Once you get some smellum in your hair, you&#x27;re gonna feel 100% better about yourself. This is definitely a Ulysses Everett McGill approved hair treatment.</li>
            <li> A true asset to any gentleman. Use a small amount with water and comb out for a glorious flow. Use dry with comb to get serious. The pleasing odor is half the point.</li>
            <li> Excellent product . Works great and smells delicious! Does not leave hair greasy or sticky.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Got this for my boyfriend and her really likes it. He has longer hair so it holds it pretty well. It smells pretty good too. No complaints.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, clean, and holds.  Has a nice scent as well.</li>
            <li> Smells really good and is exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> I am a Dapper Dan Man. You should be too.</li>
            <li> Great versatile pomade.  Water based is definitely the way to go.</li>
            <li> Best pomade I&#x27;ve ever used and the smell us great!</li>
            <li> My son is a Dapper Dan Man!  This completely controls his massive curls.  He loves it and tells everyone.</li>
            <li> At first I was a little skeptical.  I used waaayy too much.  A little dab will do you.  The smell is very pleasant.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Love Dapper Dan! Holds and looks great! I&#x27;m a Dapper Dan Man😁</li>
            <li> Does its job as advertised...a little strong for my likings but that&#x27;s just personal preference.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and the delivery was fast. Also, the item was in great shape upon arrival. Thank you!  :)</li>
            <li> I was not expecting this pomade to be as good as it is.  I have been using Layrite original for a while and like it very much, but figured I would give this a shot too.  I must say that I&#x27;m impressed.  It holds better and longer than Layrite and smells very pleasant.  I also like the old fashioned packaging.  Layrite will be my day to day hair product.  Dapper Dan will be for special occasions to look my absolute best.  Highly recommended and worth every penny!</li>
            <li> My son has gorgeous locks, but needs a quality hair treatment to keep it looking its best. And he loves Dapper Dan. It&#x27;s expensive, but worth it. The jury is still out on whether it will float if our house is flooded. I will update this review if that should ever happen.</li>
            <li> Fantastic Smell, And great Hold. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Best I have ever used. Tried all the old standards, Brylcream, etc, and some of the new ones, but this holds my hair and keeps it looking great.</li>
            <li> This product styles well, however, the scent is not at all appealing to me. I&#x27;m sorry DapperDan, I wanted to love this product.</li>
            <li> Originally bought this as a gag gift for my boys 30 &amp; 33.....you know &amp;#34;Oh brother where art thou&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt; LOL&lt;br /&gt;Now we&#x27;re Dapper Dan Men.....no Fop @%^%  We tried all three and like them all, so do the Ladies!&lt;br /&gt;Clean scent(s)</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Smells wonderful&lt;br /&gt;Goes in easily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Leaves hair hard, like hair gel does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general its an okay product, I will likely go back to American Crew pomade when my can of Dapper Dan runs out.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this stuff !! Thank you !! :-)</li>
            <li> Got this for my son and he uses it all the time and happy</li>
            <li> This pomade smells fantastic and it holds my thick curly hair down really REALLY well.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a girl, but I still get the most out of getting to say &amp;#34;I&#x27;m a Dapper Dan man, damn it!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I would give this a 5 star, but it&#x27;s too dang expensive. I absolutely love it, but I am picky about when I use it because I do not want to let it go to waste. $20 for each can is steeep. I have received several compliments on the wonderful smell. It is a strong smell, but it&#x27;s a melony fruity good one. It also worked great on keeping my hair in place but still moldable even after wearing a beanie for most of the day.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d give water based one more chance, but I was let down again. This stuff is basically gel in a tin so it won&#x27;t stay in your hair for the whole day especially if you sweat or its humid outside. Buy yourself a medium hold oil based true pomade and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot. It smells great and holds really well. Even when I take my flight helmet off I can usually fix my hair with a wet comb. However it&#x27;s pretty high on the dollar. And I thought it made my hair too hard.</li>
            <li> This Pomade is great, I am a Marine infantry man so I constantly have to wear covers and my kevlar, etc. No matter what I wear on my head I can reform with my hand or comb afterwards. The smell is fantastic, wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if I get a wookie on this deployment because of this stuff. The shine is more than medium if the sun is beating on your head and you apply wet but is fine for applying on dry hair.&lt;br /&gt; PROS.&lt;br /&gt; -smells great (fruity)&lt;br /&gt; -easy to wash&lt;br /&gt; -hold for all day&lt;br /&gt; -easy to reform (some water too)&lt;br /&gt; -a life changing step to becoming a Dapper Man!&lt;br /&gt; CONS&lt;br /&gt; -if you manage to get your hair stuck up ie with a hat, need to reform to put down.</li>
