            <li>Makes my hair so full and smells so good to wash with it</li>
            <li>Not wanting to spend 50 dollars on a shampoo and conditioner I saw this shampoo + conditioner had really good reviews and was so super cheap!</li>
            <li>Not only does it smell great, like citrus, but works great on fine and oily hair.</li>
            <li>Love the volume this gives.</li>
            <li>Keeps it smooth as well!</li>
            <li>I recently was spending time on Amazon looking for the perfect shampoo to give me volume.</li>
            <li>After one use there is a notably difference</li>
            <li>You will not regret it! :)</li>
            <li>Volumnizing Shampoo is one of my favorite hair care products.  </li>
            <li>I kept checking the bottle to make sure it says shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of this shampoo.</li>
            <li>This scent has to be one of my favorites, since I always love things that smell like citrus and orange.</li>
            <li>Love everything about this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t ask for more than that...</li>
            <li>But Herbal Essences gave more.</li>
            <li>Try it you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>Dries out hair, smells ok</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I did</li>
            <li>; it&#x27;s now one of my favorite shampoos.  </li>
            <li>never ever disappoints).&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t say it did anything outstanding for my hair, but it does</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and this is my favorite shampoo that leaves my hair hydrated and shiny</li>
            <li>Drama Clean has been my fav, but this stuff is rockin!</li>
            <li>But more importantly It gave me all day body and Volume.</li>
            <li>and I feel like it really does a good job of shampooing, plus it smells so good!&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I am so pleased I got these fantastic results with such a cheap, great smelling shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try this one out as the price was amazingly cheap.</li>
            <li>A family member brought home the Herbal Essences Body Envy conditioner which I liked so much, I decided to buy the shampoo.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so cheap</li>
            <li>If you want super clean hair, this is for you!</li>
            <li>Really lathers and cleans hair!!!</li>
            <li>It washes my hair and rinses clean - with no residue or film.  </li>
            <li>I washed my hair wondering to myself &amp;#34;what is so special about this shampoo&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Besides that, I really like the scent and love Herbal Essences.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I just got the defective bottle where they ran out of the part that actually cleans your hair and makes it feel nice, but this shampoo made my hair feel grimy.  </li>
            <li>Worth trying though.</li>
            <li>I love that after several hours, I can smell my hair and still catch a whiff of the fragrance.</li>
            <li>It has potential and may work better on others.</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more</li>
            <li>I quickly realized this was no ordinary shampoo, I smelled as though a playground of herbs had danced through my hair!</li>
            <li>so imagine my amazement when the hairs I have left began to sway too and fro in the breeze in an obvious attempt at dancing in joy at my new taste in shampoos.</li>
            <li>Herbal Essences Body Envy Volumizing Shampoo made my hair super shiny and feel so soft.</li>
            <li>so it may not be strong enough for me.</li>
            <li>Lots and lots of oils on my scalp that would normally take a whole month to get with the other kind.</li>
            <li>I &amp;lt;3 this shampoo so much.  </li>
            <li>It cleans well, but it&#x27;s the scent that I really appreciate.</li>
            <li>This really doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s cleaning my hair.</li>
            <li>The shampoo has a natural, fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>The price is reasonable, too.</li>
            <li>I really like the scent</li>
            <li>I have straight hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other volumizing shampoos that work way better than this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I love this shampoo in the winter, helps give my hair a little more volume in the dry winter air.</li>
            <li>I now have something to really live for!</li>
            <li>my hair has tons of body since using this, much more than an expensive salon brand that cost much more.</li>
            <li>Decent quality.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s thick and yummy smelling and this is just as nice.  </li>
            <li>Not sure about the volume, I did not see any, but I only ordered it because I had a coupon and got it super cheap.</li>
            <li>I have very straight and flat hair, and this volumnizing shampoo does the est job that I have found to give it some bounce and life.  </li>
            <li>I might as well use natural products if it works this well.</li>
            <li>I always get compliments when I use this shampoo because of the fruity scent, and unlike most shampoos a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>I have long almost straight hair.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, lathers well and easy to wash out.</li>
            <li>This shampoo smells amazing, and adds volume that looks natural but definetly doesn&#x27;t make naturally straight hair flat and boring look better.</li>
            <li>I like other herbal essences hair products but this particular one makes my hair feel oily.</li>
            <li>She really loved the smell, and I guess it didn&#x27;t do anything bad to her hair.</li>

            <li> Shampoo does mean cleans your hair right?  </li>
            <li> It really cleans my hair well, but leaves it feeling a little dry even though I use the matching conditioner.</li>
            <li> , Doesn&#x27;t make my hair flat at all, Does it work for Oily Hair?</li>
            <li> Not bad but definitely not great.</li>
            <li> It also left my hair very dry.  </li>
            <li> Maybe for someone with dry hair but mine isn&#x27;t dry.</li>
            <li> I have an oily scalp and bangs, dry and curly hair below the ears.</li>
            <li> For maximum effect, blow dry hair upside down then flip it up and back and see the volume !</li>
            <li> I highly not recommend it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice a difference in the body of my hair compared with any other shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Smaller than usual bottle.</li>
            <li> This makes my hair very dry and heavy.</li>
            <li> i have dark hair.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, curly hair that has absolutely no volume to it.</li>
            <li> Never will I ever settle for less!</li>
            <li> I was hoping that this shampoo would add volume to the hair on my scalp, but it has been leaving a thin, waxy film on it that makes it lie flat.</li>
            <li> I have thin long hair and it is hard to wash with this shampoo because it ends up tangling my hair.</li>
            <li> but it leaves my hair feeling thick and heavy.</li>
            <li> With the sitress I only had to shampoo my hair twice a week before it got oily or dirty.</li>
            <li> I sent this to my granddaughter who has thick shiny hair with no curls but lots of body.  </li>
            <li> and it goes on thick.  </li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s lousy.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product.  </li>

            <li> Only Herbal Essences shampoo I will buy! Not only does it smell great, like citrus, but works great on fine and oily hair. A little goes a long way, lathers well and easy to wash out. Gives my hair volume, cleanses it well, and makes it smell wonderful. No residue or build up either.</li>
            <li> Love it! Smells awesome!</li>
            <li> I &amp;lt;3 this shampoo so much.  Makes my hair so full and smells so good to wash with it, Doesn&#x27;t make my hair flat at all, Does it work for Oily Hair? U tell me if it made your hair oily....</li>
            <li> Very nice shampoo. Pleasant scent. Does the job well.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo in the winter, helps give my hair a little more volume in the dry winter air. Keeps it smooth as well!</li>
            <li> Yes, this shampoo smells nice and adds volume. But it also causes massive build-up in a short amount of time. I would not recommend this for daily or even weekly use, especially with a conditioner, because of the white film it leaves in your hair.</li>
            <li> Nice smelling shampoo.  Doesn&#x27;t leave a residue and smells nice.  I don&#x27;t notice a difference in the body of my hair compared with any other shampoo.  I have long almost straight hair.</li>
            <li> I recently was spending time on Amazon looking for the perfect shampoo to give me volume. Not wanting to spend 50 dollars on a shampoo and conditioner I saw this shampoo + conditioner had really good reviews and was so super cheap! I have long, thick, curly hair that has absolutely no volume to it. After one use there is a notably difference and I am so pleased I got these fantastic results with such a cheap, great smelling shampoo and conditioner. You will not regret it! :)</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo!  Herbal Essences Body Envy Volumnizing Shampoo is one of my favorite hair care products.  It washes my hair and rinses clean - with no residue or film.  I have very straight and flat hair, and this volumnizing shampoo does the est job that I have found to give it some bounce and life.  I have never had a problem with an Herbal Essences product, and would definitely purchase one to try without hesitation.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I just got the defective bottle where they ran out of the part that actually cleans your hair and makes it feel nice, but this shampoo made my hair feel grimy.  I kept checking the bottle to make sure it says shampoo.  Shampoo does mean cleans your hair right?  I get these brands to make my hair feel nice.  I might as well use natural products if it works this well.</li>
            <li> Good body.  Smells nice.</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells amazing, and adds volume that looks natural but definetly doesn&#x27;t make naturally straight hair flat and boring look better. For maximum effect, blow dry hair upside down then flip it up and back and see the volume !</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this shampoo. It cleans well, but it&#x27;s the scent that I really appreciate. I love that after several hours, I can smell my hair and still catch a whiff of the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Not bad but definitely not great. It has potential and may work better on others. I have oily hair so it may not be strong enough for me. Worth trying though.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and this is my favorite shampoo that leaves my hair hydrated and shiny</li>
            <li> I have tried different kinds of shampoos and always come back to Herbal Essences brands. I have been using the sitress one but found this one online and wanted to try it out. I do admit it does smell great but it leaves my hair feeling thick and heavy. With the sitress I only had to shampoo my hair twice a week before it got oily or dirty. i have dark hair. But with this, with in a day or so my hair is saturated with oils. Lots and lots of oils on my scalp that would normally take a whole month to get with the other kind. I think that this one is just not for me. Maybe for someone with dry hair but mine isn&#x27;t dry.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this shampoo, and this pack is a great value. If you like your hair smelling great with added body, give it a try.</li>
            <li> Great smell, product and size.</li>
            <li> my hair has tons of body since using this, much more than an expensive salon brand that cost much more.</li>
            <li> Drama Clean has been my fav, but this stuff is rockin! Cleans amazingly, smells nice, lathers awesome, etc. Clears up residue. I just ordered three DCs, but this might be my next bulk order. If you want super clean hair, this is for you! HE is the bomb.</li>
            <li> I sent this to my granddaughter who has thick shiny hair with no curls but lots of body.  She didn&#x27;t get that from me.  She loves this shampoo, but almost any shampoo would work for her.  She really loved the smell, and I guess it didn&#x27;t do anything bad to her hair.</li>
            <li> The smell is great, floral and citrusy without being cloying. The price is great too, but that&#x27;s about it. I have an oily scalp and bangs, dry and curly hair below the ears. I was hoping that this shampoo would add volume to the hair on my scalp, but it has been leaving a thin, waxy film on it that makes it lie flat. This really doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s cleaning my hair. Your mileage may vary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair type: medium thickness, 2B, waist-length, lightweight</li>
            <li> Great product and great price.</li>
            <li> Herbal essences shampoo- good smell</li>
            <li> good volume, excellent citrusy scent.</li>
            <li> I like other herbal essences hair products but this particular one makes my hair feel oily. I have thin long hair and it is hard to wash with this shampoo because it ends up tangling my hair. I wouldnt recommend this product to people with hair similar to mine.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s favorite shampoo!! Got this because was great price and she just loves it!!! Really lathers and cleans hair!!!</li>
            <li> Love the scent and what it does for my hair! Will definitely buy more</li>
            <li> best shampoo ever, smells so clean and refreshing!</li>
            <li> Works great and smells great.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this one out as the price was amazingly cheap. It was a big mistake. This makes my hair very dry and heavy. I highly not recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love all of Herbal Essences&#x27; products! This scent has to be one of my favorites, since I always love things that smell like citrus and orange. It really cleans my hair well, but leaves it feeling a little dry even though I use the matching conditioner. Besides that, I really like the scent and love Herbal Essences.</li>
            <li> A family member brought home the Herbal Essences Body Envy conditioner which I liked so much, I decided to buy the shampoo.  It makes my hair feel thicker. I use it every day. The shampoo has a natural, fresh scent.  The container fits great in the bath.  Have been very pleased with this product for a go-to shampoo.  The price is reasonable, too.</li>
            <li> Love everything about this shampoo. I&#x27;m trying to grow my hair out and its at that shaggy just lay there do nothing stage. Herbal Essences Body Envy Volumizing Shampoo made my hair super shiny and feel so soft. But more importantly It gave me all day body and Volume. Can&#x27;t ask for more than that...But Herbal Essences gave more. Great scent and affordable too. Try it you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and I love the price with amazons subscribe and save!</li>
            <li> Smaller than usual bottle. Decent quality.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this product.  This product did not add any body or volume to my hair.  It also left my hair very dry.  I&#x27;ve used other volumizing shampoos that work way better than this stuff.  No wonder it&#x27;s so cheap - it&#x27;s lousy.</li>
            <li> Dries out hair, smells ok</li>
            <li> I got this with a coupon and I&#x27;m so glad I did; it&#x27;s now one of my favorite shampoos.  As a matter of fact, I hog it and don&#x27;t let my husband use it; lol.  I really like the scent and it goes on thick.  I have Herbal Essence Body Wash that&#x27;s thick and yummy smelling and this is just as nice.  I have straight hair and I feel like it really does a good job of shampooing, plus it smells so good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two pack is a good deal; I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells SO GOOD!&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit I am ALWAYS tempted by an amazing smelling shampoo, and I do love Herbal Essences (this brand never ever disappoints).&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t say it did anything outstanding for my hair, but it does it&#x27;s job well (gives good body to my hair, leaves a nice shine) and smells good while you&#x27;re washing your hair.&lt;br /&gt;I did get complimented on the scent of my hair as soon as I got in the car to ride with my friend to work, so I would say no complaints here!</li>
            <li> Not sure about the volume, I did not see any, but I only ordered it because I had a coupon and got it super cheap. But the smell is AMESOME!!! My husband LOVES it as well.</li>
            <li> Its shampoo... smells good.</li>
