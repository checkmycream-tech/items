            <li>lol, just my 2 cents.</li>
            <li>(also, I did quit smoking cigarettes years ago and stopped a great deal of alcohol consumption, which is a leading cause of hair loss, besides genetics, so I&#x27;m not saying its a miracle but its working well for me</li>
            <li>great ingredients in the product.</li>
            <li>will keep this stocked until the day i die lol.</li>
            <li>great deal for the price...</li>
            <li>Smells good and softens the hair.</li>
            <li>I do a &#x27;john dillinger&#x27; to 50&#x27;s comb over style and it seems to be a perfect fit for me.</li>
            <li>It really a good product&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li>its amazing, is just an understatement)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I get nice defined curls.</li>
            <li>I sure hope it&#x27;s effective...</li>
            <li>Luckily my hair drank up so good ol&#x27; castor oil to restore some moisture.</li>
            <li>Also my hair is about 4 inches on top</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS product</li>
            <li>love the smell of the rosemary conditioner, and the shampoo is sudsy and moisturizes my hair instead of drying it out like most shampoos.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product!</li>
            <li>There are no directions on the bottle concerning this question, so in order to be on the safe side, I rinsed it out after five minutes of putting it in.</li>
            <li>I really love this product bundle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok I&#x27;ll use more often and post again</li>
            <li>my hairs look shiny and smooth!</li>
            <li>im gonna stock up more.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s extremely strong.</li>
            <li>I am a WEN user but I decided to give this a try because I LOVE castor oil in my hair, it makes my hair grow so much faster.</li>
            <li>Maybe I would like it more if I was transitioning from a normal shampoo and conditioner that has sulfates..</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t use this yet, but I&#x27;m not crazy about the scent.</li>
            <li>I love this products, leave my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>So why not use a shampoo and conditioner that has castor oil in it, right?</li>
            <li>Its frizzy and thick, this stuff is purely amazing, allows for a SUPERB comb over and adds a great base for my John Masters Organics pomade.</li>
            <li>First use</li>
            <li>I was interested in this &#x27;wen&#x27; stuff when I saw this...</li>
            <li>My hair felt so soft and was tangle free.</li>
            <li>So first off I noticed that the consistency is very watery in both the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>It works really well</li>
            <li>I will be buying this as long as its available and the rest of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I truly had high hopes since castor oil works so well on my hair.</li>
            <li>I was blown away, new hair growth?</li>
            <li>ME, this is not a hair product reserved for only a certain hair type.</li>
            <li>It is ALL natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s all natural</li>
            <li>With WEN my hair is really soft</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair so soft will reorder.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product however, I would caution that people with sensitive noses use it with caution.</li>
            <li>this is my first time using this product don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ve used it long enough to say yet.</li>
            <li>and he had no other option but to use this.. as I&#x27;m trying to get rid of all SLS in my house...</li>
            <li>and also I am not from a family known for hair loss, so everything works differently for everyone but as far as the oils and way my hair feels..</li>
            <li>Im african american and have natural dry kinky hair</li>

            <li> and also I am not from a family known for hair loss, so everything works differently for everyone but as far as the oils and way my hair feels..</li>
            <li> Im african american and have natural dry kinky hair</li>
            <li> and I have a high tight fade on the sides.</li>
            <li> After washing my hair, my hair felt drier then usual and my curls were straight up frizzy..</li>
            <li> I really like the way my hair feels after putting the conditioner in, but I am not sure if you are supposed to rinse it out or leave in.</li>
            <li> The smell is also very strong, I wouldn&#x27;t say its unpleasant..</li>
            <li> My hair is thick, curly (3c texture) and about armpit length when straight.</li>
            <li> I use it for at least 3-4 months and finally gave up on it.....</li>
            <li> but the conditioner leaves a greasy film and is heavy on the hair.</li>
            <li> The smell for the two products are a tad raunchy, but they give my type 4 natural hair moisture beyond my wildest dreams.</li>
            <li> also got the red pimento growth oil they offer and my hairline (which wasn&#x27;t bad at all) is having tiny small hairs grow in the corner of my forehead..</li>
            <li> wtf..</li>
            <li> So that was a fail.</li>
            <li> I noticed the softness in my hair ,the smell isn&#x27;t bad like everyone said.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed in this shampoo and conditioner..</li>
            <li> Was hoping for growth and thickness but very disappointing.....</li>

            <li> Was hoping for growth and thickness but very disappointing.....I use it for at least 3-4 months and finally gave up on it.....may work for others, but not for me.</li>
            <li> First use I noticed the softness in my hair ,the smell isn&#x27;t bad like everyone said. I will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> Best Shampoo I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I was interested in this &#x27;wen&#x27; stuff when I saw this... I have sicilian, peruvian/incan, german, french, english ancestry. I only say this to give a background of my hair type. Its frizzy and thick, this stuff is purely amazing, allows for a SUPERB comb over and adds a great base for my John Masters Organics pomade. This shampoo is basically just oil and cleanses as well as moisturizes my hair unlike anything I&#x27;ve ever had.. Also my hair is about 4 inches on top and I have a high tight fade on the sides. I do a &#x27;john dillinger&#x27; to 50&#x27;s comb over style and it seems to be a perfect fit for me. I&#x27;ve recommended it to fellow band members and friends that do a similar hairstyle, had a friend stay over from chicago and he had no other option but to use this.. as I&#x27;m trying to get rid of all SLS in my house... He was totally shocked and loved how its helped style his hair ( he has thinner blonde hair). He now uses this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TRUST ME, this is not a hair product reserved for only a certain hair type. I will be buying this as long as its available and the rest of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also got the red pimento growth oil they offer and my hairline (which wasn&#x27;t bad at all) is having tiny small hairs grow in the corner of my forehead.. I was blown away, new hair growth? wtf.. obviously something rad is going on with this Castor Oil stuff lol, just my 2 cents. (also, I did quit smoking cigarettes years ago and stopped a great deal of alcohol consumption, which is a leading cause of hair loss, besides genetics, so I&#x27;m not saying its a miracle but its working well for me and also I am not from a family known for hair loss, so everything works differently for everyone but as far as the oils and way my hair feels.. its amazing, is just an understatement)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am forever grateful for this company.</li>
            <li> this is my first time using this product don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ve used it long enough to say yet. still trying it.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS product it is my go to. Im african american and have natural dry kinky hair and this helps alot with the moisture. love the smell of the rosemary conditioner, and the shampoo is sudsy and moisturizes my hair instead of drying it out like most shampoos. great ingredients in the product. will keep this stocked until the day i die lol.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product! It is ALL natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I like the shampoo. It works really well but the conditioner leaves a greasy film and is heavy on the hair.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t use this yet, but I&#x27;m not crazy about the scent. I sure hope it&#x27;s effective...especially since it&#x27;s smelly and pricey. After I start using it and see results, i&#x27;ll update my review.</li>
            <li> I am a WEN user but I decided to give this a try because I LOVE castor oil in my hair, it makes my hair grow so much faster. So why not use a shampoo and conditioner that has castor oil in it, right? My hair is thick, curly (3c texture) and about armpit length when straight. So first off I noticed that the consistency is very watery in both the shampoo and conditioner. I know it&#x27;s all natural but I felt like I had to use a fourth of the bottle just to wash my hair one time. The smell is also very strong, I wouldn&#x27;t say its unpleasant.. It smells like rosemary and lemons but it&#x27;s extremely strong. After washing my hair, my hair felt drier then usual and my curls were straight up frizzy.. So that was a fail. With WEN my hair is really soft and I get nice defined curls. Luckily my hair drank up so good ol&#x27; castor oil to restore some moisture. I&#x27;m really disappointed in this shampoo and conditioner.. I truly had high hopes since castor oil works so well on my hair. Maybe I would like it more if I was transitioning from a normal shampoo and conditioner that has sulfates.. But I&#x27;ve already discovered WEN and that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll stick with.</li>
            <li> I used both products today. I really like the way my hair feels after putting the conditioner in, but I am not sure if you are supposed to rinse it out or leave in. There are no directions on the bottle concerning this question, so in order to be on the safe side, I rinsed it out after five minutes of putting it in. My hair felt so soft and was tangle free. No noticeable differences with the shampoo as compared to others.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair so soft will reorder.</li>
            <li> I really love this product bundle. The smell for the two products are a tad raunchy, but they give my type 4 natural hair moisture beyond my wildest dreams. I would recommend this product however, I would caution that people with sensitive noses use it with caution.</li>
            <li> It really a good product&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok I&#x27;ll use more often and post again</li>
            <li> I love this products, leave my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> they are awesome! my hairs look shiny and smooth! great deal for the price...im gonna stock up more.</li>
            <li> This product works miracles, My sister loves this products</li>
