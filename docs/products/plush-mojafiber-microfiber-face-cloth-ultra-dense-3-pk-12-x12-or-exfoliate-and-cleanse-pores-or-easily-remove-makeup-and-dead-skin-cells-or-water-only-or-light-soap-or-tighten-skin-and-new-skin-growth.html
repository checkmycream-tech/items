            <li>Not rolled up and packaged as in photo but nice nonetheless.</li>
            <li>so I think she liked this</li>
            <li>High Quality and Great Service!</li>
            <li>Very easy to travel with.</li>
            <li>I do use soap with the cloths but, haven&#x27;t noticed any real significant detraction from the effectiveness of the cleaning.</li>
            <li>These towels are excellent for the face; great for people that have acne , skin discoloration, and other skin imperfections.</li>
            <li>Soft and great face cloths!  </li>
            <li>not just because they have an excellent product but because they help people in poverty live chemical free lives too!</li>
            <li>I love that I can wash them and reuse.</li>
            <li>Gets makeup off for sure.</li>
            <li>Getting more for sure.</li>
            <li>I am buying more just to use for my face.</li>
            <li>Love these, and purchased as gifts.</li>
            <li>I love the fabric.</li>
            <li>I love it and glad it came in a 3-pack</li>
            <li>So glad I found them.</li>
            <li>Love these towels.  </li>
            <li>Both have good effects; oil is nice because it allows for a more thorough clean and also leaves your face moisturized, but water will do just fine if you want a quick no fuss freshen</li>
            <li>Hands down the best microfiber cloth I&#x27;ve found, and I&#x27;ve tried many.  </li>
            <li>They take off my makeup easily, including mascara, with just water.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They also can take off makeup quite easily with just a dab of water, and effortlessly with a bit of oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also absorbs water well and dries quickly!</li>
            <li>My face feels smooth and exfoliated with these.  </li>
            <li>I use them to take off eye makeup and it comes of very easily with one gentle swipe.  </li>
            <li>Love these on my face, very smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>so I can always have a clean one when I want it.</li>
            <li>My face has never felt so clean until I started using these cloths.  </li>
            <li>Amazing towels and super soft.</li>
            <li>These towels also absorb so quickly after use.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t smell and are clean my sensitive skin gently but effectively.</li>
            <li>Very soft and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>The stitching at the edges of the cloths are of a great quality but, I don&#x27;t like that it is a little rougher than the rest of the fabric.</li>
            <li>It works exactly as it says - it did remove my makeup and left my face feeling more clean than washing with just my hands!</li>
            <li>They are very durable, comfortable and well made.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>I can get my granddaughter to wash her face without a fuss, i love em, sooo soft.</li>
            <li>A tad pricey for wash cloths but worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I use these face clothes with warm water, morning and night, and no longer use (or spend money on) facial cleansers.</li>
            <li>but most microfiber clothes aren&#x27;t this lush.  </li>
            <li>dries quickly, works exactly as described and looks just like a washcloth.</li>
            <li>Now to be clear, I had to use the more exfoliating side to remove my makeup because the other one is very soft and probably used best for a final rinsing cleanse.</li>
            <li>It works really well (alone without cleanser) to remove makeup!</li>
            <li>I want to keep supporting them</li>
            <li>Better than a washcloth and such a luxury for the face.</li>
            <li>It is exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>They leave your skin feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li>Be gentle when using it on your face the first time.</li>
            <li>Super soft.</li>
            <li>These do an impressive job removing all my makeup and it seems like my breakouts might be a little less since using it.</li>
            <li>Does remove makeup really well.</li>
            <li>These are very durable.  </li>
            <li>Appreciated.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It really works to remove all traces of debris.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure you do not wash with other fabrics and do not use fabric softener.</li>
            <li>I like that they are made to be used only with water and as a result they leave the skin feeling clean without any residue or drying out.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I have problems with eczema on my face and really need to be careful with how I clean my face and remove makeup.</li>
            <li>These are really soft but at the same time, do make my face feel clean.  </li>
            <li>Soft and gently exfoliating.  </li>
            <li>Very soft, but I don&#x27;t like washing my face with them.</li>
            <li>There was a strange smell and the color bleeds after two washing.&lt;br /&gt;They are soft and air dries quickly</li>
            <li>It dries fast and is soft again the next time I&#x27;m ready to use it.</li>
            <li>This was so soft and cleaned effortlessly!</li>
            <li>Soft!</li>
            <li>I run the cotton pad test with oil on my face after a wash, and this time face was indeed 95% clean, in other words there were still traces of makeup</li>
            <li>The weave is very dense, but the fibers aren&#x27;t too long like some of the gimmicky microfiber cloths that cost more.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very soft and get all my makeup off with just a tiny bit of gentle face soap.  </li>
            <li>The cloths after several washings continue to bleed dye, certainly wouldn&#x27;t use these on my face.  </li>
            <li>I love the &amp;#34;exfoliating&amp;#34; side, I expected it to be rough</li>
            <li>clear-</li>
            <li>So soft and washes well.</li>
            <li>These towels are soft, they feel like heaven on my face.</li>
            <li>I am always skeptical of all positive reviews now a days given the several times I was solicited by sellers to leave them excellent feedback for super mediocre products.</li>
            <li>These micro fiber clothes are very soft and easy on my delicate skin.</li>
            <li>These washcloths are super soft but instructions are to wash separately and air dry or dry separately.</li>
            <li>Not good for face, but ok for body</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t look like there is going to be an unraveling anytime in the near future.</li>
            <li>It feels very soft but it&#x27;s powerful and will irritate your face if you scrub hard.</li>
            <li>They are great if you have dry patches that get irritated with the cold weather.</li>
            <li>I still wanted to try out this product eventhough, the price isn&#x27;t as cheap compared with a few other microfiber cloths and that there were no reviews.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s extremely soft and does wonders for my dry skin.</li>

            <li> My skin is sensitive to break-outs, but I have had significantly less issues since using these!</li>
            <li> I was so skeptical to use these, but they really work!  </li>
            <li> I received a coupon for their store and when checking out their other products I was taken aback by their humanitarian goals and efforts as a company.</li>
            <li> I use them in place of a facial cleanser - depending on how lazy I feel, I apply either water or coconut oil on my face and then wipe off.</li>
            <li> One for washing and the other for exfoliation.</li>
            <li> face cloths though especially when I’m tired and don’t feel like doing my regular beauty nighttime routine.</li>
            <li> The down side is that they are made to be used without soap or other cleaner.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to scrub very hard at all like you might with a regular washcloth.</li>
            <li> This runs... took quite a few washes to get it to run</li>
            <li> a bit small, but works well</li>
            <li> These are just plain genius, not much more I can say!</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are a lighter color than they appear in the picture, and also not quite as thick as I thought they would be, but neither gets in the way of them doing their job.</li>
            <li> Very absorbent towels and doesn&#x27;t have any awful smell.</li>
            <li> The jury is still out, but I&#x27;ve not experienced any downside.</li>
            <li> Cleans my face without crazy abrasion.</li>

            <li> started falling apart after 1 wash</li>
            <li> I was so skeptical to use these, but they really work!  I use them to take off eye makeup and it comes of very easily with one gentle swipe.  I love that I can wash them and reuse.</li>
            <li> These are really nice face cloths.  They&#x27;re very soft and get all my makeup off with just a tiny bit of gentle face soap.  My face feels smooth and exfoliated with these.  I use this face cloth in the shower and once I&#x27;m finished, I wring it out and hang it on a hook.  It dries fast and is soft again the next time I&#x27;m ready to use it.</li>
            <li> Ultra dense...no way!</li>
            <li> Love these cloths!  I bought two sets!  No soap needed.  Takes off all my makeup and mascara with no products needed...just warm water!</li>
            <li> These work great! They take off my makeup easily, including mascara, with just water. Very easy to travel with. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> teriffific face cloth .Bride loves to use it to remove warpaint</li>
            <li> I have problems with eczema on my face and really need to be careful with how I clean my face and remove makeup. This was so soft and cleaned effortlessly! I love the &amp;#34;exfoliating&amp;#34; side, I expected it to be rough but it&#x27;s not, it&#x27;s extremely soft and does wonders for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Gets makeup off for sure. So soft and washes well. Getting more for sure.</li>
            <li> This runs... took quite a few washes to get it to run clear- I am always skeptical of all positive reviews now a days given the several times I was solicited by sellers to leave them excellent feedback for super mediocre products. That being said aside from the dye running it does actually what it claims, gets out mascara and everything. I run the cotton pad test with oil on my face after a wash, and this time face was indeed 95% clean, in other words there were still traces of makeup but overall didn&#x27;t need the scour scrub I often give myself - something all the towelettes on the market can&#x27;t claim!</li>
            <li> Very absorbent towels and doesn&#x27;t have any awful smell.</li>
            <li> Cleans my face without crazy abrasion. Super soft. Great deal</li>
            <li> Does remove makeup really well.</li>
            <li> Very soft and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Awesome microfiber towels for face cleansing. I use these to wash my face every night. It works really well (alone without cleanser) to remove makeup! It also absorbs water well and dries quickly!</li>
            <li> I am sooooo impressed!! It works exactly as it says - it did remove my makeup and left my face feeling more clean than washing with just my hands! Now to be clear, I had to use the more exfoliating side to remove my makeup because the other one is very soft and probably used best for a final rinsing cleanse. I received a coupon for their store and when checking out their other products I was taken aback by their humanitarian goals and efforts as a company. I want to keep supporting them not just because they have an excellent product but because they help people in poverty live chemical free lives too!</li>
            <li> I purchased these Mojafiber face cloths after discovering the benefits of microfiber cleaning.  I like the size, weight and quality of these face cloths.  The caramel color is also nice.  I’m not entirely enamored with how these feel against my face though.  They don’t “glide” over your face like a regular terry washcloth.  You have to push the microfiber cloths around with some force and the cloth sometimes feels like it’s getting &amp;#34;stuck&amp;#34; on your face.  I was hoping to eliminate cleanser and regular wash cloths with this purchase, but I don’t think that’s going to happen.  I do like the occasional convenience of these microfiber face cloths though especially when I’m tired and don’t feel like doing my regular beauty nighttime routine.</li>
            <li> The cloths after several washings continue to bleed dye, certainly wouldn&#x27;t use these on my face.  I would give these cloths a zero star rating if I could.</li>
            <li> Love these on my face, very smooth and soft.  I am buying more just to use for my face. They are great if you have dry patches that get irritated with the cold weather.</li>
            <li> These are really soft but at the same time, do make my face feel clean.  All the makeup gets gone.  I love them!</li>
            <li> I purchased these to remove makeup.  Better than a washcloth and such a luxury for the face. These travel, wash and store quite well!</li>
            <li> These are the best face cloths I have ever used!  Soft and gently exfoliating.  Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I can get my granddaughter to wash her face without a fuss, i love em, sooo soft.</li>
            <li> Love these, and purchased as gifts.</li>
            <li> These towels are soft, they feel like heaven on my face. I love the fabric.</li>
            <li> Best face wash cloths ever!</li>
            <li> Amazing towels and super soft. These towels are excellent for the face; great for people that have acne , skin discoloration, and other skin imperfections. These towels also absorb so quickly after use.</li>
            <li> These do an impressive job removing all my makeup and it seems like my breakouts might be a little less since using it. Be gentle when using it on your face the first time. You don&#x27;t need to scrub very hard at all like you might with a regular washcloth. It feels very soft but it&#x27;s powerful and will irritate your face if you scrub hard. I love it and glad it came in a 3-pack so I can always have a clean one when I want it.</li>
            <li> There was a strange smell and the color bleeds after two washing.&lt;br /&gt;They are soft and air dries quickly</li>
            <li> These cloths are the best. They leave your skin feeling clean and soft. So glad I found them.</li>
            <li> These washcloths are super soft but instructions are to wash separately and air dry or dry separately. I don&#x27;t have time for that and will be washing and drying with the rest of my towels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this item at a discounted rate in exchange for honest review.</li>
            <li> These are just plain genius, not much more I can say!</li>
            <li> It is exactly as advertised. It works and feels great. It is absorbent and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue of lint/fibers on my face. I do use soap with the cloths but, haven&#x27;t noticed any real significant detraction from the effectiveness of the cleaning. The stitching at the edges of the cloths are of a great quality but, I don&#x27;t like that it is a little rougher than the rest of the fabric. There is no unraveling of the cloth and it doesn&#x27;t look like there is going to be an unraveling anytime in the near future. It is made of sturdy material and quality especially, already after machine washes. I still wanted to try out this product eventhough, the price isn&#x27;t as cheap compared with a few other microfiber cloths and that there were no reviews.</li>
            <li> Amazing cloths for face and body. A tad pricey for wash cloths but worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best microfiber cloth I&#x27;ve found, and I&#x27;ve tried many.  These are very durable.  The weave is very dense, but the fibers aren&#x27;t too long like some of the gimmicky microfiber cloths that cost more.  I use this cloth to wash my face each evening before applying Retin-A and moisturizer (Mojacare night cream).  My face has never felt so clean until I started using these cloths.  The dense fibers (1.6 million per square inch) gently shed dead skin cells and pulls everything out of my pores with no chemical cleansers.  My wife says that this cloth with water alone also removes all of her makeup, even waterproof mascara, without having to use makeup remover.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with such a simple purchase as a cloth.  I bought a lot of extras of these in case they ever stop making them.  Everybody I&#x27;ve given one to loves it.</li>
            <li> Love these towels.  Cleans my face great and when rinseing them out, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> Very soft, but I don&#x27;t like washing my face with them.</li>
            <li> dries quickly, works exactly as described and looks just like a washcloth.</li>
            <li> Soft! Love these cloths!</li>
            <li> I use these face clothes with warm water, morning and night, and no longer use (or spend money on) facial cleansers. My skin is sensitive to break-outs, but I have had significantly less issues since using these! They are wonderful!</li>
            <li> Not rolled up and packaged as in photo but nice nonetheless. A bit pricey for towels you might pick up at bed bath and beyond, but I paid for convenience.</li>
            <li> Excellent face cloths! They don&#x27;t smell and are clean my sensitive skin gently but effectively.</li>
            <li> Great washing-up cloths to use after removing makeup so that you don&#x27;t stain your washcloth - nor traumatize your face. Appreciated.</li>
            <li> Soft and great face cloths!  High Quality and Great Service!</li>
            <li> I purchased these recently after having them recommended to me.  They are very durable, comfortable and well made.  The texture also works to act, as described, to exfoliate.  I like that they are made to be used only with water and as a result they leave the skin feeling clean without any residue or drying out.  The down side is that they are made to be used without soap or other cleaner.  The jury is still out, but I&#x27;ve not experienced any downside.</li>
            <li> What a wonderful cloth to wash with I don&#x27;t want to use anything else.</li>
            <li> These are so amazing - it&#x27;s like some kind of sorcery. I use them in place of a facial cleanser - depending on how lazy I feel, I apply either water or coconut oil on my face and then wipe off. Both have good effects; oil is nice because it allows for a more thorough clean and also leaves your face moisturized, but water will do just fine if you want a quick no fuss freshen up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They also can take off makeup quite easily with just a dab of water, and effortlessly with a bit of oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are a lighter color than they appear in the picture, and also not quite as thick as I thought they would be, but neither gets in the way of them doing their job.</li>
            <li> Package arrived quickly (Prime is great!) These micro fiber clothes are very soft and easy on my delicate skin. I recommend them!</li>
            <li> Not good for face, but ok for body</li>
            <li> Very different. I like them.</li>
            <li> a bit small, but works well and it doesn&#x27;t smell!!</li>
            <li> These have worked wonders on my face since using them. Thanks.</li>
            <li> gift so I think she liked this</li>
            <li> When you purchase you&#x27;ll notice two different sides.  One for washing and the other for exfoliation. It really works to remove all traces of debris.  Pricy but most microfiber clothes aren&#x27;t this lush.  You receive three so they will last a while.  Just make sure you do not wash with other fabrics and do not use fabric softener.</li>
