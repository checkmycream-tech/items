            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on it.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Its more for a child.</li>
            <li>They looked ok but the pin or jewel on them is not what you get.</li>
            <li>I love this and wear it all the time.</li>
            <li>it looks lovely with any outfit she chooses.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be able to use them.</li>
            <li>I love them.  </li>
            <li>Looks even better in person.  </li>
            <li>So got make sure not to bend..</li>
            <li>I really love them.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for something with more volume/bulk to it.  </li>
            <li>but there could have been more.  </li>
            <li>Even better in person.</li>
            <li>My friend and I ended up ripping it apart, buying some more feathers and making it into a nicer clip.</li>
            <li>Cut a bit goofy.</li>
            <li>If you like peacock feathers you will love these clips.</li>
            <li>I collect peacocks and love everything about them.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this item to anyone:)</li>
            <li>Absolutely adorable.</li>
            <li>You will love it.</li>
            <li>I would definitely have to get a perfect one before I would order again...</li>
            <li>But it is lovely to look at,</li>
            <li>Ok, shame on me for thinking I&#x27;d get rhinestones at this price.</li>
            <li>Cute.</li>
            <li>Super cute!</li>
            <li>First order was messed up but they made good on it.  </li>
            <li>Wore this with my peacock shirt and loved it so much!  </li>
            <li>Its pretty, and my daughter loved it but the embelishment is falling off and it hasnt even been worn.</li>
            <li>Nicely priced and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>It took a while for the peacock feather clip to arrive...but it was worth the wait, it was lovely!  </li>
            <li>It probably works fine for most people</li>
            <li>The feathers are beautiful though and the clip is a good tight one.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;ll be easy for me to alter it.  </li>
            <li>BUT when it arrived, the clip was sticking out in such a way that it split one of the beautiful peacock feathers</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and pretty.  </li>
            <li>They are very pretty &amp; my sisters will look beautiful wearing them on my big day :)</li>
            <li>The quality was fine...</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;d probably mess it up wearing it out anyway), but I wish it had been perfect when it arrived.</li>
            <li>perfect for a little pazaz in your hair.</li>
            <li>Very pretty can&#x27;t wait to see them on the girls!</li>
            <li>What I got wouldn&#x27;t have even fit a newborn baby</li>
            <li>, I Understand It Was Cheap</li>
            <li>They came with a silver plastic cheap thing.</li>
            <li>Rather cheap looking.</li>
            <li>I will enjoy wearing this one</li>
            <li>Beautifully Detailed.</li>
            <li>, I am into that crafty stuff</li>
            <li>so it looks cheap.</li>
            <li>once you get it out of the packaging, you can smooth out the wrinkles, and they are no longer noticeable.  </li>
            <li>I bought it for my 4 yr old grand daughter, who loves it so much that she wears a lot, and received many compliments!!</li>
            <li>It will look very nice in her red hair.</li>
            <li>So pretty i love this feather hair clip</li>
            <li>So unique.</li>
            <li>Used it in my hair for a wedding, it was great, stayed in never got loose or fell out.</li>
            <li>This appears to be made from real peacock feathers and is quite lovely.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t wore it yet but seems to be very sturdy:)</li>
            <li>A really sweet hair clip for all ages.</li>
            <li>This is very pretty but it is much smaller than it seems in the photo, which was actually a good thing to me.</li>
            <li>Well made, arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>Luckily it arrived 10/20/13.  </li>
            <li>It is sturdy enough that I will be able to use it many times.</li>
            <li>Of course, the feathers get a little bit of wear from the packaging, but it&#x27;s still beautiful.</li>
            <li>Just what I was looking for and very pretty.</li>
            <li>it is pretty cheap.</li>
            <li>The price of the item was very reasonable as well!</li>
            <li>This is a very pretty hair clip for the price.  </li>
            <li>Very pretty</li>
            <li>Very pretty.</li>
            <li>But looks good in my dark or light hair..</li>
            <li>--It is exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what was described!</li>
            <li>I was totally surprised and pleased.</li>
            <li>and I did order one extra in case any were a &amp;#34;dud.&amp;#34; They were all nice though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li>So it does not open as nicely as the picture shows.  </li>
            <li>This lovely item arrived 3 weeks early to my amazement.</li>
            <li>they brought a fun flair to our hair on my wedding day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of those spring loaded pinch clips like the  kind beauticians use to hold back your hair.  </li>
            <li>I got this for my Mother&#x27;s wedding and it was just the right size and held in her thin hair perfectly.</li>
            <li>These came pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>PRICE WAS RIGHT AND VENDOR/</li>
            <li>It is made to be worn on the right side of your head though.  </li>
            <li>but it was delivered right when it was projected to be delivered- like a couple weeks</li>
            <li>And, the price is right.</li>
            <li>Cute, small and fits nicely with any of my hair styles</li>
            <li>So colorful and pretty.  </li>
            <li>very cute accent, especially since my 8 year old daughter is really into peacocks right now!  </li>
            <li>SO VERY MUCH.</li>
            <li>Cost was very reasonable.</li>
            <li>The whole clip lays nice and flat against your head.</li>
            <li>If you need this for a particular event, make sure to order it early</li>
            <li>Overall these are cute and very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I was expecting something that would fit my 6 year old...</li>
            <li>The clip itself was very sturdy and stayed secured in my hair for over 12 hours of dancing!</li>
            <li>but unfortunately it is not</li>
            <li>Simple yet elegant.</li>
            <li>I prefer the clip to a comb because it allows for more freedom to wear the clip with different hairstyles.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so pretty</li>
            <li>I will most likely add more feathers to it later</li>
            <li>hot gluing another one on it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll probably cost more to ship it back!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really pretty.</li>
            <li>It came exactly as it appears in the picture.</li>
            <li>much smaller than pictured, I will have to &amp;#34;add&amp;#34; to it to make stand out better</li>
            <li>It came in the mail pretty fast.</li>
            <li>Such a sweet clip!</li>
            <li>pretty cheap in construction, in quality, and the overall look.</li>
            <li>The clip it means that I can clip it to a large purple flower on my hat and</li>
            <li>i thought it of a very high quality product</li>
            <li>very cute...bought this for my daughter&#x27;s school performance..</li>
            <li>Thanks so much</li>
            <li>You changed but nothing  sent it thanks for nothing</li>
            <li>I bought this for my friend, who absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Keeping it as the price makes it not worse the time returning it etc...</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>The jewel is a cheap piece of plastic and looks as such.  </li>
            <li>She wants to be a peacock.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very well made and could see myself wearing it again without a Halloween costume.</li>
            <li>It is to big and looks cheap</li>
            <li>the rhinestone really makes it pop.</li>
            <li>It was very squished with no protection in the packaging</li>
            <li>Thank god my mom is crafty &amp; came up with something very similar!</li>
            <li>the rhinestones are a good quality not cheap looking and the feathers are soft</li>
            <li>The colors are rich and it has a metal clip on the back.  </li>
            <li>This hair clip is so classy &amp; pretty.  </li>
            <li>They all came packaged individual, the product was true to what the picture represents</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more black than anything.</li>
            <li>very poor quality, i could have made one myself and been more satisfied</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn this a few times, it is not subtle but adds a lovely touch to an evening chignon</li>
            <li>The diamond in the center is a shiny piece of cheap plastic.</li>
            <li>It is very cute, not too big, not too small</li>
            <li>They are really pretty in person and totally completed the look for my girls and my peacock color scheme</li>
            <li>I purchased 7 of these for my wedding and they arrived completely unusable!  </li>
            <li>I have to hot glue them back on.</li>
            <li>They are bigger than the picture shows but still pretty.</li>
            <li>The pin at the back was in pieces, still thinking of what to do with the beautiful flower that has now become useless</li>
            <li>The picture does not really do it justice, as it&#x27;s very very pretty.</li>
            <li>I took the hair piece apart and fixed it so it would look like the picture.</li>
            <li>but I fixed it by straightnening them with my hair straighter.</li>
            <li>and I surprised her with this clip</li>
            <li>I got this for my 17 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>Came late wasn&#x27;t able to wear it for my peacock costume</li>
            <li>It took nearly a month to receive but for the price and quality I feel I made out like a bandit.</li>
            <li>It was just the right size too, not to overbearing but big enough to stand out.</li>
            <li>The feathers were slightly bent due to the packaging, but it was ok...</li>
            <li>The clip on the back looks cheap so they will have to use other clips to hold their hair back &amp; use this clip to just poke it in to decorate their hair.</li>
            <li>Origionaly gave four stars cause it seamed delicate and easily damaged.</li>
            <li>My friend loves peacocks and this was one of a few perfects little pieces I was able to find.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really very lovely just as pictured but to my disappointment it came broke and all attempts to fix it was futile.</li>
            <li>But if you are looking for exactly this then don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
            <li>but I have very thick and easily tangled</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not to big or to small, very real looking &amp;</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on it.  </li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> Its more for a child.</li>
            <li> They looked ok but the pin or jewel on them is not what you get.</li>
            <li> I love this and wear it all the time.</li>
            <li> it looks lovely with any outfit she chooses.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be able to use them.</li>
            <li> I love them.  </li>
            <li> Looks even better in person.  </li>
            <li> So got make sure not to bend..</li>
            <li> I really love them.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for something with more volume/bulk to it.  </li>
            <li> but there could have been more.  </li>
            <li> Even better in person.</li>
            <li> My friend and I ended up ripping it apart, buying some more feathers and making it into a nicer clip.</li>
            <li> Cut a bit goofy.</li>
            <li> If you like peacock feathers you will love these clips.</li>
            <li> I collect peacocks and love everything about them.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this item to anyone:)</li>
            <li> Absolutely adorable.</li>
            <li> You will love it.</li>
            <li> I would definitely have to get a perfect one before I would order again...</li>
            <li> But it is lovely to look at,</li>
            <li> Ok, shame on me for thinking I&#x27;d get rhinestones at this price.</li>
            <li> Cute.</li>
            <li> Super cute!</li>
            <li> First order was messed up but they made good on it.  </li>
            <li> Wore this with my peacock shirt and loved it so much!  </li>
            <li> Its pretty, and my daughter loved it but the embelishment is falling off and it hasnt even been worn.</li>
            <li> Nicely priced and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> It took a while for the peacock feather clip to arrive...but it was worth the wait, it was lovely!  </li>
            <li> It probably works fine for most people</li>
            <li> The feathers are beautiful though and the clip is a good tight one.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;ll be easy for me to alter it.  </li>
            <li> BUT when it arrived, the clip was sticking out in such a way that it split one of the beautiful peacock feathers</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and pretty.  </li>
            <li> They are very pretty &amp; my sisters will look beautiful wearing them on my big day :)</li>
            <li> The quality was fine...</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;d probably mess it up wearing it out anyway), but I wish it had been perfect when it arrived.</li>
            <li> perfect for a little pazaz in your hair.</li>
            <li> Very pretty can&#x27;t wait to see them on the girls!</li>
            <li> What I got wouldn&#x27;t have even fit a newborn baby</li>
            <li> , I Understand It Was Cheap</li>
            <li> They came with a silver plastic cheap thing.</li>
            <li> Rather cheap looking.</li>
            <li> I will enjoy wearing this one</li>
            <li> Beautifully Detailed.</li>
            <li> , I am into that crafty stuff</li>
            <li> so it looks cheap.</li>
            <li> once you get it out of the packaging, you can smooth out the wrinkles, and they are no longer noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I bought it for my 4 yr old grand daughter, who loves it so much that she wears a lot, and received many compliments!!</li>
            <li> It will look very nice in her red hair.</li>
            <li> So pretty i love this feather hair clip</li>
            <li> So unique.</li>
            <li> Used it in my hair for a wedding, it was great, stayed in never got loose or fell out.</li>
            <li> This appears to be made from real peacock feathers and is quite lovely.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t wore it yet but seems to be very sturdy:)</li>
            <li> A really sweet hair clip for all ages.</li>
            <li> This is very pretty but it is much smaller than it seems in the photo, which was actually a good thing to me.</li>
            <li> Well made, arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> Luckily it arrived 10/20/13.  </li>
            <li> It is sturdy enough that I will be able to use it many times.</li>
            <li> Of course, the feathers get a little bit of wear from the packaging, but it&#x27;s still beautiful.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for and very pretty.</li>
            <li> it is pretty cheap.</li>
            <li> The price of the item was very reasonable as well!</li>
            <li> This is a very pretty hair clip for the price.  </li>
            <li> Very pretty</li>
            <li> Very pretty.</li>
            <li> But looks good in my dark or light hair..</li>
            <li> --It is exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what was described!</li>
            <li> I was totally surprised and pleased.</li>
            <li> and I did order one extra in case any were a &amp;#34;dud.&amp;#34; They were all nice though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> So it does not open as nicely as the picture shows.  </li>
            <li> This lovely item arrived 3 weeks early to my amazement.</li>
            <li> they brought a fun flair to our hair on my wedding day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of those spring loaded pinch clips like the  kind beauticians use to hold back your hair.  </li>
            <li> I got this for my Mother&#x27;s wedding and it was just the right size and held in her thin hair perfectly.</li>
            <li> These came pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> PRICE WAS RIGHT AND VENDOR/</li>
            <li> It is made to be worn on the right side of your head though.  </li>
            <li> but it was delivered right when it was projected to be delivered- like a couple weeks</li>
            <li> And, the price is right.</li>
            <li> Cute, small and fits nicely with any of my hair styles</li>
            <li> So colorful and pretty.  </li>
            <li> very cute accent, especially since my 8 year old daughter is really into peacocks right now!  </li>
            <li> SO VERY MUCH.</li>
            <li> Cost was very reasonable.</li>
            <li> The whole clip lays nice and flat against your head.</li>
            <li> If you need this for a particular event, make sure to order it early</li>
            <li> Overall these are cute and very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I was expecting something that would fit my 6 year old...</li>
            <li> The clip itself was very sturdy and stayed secured in my hair for over 12 hours of dancing!</li>
            <li> but unfortunately it is not</li>
            <li> Simple yet elegant.</li>
            <li> I prefer the clip to a comb because it allows for more freedom to wear the clip with different hairstyles.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so pretty</li>
            <li> I will most likely add more feathers to it later</li>
            <li> hot gluing another one on it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll probably cost more to ship it back!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really pretty.</li>
            <li> It came exactly as it appears in the picture.</li>
            <li> much smaller than pictured, I will have to &amp;#34;add&amp;#34; to it to make stand out better</li>
            <li> It came in the mail pretty fast.</li>
            <li> Such a sweet clip!</li>
            <li> pretty cheap in construction, in quality, and the overall look.</li>
            <li> The clip it means that I can clip it to a large purple flower on my hat and</li>
            <li> i thought it of a very high quality product</li>
            <li> very cute...bought this for my daughter&#x27;s school performance..</li>
            <li> Thanks so much</li>
            <li> You changed but nothing  sent it thanks for nothing</li>
            <li> I bought this for my friend, who absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> Keeping it as the price makes it not worse the time returning it etc...</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> The jewel is a cheap piece of plastic and looks as such.  </li>
            <li> She wants to be a peacock.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very well made and could see myself wearing it again without a Halloween costume.</li>
            <li> It is to big and looks cheap</li>
            <li> the rhinestone really makes it pop.</li>
            <li> It was very squished with no protection in the packaging</li>
            <li> Thank god my mom is crafty &amp; came up with something very similar!</li>
            <li> the rhinestones are a good quality not cheap looking and the feathers are soft</li>
            <li> The colors are rich and it has a metal clip on the back.  </li>
            <li> This hair clip is so classy &amp; pretty.  </li>
            <li> They all came packaged individual, the product was true to what the picture represents</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more black than anything.</li>
            <li> very poor quality, i could have made one myself and been more satisfied</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this a few times, it is not subtle but adds a lovely touch to an evening chignon</li>
            <li> The diamond in the center is a shiny piece of cheap plastic.</li>
            <li> It is very cute, not too big, not too small</li>
            <li> They are really pretty in person and totally completed the look for my girls and my peacock color scheme</li>
            <li> I purchased 7 of these for my wedding and they arrived completely unusable!  </li>
            <li> I have to hot glue them back on.</li>
            <li> They are bigger than the picture shows but still pretty.</li>
            <li> The pin at the back was in pieces, still thinking of what to do with the beautiful flower that has now become useless</li>
            <li> The picture does not really do it justice, as it&#x27;s very very pretty.</li>
            <li> I took the hair piece apart and fixed it so it would look like the picture.</li>
            <li> but I fixed it by straightnening them with my hair straighter.</li>
            <li> and I surprised her with this clip</li>
            <li> I got this for my 17 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li> Came late wasn&#x27;t able to wear it for my peacock costume</li>
            <li> It took nearly a month to receive but for the price and quality I feel I made out like a bandit.</li>
            <li> It was just the right size too, not to overbearing but big enough to stand out.</li>
            <li> The feathers were slightly bent due to the packaging, but it was ok...</li>
            <li> The clip on the back looks cheap so they will have to use other clips to hold their hair back &amp; use this clip to just poke it in to decorate their hair.</li>
            <li> Origionaly gave four stars cause it seamed delicate and easily damaged.</li>
            <li> My friend loves peacocks and this was one of a few perfects little pieces I was able to find.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really very lovely just as pictured but to my disappointment it came broke and all attempts to fix it was futile.</li>
            <li> But if you are looking for exactly this then don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
            <li> but I have very thick and easily tangled</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not to big or to small, very real looking &amp;</li>
            <li> When you order something from a picture, you&#x27;r never sure how it will really look.  </li>
            <li> I gave this product 3 stars because of the ETA and the hair piece was very flat.  </li>
            <li> The center piece is this cheesy plastic thing, like off a kid&#x27;s magic wand.</li>
            <li> The black feather that you see in the picture off to the left was actually on the middle peacock feather.so the clip</li>
            <li> feathers were damaged or bent, cut strange.</li>
            <li> was only 2 feathers wide instead of 3 which changes the look of it.</li>
            <li> Shipping takes quite a long time, so order well in advance of whatever event it&#x27;s for.</li>
            <li> Using this and several other pins and brooches to create my daughters wedding bouquet.  </li>
            <li> The only reason that I gave this 3 stars was due to the shipping time.  </li>
            <li> Came in a tiny damaged box without proper insulation, which resulted in feathers being misplaced, bended and smashed.</li>
            <li> It was wrapped in loose plastic</li>
            <li> My only issue with this was the way it was packaged bc when I received it it was sorta folded in half</li>
            <li> next I&#x27;m thinking of clipping them to a black dress...</li>
            <li> Three and a half years later</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really say what I wish because AMAZON didn&#x27;t post my first review!&lt;br /&gt;Totally disappointing!</li>
            <li> The feathers are soft and delicate.</li>
            <li> product as expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to remove the center piece and stick something else there.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my bridesmaids, expecting them to maybe be a little different from the picture and from each other</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> other thing, if you have cats beware -- one of my cats has it out for this hair clip.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was faster than expected, and item was exactly as expected!!</li>
            <li> I got it in a small package, and it was a little smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> As with everything that ships from China it was completely flat but at least they didn&#x27;t fold it like they do the earrings.  </li>
            <li> Half of the pieces were falling off.</li>
            <li> and I later noticed hot glue strands connecting at the base of the clip.</li>
            <li> I Thought It Was Going To Be A Little Bit Nicer Than What It Was</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a little lackluster.</li>
            <li> Arrived a little smooshed, but i like it.</li>
            <li> Delivery took a little while</li>
            <li> This item shipped from China, so it took a little while to get here...</li>
            <li> Bought for my little daughter.</li>
            <li> It is very pretty but seems so delicate that I am afraid to wear it.</li>
            <li> Missing feathers and no jewels.</li>
            <li> Its not too heavy so it stays in your hair well.</li>
            <li> they were put together so poorly and are way to big to be warn in my hair!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the peacock feathers were in really bad shape due to the packaging so I will have to do a little crafting to make these look more presentable for my wedding.</li>
            <li> It looks very expensive and it&#x27;s a real head turner.</li>
            <li> It was not worth buying!!</li>
            <li> Just like pic a little slow on getting the item</li>
            <li> SIZE IS TOO SMALL AND FLIMSLY.  </li>
            <li> and they all look just like on the picture if not better.</li>
            <li> After a few monthes and dozens of uses im five staring it!</li>
            <li> I was not able to track the location of this clip after purchase.  </li>
            <li> Item does look like picture but this arrived broken and actual clip seems to be poor quality.</li>
            <li> The package it came in was a little smaller than the clip, so one of the feathers was badly mishaped.</li>
            <li> I hate it, it is a very substandard product.</li>
            <li> I was just disappointed to see how flat it was, no volume.  </li>
            <li> Yet, I had two that were broken.</li>
            <li> When the hair clip arrived, one of the feathers was broken.</li>
            <li> The spring and the clip is separated broken off.</li>
            <li> This product came broken and is not useable!</li>
            <li> This product was put together very poorly.</li>
            <li> But It Was Very Poorly Put Together &amp; Looked Like It Came From The Dollar Tree.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really disappointing and will need a lot of work.</li>
            <li> disappointed because I could not wear it on lapel</li>
            <li> so there was a V-shaped void. :(  </li>
            <li> , I know it would have helped me. :(</li>
            <li> Really disappointed with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed, but then again I had a feeling</li>
            <li> I guess waiting on a replacement is pointless.hopefully all Amazon products arnt this awful!</li>
            <li> They are all balled up and look terrible.  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this item!</li>

            <li> Item does look like picture but this arrived broken and actual clip seems to be poor quality. I will glue or tape clip in place to use as decoration but it cannot be worn as hair clip...or you will need ot reinforce.</li>
            <li> cute and goes well with my dress</li>
            <li> pretty cheap in construction, in quality, and the overall look. Just go to Michael&#x27;s and get some feathers, a hair clip, and a glue gun. you will do a better job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;oh and by the way its ships by mule so expect to wait for months for it&#x27;s arrival. LOL free shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;never again.</li>
            <li> They were beautiful. Yet, I had two that were broken. Missing feathers and no jewels.</li>
            <li> Got it and just in time for the wedding I want to wear it in...</li>
            <li> very cute...bought this for my daughter&#x27;s school performance..it went well with her peacock project</li>
            <li> feathers were damaged or bent, cut strange. Did not look like picture</li>
            <li> Bought this for my granddaughter and she loves it.  No problem with shipping, none of the feathers were damaged.</li>
            <li> This product was put together very poorly. The clip was glued on to where it stuck out into the feathers, making the feathers separate and no longer look like a peacock feather. The black feather that you see in the picture off to the left was actually on the middle peacock feather.so the clip was only 2 feathers wide instead of 3 which changes the look of it. I am very disappointed, but then again I had a feeling this is what would happen when ordering from China! I took the hair piece apart and fixed it so it would look like the picture.I was going to return it but for the 4 weeks I waited for it and the $3 I paid.I guess waiting on a replacement is pointless.hopefully all Amazon products arnt this awful!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not what is pictured. I contacted the company, they were expedient in getting back to me, refunded the money but it still set me back in what I was making for a Christmas present. If you don&#x27;t care if it looks like this or not, it&#x27;s still a clip. But if you are looking for exactly this then don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
            <li> They arrived today. They are beautiful, and we look forward to using them in my daughters wedding!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t even what I ordered. I was expecting something that would fit my 6 year old... What I got wouldn&#x27;t have even fit a newborn baby</li>
            <li> This is very pretty but it is much smaller than it seems in the photo, which was actually a good thing to me.</li>
            <li> Perfect. Just what I was looking for and very pretty.</li>
            <li> Much better than it&#x27;s picture</li>
            <li> Great quality and size, for my daughter&#x27;s peacock costume, arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous accessory. It looks very expensive and it&#x27;s a real head turner. I wore it to a Gatsby thed wedding.</li>
            <li> When the hair clip arrived, one of the feathers was broken. Luckily my daughter bought some peacock feathers, and made a beautiful fasinator for me to wear to my friends&#x27; wedding.</li>
            <li> So cute! I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments on it.  Good quality considering it is pretty cheap.</li>
            <li> I love it.  The colors are so beautiful.  I think my daughter will want to take it when she sees it.</li>
            <li> This appears to be made from real peacock feathers and is quite lovely. I can&#x27;t wait to wear it.</li>
            <li> perfect for a little pazaz in your hair. product as expected.</li>
            <li> I Thought It Was Going To Be A Little Bit Nicer Than What It Was, I Understand It Was Cheap But It Was Very Poorly Put Together &amp; Looked Like It Came From The Dollar Tree. Something A Kid Could Have Put Together.</li>
            <li> Its more for a child.</li>
            <li> They looked ok but the pin or jewel on them is not what you get. They came with a silver plastic cheap thing. Like children&#x27;s dress up.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift and she loved it</li>
            <li> My daughter loves Peacock feathers and it was a gift for her.  It will look very nice in her red hair.</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my bridesmaids... They are really pretty in person and totally completed the look for my girls and my peacock color scheme</li>
            <li> Shipping takes quite a long time, so order well in advance of whatever event it&#x27;s for. It&#x27;s beautiful though.</li>
            <li> Rather cheap looking.</li>
            <li> Loved this beautiful clip.  Matched my dress perfectly and did a wonderful job covering the pins I couldn&#x27;t hide while doing my hair myself :)</li>
            <li> This is a really cute barrette!</li>
            <li> When you order something from a picture, you&#x27;r never sure how it will really look.  I was totally surprised and pleased. The picture does not really do it justice, as it&#x27;s very very pretty.</li>
            <li> I love this and wear it all the time. My friends love it too! I would recommend this product to any girl who likes cute hair clips! :)</li>
            <li> SIZE IS TOO SMALL AND FLIMSLY.  WILL HAVE TO WEAR IT THOUGH WITH A PEACOCK DRESS TO THE KY DERBY BALL.  PRICE WAS RIGHT AND VENDOR/MFG SENT IT ON TIME.</li>
            <li> It is cute! but it broke after one time of wearing it.The quality of it is like something I can make.</li>
            <li> very cute accent, especially since my 8 year old daughter is really into peacocks right now!  it looks lovely with any outfit she chooses.</li>
            <li> Well made, arrived quickly.  It is made to be worn on the right side of your head though.  I wear these on the left side, so had to put it in from the back. The clip is attached backwards.</li>
            <li> I got this for my Mother&#x27;s wedding and it was just the right size and held in her thin hair perfectly.</li>
            <li> Super cute! Wearing this to a peacock themed party.</li>
            <li> 3 out of the 4 that i ordered were defective. I dont reccomend buying these becuase you dont know if they are going to come in good shape or not. I returned all of them.</li>
            <li> These hairclips met all of my expectations. Cant wait to put them in all of my bridesmaids hair. Thanks so much</li>
            <li> I bought this clip for a Peacock themed wedding I was a maid of Honor in. I could not get over how beautiful this clip was! The pictures and description do not do it justice. It was just the right size too, not to overbearing but big enough to stand out. The clip itself was very sturdy and stayed secured in my hair for over 12 hours of dancing!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product :)</li>
            <li> So pretty i love this feather hair clip</li>
            <li> Clips that were big enough to show without making my bridesmaids look like Vegas showgirls. Nicely priced and arrived quickly. They are all slightly different bc of variations in feathers and I did order one extra in case any were a &amp;#34;dud.&amp;#34; They were all nice though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> I hate it, it is a very substandard product. i thought it of a very high quality product but unfortunately it is not</li>
            <li> I purchased 7 of these for my wedding and they arrived completely unusable!  They are all balled up and look terrible.  I won&#x27;t be able to use them.</li>
            <li> Beautiful but clip was chinsy</li>
            <li> First order was messed up but they made good on it.  I love them.  They are perfect for my wedding.</li>
            <li> The feather clip is exactly as described, perfect for my wedding. Simple yet elegant. The price is great and received quickly!</li>
            <li> I think and hope it will be good i am still waiting&lt;br /&gt; You changed but nothing  sent it thanks for nothing iput a 5 that was not my choice</li>
            <li> I love it! It is very cute, not too big, not too small--It is exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> Stays in place and I receive compliments each time I wear it. A good size.</li>
            <li> Beautiful, just like the picture.</li>
            <li> Perfect! Used it in my hair for a wedding, it was great, stayed in never got loose or fell out.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my 4 yr old grand daughter, who loves it so much that she wears a lot, and received many compliments!!</li>
            <li> The quality of the pin is exceptional!  I have not worn it yet but I can&#x27;t wait to.  The colors are rich and it has a metal clip on the back.  I prefer the clip to a comb because it allows for more freedom to wear the clip with different hairstyles.</li>
            <li> Looked beautiful in my maid of honours hair. My wedding colors were peacock so this was perfect</li>
            <li> I bought this for my friend, who absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> Looked beautifully on my bridesmaids!</li>
            <li> Good product. Love the fashion!</li>
            <li> I ordered 6 and they all look just like on the picture if not better. I would highly recommend to anyone! I want to place an order for a couple more asap! :)</li>
            <li> Looks even better in person.  Using this and several other pins and brooches to create my daughters wedding bouquet.  This made the bouquet stand out quite nicely.</li>
            <li> The package it came in was a little smaller than the clip, so one of the feathers was badly mishaped. Hopefully I can figure out a way to correct it. Otherwise the clip looks beautiful!</li>
            <li> this is absolutely beautiful and well made!! I was amazed that it was only $4. I am replacing my veil with this at my wedding reception</li>
            <li> My only issue with this was the way it was packaged bc when I received it it was sorta folded in half so the feathers were bend but I fixed it by straightnening them with my hair straighter. I&#x27;ve already worn it three times and its still in good shape</li>
            <li> I received this in the mail the day before a WWII Ball I was attending and it was absolutely perfect!!!!</li>
            <li> I love it! looks awesome and perfect for halloween! thanks</li>
            <li> Super cute, great to accessorize for my peacock wedding!</li>
            <li> It a feather clip.. So got make sure not to bend.. But looks good in my dark or light hair..</li>
            <li> Absolutely stunning piece! My friend loves peacocks and this was one of a few perfects little pieces I was able to find. The quality is wonderful and it can be pinned to shirt or worn as a hair piece!</li>
            <li> You get what you paid for....Came in a tiny damaged box without proper insulation, which resulted in feathers being misplaced, bended and smashed. Keeping it as the price makes it not worse the time returning it etc...</li>
            <li> i thought you could wear for a pin or in hair.  disappointed because I could not wear it on lapel</li>
            <li> I really like this clip, it is beautiful.  I have attached it to my silver hat that I bought and it really looks wonderful</li>
            <li> Cute, small and fits nicely with any of my hair styles</li>
            <li> This product came broken and is not useable! The spring and the clip is separated broken off.</li>
            <li> very poor quality, i could have made one myself and been more satisfied</li>
            <li> Origionaly gave four stars cause it seamed delicate and easily damaged. After a few monthes and dozens of uses im five staring it! Still beautiful!</li>
            <li> This hair clip is so classy &amp; pretty.  BUT when it arrived, the clip was sticking out in such a way that it split one of the beautiful peacock feathers so there was a V-shaped void. :(  It&#x27;s so pretty, I&#x27;m going to keep it (I&#x27;d probably mess it up wearing it out anyway), but I wish it had been perfect when it arrived.</li>
            <li> Such a sweet clip! I will enjoy wearing this one</li>
            <li> Half of the pieces were falling off. I have to hot glue them back on.</li>
            <li> My sisters bought these to wear in their hair for my upcoming wedding in June. Peacock feathers is the inspiration for my wedding. These came pretty quickly. About 10 days. They are bigger than the picture shows but still pretty. The clip on the back looks cheap so they will have to use other clips to hold their hair back &amp; use this clip to just poke it in to decorate their hair. I&#x27;m happy about this purchase. They are very pretty &amp; my sisters will look beautiful wearing them on my big day :)</li>
            <li> would work beautifully for what we are going to use it for.. the colors are very nice and bright. thanks</li>
            <li> I really love them. So unique. Beautifully Detailed. Can wear them with anything!!! THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH. Hope to see more like this from you!</li>
            <li> was bent in the plastic bag.  So it does not open as nicely as the picture shows.  I ended up using it as an ornament instead of boy on a box.</li>
            <li> Everyone LOVES IT! Bought it for my sister. and she gets complimented on it every time she wears it. Very cute</li>
            <li> I bought this for a wedding shower. The bride loved it. Looked beautiful on her.</li>
            <li> These are so cute and you cant beat this price!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t wore it yet but seems to be very sturdy:) The price of the item was very reasonable as well!</li>
            <li> it is beautiful...can&#x27;t wait to wear it to my son&#x27;s wedding</li>
            <li> My daughter is a peacock this year for halloween and I surprised her with this clip she was so excited!!</li>
            <li> Well the ETA here had me worried.  I placed my order 10/04/13 and the ETA was 10/31 - 11/19/13!  Luckily it arrived 10/20/13.  I gave this product 3 stars because of the ETA and the hair piece was very flat.  I was hoping for something with more volume/bulk to it.  The feathers are nice quality but there could have been more.  It is very nice and it will work for my Halloween costume.  I was just disappointed to see how flat it was, no volume.  I will most likely add more feathers to it later, I am into that crafty stuff so it&#x27;ll be easy for me to alter it.  I hope this helps others on their search, I know it would have helped me. :(</li>
            <li> Nice clips. I bought 2 for my shoes... And for another event I used for my hair...next I&#x27;m thinking of clipping them to a black dress...</li>
            <li> Feathers are bent and not evenly spaced out so it looks cheap. The diamond in the center is a shiny piece of cheap plastic. I do not recommend this product to anyone. I wanted to use it on a historical hat but it&#x27;s really disappointing and will need a lot of work. Not worth it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter and she loved it. Very nice and worth of buying it</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for I suppose.  The jewel is a cheap piece of plastic and looks as such.  We ordered these for my BFFs wedding and I ended up popping off this jewel and hot gluing another one on it.  It also took what seemed like forever to ship.  Other than that I had no issues.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it!!! It&#x27;s part of her halloween costume. She wants to be a peacock.</li>
            <li> This lovely item arrived 3 weeks early to my amazement. I love it!</li>
            <li> gorgeous. just what i wanted!</li>
            <li> Just like pic a little slow on getting the item</li>
            <li> Loved it. Even better in person.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my daughter and she loved it.</li>
            <li> It does not look like the picture.  My friend and I ended up ripping it apart, buying some more feathers and making it into a nicer clip. It was wrapped in loose plastic but the wrap still smushed the feathers.  I uploaded a picture of the item as it came to me.  It&#x27;s just a little lackluster.</li>
            <li> Bought these for the girls in my wedding party! Very pretty can&#x27;t wait to see them on the girls! Delivery time was reasonable and feathers were all perfect!</li>
            <li> looks cheap!!! no recomended</li>
            <li> Cut a bit goofy. Not wedding quality.</li>
            <li> Cute! I bought as part of a costume. It&#x27;s very well made and could see myself wearing it again without a Halloween costume.</li>
            <li> Beautiful and very affordable!</li>
            <li> what a beautiful peacock  the colors are beautiful the rhinestones are a good quality not cheap looking and the feathers are soft</li>
            <li> Gorgeous piece received many compliments.</li>
            <li> I am using my husbands account. I don&#x27;t like this hair clip. It is to big and looks cheap</li>
            <li> We bought this for our niece because she is into vintage hats! But it&#x27;s not even &amp;#34;•The width (measure from the longest points) is around 7&amp;#34; length... &amp;#34;; it&#x27;s much smaller than described! Definitely a discrepancy in the description! Really disappointed with this purchase! Never buy from them again!! What a rip off! It&#x27;ll probably cost more to ship it back! Can&#x27;t really say what I wish because AMAZON didn&#x27;t post my first review!&lt;br /&gt;Totally disappointing!</li>
            <li> I bought these for myself and my maid of honor for my wedding. they were perfect in size, look and everything. they brought a fun flair to our hair on my wedding day.</li>
            <li> I got this for my 17 year old daughter.  She loves  to do pin up style hair duo&#x27;s it&#x27;s not to big or to small, very real looking &amp; well made especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this a few times, it is not subtle but adds a lovely touch to an evening chignon</li>
            <li> Arrived a little smooshed, but i like it.</li>
            <li> This hair piece was supposed to be 7 inches. It was only 4. The alligator clip was not even attached to the feathers. I am very disappointed in this item! It was not worth buying!!</li>
            <li> although I was happy with what i recieved it is not as pictured, but all in all a very nice piece, it stayed in place wore it on my wedding day.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love these beautiful hair clips.  So colorful and pretty.  If you like peacock feathers you will love these clips.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and pretty.  The only thing I dislike about it is the hair clip gets tangled in my hair.  It&#x27;s one of those spring loaded pinch clips like the  kind beauticians use to hold back your hair.  It probably works fine for most people but I have very thick and easily tangled hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other thing, if you have cats beware -- one of my cats has it out for this hair clip.  She is incensed that this bird thing dare land on her human&#x27;s head and she is determined to catch it and kill it..</li>
            <li> As with everything that ships from China it was completely flat but at least they didn&#x27;t fold it like they do the earrings.  The clip it means that I can clip it to a large purple flower on my hat and the rhinestone really makes it pop.</li>
            <li> Perfect product! Shipping was faster than expected, and item was exactly as expected!!</li>
            <li> Came late wasn&#x27;t able to wear it for my peacock costume but it&#x27;s really pretty. So I&#x27;ll save it for next time.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for, for a great price!</li>
            <li> I collect peacocks and love everything about them.  Wore this with my peacock shirt and loved it so much!  Get it!</li>
            <li> I got it in a small package, and it was a little smaller than I expected. It was very squished with no protection in the packaging and I later noticed hot glue strands connecting at the base of the clip.</li>
            <li> Great! Delivery took a little while but it was delivered right when it was projected to be delivered- like a couple weeks so I can&#x27;t complain about that! It&#x27;s exactly what was described!</li>
            <li> This is a very pretty hair clip for the price.  The feathers were slightly bent due to the packaging, but it was ok...once you get it out of the packaging, you can smooth out the wrinkles, and they are no longer noticeable.  The only reason that I gave this 3 stars was due to the shipping time.  The package came from China, so it took almost one month to receive the item.  It was well past the Halloween costume time I needed it for, but since it is so pretty, I kept them anyway.  If you need this for a particular event, make sure to order it early</li>
            <li> Very pretty and I love it!</li>
            <li> It took a while for the peacock feather clip to arrive...but it was worth the wait, it was lovely!  I&#x27;m using it on a curtain tie-back!</li>
            <li> It came exactly as it appears in the picture. Of course, the feathers get a little bit of wear from the packaging, but it&#x27;s still beautiful.</li>
            <li> Its pretty, and my daughter loved it but the embelishment is falling off and it hasnt even been worn. Im going to have to hand sew it on somehow.</li>
            <li> Cute, cheap and very stylish.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my bridesmaids, expecting them to maybe be a little different from the picture and from each other (the write-up said that may happen) but they are all beautiful, well-made, and uniform!</li>
            <li> I got this hoping for the blue to stand out like it does in picture but it doesn&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s more black than anything.</li>
            <li> I received these beautiful hair clip and they are sensational in person the colors and the size is perfect to wear thank you</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful hair clip. It came in the mail pretty fast. Its not too heavy so it stays in your hair well.</li>
            <li> Three and a half years later &amp; I still don&#x27;t have it!! They did give me my money back... Gave the 1-star to voice my distaste - this was supposed to be part of my hairpiece for my wedding. Thank god my mom is crafty &amp; came up with something very similar!</li>
            <li> Every time I wear this I get compliments. The price is great. It is sturdy enough that I will be able to use it many times. I would recommend this item to anyone:)</li>
            <li> This flower hair comb is beautiful. The feathers are soft and delicate. It took nearly a month to receive but for the price and quality I feel I made out like a bandit.</li>
            <li> This item shipped from China, so it took a little while to get here... I&#x27;d almost forgotten that I had ordered it.  The quality was fine... Everything seems put together well... HOWEVER, the one bummer was that the colors on it are no where nearly as bright and vibrate as this image.  My feathers were kinda muted and dingy colors in comparison with this image.</li>
            <li> Absolutely adorable. A really sweet hair clip for all ages. And, the price is right. You will love it. Promise.</li>
            <li> I will be using this for my daughters wedding which has a peacock theme.  Took awhile to deliver but I am happy with product</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for all my bridesmaids to wear in our wedding. They all came packaged individual, the product was true to what the picture represents and I did not see any flaws. Cost was very reasonable. I would recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Overall these are cute and very reasonably priced. Unfortunately the peacock feathers were in really bad shape due to the packaging so I will have to do a little crafting to make these look more presentable for my wedding.</li>
            <li> I like it.  It is very pretty but seems so delicate that I am afraid to wear it.</li>
            <li> I was not able to track the location of this clip after purchase.  When I received it, the feathers were bent and do not look like the picture.  I would definitely have to get a perfect one before I would order again...</li>
            <li> Got this for my (peacock themed) wedding, it&#x27;s cute and inexpensive!</li>
            <li> The colors are lovely, but the clip to fasten it to your hair is basically a glorified bobby pin!  But it is lovely to look at,</li>
            <li> they were put together so poorly and are way to big to be warn in my hair!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Ok, shame on me for thinking I&#x27;d get rhinestones at this price. The center piece is this cheesy plastic thing, like off a kid&#x27;s magic wand. The feathers are beautiful though and the clip is a good tight one. I&#x27;m going to remove the center piece and stick something else there. It took about 3 weeks to arrive from China.</li>
            <li> It was just like it is pictured but even prettier!!!!  The color was very nice and the silver d&amp;eacute;cor made it very elegant also.  My daughter is going to wear it in her hair for her wedding.  She loved it.</li>
            <li> Beautiful, thank you!</li>
            <li> much smaller than pictured, I will have to &amp;#34;add&amp;#34; to it to make stand out better</li>
            <li> Very pretty. Colors are bright. The whole clip lays nice and flat against your head. I would buy this again!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really very lovely just as pictured but to my disappointment it came broke and all attempts to fix it was futile. The pin at the back was in pieces, still thinking of what to do with the beautiful flower that has now become useless</li>
            <li> Cute. Bought for my little daughter.</li>
            <li> I got this for my bridesmaids, this clips are so beautiful !</li>
