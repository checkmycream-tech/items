            <li>The Scruples Smooth Out Straightening Gel, is great, I have been using for years, it eliminates the hair blowing for me.</li>
            <li>When this dries, it leaves a kind of pasty gunk in your hair.</li>
            <li>On top of that, it doesn&#x27;t do a good job straightening at all.</li>
            <li>On the plus side, it smells good, and if you are looking for more of a glossing product, this would probably work well for you.</li>

            <li>I love the clean smell that is light, not over-powering.</li>
            <li>In any case, I remember using Scruples years ago and figured for half the price of Fekkai, I&#x27;d give this a try and its great!   </li>
            <li>When I straighten my hair using a blow dryer, I always use Scruples Smooth Out.  </li>
            <li>and this helps smooth out the wavys and curls!&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>You just rub a tab on your hand and smooth it through hair</li>
            <li>hair smooth &amp; no frizz &amp; shines without making your hair greasy</li>
            <li>His curls were so soft looking , and looked so nice that he&#x27;s wearing it longer and curly now, and it looks really cute.  </li>
            <li>Pretty dope and smells OK.</li>
            <li>Gives my hair nice body but also keeps the frizzies and the unruly curls under complete control.  </li>
            <li>I have been a loyal consumer of</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>After blow drying my hair stays straight and smooth all day.  </li>
            <li>Reduces frizzy look and makes me look more professional.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my natural curly hair straight and smooth!</li>
            <li>This does exactly that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Leaves hair smooth and soft, not oily.</li>
            <li>The first time I ordered it was in mid-November</li>
            <li>I received it quickly in about  3 days which is outstanding compared to other things I have ordered from Amazon partners.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few different products, and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing when used on towel dried hair that will be set with hot curlers.  </li>
            <li>Have tried many things in the past, but this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>He has loose curls and most straightening gels work well on his hair.  </li>
            <li>Though it says it is for smoothing out straight hair, I use it to hold my curly hair.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I have wavy hair that I prefer to wear straight but even after blow drying, it gets frizzy and wavy.  </li>
            <li>so I just needed something that smooths out my hair and keeps it straight.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much at all.</li>
            <li>This is a really good product for course, thick hair that tends to frizz.  </li>
            <li>but, when I was washing my hair myself and rolling on hot rollers, I was not getting the soft shiney look, I used everything but could not get it like she does.</li>
            <li>It gets very humid where I live in the summer</li>
            <li>highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It was highly recommended by my hairdresser.</li>
            <li>wow!!</li>
            <li>His hair didn&#x27;t stay straight for 5 minutes after styling it and by the end of the day his hair was curlier than in its natural state.  </li>
            <li>I have coarse gray hair and after application and blow dry my hair is smooth and straight.</li>
            <li>My hair was so soft and shiny!  </li>
            <li>Perfect on my hair which has a lot of body and curls like crazy when it gets wet.</li>
            <li>I can never match her technique, but it really helped improve my daily blowouts.  </li>
            <li>and I have naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I have frizzy hair and it helps to create soft curls and also works when straightening.</li>
            <li>It leaves the hair shiny and soft and no need to use hair spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have long curly hair and use this everyday and love it.</li>
            <li>It is probably the first beauty product I&#x27;ve purchased in a long time that I&#x27;ve actually used until it was completely gone.  </li>
            <li>I have very curly frizzy hair and even use on dry hair.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have incredibly high hopes for this gel since I have tried countless different hair products</li>
            <li>It works fabulous for course, thick hair that is diffucult to manage.  </li>
            <li>My hair is slightly wavy, and with this I can get away with just a blow dry to smooth it out, only needing to flat iron if I&#x27;m going for a harsher look.  </li>
            <li>soft and not oily at all, and NO FRIZZ or Dry brittle feeling to my hair!</li>
            <li>I was looking for a gel product that held my hair smoothly without letting little stray hair poke out and make the style look messy.</li>

            <li> It really helps hold my curly hair without making it too stiff.</li>
            <li> she actually uses a flat iron on my hair to curl it</li>
            <li> Before he was going to get a haircut, I suggested he try it on his  wet hair and let it  dry naturally.  </li>
            <li> Not  heavy or oily, which can weigh down my hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff last forever like an old commercial said a little dab will do ya!  </li>
            <li> I prefer it to any other product I&#x27;ve tried, including several of the \\&quot;curly only\\&quot; products.</li>
            <li> This gel gets it under control when I blow dry.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it is not really a gel product, it is like a glossing product.</li>
            <li> It even cuts down on the time it takes to blow dry</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and has a natural wave to it which is VERY annoying for those who have hair like mine.</li>
            <li> It seems to do the job, but when other reviews said they &amp;#34;loved</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have time to dry and straighten everyday</li>
            <li> It holds the curls in my hair without getting frizzy, but doesn&#x27;t make your hair &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; or weighed down.</li>
            <li> I Have been using this product for years and it never lets me down.</li>
            <li> small amount goes a long way!</li>
            <li> finally, a product that keeps my heavy highlights shiney and manageable!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;You only need a very small amount for it to work (otherwise it can make your hair a little greasy).  </li>
            <li> I put hhis in and blow dried my hair with a round brosh didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> One application lasts for a few days.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to stomach.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for at least 9 years.</li>
            <li> It made my hair feel and look hella thick when using a blow dryer after.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed and I dislike this product very much, it makes my hiar oily, and does not work at all in taming friz, or help with straightening.</li>
            <li> Fekkai Straight Away in spite of its outrageous price.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it appears it has been discontinued.</li>
            <li> I was randomly looking through Amazon for straightening style products and stumbled upon this.  </li>
            <li> (Don&#x27;t get me started on how I hate those uppity companies who keep changing their products.)  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I used this product on my son&#x27;s curly hair and was very disappointed.  </li>

            <li> It leaves my hair manageable.  I like the product and would purchase it again.  Love how my hair feels.  Good buy.</li>
            <li> It made my hair feel and look hella thick when using a blow dryer after. It worked best for me putting it on and just towel drying my hair. Pretty dope and smells OK.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after asking my hairdresser how she gets great, smooth blowouts for me.  I can never match her technique, but it really helped improve my daily blowouts.  Reduces frizzy look and makes me look more professional.  Great product!  FYI - you do not need much to get a great look.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for at least 9 years. Though it says it is for smoothing out straight hair, I use it to hold my curly hair. I prefer it to any other product I&#x27;ve tried, including several of the \\&quot;curly only\\&quot; products. It washes out well, holds well, rinses off my hands well. I have not tried to use it as a straightening gel, so I cannot rate it on that. I love the clean smell that is light, not over-powering. To my knowledge it does not contain ingredients that are anti-curly hair. Wish they&#x27;d change the name of it to just gel or smoothing gel...</li>
            <li> Have used this product for several years. Keeps my natural curly hair straight and smooth!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over ten years and I have naturally curly hair.  When I straighten my hair using a blow dryer, I always use Scruples Smooth Out.  Once it was no longer sold at my hair salon, I began to purchase it online.  In my opinion, it&#x27;s the best!</li>

In any case, I remember using Scruples years ago and figured for half the price of Fekkai, I&#x27;d give this a try and its great!   Gives my hair nice body but also keeps the frizzies and the unruly curls under complete control.  Yeah!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> I received the order in 3-4 days. The receipt had said that delivery would be 7-10 days. Scruples Smoothing Gel si the best product I&#x27;ve used. I have frizzy hair and it helps to create soft curls and also works when straightening. No frizz in humidity.</li>
            <li> The pump broke immediately.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this product!! So glad I found it on Amazon ðŸ˜ƒ</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and has a natural wave to it which is VERY annoying for those who have hair like mine. With this product I can straighten my hair in no time!! I would defiantly recommend!</li>
            <li> I love this product! I have wavy/curly hair and this helps smooth out the wavys and curls!&lt;br /&gt;A small amount goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 20 years. I have curly hair and like how this gel helps me to style my hair. Not  heavy or oily, which can weigh down my hair.</li>
            <li> I used this product on my son&#x27;s curly hair and was very disappointed.  He has loose curls and most straightening gels work well on his hair.  Using this gel was like using nothing at all.  His hair didn&#x27;t stay straight for 5 minutes after styling it and by the end of the day his hair was curlier than in its natural state.  Would definitely NOT recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It holds the curls in my hair without getting frizzy, but doesn&#x27;t make your hair &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; or weighed down. I have long curly hair and use this everyday and love it. Have tried many things in the past, but this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> Perfect on my hair which has a lot of body and curls like crazy when it gets wet. This gel gets it under control when I blow dry.  I received it quickly in about  3 days which is outstanding compared to other things I have ordered from Amazon partners. Excellent product and service!</li>
            <li> love it and it has no residue and makes my hair shiny</li>
            <li> This product is amazing when used on towel dried hair that will be set with hot curlers.  It leaves the hair shiny and soft and no need to use hair spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was told about this product from my hair dresser. I have not stopped using it. Found on Amazon at a really great price. I would recommend to anyone looking for extra shine or straightening for their hair.</li>
            <li> This is a really good product for course, thick hair that tends to frizz.  it leaves my hair shiny and lightweight.  It gets very humid where I live in the summer and this does the trick to keep it manageable and not looking like a giant poof ball.  I took off one star for the smell...smells like men&#x27;s cologne, don&#x27;t like that at all.</li>
            <li> wow!! I love this product!! my beautician uses this on a regular basis with all her clients, and my hair is always shiney and has beautiful bouncy curls when I leave her shop! she actually uses a flat iron on my hair to curl it and it&#x27;s amazing! but, when I was washing my hair myself and rolling on hot rollers, I was not getting the soft shiney look, I used everything but could not get it like she does. so, I asked her what she was using, and she showed me this! I bought some from amazon and bingo!! soft and not oily at all, and NO FRIZZ or Dry brittle feeling to my hair! smooth all the way to the ends of my hair! finally, a product that keeps my heavy highlights shiney and manageable!! I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed and I dislike this product very much, it makes my hiar oily, and does not work at all in taming friz, or help with straightening.</li>
            <li> Does not straighten your hair I put hhis in and blow dried my hair with a round brosh didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> This is a great product that smoothes and adds shine to your hair. It was highly recommended by my hairdresser.</li>
            <li> My stylist recommended this product to me, and I was an immediate convert.  My hair is slightly wavy, and with this I can get away with just a blow dry to smooth it out, only needing to flat iron if I&#x27;m going for a harsher look.  One application lasts for a few days.  It&#x27;s not sticky, and just one pump is plenty.  I&#x27;ve tried a few different products, and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li> Scruples Smooth Out Straightening Gel is one of the best products that I have ever used. I have coarse gray hair and after application and blow dry my hair is smooth and straight. So glad I tried it!</li>
            <li> It seems to do the job, but when other reviews said they &amp;#34;loved how it smells,&amp;#34; I didn&#x27;t realize it was going to smell so floral-y.  It&#x27;s hard to stomach.</li>
            <li> This product holds my hair, which is curly and has a mind of its own, better than any I have tried.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years. It really helps hold my curly hair without making it too stiff. One pump is enough! It lasts me quite a while.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s one of my favorite Scruples  straightening gel!! its light and not greasy! My hair looks great after using this!!</li>
            <li> Works well, but doesn&#x27;t take out all the frizz</li>
            <li> I Have been using this product for years and it never lets me down.</li>
            <li> When this dries, it leaves a kind of pasty gunk in your hair. On top of that, it doesn&#x27;t do a good job straightening at all.</li>
            <li> This was great. It worked perfectly without any issues. I own my personal salon so you can take my word that it is good.</li>
            <li> The Scruples Smooth Out Straightening Gel, is great, I have been using for years, it eliminates the hair blowing for me. You just rub a tab on your hand and smooth it through hair and you have no waves once it air dries... Love this product!!!</li>
            <li> This is one of those straightening gels that smells wonderful!  You finish washing your hair and add a dime size of product to your hair and work through it.  It protects your hair when you straighten it.</li>
            <li> Scruples smooth out straightening gel is the best product on the market!  It works fabulous for course, thick hair that is diffucult to manage.  It has a delightful scent as well!  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have incredibly high hopes for this gel since I have tried countless different hair products but I am thrilled with how this works! I have wavy hair that I prefer to wear straight but even after blow drying, it gets frizzy and wavy.  I don&#x27;t have time to dry and straighten everyday so I just needed something that smooths out my hair and keeps it straight.  This does exactly that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You only need a very small amount for it to work (otherwise it can make your hair a little greasy).  After blow drying my hair stays straight and smooth all day.  Can&#x27;t recommend this enough.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair smooth and soft, not oily. I have used this product years ago and it still performs with great results.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a gel product that held my hair smoothly without letting little stray hair poke out and make the style look messy. I have to wear my hair up every day, and this product seemed to be the one that would do the trick when I was reading what it was supposed to do. Unfortunately, it is not really a gel product, it is like a glossing product. It doesn&#x27;t have any \\&quot;hold\\&quot; factor at all. On the plus side, it smells good, and if you are looking for more of a glossing product, this would probably work well for you. It just didn&#x27;t work for what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I had bought this awhile ago from my salon.  This stuff last forever like an old commercial said a little dab will do ya!  I have very curly frizzy hair and even use on dry hair.  I was very happy to see Amazon carries it since my salon went out of business.</li>
            <li> I was randomly looking through Amazon for straightening style products and stumbled upon this.  The reviews were all so good that I took a chance and ordered it.  I LOVE it.  It is probably the first beauty product I&#x27;ve purchased in a long time that I&#x27;ve actually used until it was completely gone.  The first time I ordered it was in mid-November and it lasted me until April.  You don&#x27;t need much at all.</li>
            <li> Great product &amp; smells so good&lt;br /&gt;Makes hair smooth &amp; no frizz &amp; shines without making your hair greasy</li>
            <li> My hairdresser used this on my hair before drying my moderately curly shoulder length hair.  My hair was so soft and shiny!  I bought some at Amazon for a great price and tried it.  I&#x27;ve  tried many straightening/smoothing/frizz control products, but this is the best!  It even cuts down on the time it takes to blow dry my hair.&lt;br /&gt;My son also has curly hair and wore it really short.  Before he was going to get a haircut, I suggested he try it on his  wet hair and let it  dry naturally.  His curls were so soft looking , and looked so nice that he&#x27;s wearing it longer and curly now, and it looks really cute.  Would definitely recommend!!</li>
