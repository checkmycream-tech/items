            <li>Taylor has a great reputation and judging from this soap</li>
            <li>but it smells great.</li>
            <li>A bit pricey, but the scent is great, it lathers up well</li>
            <li>Bought it as a gift and have heard great things in response to it.  </li>

            <li>Smells great and lathers up well.</li>
            <li>Great lather.</li>
            <li>I thought it smelled great</li>
            <li>In addition the soap is great and the sandalwood scent is very nice but not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Looks very nice.</li>
            <li>This shaving soap makes a very nice lather with a smell of sandlewood.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a very nice, close shave.   </li>
            <li>Very nice shave soap.</li>
            <li>The smell is very nice</li>
            <li>performance is good, and does the job for me, but this soap does not lather up like the Pororaso did, still, I get a great shave,  and I like the scent, so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li>Works great, smells great, and the bowl looks good.  </li>
            <li>is amazing!</li>
            <li>Make sure you have a quality brush and this stuff lathers wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>The bowl is great, just wish the smell was as good.</li>
            <li>works good smells great</li>
            <li>Has a pleasant smell and soothes the skin while shaving.</li>
            <li>Excellent quality soap, lasts forever and mild scent is great..</li>
            <li>The soap fits perfectly in it and does not move around, a huge plus when lathering vigorously.  </li>
            <li>Smells amazing and produces a great lather.</li>
            <li>but it isn&#x27;t as good as their cream in my opinion.</li>
            <li>and he loved it.</li>
            <li>Because it smells so good</li>
            <li>Good soap that lathers well.  </li>
            <li>The thing with the soap is-in order to get a good lather going, you need the brush to be a lot wetter than with cream, and it&#x27;s just messier.  </li>
            <li>The face lubrication is also not as good as with the cream.</li>
            <li>it works great and smells nice but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>I would use a good pre-shave oil with it, however just to get that cream like slickness.</li>
            <li>As a man that appreciates a good shave</li>
            <li>Good lather and works well.</li>
            <li>It does smell really good though.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always on the search of a good shaving soap.  </li>
            <li>Results in close shave every time and leaves a very refreshing feeling afterwards.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this product and recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>I am VERY pleased with both.  </li>
            <li>This soap lathers up nicely and smells good.  </li>
            <li>Good scent, nice bowl.</li>
            <li>I love how he smells after shaving!</li>
            <li>If you love class shave scents, give it a try!</li>
            <li>I am in love with the sandalwood shaving cream!  </li>
            <li>and I love the scent!</li>
            <li>This is my first ToBS product and I have to say I&#x27;m impressed.  </li>
            <li>likes the smell, and I love it!</li>
            <li>very good with a mild purfume</li>
            <li>It lathers up well, goes on smoothly and smells great.  </li>
            <li>Amazing scent, amazing container, amazing lather!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is nice soap.</li>
            <li>and you will know what i am talking about the smell verey nice and  your razor</li>
            <li>My wife commented on how nice this bowl looks on the countertop.  </li>
            <li>I believe this is not a beginner soap on the amount of prep required to get a nice lather..</li>
            <li>The bowl is nice, though I think I will soon be transferring my soap out so</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always liked shaving after a shower.  </li>
            <li>B005OSQGN8 Deluxe LED Fogless Shower Mirror with Squeegee by ToiletTree Products.</li>
            <li>Shave cream is not so good for shower shaving because it&#x27;s more finicky about water mixture, and excess moisture in the shower always throws things off.  </li>
            <li>Great smell and an awesome lather inside a nice wooden bowl!  </li>
            <li>This shave soap is really nice.  </li>
            <li>Great soap, love the lather, smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant, light and not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Great mild scent.  </li>
            <li>Lathers up very easily...</li>
            <li>This has a very strong scent.  </li>
            <li>has a very strong scent of saddle wood.  </li>
            <li>Taylor of Old Bond Street makes a wonderful Sandalwood soap.  </li>
            <li>But it does a great job of softening my beard when I wash my face with it, it gives me a good lather and gives a good glide to my razor,, especially when I mix in my shave oil.</li>
            <li>This is the best shaving soap I&#x27;ve tried so far.  </li>
            <li>Makes for a smooth shave and it smells good too; not flowery</li>
            <li>Lathers really easily!</li>
            <li>I purchased the Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood shaving soap after reading many excellent reviews.</li>
            <li>This is a great product at a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>Still however, the product is long-lasting (I&#x27;d say close to 20 shaves in and barely a dent within the puck) and provides an excellent shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Loads easily and generates a nice lather and scent.</li>
            <li>The soap also rinses easily, leaving a nice but not over-powering scent on your face.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell and makes for a very comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>wow this stuff is great, good smell easy lather</li>
            <li>It is way better than VDH</li>
            <li>Using a better brush makes all the difference.  </li>
            <li>Some people have issues with the smell not being on par with the cream, but to me I think the soap smells better.</li>
            <li>Glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li>The smell is more powdery with their soap.</li>
            <li>Cream has a more robust smell to it.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite soaps.</li>
            <li>Again something gifted to my husband</li>
            <li>The lid of the bowl barly sits on  top of the bowl(not snugly).</li>
            <li>TOBS could probably charge much more for this</li>
            <li>Enjoy your shave!</li>
            <li>The soap leaves a nice fragrance on your face that you will enjoy smelling the rest of the day.</li>
            <li>Over all it is just ok,</li>
            <li>I have compensated by letting the soap soak while I shower then work the top of the soap with my fingers.</li>
            <li>So much better than store bought mass produced foams and gell.  </li>
            <li>FANTASTIC shaving soap!</li>
            <li>Started with TOBS sandalwood cream and wanted to go to the more authentic soap and bowl instead of the premixed cream</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I am pleased with this purchase and will purchase the soap again</li>
            <li>, however lovely stuff.  </li>
            <li>just ok ,i like everlyn more</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve learned a lot along the way and changed a lot of the products I use numerous times, trying to find the stuff that work best.  </li>
            <li>I gather that many people on this page have tried it at one point and written at length about its virtues.  </li>
            <li>I like to shave in the shower occasionally (with the excellent  [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>experienced!t&#x27;s more finicky about water mixture, and excess moisture in the shower always throws things off.  </li>
            <li>The soap bar fills the bowl to the top, so there&#x27;s no room at all for foam.</li>
            <li>Just wish the scent was a bit stronger and more of a woodsy smell.</li>
            <li>ok</li>
            <li>OK.  </li>
            <li>The Sandalwood Scented products are the best and my personal favorite.</li>
            <li>is that I also bought the shaving cream in sandalwood and that is so much better to shave with</li>
            <li>It has a great scent and lathers really well.  </li>
            <li>All perform better than this soap IMHO.  </li>
            <li>satisfying heft.)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many from the Art of Shaving, which I like.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>and they know what their doing, great value, highly recommend..</li>
            <li>It produces a wonderful lather with not too strong of a sandalwood smell following you though the day.</li>
            <li>Lathers very nice, goes on smooth, and has a very nice, woodsy after-scent that lingers long after shaving.</li>
            <li>My complaints with this product are minor at best but include the bowl and lid</li>
            <li>The lather is very rich and it is easy to load even with a badger brush.</li>
            <li>Smells great, produces rich, foamy lather that makes shaving much easier.</li>
            <li>The difference between the two is night and day, with the CC product feeling more like soap and the Taylor feeling like a creamy smooth treat.  </li>
            <li>First foray with Taylor of Old Bond Street and I am impressed!</li>
            <li>I can really get a good bowlful of lather in my scuttle.</li>
            <li>The scent is fantastic and very clean.</li>
            <li>do not mate well and there are some areas where the gap is easily visible.  </li>
            <li>My only reason for not giving it a 5-star rating is that I have not been able to produce a great lather.</li>
            <li>It lathers easily.  </li>
            <li>It lathers easily.  </li>
            <li>Your cologne would easily cover it.</li>
            <li>The scent is not as strong as I would like it.</li>
            <li>Too strong for me.  </li>
            <li>The Taylor bowl is just beautiful after six months of daily use.  </li>
            <li>Great product, its very aromatic so make sure you really like the sandalwood</li>
            <li>With this, you have to work up the lather (isn&#x27;t that why you buy a nice brush in the first place?)but</li>
            <li>Beautifully packaged in its wooden bowl</li>
            <li>(You fleshy faced guys out there don&#x27;t know how easy you have it to be shaving over a smooth and forgiving surface!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The lather is easy to generate in the bowl and the texture on the face seems far superior to any creams I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many different shave soaps in the past, but this one give the best lather that I&#x27;ve ever experienced.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Art of Shaving products exclusively for some time, but wanted to see what else is available for the finely groomed man.  </li>
            <li>It has a rich sandalwod scent that is pronounced but not too strong.</li>
            <li>Good lather, smooth shave, leaves skin soft and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Again, a great product, especially for the money.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy it.</li>
            <li>Taylor products are fantastic and sold at reasonible prices.</li>
            <li>It works well, smells great, and excels especially at keeping the skin from drying out.  </li>
            <li>But shave soap is great in the shower, so I thought I would try TOBS shave soap of the same scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But shave soap is great in the shower, so I thought I would try TOBS shave soap of the same scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>F Trumper was nice but just too much money.</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t imagine finding another Sandalwood soap that I enjoy using anymore than this one.</li>
            <li>then you will enjoy the sandalwood fragrance.</li>
            <li>had it been available on amazon.</li>
            <li>I read a lot of reviews saying people liked this as much as AoS</li>
            <li>Saw the good reviews for Taylor of Old Bond and thought I would try it.</li>
            <li>The aroma of the soap is no where near as good as the cream.  </li>
            <li>The bowl is a very nice wooden bowl with a matching lid.  </li>
            <li>And I admit it, I like wooden pieces, and the bowl is a very nice container for the soap.</li>
            <li>Very nice wooden bowl.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would have to say if you are a TOBS fan it is a great product the scent is mild and the lather has left my face moisturized and smooth after using this product</li>
            <li>Many fine shaving outlets can supply this product; I will certainly be using another distribution channel when it&#x27;s time for a refill.</li>
            <li>The bowl looks very nice - recommend getting a \\&quot;matching\\&quot; dark wood brush holder for your counter top.    </li>
            <li>I was not totally disappointed with their soap</li>
            <li>Ordered this shaving soap after reading the reviews and I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to use this soap.</li>
            <li>Prorasso, which is impressive because shave cream usually has the advantage in that respect.  </li>
            <li>The lather is so rich and conditioning</li>
            <li>The wooden bowl is elegant, and a nice touch to the \\&quot;experience\\&quot; of DE shaving.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think there is anything really special about this soap.</li>
            <li>Lathers up good and has lasted several months and is still going.</li>
            <li>The wood bowl adds and nice old world touch.  </li>
            <li>The actual product sold on this page comes in a wooden bowl, with the soap fitted perfectly inside (replacements available, of course).  </li>

            <li>You really need to check them all out and find your favorite to.</li>
            <li>Nice classy wood bowl too ..</li>
            <li>It lathers well with a badger brush, provides excellent lubricity while shaving, smells terrific and does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>The one positive for this product is that the bowl is an attractive wooden bowl.</li>
            <li>/&gt;SMELL- Is pleasant (not old person smelling)</li>
            <li>The Taylor of Old Bond Street is a superb product deserving of its lineage which dates back to England in the mid 1800s.</li>
            <li>other than that I am happy with the soap.</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick and trouble-free.</li>
            <li>If you are lucky you can find it for about $15.</li>
            <li>And daily its a mission to work up a perfect lather, I think I recently have found the trick.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Scent was mild in comparison to cream</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly and elk order from this stiller again.</li>
            <li>and I cannot recommend it more highly.  </li>
            <li>and I cannot recommend it more highly.  </li>
            <li>The wooden bowl is beautiful and very classy.</li>
            <li>fit snugly after first use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Wooden</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is from real lavender, the soap foams up nicely and allows your straight or safety razor to glide right over your face.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s truly fantastic stuff, better than the TOBS cream and way better than other competitors.  </li>
            <li>New to DE shaving but absolutely love this soap.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of this stuff however it simply doesn&#x27;t lather as good as my regular soap(Tabac Original).  </li>
            <li>Provides adequate glide cushion, not the best I&#x27;ve ever had, but I&#x27;ve definately had worse.  </li>
            <li>Impressive product works better than any other Soap I had previously used.</li>
            <li>I plan to continue to order this for him since he does enjoy it so much</li>
            <li>Having tried many shaving options for my sensitive skin I eventually came across soap.</li>
            <li>Nice wooden bowl.</li>
            <li>I love sandalwood, and this Taylor of old bond is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>I was not crazy about the smell.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the buy</li>
            <li>The shaving soap comes in a nice wooden bowl and I must say that I do like the sandalwood scent.</li>
            <li>was my favorite of these early finds.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much easier to use this product straight out of the bowl than to lather up cream in a mug (which also takes up more space on the counter).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much easier to use this product straight out of the bowl than to lather up cream in a mug (which also takes up more space on the counter).  </li>
            <li>The sandalwood scent is outstanding, and about as masculine as it gets.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Let me start out by saying I love to use Taylor of Old Bond Street for shaving.  </li>
            <li>I saw this Taylor of Old Bond Street sandalwood product with the wooden bowl and thought it would be an attractive addition to my bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was able to get a few good shaves with it, but overall there are a lot of soaps I like much better..</li>
            <li>This is my 4th Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving product and it is very pleasant with spicier notes than the typical Taylor&#x27;s sandalwood product.  </li>
            <li>The soap lathers nicely, doesn&#x27;t take much to load the brush, and it feels nice and slick.</li>
            <li>Add water as you go until it reaches the right consistency.</li>
            <li>This can be a chore to get it whipped up right and has a feel of pulling against my skin as I shave.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m not doing it right</li>
            <li>He is very pleased with the quality and performance of the soap, noting that it gives him a much closer, cleaner shave than standard shaving cream.</li>
            <li>The little wooden bowl is attractive it looks great on my sink next to my straight razor.</li>
            <li>My wife loves the scent as do I. Creates a nice thick lather, love it.</li>
            <li>It appears to be a luxury product at a very reasonable price point.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very very luxurious.  </li>
            <li>Not having used it myself, but the packaging is just as nice (wood bowl) and the fragrance smells as nice as well, subtle, high quality.  </li>
            <li>First I tried several different kinds of Proraso shave soap (pretty good stuff: the green tub is better than the red sandalwood), one kind of Proraso shave cream (not as good as their soap), and finally the TOBS shave *</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the bowl will be fine after the soap wears down, but the bowl should be made taller to work like it should.  </li>
            <li>, the Taylor was the larger size soap and so was a much better value to start.  </li>
            <li>On the first use of the Taylor, I noticed that its scent reminded me of my father.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time using a soap instead of a cream.  </li>
            <li>Adding a bit more water I have managed to get this soap to lather properly.</li>
            <li>Thanks for reading!</li>
            <li>I will try the lavender next but wish there was more selection.</li>
            <li>30 seconds loading on a badger brush provides more than enough lather for a three or four pass DE shave.  </li>
            <li>First I HAVE to use pre-shave oil with this soap.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have HAD to use pre shave oil.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Remember-you only pay for the bowl the first time-after that, be sure you just order the soap refill.</li>
            <li>I have watched videos and read reviews of how well this brand of shaving soap lathers so the fault is most likely with me.</li>
            <li>Perhaps more practice on my part is necessary.</li>
            <li>I just finished my first shave and the product performed well.</li>
            <li>A daily shave is now quite enjoyable.</li>
            <li>The Van der Hagen that I get locally for a couple of dollars does a better job.  </li>
            <li>We will buy again and absolutely recommend to others!</li>
            <li>In next year sometime by this rate :)</li>
            <li>And since your soap splashes onto the edges of the bowl, if you don&#x27;t wipe it off the lid will stick to the top of the bowl when you want to shave the next day.  </li>
            <li>this is my first experience with shaving soap in this form, I can&#x27;t compare it to others.</li>
            <li>The bowl, while quite attractive, is very small.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and this soap lathers very well even with the cheap Burmashave Nylon brush I use.</li>
            <li>just a clean masculine smell.</li>
            <li>The soap washes cleanly with no residue but with the masculine scent of sandalwood - which is not too over powering.  </li>
            <li>The lathe turned wooden bowl and lid look classic sitting next to my just-bought badger shaving brush (used boar bristle for many, many years).</li>
            <li>After the first pass I noticed that the razor wasn&#x27;t sliding so much as gliding which gave a closure</li>
            <li>The lack of our events star is simply due to the scent not being very strong.</li>
            <li>The soap is flat on top and comes nearly to the top rim of the wooden bowl.  </li>
            <li>The soap is flat on top and comes nearly to the top rim of the wooden bowl.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;the scent is pure manliness.</li>
            <li>left.&lt;br /&gt;The bowl is pretty decent and has not broke or really fade yet.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>soap is SUPER smooth on the face -- much smoother than any other option I&#x27;ve tried, including TOBS&#x27;s cream.  </li>
            <li>soap is SUPER smooth on the face -- much smoother than any other option I&#x27;ve tried, including TOBS&#x27;s cream.  </li>
            <li>The size of the shaving soap is more than what I expected.    </li>
            <li>This product works very well with straight razors.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It is much easier to use the soap with a brush than to use a can of shaving foam.  </li>
            <li>Much \\&quot;cleaner\\&quot; looking on the sink, I think.&lt;br</li>
            <li>An absolute pleasure to shave with.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Very disatisfied because this was a gift.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not ready to remind people of my grandfather at 35 years of age :)  </li>
            <li>I used a whole tub and never thought I&#x27;d switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>TOBS produces so much lather</li>
            <li>Very manly.  </li>
            <li>The soap itself performs very well.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t want that much effort</li>
            <li>The photo of this product is very misleading and makes it look like you will get a bowl that is brimming over with soap.  </li>
            <li>The photo of this product is very misleading and makes it look like you will get a bowl that is brimming over with soap.  </li>
            <li>It lathers up fast ..</li>
            <li>and he really loves it.  </li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant and subtle.  </li>
            <li>Great product itself but false advertising</li>
            <li>That was also quite nice - heavy, metal handle.  </li>
            <li>Taylor of Old Bond Street has the most high quality line of men&#x27;s shaving and personal care products out here!</li>
            <li>This product by far has a great yet subtle sent of Sandalwood.</li>
            <li>Having used it for six months, I still have over 75% of the original soap left.  </li>
            <li>20% Larger Than Our #1 Selling Original Mirror.]]).  </li>
            <li>But my real complaint with this soap is it is not the same great sandalwood scent that I loved with the other shaving cream version.  </li>
            <li>It take very little product to get a nice lather.  </li>
            <li>It provides a slick /lubricated lather for the blade to slide across nicely without chomping up your face.  </li>
            <li>Makes shaving enjoyable and less of a chore.</li>
            <li>It is truly a classic scent and one</li>
            <li>THe smell is steady, not overpowering.</li>
            <li>I decided on this one in particular because I travel a lot</li>
            <li>The sandalwood scent was the main reason i bought this product, and without it it&#x27;s just an overpriced bar of soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m extremely satisfied and plan to use the entire puck.</li>
            <li>you are partial to strong earthy, musky scented products</li>
            <li>My expectations were high given the name attached to it.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend using a high quality badger brush.  </li>
            <li>I would still rate it relatively high.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>I have a pretty thick beard (can grow it full in about 3 weeks), and the hairs grow in all different directions, not in any uniform way like most guys with thicker beards.  </li>
            <li>It has a little stronger scent than most Sandalwood soaps I have used from Crabtree and Evelyn and The Art of Shaving</li>
            <li>Soap is the real old school, but I dig the cream jars.  </li>
            <li>but my blades were fresh and the  same blades I always use.  </li>
            <li>my first jar of Taylor, was actually a cream, meaning you go through it fast.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for those shaving with a safety razor though DO NOT ORDER this item FROM MiN New York.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other shaving soaps before, but nothing holds a candle to this fine product.  </li>
            <li>Other than that this is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>The only problem is when making a nice lather the soap spills on the sides, I wish the bowl was a little deeper, or the puck was shorter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sort of new to D/E shaving.</li>
            <li>But in lieu of all my whining I would encourage anyone seeking a new soap to give it a try as others here  seem to have no complaints and</li>
            <li>I am new to shaving soap, as opposed to cream.</li>
            <li>The aroma is classic but not the \\&quot;old man</li>
            <li>Good, soap, foams really well with the badger brush.&lt;br /&gt;However, the bowl container it comes in is merely asthetics.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Now that the investment of the wood bowl is done, the replacement Taylor soaps will be a very modest outlay.</li>
            <li>Compare this with any canned shave product and the $20 entry cost seems small, more so when you consider a refill soap is ~$10.  </li>
            <li>The soap needs a bit more water than usual to apply, if not then it can &amp;#34;dry out on your skin&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>In fact, the scent is so different that I returned the first bowl I received thinking it had to be packaged incorrectly.  </li>
            <li>But my replacement has exactly the same scent.  </li>
            <li>After two attempts to contact MiN they replied saying that the item was back-ordered (though it wasn&#x27;t listed that way when I placed my order) and they were waiting for their new shipment to clear customs.  </li>
            <li>I can not say enough that for anyone who has not used the \\&quot;old-fashioned\\&quot; traditional shaving they will like it hands down, and saving soaps like this are just more a perk!</li>
            <li>This was the first shaving soap I&#x27;ve ever used, but I&#x27;m  never going back to my old ways.</li>
            <li>This small bit of spillover residue actually has the effect of making a nice smell on my towel and the edges of the bowl to fill the bathroom for the rest of the day.  </li>
            <li>This small bit of spillover residue actually has the effect of making a nice smell on my towel and the edges of the bowl to fill the bathroom for the rest of the day.  </li>
            <li>is the best shaving soap I have used and is less expensive than any of the Art of Shaving products.</li>
            <li>Honestly I expected this to be better, it leaves my skin feeling dry.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m certain this will last me through the end of the year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks Taylor of Old Bond Street  Later</li>
            <li>The Sandalwood is very woody and fragrant and the wooden bowl is both a classy and functional touch.</li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B00158S4RM Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Soap</li>
            <li>it will passe softly i will order it again and again</li>
            <li>The lotion in the soap leaves skin soft after the shave.</li>
            <li>Really brings back class to shaving!</li>
            <li>I started going the old school brush, soap,safety razor shaving routine about 15 months ago.</li>
            <li>I was once a devoted disciple of Prorasso, then I discovered Taylor of Old Bond Street.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got a fairly sensitive nose</li>
            <li>Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream Bowl, 5.3-Ounce]].  </li>
            <li>Also, I have played around with this soap quite a bit it does dry fast!</li>
            <li>Sure, you are getting a wooden bowl out of the deal, but it&#x27;s a bowl that is really too shallow to work well as a shaving bowl.  </li>
            <li>First I am not new to soaps or shaving LIKE</li>
            <li>My wife does not particularly care for it either and after first use asked if I were wearing old spice.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it is not a bad scent at all, but it is not the same fragrant sandalwood scent I loved in their other product.  </li>
            <li>TOBS mixed fairly easy and created a rich lather which at first made me nervous since it went on thick instead of slick with the cream.  </li>
            <li>I only gave this particular product a 4 out of 5</li>
            <li>Overall, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m confident that it will last way longer, as it only takes a little soap to make a lot of lather.  </li>
            <li>It lathers reasonably well but not anywhere near as well as the same brand in the shaving cream bowl mentioned above.  </li>
            <li>But other problems are the soap fills the   bowl nearly to the top which creates a mess when lathering your brush.</li>
            <li>There is some inherent mess involved with lathering directly from the bowl because the soap literally comes right to the edge.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also very lean and have paper-thin skin, especially on my neck, meaning it&#x27;s a real bear to shave over my bumpy adam&#x27;s apple, sharp jaw line, and bony chin without getting a nick.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to soap shaving, so I&#x27;m still getting used to the routine, learning how to lather and apply properly.    </li>
            <li>This is my second soap I have ever bought, I am 24 and new to DE shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Used</li>
            <li>All comes in a very classy wooden shaving bowl.</li>
            <li>The product was marked sandlewood soap on the outside.</li>
            <li>One tip;  load the damp (not wet) brush in the bowl then build your lather in a separate bowl, not on the soap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be surprised if it doesn&#x27;t last six months.  </li>
            <li>In short, no man&#x27;s bathroom is complete without this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Also, I noticed that clean up with the bowl was easier than cleaning the mug and tube (the soap would dry and then cake on the threads of the tube and make a mess).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit more expensive, but I highly recommend treating yourself to the wooden bowl.  </li>
            <li>I buy Art of Shaving for my husband, but that is far more expensive and this was for an in-law for whom I wasn&#x27;t going to make that stretch.  </li>
            <li>Taylor Sandalwood Shaving Soap has a very fragrant sandalwood aroma, makes a superior lather and protective soap layer when compared to other less expensive shave soaps.  </li>
            <li>Soap gives a nice thick &amp; slick lather.</li>
            <li>I was a little apprehensive about the scent of this soap from having read previous reviews, but my wife and I are both huge fans of it.since</li>
            <li>It does not particularly smell like old spice but does have the quality of grooming and hygiene products for men that believe a man should smell like a lumberjack.</li>
            <li>I consider myself very tolerant of smells, and would have used it, even if the smell was not very appealing.</li>

            <li> The soap fits perfectly in it and does not move around, a huge plus when lathering vigorously.  </li>
            <li> Smells amazing and produces a great lather.</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t as good as their cream in my opinion.</li>
            <li> and he loved it.</li>
            <li> Because it smells so good</li>
            <li> Good soap that lathers well.  </li>
            <li> The thing with the soap is-in order to get a good lather going, you need the brush to be a lot wetter than with cream, and it&#x27;s just messier.  </li>
            <li> The face lubrication is also not as good as with the cream.</li>
            <li> it works great and smells nice but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I would use a good pre-shave oil with it, however just to get that cream like slickness.</li>
            <li> As a man that appreciates a good shave</li>
            <li> Good lather and works well.</li>
            <li> It does smell really good though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always on the search of a good shaving soap.  </li>
            <li> Results in close shave every time and leaves a very refreshing feeling afterwards.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product and recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I am VERY pleased with both.  </li>
            <li> This soap lathers up nicely and smells good.  </li>
            <li> Good scent, nice bowl.</li>
            <li> I love how he smells after shaving!</li>
            <li> If you love class shave scents, give it a try!</li>
            <li> I am in love with the sandalwood shaving cream!  </li>
            <li> and I love the scent!</li>
            <li> This is my first ToBS product and I have to say I&#x27;m impressed.  </li>
            <li> likes the smell, and I love it!</li>
            <li> very good with a mild purfume</li>
            <li> It lathers up well, goes on smoothly and smells great.  </li>
            <li> Amazing scent, amazing container, amazing lather!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is nice soap.</li>
            <li> and you will know what i am talking about the smell verey nice and  your razor</li>
            <li> My wife commented on how nice this bowl looks on the countertop.  </li>
            <li> I believe this is not a beginner soap on the amount of prep required to get a nice lather..</li>
            <li> The bowl is nice, though I think I will soon be transferring my soap out so</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked shaving after a shower.  </li>
            <li> B005OSQGN8 Deluxe LED Fogless Shower Mirror with Squeegee by ToiletTree Products.</li>
            <li> Shave cream is not so good for shower shaving because it&#x27;s more finicky about water mixture, and excess moisture in the shower always throws things off.  </li>
            <li> Great smell and an awesome lather inside a nice wooden bowl!  </li>
            <li> This shave soap is really nice.  </li>
            <li> Great soap, love the lather, smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> The scent is pleasant, light and not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> Great mild scent.  </li>
            <li> Lathers up very easily...</li>
            <li> This has a very strong scent.  </li>
            <li> has a very strong scent of saddle wood.  </li>
            <li> Taylor of Old Bond Street makes a wonderful Sandalwood soap.  </li>
            <li> But it does a great job of softening my beard when I wash my face with it, it gives me a good lather and gives a good glide to my razor,, especially when I mix in my shave oil.</li>
            <li> This is the best shaving soap I&#x27;ve tried so far.  </li>
            <li> Makes for a smooth shave and it smells good too; not flowery</li>
            <li> Lathers really easily!</li>
            <li> I purchased the Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood shaving soap after reading many excellent reviews.</li>
            <li> This is a great product at a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> Still however, the product is long-lasting (I&#x27;d say close to 20 shaves in and barely a dent within the puck) and provides an excellent shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Loads easily and generates a nice lather and scent.</li>
            <li> The soap also rinses easily, leaving a nice but not over-powering scent on your face.  </li>
            <li> Love the smell and makes for a very comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> wow this stuff is great, good smell easy lather</li>
            <li> It is way better than VDH</li>
            <li> Using a better brush makes all the difference.  </li>
            <li> Some people have issues with the smell not being on par with the cream, but to me I think the soap smells better.</li>
            <li> Glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> The smell is more powdery with their soap.</li>
            <li> Cream has a more robust smell to it.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite soaps.</li>
            <li> Again something gifted to my husband</li>
            <li> The lid of the bowl barly sits on  top of the bowl(not snugly).</li>
            <li> TOBS could probably charge much more for this</li>
            <li> Enjoy your shave!</li>
            <li> The soap leaves a nice fragrance on your face that you will enjoy smelling the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> Over all it is just ok,</li>
            <li> I have compensated by letting the soap soak while I shower then work the top of the soap with my fingers.</li>
            <li> So much better than store bought mass produced foams and gell.  </li>
            <li> FANTASTIC shaving soap!</li>
            <li> Started with TOBS sandalwood cream and wanted to go to the more authentic soap and bowl instead of the premixed cream</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I am pleased with this purchase and will purchase the soap again</li>
            <li> , however lovely stuff.  </li>
            <li> just ok ,i like everlyn more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned a lot along the way and changed a lot of the products I use numerous times, trying to find the stuff that work best.  </li>
            <li> I gather that many people on this page have tried it at one point and written at length about its virtues.  </li>
            <li> I like to shave in the shower occasionally (with the excellent  [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> experienced!t&#x27;s more finicky about water mixture, and excess moisture in the shower always throws things off.  </li>
            <li> The soap bar fills the bowl to the top, so there&#x27;s no room at all for foam.</li>
            <li> Just wish the scent was a bit stronger and more of a woodsy smell.</li>
            <li> ok</li>
            <li> OK.  </li>
            <li> The Sandalwood Scented products are the best and my personal favorite.</li>
            <li> is that I also bought the shaving cream in sandalwood and that is so much better to shave with</li>
            <li> It has a great scent and lathers really well.  </li>
            <li> All perform better than this soap IMHO.  </li>
            <li> satisfying heft.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many from the Art of Shaving, which I like.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> and they know what their doing, great value, highly recommend..</li>
            <li> It produces a wonderful lather with not too strong of a sandalwood smell following you though the day.</li>
            <li> Lathers very nice, goes on smooth, and has a very nice, woodsy after-scent that lingers long after shaving.</li>
            <li> My complaints with this product are minor at best but include the bowl and lid</li>
            <li> The lather is very rich and it is easy to load even with a badger brush.</li>
            <li> Smells great, produces rich, foamy lather that makes shaving much easier.</li>
            <li> The difference between the two is night and day, with the CC product feeling more like soap and the Taylor feeling like a creamy smooth treat.  </li>
            <li> First foray with Taylor of Old Bond Street and I am impressed!</li>
            <li> I can really get a good bowlful of lather in my scuttle.</li>
            <li> The scent is fantastic and very clean.</li>
            <li> do not mate well and there are some areas where the gap is easily visible.  </li>
            <li> My only reason for not giving it a 5-star rating is that I have not been able to produce a great lather.</li>
            <li> It lathers easily.  </li>
            <li> It lathers easily.  </li>
            <li> Your cologne would easily cover it.</li>
            <li> The scent is not as strong as I would like it.</li>
            <li> Too strong for me.  </li>
            <li> The Taylor bowl is just beautiful after six months of daily use.  </li>
            <li> Great product, its very aromatic so make sure you really like the sandalwood</li>
            <li> With this, you have to work up the lather (isn&#x27;t that why you buy a nice brush in the first place?)but</li>
            <li> Beautifully packaged in its wooden bowl</li>
            <li> (You fleshy faced guys out there don&#x27;t know how easy you have it to be shaving over a smooth and forgiving surface!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The lather is easy to generate in the bowl and the texture on the face seems far superior to any creams I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different shave soaps in the past, but this one give the best lather that I&#x27;ve ever experienced.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Art of Shaving products exclusively for some time, but wanted to see what else is available for the finely groomed man.  </li>
            <li> It has a rich sandalwod scent that is pronounced but not too strong.</li>
            <li> Good lather, smooth shave, leaves skin soft and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Again, a great product, especially for the money.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Taylor products are fantastic and sold at reasonible prices.</li>
            <li> It works well, smells great, and excels especially at keeping the skin from drying out.  </li>
            <li> But shave soap is great in the shower, so I thought I would try TOBS shave soap of the same scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But shave soap is great in the shower, so I thought I would try TOBS shave soap of the same scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> F Trumper was nice but just too much money.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t imagine finding another Sandalwood soap that I enjoy using anymore than this one.</li>
            <li> then you will enjoy the sandalwood fragrance.</li>
            <li> had it been available on amazon.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews saying people liked this as much as AoS</li>
            <li> Saw the good reviews for Taylor of Old Bond and thought I would try it.</li>
            <li> The aroma of the soap is no where near as good as the cream.  </li>
            <li> The bowl is a very nice wooden bowl with a matching lid.  </li>
            <li> And I admit it, I like wooden pieces, and the bowl is a very nice container for the soap.</li>
            <li> Very nice wooden bowl.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would have to say if you are a TOBS fan it is a great product the scent is mild and the lather has left my face moisturized and smooth after using this product</li>
            <li> Many fine shaving outlets can supply this product; I will certainly be using another distribution channel when it&#x27;s time for a refill.</li>
            <li> The bowl looks very nice - recommend getting a \\&quot;matching\\&quot; dark wood brush holder for your counter top.    </li>
            <li> I was not totally disappointed with their soap</li>
            <li> Ordered this shaving soap after reading the reviews and I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to use this soap.</li>
            <li> Prorasso, which is impressive because shave cream usually has the advantage in that respect.  </li>
            <li> The lather is so rich and conditioning</li>
            <li> The wooden bowl is elegant, and a nice touch to the \\&quot;experience\\&quot; of DE shaving.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think there is anything really special about this soap.</li>
            <li> Lathers up good and has lasted several months and is still going.</li>
            <li> The wood bowl adds and nice old world touch.  </li>
            <li> The actual product sold on this page comes in a wooden bowl, with the soap fitted perfectly inside (replacements available, of course).  </li>

            <li> You really need to check them all out and find your favorite to.</li>
            <li> Nice classy wood bowl too ..</li>
            <li> It lathers well with a badger brush, provides excellent lubricity while shaving, smells terrific and does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> The one positive for this product is that the bowl is an attractive wooden bowl.</li>
            <li> /&gt;SMELL- Is pleasant (not old person smelling)</li>
            <li> The Taylor of Old Bond Street is a superb product deserving of its lineage which dates back to England in the mid 1800s.</li>
            <li> other than that I am happy with the soap.</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick and trouble-free.</li>
            <li> If you are lucky you can find it for about $15.</li>
            <li> And daily its a mission to work up a perfect lather, I think I recently have found the trick.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Scent was mild in comparison to cream</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly and elk order from this stiller again.</li>
            <li> and I cannot recommend it more highly.  </li>
            <li> and I cannot recommend it more highly.  </li>
            <li> The wooden bowl is beautiful and very classy.</li>
            <li> fit snugly after first use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Wooden</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent is from real lavender, the soap foams up nicely and allows your straight or safety razor to glide right over your face.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s truly fantastic stuff, better than the TOBS cream and way better than other competitors.  </li>
            <li> New to DE shaving but absolutely love this soap.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell of this stuff however it simply doesn&#x27;t lather as good as my regular soap(Tabac Original).  </li>
            <li> Provides adequate glide cushion, not the best I&#x27;ve ever had, but I&#x27;ve definately had worse.  </li>
            <li> Impressive product works better than any other Soap I had previously used.</li>
            <li> I plan to continue to order this for him since he does enjoy it so much</li>
            <li> Having tried many shaving options for my sensitive skin I eventually came across soap.</li>
            <li> Nice wooden bowl.</li>
            <li> I love sandalwood, and this Taylor of old bond is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> I was not crazy about the smell.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the buy</li>
            <li> The shaving soap comes in a nice wooden bowl and I must say that I do like the sandalwood scent.</li>
            <li> was my favorite of these early finds.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much easier to use this product straight out of the bowl than to lather up cream in a mug (which also takes up more space on the counter).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much easier to use this product straight out of the bowl than to lather up cream in a mug (which also takes up more space on the counter).  </li>
            <li> The sandalwood scent is outstanding, and about as masculine as it gets.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Let me start out by saying I love to use Taylor of Old Bond Street for shaving.  </li>
            <li> I saw this Taylor of Old Bond Street sandalwood product with the wooden bowl and thought it would be an attractive addition to my bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was able to get a few good shaves with it, but overall there are a lot of soaps I like much better..</li>
            <li> This is my 4th Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving product and it is very pleasant with spicier notes than the typical Taylor&#x27;s sandalwood product.  </li>
            <li> The soap lathers nicely, doesn&#x27;t take much to load the brush, and it feels nice and slick.</li>
            <li> Add water as you go until it reaches the right consistency.</li>
            <li> This can be a chore to get it whipped up right and has a feel of pulling against my skin as I shave.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m not doing it right</li>
            <li> He is very pleased with the quality and performance of the soap, noting that it gives him a much closer, cleaner shave than standard shaving cream.</li>
            <li> The little wooden bowl is attractive it looks great on my sink next to my straight razor.</li>
            <li> My wife loves the scent as do I. Creates a nice thick lather, love it.</li>
            <li> It appears to be a luxury product at a very reasonable price point.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very very luxurious.  </li>
            <li> Not having used it myself, but the packaging is just as nice (wood bowl) and the fragrance smells as nice as well, subtle, high quality.  </li>
            <li> First I tried several different kinds of Proraso shave soap (pretty good stuff: the green tub is better than the red sandalwood), one kind of Proraso shave cream (not as good as their soap), and finally the TOBS shave *</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the bowl will be fine after the soap wears down, but the bowl should be made taller to work like it should.  </li>
            <li> , the Taylor was the larger size soap and so was a much better value to start.  </li>
            <li> On the first use of the Taylor, I noticed that its scent reminded me of my father.  </li>
            <li> This is my first time using a soap instead of a cream.  </li>
            <li> Adding a bit more water I have managed to get this soap to lather properly.</li>
            <li> Thanks for reading!</li>
            <li> I will try the lavender next but wish there was more selection.</li>
            <li> 30 seconds loading on a badger brush provides more than enough lather for a three or four pass DE shave.  </li>
            <li> First I HAVE to use pre-shave oil with this soap.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have HAD to use pre shave oil.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Remember-you only pay for the bowl the first time-after that, be sure you just order the soap refill.</li>
            <li> I have watched videos and read reviews of how well this brand of shaving soap lathers so the fault is most likely with me.</li>
            <li> Perhaps more practice on my part is necessary.</li>
            <li> I just finished my first shave and the product performed well.</li>
            <li> A daily shave is now quite enjoyable.</li>
            <li> The Van der Hagen that I get locally for a couple of dollars does a better job.  </li>
            <li> We will buy again and absolutely recommend to others!</li>
            <li> In next year sometime by this rate :)</li>
            <li> And since your soap splashes onto the edges of the bowl, if you don&#x27;t wipe it off the lid will stick to the top of the bowl when you want to shave the next day.  </li>
            <li> this is my first experience with shaving soap in this form, I can&#x27;t compare it to others.</li>
            <li> The bowl, while quite attractive, is very small.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and this soap lathers very well even with the cheap Burmashave Nylon brush I use.</li>
            <li> just a clean masculine smell.</li>
            <li> The soap washes cleanly with no residue but with the masculine scent of sandalwood - which is not too over powering.  </li>
            <li> The lathe turned wooden bowl and lid look classic sitting next to my just-bought badger shaving brush (used boar bristle for many, many years).</li>
            <li> After the first pass I noticed that the razor wasn&#x27;t sliding so much as gliding which gave a closure</li>
            <li> The lack of our events star is simply due to the scent not being very strong.</li>
            <li> The soap is flat on top and comes nearly to the top rim of the wooden bowl.  </li>
            <li> The soap is flat on top and comes nearly to the top rim of the wooden bowl.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;the scent is pure manliness.</li>
            <li> left.&lt;br /&gt;The bowl is pretty decent and has not broke or really fade yet.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> soap is SUPER smooth on the face -- much smoother than any other option I&#x27;ve tried, including TOBS&#x27;s cream.  </li>
            <li> soap is SUPER smooth on the face -- much smoother than any other option I&#x27;ve tried, including TOBS&#x27;s cream.  </li>
            <li> The size of the shaving soap is more than what I expected.    </li>
            <li> This product works very well with straight razors.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It is much easier to use the soap with a brush than to use a can of shaving foam.  </li>
            <li> Much \\&quot;cleaner\\&quot; looking on the sink, I think.&lt;br</li>
            <li> An absolute pleasure to shave with.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Very disatisfied because this was a gift.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not ready to remind people of my grandfather at 35 years of age :)  </li>
            <li> I used a whole tub and never thought I&#x27;d switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> TOBS produces so much lather</li>
            <li> Very manly.  </li>
            <li> The soap itself performs very well.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t want that much effort</li>
            <li> The photo of this product is very misleading and makes it look like you will get a bowl that is brimming over with soap.  </li>
            <li> The photo of this product is very misleading and makes it look like you will get a bowl that is brimming over with soap.  </li>
            <li> It lathers up fast ..</li>
            <li> and he really loves it.  </li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant and subtle.  </li>
            <li> Great product itself but false advertising</li>
            <li> That was also quite nice - heavy, metal handle.  </li>
            <li> Taylor of Old Bond Street has the most high quality line of men&#x27;s shaving and personal care products out here!</li>
            <li> This product by far has a great yet subtle sent of Sandalwood.</li>
            <li> Having used it for six months, I still have over 75% of the original soap left.  </li>
            <li> 20% Larger Than Our #1 Selling Original Mirror.]]).  </li>
            <li> But my real complaint with this soap is it is not the same great sandalwood scent that I loved with the other shaving cream version.  </li>
            <li> It take very little product to get a nice lather.  </li>
            <li> It provides a slick /lubricated lather for the blade to slide across nicely without chomping up your face.  </li>
            <li> Makes shaving enjoyable and less of a chore.</li>
            <li> It is truly a classic scent and one</li>
            <li> THe smell is steady, not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I decided on this one in particular because I travel a lot</li>
            <li> The sandalwood scent was the main reason i bought this product, and without it it&#x27;s just an overpriced bar of soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m extremely satisfied and plan to use the entire puck.</li>
            <li> you are partial to strong earthy, musky scented products</li>
            <li> My expectations were high given the name attached to it.  </li>
            <li> Would highly recommend using a high quality badger brush.  </li>
            <li> I would still rate it relatively high.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> I have a pretty thick beard (can grow it full in about 3 weeks), and the hairs grow in all different directions, not in any uniform way like most guys with thicker beards.  </li>
            <li> It has a little stronger scent than most Sandalwood soaps I have used from Crabtree and Evelyn and The Art of Shaving</li>
            <li> Soap is the real old school, but I dig the cream jars.  </li>
            <li> but my blades were fresh and the  same blades I always use.  </li>
            <li> my first jar of Taylor, was actually a cream, meaning you go through it fast.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for those shaving with a safety razor though DO NOT ORDER this item FROM MiN New York.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other shaving soaps before, but nothing holds a candle to this fine product.  </li>
            <li> Other than that this is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> The only problem is when making a nice lather the soap spills on the sides, I wish the bowl was a little deeper, or the puck was shorter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sort of new to D/E shaving.</li>
            <li> But in lieu of all my whining I would encourage anyone seeking a new soap to give it a try as others here  seem to have no complaints and</li>
            <li> I am new to shaving soap, as opposed to cream.</li>
            <li> The aroma is classic but not the \\&quot;old man</li>
            <li> Good, soap, foams really well with the badger brush.&lt;br /&gt;However, the bowl container it comes in is merely asthetics.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Now that the investment of the wood bowl is done, the replacement Taylor soaps will be a very modest outlay.</li>
            <li> Compare this with any canned shave product and the $20 entry cost seems small, more so when you consider a refill soap is ~$10.  </li>
            <li> The soap needs a bit more water than usual to apply, if not then it can &amp;#34;dry out on your skin&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> In fact, the scent is so different that I returned the first bowl I received thinking it had to be packaged incorrectly.  </li>
            <li> But my replacement has exactly the same scent.  </li>
            <li> After two attempts to contact MiN they replied saying that the item was back-ordered (though it wasn&#x27;t listed that way when I placed my order) and they were waiting for their new shipment to clear customs.  </li>
            <li> I can not say enough that for anyone who has not used the \\&quot;old-fashioned\\&quot; traditional shaving they will like it hands down, and saving soaps like this are just more a perk!</li>
            <li> This was the first shaving soap I&#x27;ve ever used, but I&#x27;m  never going back to my old ways.</li>
            <li> This small bit of spillover residue actually has the effect of making a nice smell on my towel and the edges of the bowl to fill the bathroom for the rest of the day.  </li>
            <li> This small bit of spillover residue actually has the effect of making a nice smell on my towel and the edges of the bowl to fill the bathroom for the rest of the day.  </li>
            <li> is the best shaving soap I have used and is less expensive than any of the Art of Shaving products.</li>
            <li> Honestly I expected this to be better, it leaves my skin feeling dry.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m certain this will last me through the end of the year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks Taylor of Old Bond Street  Later</li>
            <li> The Sandalwood is very woody and fragrant and the wooden bowl is both a classy and functional touch.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B00158S4RM Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Soap</li>
            <li> it will passe softly i will order it again and again</li>
            <li> The lotion in the soap leaves skin soft after the shave.</li>
            <li> Really brings back class to shaving!</li>
            <li> I started going the old school brush, soap,safety razor shaving routine about 15 months ago.</li>
            <li> I was once a devoted disciple of Prorasso, then I discovered Taylor of Old Bond Street.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got a fairly sensitive nose</li>
            <li> Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream Bowl, 5.3-Ounce]].  </li>
            <li> Also, I have played around with this soap quite a bit it does dry fast!</li>
            <li> Sure, you are getting a wooden bowl out of the deal, but it&#x27;s a bowl that is really too shallow to work well as a shaving bowl.  </li>
            <li> First I am not new to soaps or shaving LIKE</li>
            <li> My wife does not particularly care for it either and after first use asked if I were wearing old spice.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it is not a bad scent at all, but it is not the same fragrant sandalwood scent I loved in their other product.  </li>
            <li> TOBS mixed fairly easy and created a rich lather which at first made me nervous since it went on thick instead of slick with the cream.  </li>
            <li> I only gave this particular product a 4 out of 5</li>
            <li> Overall, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m confident that it will last way longer, as it only takes a little soap to make a lot of lather.  </li>
            <li> It lathers reasonably well but not anywhere near as well as the same brand in the shaving cream bowl mentioned above.  </li>
            <li> But other problems are the soap fills the   bowl nearly to the top which creates a mess when lathering your brush.</li>
            <li> There is some inherent mess involved with lathering directly from the bowl because the soap literally comes right to the edge.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also very lean and have paper-thin skin, especially on my neck, meaning it&#x27;s a real bear to shave over my bumpy adam&#x27;s apple, sharp jaw line, and bony chin without getting a nick.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to soap shaving, so I&#x27;m still getting used to the routine, learning how to lather and apply properly.    </li>
            <li> This is my second soap I have ever bought, I am 24 and new to DE shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Used</li>
            <li> All comes in a very classy wooden shaving bowl.</li>
            <li> The product was marked sandlewood soap on the outside.</li>
            <li> One tip;  load the damp (not wet) brush in the bowl then build your lather in a separate bowl, not on the soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be surprised if it doesn&#x27;t last six months.  </li>
            <li> In short, no man&#x27;s bathroom is complete without this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Also, I noticed that clean up with the bowl was easier than cleaning the mug and tube (the soap would dry and then cake on the threads of the tube and make a mess).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit more expensive, but I highly recommend treating yourself to the wooden bowl.  </li>
            <li> I buy Art of Shaving for my husband, but that is far more expensive and this was for an in-law for whom I wasn&#x27;t going to make that stretch.  </li>
            <li> Taylor Sandalwood Shaving Soap has a very fragrant sandalwood aroma, makes a superior lather and protective soap layer when compared to other less expensive shave soaps.  </li>
            <li> Soap gives a nice thick &amp; slick lather.</li>
            <li> I was a little apprehensive about the scent of this soap from having read previous reviews, but my wife and I are both huge fans of it.since</li>
            <li> It does not particularly smell like old spice but does have the quality of grooming and hygiene products for men that believe a man should smell like a lumberjack.</li>
            <li> I consider myself very tolerant of smells, and would have used it, even if the smell was not very appealing.</li>
            <li> you have never used the other Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving cream,  and you just want a nice-looking wooden shaving bowl along with some soap, you will probably like this product.  </li>
            <li> you have never used the other Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving cream,  and you just want a nice-looking wooden shaving bowl along with some soap, you will probably like this product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fragrant when you&#x27;re lathering up, but it&#x27;s only very subtle on your skin afterwards and doesn&#x27;t smell at all like you are wearing cologne - not nearly that strong.    </li>
            <li> Yup I smell even sexier than usual today thanks to this stuff.</li>
            <li> last a long time and stores well.</li>
            <li> and it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> last long.</li>
            <li> One, very minor, complaint is that, as with all soaps, you have to shave up right away, or the soap will dry out on your skin.</li>
            <li> The hard soap refill costs almost as much as the 5.3 ounce product.  </li>
            <li> The hard soap refill costs almost as much as the 5.3 ounce product.  </li>
            <li> The bowls are worlds apart, the Col. Conk bowl was warped and ready for kindling in less than two months, the finish on it seemed thin and the lid split right in half.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Taylor of Old Bond street products for a few years now and they can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> I have tried others but am done testing, I am a life long Taylor customer.</li>
            <li> Even though this soap is a little more expensive than a can of shaving foam</li>
            <li> particular soap is hard soap, like bar soap.  </li>
            <li> I am in a place where the water quality is poor and leaves the top of the soap kinda hard.</li>
            <li> You will not mistake if for a shaving cream, it will tend to dry your skin</li>
            <li> , you can&#x27;t wait after you apply it because it will dry out on your face.    </li>
            <li> However after shaving     my face burns and skin becomes dry.</li>
            <li> It also leaves my face feeling dry after words.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really comment upon how well it lathers or shaves versus other brands (I hand lather and apply with the brush), but I&#x27;m getting used to the lather not being as thick as the shave gel</li>
            <li> bowl is quite nice, although it is quite shallow which makes it difficult to lather the soap without splashing it all over the edges of the bowl.  </li>
            <li> But if you have used the other version of Taylor of Old Bond Street sandalwood shaving cream in the plastic bowl and wanted the same scent in the hard soap you will be sorely disappointed.ly getting about 3.5 ounces of soap compared with 5.3 ounces of soap if you buy the sandalwood shave cream in a plastic bowl.  </li>
            <li> At the same time I purchased a small Col Conk Bay Rum soap in their wooden bowl.  </li>
            <li> would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for an alternative to the typical creams.</li>
            <li> I have found soaps to be a little less slick than creams, but as soaps go, this one is less drying on the skin and plenty slick enough for a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately that&#x27;s the only positive I can come up with for this product.  </li>
            <li> My shave seems to be a little smoother, though, with the hard soap, and I do not nick myself as much with it.  </li>
            <li> Washes off clean with a very faint smell left over.</li>
            <li> It smells like a wet diaper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a wet shaver for years.</li>
            <li> Once my son started shaving with a brush, I noticed we were going through the stuff at an alarming rate!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> When you are done, let the soap air dry before putting on the lid as letting soaps stay too wet seems to cause them to break down over time.    </li>
            <li> so think I will use it only on occasion as it seems too harsh for daily use, at least    on my face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Being a noob, I went with TOBS based on the company&#x27;s history and other reviews</li>
            <li> Not EXACTLY what I had in mind</li>
            <li> The scent is just enough to not be annoying and soft enough that it won&#x27;t interfere with any colognes you may add later.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s hardly any difference in the level of soap in the wooden bowl.  </li>
            <li> The wood is finished well, with what seems like a tough polyurethane, so it should last a long time without water damage.  </li>
            <li> I can shave fast and carelessly without getting the slightest nick.  </li>
            <li> I can shave fast and carelessly without getting the slightest nick.  </li>
            <li> I can also shave through several days of thick stubble without any pulling at all.  </li>
            <li> I can also shave through several days of thick stubble without any pulling at all.  </li>
            <li> It is also hard to use because the soap is too hard to get a generous amount on my brush, and the wood dish is not deep enough to build lather in with the soap inside without making a mess.</li>
            <li> ~$20, for a soap and bowl for both Col. Conk and Taylor, the odd thing is</li>
            <li> Having used the Art of Shaving Sandalwood for months previous, I got used to its scent.  </li>
            <li> Also, this way takes up less space, so instead of a tube + mug, I now just have the bowl.</li>
            <li> shaves using this soap where by I  will typically nick myself one or twice a month.</li>
            <li> After years of buying the hype of expensive 4-bladed razors I recently decided to try my hand with a double edge safety razor.</li>
            <li> The bowl lid has a little knob carved into it, but it is too shallow to grip and is only decorative.  </li>
            <li> however I find that adding a little liquid glycerin prevents this from being an issue.  </li>
            <li> I may have found my everyday shaving soap.  </li>
            <li> 1 part shaving cream, 1 part shaving soap, and a few drops of glycerin.  </li>
            <li> Pro tip buy the bowl with the soap included when it goes on sale a few times a year, and then just buy the refill soap after.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Taylor Sandalwood cream for a few years.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The reason for my frequent changes in gear and method have to do with my difficult beard situation.  </li>
            <li> a few nothing matches the value and quality of this cream.  </li>
            <li> But if you have used the other version of Taylor of Old Bond Street sandalwood shaving cream in the plastic bowl and wanted the same scent in the hard soap you will be sorely disappointed.</li>
            <li> It also irritated my skin pretty bad.</li>
            <li> Although hard soaps have a bad rap of not protecting the skin well due to their lower glycerine content in compared to the creams, I have yet to nick myself with my straight razor while using it.  </li>
            <li> I was worried that soap would dry my skin out unnecessarily, this was not the case.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this soap to any man who wants to leave the world of bad shaving and enter into the world of man shaving.</li>
            <li> I have been using DE razors since I was young and have went through a myriad of soaps, scents, creams, and some crazy oil like thing called &amp;#34;Shavers Secret&amp;#34; (which I believe is just olive oil....)</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve just made it past 1/2</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never experienced this with any other shaving soap or cream.    </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not wet shaving men, you&#x27;re doing it wrong!</li>
            <li> This appears to be a somewhat hard soap</li>
            <li> Lathers well, even in hard water.  </li>
            <li> The product arrived months late with no communication from the distributor.  </li>
            <li> This stuff lathers at least as well as</li>
            <li> decided to try the soap as a way to get him to slow his roll a bit.  </li>
            <li> You guys from the country might not know what I mean by that ..</li>
            <li> it is too shallow.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s subtle and reminds me of going to the barber shop with grandpa.</li>
            <li> I actually got sick from the smell.  </li>
            <li> But the lather seems to stay kinda thin.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I bought this product along with its after shave gel, and cannot use it.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it did not hold up.</li>
            <li> The soap can take a LOT of water so don&#x27;t be shy about adding it til you get it the way you like it.</li>
            <li> It is not over powering and for someone with sensitive skin has not caused any irritating effects like i use to get with those nasty gel&#x27;s for the bad cartridge shavers.  </li>
            <li> And when lathering it up don&#x27;t be afraid of getting in there and being aggressive with the soap for about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> But cannot even do that because the odor is so bad.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t bad, but not as aromatic as the cream.  </li>
            <li> I promise that you will not be disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to trying TOBS soap., but I have to say I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> Horrible</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product, Great Seller</li>
            <li> Looks very nice. Holds your soap when not using it.</li>
            <li> The Taylor of Old Bond Street is a superb product deserving of its lineage which dates back to England in the mid 1800s. Made in England and animal-conscious, this shaving soap delivers what I would call a balm as well as soap to your face.  I&#x27;ve used other shaving soaps before, but nothing holds a candle to this fine product.  The lathe turned wooden bowl and lid look classic sitting next to my just-bought badger shaving brush (used boar bristle for many, many years). Shipping was quick and trouble-free.</li>
            <li> This shaving soap makes a very nice lather with a smell of sandlewood.  The bowl is a very nice wooden bowl with a matching lid.  The size of the shaving soap is more than what I expected.    I will buy again when i run out.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this shaving soap. I love how he smells after shaving!</li>
            <li> Taylor Sandalwood Shaving Soap has a very fragrant sandalwood aroma, makes a superior lather and protective soap layer when compared to other less expensive shave soaps.  This product works very well with straight razors.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> The product itself is 5 star.  The lather is easy to generate in the bowl and the texture on the face seems far superior to any creams I&#x27;ve used. The scent is just enough to not be annoying and soft enough that it won&#x27;t interfere with any colognes you may add later.  I highly recommend this product for those shaving with a safety razor though DO NOT ORDER this item FROM MiN New York.  The product arrived months late with no communication from the distributor.  After two attempts to contact MiN they replied saying that the item was back-ordered (though it wasn&#x27;t listed that way when I placed my order) and they were waiting for their new shipment to clear customs.  A week or so later the product arrived at my door.  Many fine shaving outlets can supply this product; I will certainly be using another distribution channel when it&#x27;s time for a refill.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shave soap for a couple of months now.  It lathers up well, goes on smoothly and smells great.  One, very minor, complaint is that, as with all soaps, you have to shave up right away, or the soap will dry out on your skin.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B00158S4RM Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Soap In A Wooden Bowl, 3.5-Ounce]]  I bought this from Amazon earlier this year.  I have been using the Art of Shaving products exclusively for some time, but wanted to see what else is available for the finely groomed man.  At the same time I purchased a small Col Conk Bay Rum soap in their wooden bowl.  The difference between the two is night and day, with the CC product feeling more like soap and the Taylor feeling like a creamy smooth treat.  The smells are not comparable as they are different fragrances.    The Price:  I paid the same price ~$20, for a soap and bowl for both Col. Conk and Taylor, the odd thing is, the Taylor was the larger size soap and so was a much better value to start.  The Bowl:  The bowls are worlds apart, the Col. Conk bowl was warped and ready for kindling in less than two months, the finish on it seemed thin and the lid split right in half.  The Taylor bowl is just beautiful after six months of daily use.  The Soap:  Taylor of Old Bond Street makes a wonderful Sandalwood soap.  Having used the Art of Shaving Sandalwood for months previous, I got used to its scent.  On the first use of the Taylor, I noticed that its scent reminded me of my father.  It is truly a classic scent and one you look forward too every morning.  You will not mistake if for a shaving cream, it will tend to dry your skin however I find that adding a little liquid glycerin prevents this from being an issue.  Having used it for six months, I still have over 75% of the original soap left.  Compare this with any canned shave product and the $20 entry cost seems small, more so when you consider a refill soap is ~$10.  This is a great product at a very reasonable price.  If you love class shave scents, give it a try!</li>
            <li> This soap lathers up nicely and smells good.  It provides a slick /lubricated lather for the blade to slide across nicely without chomping up your face.  It is way better than VDH you can purchase from any walgreens/cvs/rite aid.  I probably won&#x27;t use that again.  Using a better brush makes all the difference.  Give this soap a try.  The wooden bowl is elegant, and a nice touch to the \\&quot;experience\\&quot; of DE shaving.</li>
            <li> My expectations were high given the name attached to it.  This is my first time using a soap instead of a cream.  It lathered up faster than I thought.  The smell is pleasant and subtle.  The greatest thing I noticed is how well it moisturizers the skin.  I would recommend this soap to any man who wants to leave the world of bad shaving and enter into the world of man shaving.</li>
            <li> Having tried many shaving options for my sensitive skin I eventually came across soap. I was worried that soap would dry my skin out unnecessarily, this was not the case.  This soap lathers well and provided the closest smoothest shave I have ever had.  It is much easier to use the soap with a brush than to use a can of shaving foam.  Even though this soap is a little more expensive than a can of shaving foam I&#x27;m confident that it will last way longer, as it only takes a little soap to make a lot of lather.  Paired with the same brand of aftershave this leaves you feeling and smelling like a gentleman.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to soap shaving, so I&#x27;m still getting used to the routine, learning how to lather and apply properly.    This soap and bowl are great.  The bowl looks very nice - recommend getting a \\&quot;matching\\&quot; dark wood brush holder for your counter top.    Also, given that I&#x27;m not into fragrances, I was concerned about the sandalwood and smelling like The Dude&#x27;s house or something.  Not a problem at all.  It&#x27;s fragrant when you&#x27;re lathering up, but it&#x27;s only very subtle on your skin afterwards and doesn&#x27;t smell at all like you are wearing cologne - not nearly that strong.    I can&#x27;t really comment upon how well it lathers or shaves versus other brands (I hand lather and apply with the brush), but I&#x27;m getting used to the lather not being as thick as the shave gel I&#x27;m used to.  Still, no cuts at all, and it&#x27;s a very nice, close shave.   I will say for the benefit of beginners that, as someone else said too, you can&#x27;t wait after you apply it because it will dry out on your face.    Again, a great product, especially for the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sort of new to D/E shaving. I started out with Pororaso in a tube, no complaints per se, but I wanted to try something else. Saw the good reviews for Taylor of Old Bond and thought I would try it. I like the scent, and I found that I actually prefer the soap in a bowl method rather than squeezing out of the tube with the Pororaso. Also, I noticed that clean up with the bowl was easier than cleaning the mug and tube (the soap would dry and then cake on the threads of the tube and make a mess). Also, this way takes up less space, so instead of a tube + mug, I now just have the bowl. Much \\&quot;cleaner\\&quot; looking on the sink, I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The performance is good, and does the job for me, but this soap does not lather up like the Pororaso did, still, I get a great shave,  and I like the scent, so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> Make sure you have a quality brush and this stuff lathers wonderfully.  Although hard soaps have a bad rap of not protecting the skin well due to their lower glycerine content in compared to the creams, I have yet to nick myself with my straight razor while using it.  Would highly recommend using a high quality badger brush.  My complaints with this product are minor at best but include the bowl and lid do not mate well and there are some areas where the gap is easily visible.  There is some inherent mess involved with lathering directly from the bowl because the soap literally comes right to the edge.  Still its a welcome addition to my toiletries as the scent is wonderful (sandalwood) and I will always keep some of this stuff around.</li>
            <li> Very nice shave soap. Has a pleasant smell and soothes the skin while shaving. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Came in a woden bowl.  Lathers up good and has lasted several months and is still going.</li>
            <li> Nice wooden bowl. The soap lathers nicely, doesn&#x27;t take much to load the brush, and it feels nice and slick. I really enjoy it. Some people have issues with the smell not being on par with the cream, but to me I think the soap smells better. Glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> very good with a mild purfume</li>
            <li> It is nice soap. I prefer the TOBS cream over their soap. The smell is more powdery with their soap. Cream has a more robust smell to it. The performance is great with their soap though. I was not totally disappointed with their soap but it isn&#x27;t as good as their cream in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product. Soap gives a nice thick &amp; slick lather. One of my favorite soaps.</li>
            <li> it will let you injoy by your shaving time just tray it once and you will know what i am talking about the smell verey nice and  your razor it will passe softly i will order it again and again</li>
            <li> Great soap regardless of what type of rush you use. Loads easily and generates a nice lather and scent. An absolute pleasure to shave with.</li>
            <li> Again something gifted to my husband and he loved it. I plan to continue to order this for him since he does enjoy it so much</li>
            <li> Ordered this shaving soap after reading the reviews and I am not disappointed. Impressive product works better than any other Soap I had previously used. Results in close shave every time and leaves a very refreshing feeling afterwards. The lotion in the soap leaves skin soft after the shave. I am very satisfied with this product and recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this stuff however it simply doesn&#x27;t lather as good as my regular soap(Tabac Original).  Because it smells so good I would still rate it relatively high. But other problems are the soap fills the   bowl nearly to the top which creates a mess when lathering your brush. The lid of the bowl barly sits on  top of the bowl(not snugly). I have nicked my face 4 times during three shaves using this soap where by I  will typically nick myself one or twice a month. That could be a fluke but my blades were fresh and the  same blades I always use.  But in lieu of all my whining I would encourage anyone seeking a new soap to give it a try as others here  seem to have no complaints and the scent is terrific.  Edit: Adding a bit more water I have managed to get this soap to lather properly. However after shaving     my face burns and skin becomes dry. I&#x27;ve never experienced this with any other shaving soap or cream.    I do like the scent so think I will use it only on occasion as it seems too harsh for daily use, at least    on my face.</li>
            <li> This product is a great buy. It produces a wonderful lather with not too strong of a sandalwood smell following you though the day. Given the price, I choose this over its more expensive AOS counterpart any day.</li>
            <li> I love sandalwood, and this Taylor of old bond is one of my favorites. The little wooden bowl is attractive it looks great on my sink next to my straight razor. THe smell is steady, not overpowering. The only problem is when making a nice lather the soap spills on the sides, I wish the bowl was a little deeper, or the puck was shorter. Other than that this is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> This shaving soap was purchased because of the manufacturer and the scent.  I am VERY pleased with both.  It lathers well with a badger brush, provides excellent lubricity while shaving, smells terrific and does not dry out my skin. This will definately be reordered when it runs out.  Thanks for reading!</li>
            <li> New to DE shaving but absolutely love this soap.  Highly recommended.  I will try the lavender next but wish there was more selection.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I bought this product along with its after shave gel, and cannot use it.  It smells like a wet diaper. I actually got sick from the smell.  I consider myself very tolerant of smells, and would have used it, even if the smell was not very appealing. But cannot even do that because the odor is so bad.</li>
            <li> My wife commented on how nice this bowl looks on the countertop.  In addition the soap is great and the sandalwood scent is very nice but not overpowering.  Lathers up very easily... 30 seconds loading on a badger brush provides more than enough lather for a three or four pass DE shave.  This appears to be a somewhat hard soap and I think it will last for several months.  TOBS could probably charge much more for this (but hopefully they won&#x27;t).  It appears to be a luxury product at a very reasonable price point.  I may have found my everyday shaving soap.  Enjoy your shave!</li>
            <li> Good scent, nice bowl. Works great.</li>
            <li> I am in love with the sandalwood shaving cream!  So I figured I would try out the soap to see how it compares.  The aroma of the soap is no where near as good as the cream.  It isn&#x27;t bad, but not as aromatic as the cream.  If you never have tried the cream, I suggest it first!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the soap to create an uberlather.  1 part shaving cream, 1 part shaving soap, and a few drops of glycerin.  This provides an excellent shave with my DE!</li>
            <li> Good soap that lathers well.  I was not crazy about the smell.  Not a traditional sandalwood compared to others.  The bowl is great, just wish the smell was as good.</li>
            <li> My husband loves it and I love the scent!</li>
            <li> Taylor products are fantastic and sold at reasonible prices. Sandalwood and Mr. Taylors are the two best scents they have. Exellent shave soap, just buy it.</li>
            <li> This is my 4th Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving product and it is very pleasant with spicier notes than the typical Taylor&#x27;s sandalwood product.  The wood bowl adds and nice old world touch.  It take very little product to get a nice lather.  The smell is refined and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Good, soap, foams really well with the badger brush.&lt;br /&gt;However, the bowl container it comes in is merely asthetics.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot use it for mixing bowl...it is too shallow. (I tried using it couple times).&lt;br /&gt;But other than that I am happy with the soap.</li>
            <li> wow this stuff is great, good smell easy lather</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a wet shaver for years. This soap is a great value and lasts forever.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is from real lavender, the soap foams up nicely and allows your straight or safety razor to glide right over your face.&lt;br /&gt;This is the best shaving soap I have used and is less expensive than any of the Art of Shaving products. Pro tip buy the bowl with the soap included when it goes on sale a few times a year, and then just buy the refill soap after. If you are lucky you can find it for about $15.</li>
            <li> This soap is a shaver&#x27;s dream. It creates an incredibly dense foam that is perfect for protecting your face. The case it comes in is beautiful and one I&#x27;m not ashamed to leave on the counter. The soap leaves a nice fragrance on your face that you will enjoy smelling the rest of the day. I will be using this product for life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different shave soaps in the past, but this one give the best lather that I&#x27;ve ever experienced. Well worth the buy</li>
            <li> I was really excited to use this soap. First I am not new to soaps or shaving LIKE A MAN. I have been using DE razors since I was young and have went through a myriad of soaps, scents, creams, and some crazy oil like thing called &amp;#34;Shavers Secret&amp;#34; (which I believe is just olive oil....) anyway I was looking forward to this soap. Unfortunately it did not hold up. First I HAVE to use pre-shave oil with this soap. This is the first time I have HAD to use pre shave oil. The scent is not as strong as I would like it. And it doesn&#x27;t seem to lather that well (I use a Da Vinci Silvertip Badger Shaving Brush... it&#x27;s a $100 brush so that&#x27;s not the issue). It also leaves my face feeling dry after words. Over all it is just ok, I can;t wait for it to be gone so I can put something else in the wooden bowl.... soup maybe</li>
            <li> I know, I know.  Soap is the real old school, but I dig the cream jars.  The soap just doesn&#x27;t measure up.</li>
            <li> This is my second soap I have ever bought, I am 24 and new to DE shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Used Semogue 620 / parker 96r&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SMELL- Is pleasant (not old person smelling) just a clean masculine smell. It is not over empowering when lathered up and on face. Washes off clean with a very faint smell left over. You should be using aftershave after all is said and done so the smell should be of no concern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LATHER- I have been using this for about 4 months now. And daily its a mission to work up a perfect lather, I think I recently have found the trick. I am in a place where the water quality is poor and leaves the top of the soap kinda hard. I have compensated by letting the soap soak while I shower then work the top of the soap with my fingers. And when lathering it up don&#x27;t be afraid of getting in there and being aggressive with the soap for about 30 seconds. I believe this is not a beginner soap on the amount of prep required to get a nice lather.. Also, I have played around with this soap quite a bit it does dry fast! Compared to my porasco soap this soap has zero protection and zero slickness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am about 4 months into the jar and I probably have another 4 months atleast left.&lt;br /&gt;The bowl is pretty decent and has not broke or really fade yet.&lt;br /&gt;This soap is garbage, I thought It was my technique until I tried a different soap and immediately realized its this soap.</li>
            <li> works good smells great</li>
            <li> This is my first ToBS product and I have to say I&#x27;m impressed.  The scent is pleasant, light and not overpowering.  Lathers well, even in hard water.  Provides adequate glide cushion, not the best I&#x27;ve ever had, but I&#x27;ve definately had worse.  I will definately be a repeat ToBS customer.  The bowl is nice, though I think I will soon be transferring my soap out so I can really get a good bowlful of lather in my scuttle.</li>
            <li> TOBS Sandalwood shave soap is amazing! Amazing scent, amazing container, amazing lather!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being a noob, I went with TOBS based on the company&#x27;s history and other reviews I have read. I decided on this one in particular because I travel a lot and I like the convenience of a bowl that come with the soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the scent is pure manliness. It&#x27;s subtle and reminds me of going to the barber shop with grandpa. If you&#x27;re not wet shaving men, you&#x27;re doing it wrong!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Taylor Sandalwood cream for a few years.  Once my son started shaving with a brush, I noticed we were going through the stuff at an alarming rate!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try the soap as a way to get him to slow his roll a bit.  Worked great.  He came home from college in May...It&#x27;s now the end of August and he just went back.  There&#x27;s hardly any difference in the level of soap in the wooden bowl.  I&#x27;m certain this will last me through the end of the year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As great as it is, it took some getting used to.  I&#x27;ve always liked shaving after a shower.  The beard is softer, and the sandalwood has a great scent.  The thing with the soap is-in order to get a good lather going, you need the brush to be a lot wetter than with cream, and it&#x27;s just messier.  Once I figured that out and adjusted my routine, I was getting shaves every bit as close as with the cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember-you only pay for the bowl the first time-after that, be sure you just order the soap refill.</li>
            <li> The product was marked sandlewood soap on the outside. The item was actually a different sent and it didn&#x27;t come with the shaving dish I paid for. I tried to correct this situation to no avail. Very disatisfied because this was a gift.</li>
            <li> While I ordered the sandalwood, I feel as if the scent of the soap borders a lavender or stock soap smell. Still however, the product is long-lasting (I&#x27;d say close to 20 shaves in and barely a dent within the puck) and provides an excellent shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for an alternative to the typical creams.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very very luxurious.  A truly great shaving experience.</li>
            <li> After years of buying the hype of expensive 4-bladed razors I recently decided to try my hand with a double edge safety razor. I purchased the Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood shaving soap after reading many excellent reviews. The shaving soap comes in a nice wooden bowl and I must say that I do like the sandalwood scent. My only reason for not giving it a 5-star rating is that I have not been able to produce a great lather. I have watched videos and read reviews of how well this brand of shaving soap lathers so the fault is most likely with me. Perhaps more practice on my part is necessary. I would definitely purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> My wife loves the scent as do I. Creates a nice thick lather, love it.</li>
            <li> This has a very strong scent.  Too strong for me.  The face lubrication is also not as good as with the cream.</li>
            <li> So much better than store bought mass produced foams and gell.  Great mild scent.  I will be reordering.</li>
            <li> Great product. Lathers really easily!</li>
            <li> Great soap, love the lather, smooth shave.  The smell is very nice but my wife tells me it reminds her of how our grandfathers smell.  Again, great soap and relaxing scent but I&#x27;m not ready to remind people of my grandfather at 35 years of age :)  I will be looking to buy another scent from Taylor!</li>
            <li> Very Happy to find this product. This was my second order and I will continue to buy it!</li>
            <li> FANTASTIC shaving soap! Lathers very nice, goes on smooth, and has a very nice, woodsy after-scent that lingers long after shaving. All comes in a very classy wooden shaving bowl. Really brings back class to shaving! All around wonderful product! Definitely recommended if you&#x27;re looking to spruce up your shaving!</li>
            <li> Great soap, and like all the TOBS line of shaving products, is a joy to use.  The sandalwood shaving soap leaves enough residue for a second &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; pass without chaffing.  The soap also rinses easily, leaving a nice but not over-powering scent on your face.  Would recommend to any DE shaver.</li>
            <li> Great product itself but false advertising, It didn&#x27;t come with the wooden bowl these guys are liars. Why would you say it comes with a wooden bowl and lie to us like that? Horrible</li>
            <li> This product ranks #3 with Truefitt &amp; Hill and Trumper.  The cream performs well and lathers well.  I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Started with TOBS sandalwood cream and wanted to go to the more authentic soap and bowl instead of the premixed cream&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reviewed the options for just purchasing the puck and bowl separately and went with the bowl and soap for the value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The TOBS mixed fairly easy and created a rich lather which at first made me nervous since it went on thick instead of slick with the cream.  After the first pass I noticed that the razor wasn&#x27;t sliding so much as gliding which gave a closure shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will be keeping bowl to refill with TOBS soap after this is depleted&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;Lathered easily&lt;br /&gt;Scent was mild in comparison to cream&lt;br /&gt;Lid fit snugly after first use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Wooden bowl has off scent which might go to why some people complain concerning scent of soap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have to say if you are a TOBS fan it is a great product the scent is mild and the lather has left my face moisturized and smooth after using this product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am pleased with this purchase and will purchase the soap again</li>
            <li> Yup I smell even sexier than usual today thanks to this stuff. In my opinion, seems a bit of cinnamon with the sandalwood. Not EXACTLY what I had in mind, however lovely stuff.  Thanks Taylor of Old Bond Street  Later soap buying taters.</li>
            <li> This was the first shaving soap I&#x27;ve ever used, but I&#x27;m  never going back to my old ways. Love the smell and makes for a very comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> just ok ,i like everlyn more</li>
            <li> Great product, its very aromatic so make sure you really like the sandalwood scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise the wooden bowl is well constructed and I will reuse it and just add in the refills to save money.</li>
            <li> I am beyond impressed with this shave soap!  It&#x27;s truly fantastic stuff, better than the TOBS cream and way better than other competitors.  I&#x27;ve been shaving with a DE razor for about a year now.  I&#x27;ve learned a lot along the way and changed a lot of the products I use numerous times, trying to find the stuff that work best.  I&#x27;ve finally placed the last piece of the puzzle in discovering this TOBS shave soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason for my frequent changes in gear and method have to do with my difficult beard situation.  I have a pretty thick beard (can grow it full in about 3 weeks), and the hairs grow in all different directions, not in any uniform way like most guys with thicker beards.  I&#x27;m also very lean and have paper-thin skin, especially on my neck, meaning it&#x27;s a real bear to shave over my bumpy adam&#x27;s apple, sharp jaw line, and bony chin without getting a nick.  (You fleshy faced guys out there don&#x27;t know how easy you have it to be shaving over a smooth and forgiving surface!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My quest for the perfect shaving soap/cream took a while to lead me here.  First I tried several different kinds of Proraso shave soap (pretty good stuff: the green tub is better than the red sandalwood), one kind of Proraso shave cream (not as good as their soap), and finally the TOBS shave *cream*.  The TOBS shave cream was my favorite of these early finds.  I gather that many people on this page have tried it at one point and written at length about its virtues.  It works well, smells great, and excels especially at keeping the skin from drying out.  I used a whole tub and never thought I&#x27;d switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, the day came when my tub of TOBS cream was running out.  I like to shave in the shower occasionally (with the excellent  [[ASIN:B005OSQGN8 Deluxe LED Fogless Shower Mirror with Squeegee by ToiletTree Products. Guaranteed Not to Fog, Designed Not to Fall. 20% Larger Than Our #1 Selling Original Mirror.]]).  Shave cream is not so good for shower shaving because it&#x27;s more finicky about water mixture, and excess moisture in the shower always throws things off.  But shave soap is great in the shower, so I thought I would try TOBS shave soap of the same scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m TOTALLY impressed with TOBS shave soap.  It lathers easily.  It smells great.  It&#x27;s much easier to use this product straight out of the bowl than to lather up cream in a mug (which also takes up more space on the counter).  Best of all, TOBS shave soap is SUPER smooth on the face -- much smoother than any other option I&#x27;ve tried, including TOBS&#x27;s cream.  I can shave fast and carelessly without getting the slightest nick.  I can also shave through several days of thick stubble without any pulling at all.  The actual product sold on this page comes in a wooden bowl, with the soap fitted perfectly inside (replacements available, of course).  The soap is flat on top and comes nearly to the top rim of the wooden bowl.  Some of the lather will definitely spill over the edges of the bowl when you shave, but I don&#x27;t count this as a problem.  When I&#x27;m in the shower, I just put the lid on and wipe away the excess soap from the sides of the bowl with my fingers.  Outside the shower, I put the lid on and wipe the sides with a towel.  This small bit of spillover residue actually has the effect of making a nice smell on my towel and the edges of the bowl to fill the bathroom for the rest of the day.  I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, this is really great stuff and I cannot recommend it more highly.  It will give you the smoothest, easiest lather you have ever experienced!t&#x27;s more finicky about water mixture, and excess moisture in the shower always throws things off.  But shave soap is great in the shower, so I thought I would try TOBS shave soap of the same scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m TOTALLY impressed with TOBS shave soap.  It lathers easily.  It smells great.  It&#x27;s much easier to use this product straight out of the bowl than to lather up cream in a mug (which also takes up more space on the counter).  Best of all, TOBS shave soap is SUPER smooth on the face -- much smoother than any other option I&#x27;ve tried, including TOBS&#x27;s cream.  I can shave fast and carelessly without getting the slightest nick.  I can also shave through several days of thick stubble without any pulling at all.

            <li> I like the lather and the smell.  Makes shaving enjoyable and less of a chore.</li>
            <li> Great smell and an awesome lather inside a nice wooden bowl!  Shipped quickly and elk order from this stiller again.</li>
            <li> I started going the old school brush, soap,safety razor shaving routine about 15 months ago. This is the fourth&lt;br /&gt;soap I&#x27;ve \\&quot;auditioned\\&quot; during that time. The soap from Geo.F Trumper was nice but just too much money. Also, it,&lt;br /&gt;like my first jar of Taylor, was actually a cream, meaning you go through it fast. With this, you have to work up the lather (isn&#x27;t that why you buy a nice brush in the first place?)but it works great and smells nice but not overpowering. Now that the investment of the wood bowl is done, the replacement Taylor soaps will be a very modest outlay.</li>
            <li> Smells great, produces rich, foamy lather that makes shaving much easier.</li>
            <li> I have been looking forward to trying this product. Taylor has a great reputation and judging from this soap it is well deserved. I just finished my first shave and the product performed well. It has a rich sandalwod scent that is pronounced but not too strong. Your cologne would easily cover it. The aroma is classic but not the \\&quot;old man smell\\&quot; I remember from my youth.    I have found soaps to be a little less slick than creams, but as soaps go, this one is less drying on the skin and plenty slick enough for a smooth shave. I would use a good pre-shave oil with it, however just to get that cream like slickness. The lather is very rich and it is easy to load even with a badger brush. One tip;  load the damp (not wet) brush in the bowl then build your lather in a separate bowl, not on the soap. Add water as you go until it reaches the right consistency. The soap can take a LOT of water so don&#x27;t be shy about adding it til you get it the way you like it. When you are done, let the soap air dry before putting on the lid as letting soaps stay too wet seems to cause them to break down over time.    Overall, I highly recommend this product. I intend to try the pre shave and some of the creams next.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t often write reviews but I had to in this case. This product is fantastic. Beautifully packaged in its wooden bowl but it&#x27;s allure is the sandalwood wood aroma that comes from the soap. It is intoxicating and had anyone around me swooning. As a man that appreciates a good shave I promise that you will not be disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> First foray with Taylor of Old Bond Street and I am impressed! The Sandalwood is very woody and fragrant and the wooden bowl is both a classy and functional touch.</li>
            <li> I was once a devoted disciple of Prorasso, then I discovered Taylor of Old Bond Street.  This stuff lathers at least as well as Prorasso, which is impressive because shave cream usually has the advantage in that respect.  TOBS produces so much lather it&#x27;s almost wasteful. Even so, I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and am just starting to make a dent in it.  I&#x27;ll be surprised if it doesn&#x27;t last six months.  The sandalwood scent is outstanding, and about as masculine as it gets.  It&#x27;s a bit more expensive, but I highly recommend treating yourself to the wooden bowl.  The soap fits perfectly in it and does not move around, a huge plus when lathering vigorously.  The wood is finished well, with what seems like a tough polyurethane, so it should last a long time without water damage.  In short, no man&#x27;s bathroom is complete without this stuff.  You&#x27;ll thank yourself, trust me.</li>
            <li> I am new to shaving soap, as opposed to cream. But it does a great job of softening my beard when I wash my face with it, it gives me a good lather and gives a good glide to my razor,, especially when I mix in my shave oil. My wife also likes the scent, which is not anything like any Axe product. Very manly.  And I admit it, I like wooden pieces, and the bowl is a very nice container for the soap.</li>
            <li> This product by far has a great yet subtle sent of Sandalwood. It is not over powering and for someone with sensitive skin has not caused any irritating effects like i use to get with those nasty gel&#x27;s for the bad cartridge shavers.  I can not say enough that for anyone who has not used the \\&quot;old-fashioned\\&quot; traditional shaving they will like it hands down, and saving soaps like this are just more a perk!</li>
            <li> I had never used this product before and I have alway&#x27;s been a fan of Sandalwood scent. The scent is fantastic and very clean. It has a little stronger scent than most Sandalwood soaps I have used from Crabtree and Evelyn and The Art of Shaving but it smells great. After you shave and you wash it off, it leaves you with a lingering scent. I have extremely sensitive skin and this soap lathers very well even with the cheap Burmashave Nylon brush I use. It lubricates my face and leaves my skin with no razor burn. Since I have used this soap I have no reason to use an aftershave. I just can&#x27;t imagine finding another Sandalwood soap that I enjoy using anymore than this one.</li>
            <li> Good lather and works well.</li>
            <li> The one positive for this product is that the bowl is an attractive wooden bowl. Unfortunately that&#x27;s the only positive I can come up with for this product.  The downsides are that:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It smells nothing like sandalwood.  I&#x27;ve got a fairly sensitive nose and I could not smell even a hint of sandalwood.  The sandalwood scent was the main reason i bought this product, and without it it&#x27;s just an overpriced bar of soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The bowl, while quite attractive, is very small.  The soap bar fills the bowl to the top, so there&#x27;s no room at all for foam.</li>
            <li> Seller deserves 5 stars for excellent service. The lack of our events star is simply due to the scent not being very strong. The soap itself performs very well. I use this with a DE safety razor and the TOBS aftershave lotion, and have noticed a vast improvement in my razor burn. A daily shave is now quite enjoyable. Just wish the scent was a bit stronger and more of a woodsy smell. Overall, I&#x27;m extremely satisfied and plan to use the entire puck.</li>
            <li> I have been using Taylor of Old Bond street products for a few years now and they can&#x27;t be beat. I have tried others but am done testing, I am a life long Taylor customer.</li>
            <li> i like the scent. has a very strong scent of saddle wood.  last a long time and stores well. ok</li>
            <li> This shave soap is really nice.  A bit pricey, but the scent is great, it lathers up well and it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Honestly I expected this to be better, it leaves my skin feeling dry.  The Van der Hagen that I get locally for a couple of dollars does a better job.  It is also hard to use because the soap is too hard to get a generous amount on my brush, and the wood dish is not deep enough to build lather in with the soap inside without making a mess. It does smell really good though.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my husband, and he loves it! The wooden bowl is beautiful and very classy. He is very pleased with the quality and performance of the soap, noting that it gives him a much closer, cleaner shave than standard shaving cream. Even though he shaves every day, it also looks like this soap is going to last forever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He likes the smell, and I love it! So enticing. We are both very happy with this. We will buy again and absolutely recommend to others!</li>
            <li> OK.  I prefer cream version.  This can be a chore to get it whipped up right and has a feel of pulling against my skin as I shave.  Maybe I&#x27;m not doing it right but I don&#x27;t want that much effort so I&#x27;ll stick with the cream, which is excellent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been waiting to write this review until my shaving soap ran out....I bought this in Jan. 2013 and I&#x27;ve just made it past 1/2 the bowl!&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the bottom line.  Seldom have I been nicked by using this product.  The lather is so rich and conditioning you may actually look forward to shaving.  The soap needs a bit more water than usual to apply, if not then it can &amp;#34;dry out on your skin&amp;#34;.  The soap washes cleanly with no residue but with the masculine scent of sandalwood - which is not too over powering.  I&#x27;ve used the AOS, Zihr, Nivea, Neutrogena, Aveeno, and Anthony Logistics to name a few nothing matches the value and quality of this cream.  Will definitely get again...In next year sometime by this rate :)</li>
            <li> Taylor of Old Bond Street has the most high quality line of men&#x27;s shaving and personal care products out here! The Sandalwood Scented products are the best and my personal favorite. You really need to check them all out and find your favorite to. Well worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I only gave this particular product a 4 out of 5 is that I also bought the shaving cream in sandalwood and that is so much better to shave with but if you don&#x27;t want to spend the money this is your best option.</li>
            <li> Let me start out by saying I love to use Taylor of Old Bond Street for shaving.  I started out with [[ASIN:B0007MW2ZW Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream Bowl, 5.3-Ounce]].  It has a great scent and lathers really well.  I saw this Taylor of Old Bond Street sandalwood product with the wooden bowl and thought it would be an attractive addition to my bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bowl is quite nice, although it is quite shallow which makes it difficult to lather the soap without splashing it all over the edges of the bowl.  I&#x27;m sure the bowl will be fine after the soap wears down, but the bowl should be made taller to work like it should.  The bowl lid has a little knob carved into it, but it is too shallow to grip and is only decorative.  To lift the lid off the bowl you will have to grip it from the edges.  And since your soap splashes onto the edges of the bowl, if you don&#x27;t wipe it off the lid will stick to the top of the bowl when you want to shave the next day.  So for all of those reasons I docked it a star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular soap is hard soap, like bar soap.  It lathers reasonably well but not anywhere near as well as the same brand in the shaving cream bowl mentioned above.  My shave seems to be a little smoother, though, with the hard soap, and I do not nick myself as much with it.  But my real complaint with this soap is it is not the same great sandalwood scent that I loved with the other shaving cream version.  In fact, the scent is so different that I returned the first bowl I received thinking it had to be packaged incorrectly.  But my replacement has exactly the same scent.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it is not a bad scent at all, but it is not the same fragrant sandalwood scent I loved in their other product.  So that&#x27;s why I docked another star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, this product is way over-priced.  Sure, you are getting a wooden bowl out of the deal, but it&#x27;s a bowl that is really too shallow to work well as a shaving bowl.  And you are only getting about 3.5 ounces of soap compared with 5.3 ounces of soap if you buy the sandalwood shave cream in a plastic bowl.  The hard soap refill costs almost as much as the 5.3 ounce product.  The photo of this product is very misleading and makes it look like you will get a bowl that is brimming over with soap.  Not at all.  The soap fills the inside of the bowl, but it does not brim over like the photo suggests.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have never used the other Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving cream,  and you just want a nice-looking wooden shaving bowl along with some soap, you will probably like this product.  But if you have used the other version of Taylor of Old Bond Street sandalwood shaving cream in the plastic bowl and wanted the same scent in the hard soap you will be sorely disappointed.ly getting about 3.5 ounces of soap compared with 5.3 ounces of soap if you buy the sandalwood shave cream in a plastic bowl.

            <li> The soap works well. Good lather, smooth shave, leaves skin soft and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are partial to strong earthy, musky scented products then you will enjoy the sandalwood fragrance. I don&#x27;t however and would have preferred a different TOBS fragrance in shaving soap had it been available on amazon. My wife does not particularly care for it either and after first use asked if I were wearing old spice. It does not particularly smell like old spice but does have the quality of grooming and hygiene products for men that believe a man should smell like a lumberjack.</li>
            <li> You guys from the country might not know what I mean by that .. But anyone who lives/works in the city knows what it smells like to walk on a sidewalk that smells like some homeless dude peed on it. I was looking forward to trying TOBS soap., but I have to say I am disappointed. It lathers up fast .. But the lather seems to stay kinda thin. I was able to get a few good shaves with it, but overall there are a lot of soaps I like much better.. That are cheaper like van der Hagen, arko, proraso, tabac Palmolive .. All perform better than this soap IMHO.  It also irritated my skin pretty bad.</li>
            <li> Bought it as a gift and have heard great things in response to it.  I buy Art of Shaving for my husband, but that is far more expensive and this was for an in-law for whom I wasn&#x27;t going to make that stretch.  I read a lot of reviews saying people liked this as much as AoS and I can see why.  Not having used it myself, but the packaging is just as nice (wood bowl) and the fragrance smells as nice as well, subtle, high quality.  Brother in-law was really happy with it (I bought him a shaving brush from the same maker.  That was also quite nice - heavy, metal handle.  satisfying heft.)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think there is anything really special about this soap. It seems to do it&#x27;s job and that&#x27;s all I want.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always on the search of a good shaving soap.  I&#x27;ve tried many from the Art of Shaving, which I like.  This is the best shaving soap I&#x27;ve tried so far.  Smells great and lathers up well.</li>
            <li> Great lather. Perfect. Love it. Makes for a smooth shave and it smells good too; not flowery It appears that it will last me awhile too..</li>
            <li> best shave soap EVER!!!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent quality soap, lasts forever and mild scent is great.. Nice classy wood bowl too .. TOB has been around forever and they know what their doing, great value, highly recommend..</li>
            <li> Very good but the cream will give you a thicker lather.</li>
            <li> Very nice wooden bowl. Smells amazing and produces a great lather. Can&#x27;t ask for anything else!! Would recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> I was a little apprehensive about the scent of this soap from having read previous reviews, but my wife and I are both huge fans of it.since this is my first experience with shaving soap in this form, I can&#x27;t compare it to others. All I can say is it seems to lather well and last long.</li>
            <li> Works great, smells great, and the bowl looks good.  Will definitely buy this same soap when mine runs out! My wife loves how it smells, too!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my son.  I thought it smelled great and he really loves it.  He says that it is really lasting well.</li>
