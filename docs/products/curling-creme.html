            <li>Also has a pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it with and without a diffuser on my blow dryer and while both are fine the diffuser works best.</li>

            <li>I get so many compliments on how my hair looks and the smell is amazing!</li>
            <li>LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li>found Noodle Head Kick up Your Curls by accident on a sale and have a graveyard of hair products, so what&#x27;s one more?</li>
            <li>and I love the way it makes my curls</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve been using it for a while and am still in love with</li>
            <li>It seems more like a leave in conditioner than a styling product.  </li>
            <li>Love this product and it is a pain to find it when i want it.</li>
            <li>After reading such awesome reviews, I figured I would love this product as well.</li>
            <li>Best product for my curly hair, Light, natural looking but gets rid of all the frizz.</li>
            <li>make my hair hold curl better</li>
            <li>I have been able to reduce this problem by diluting the cream with water and mixing it well before application.</li>
            <li>Make sure to get it at Sally&#x27;s rather than ordering it here, it&#x27;s a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li>It works wonders--and may even be better (for my needs) than the Redken curl cream.</li>
            <li>The Garnier Fructis Curl Creme that I&#x27;ve used has worked much better than the Noodle Head product on my hair.</li>
            <li>so styling is easy.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, but a TON of it</li>
            <li>I use cheap Suave clarifying shampoo and Nexxus Humectress.</li>
            <li>I must say, I appreciate how light the cream is.</li>
            <li>It smells GREAT though; that&#x27;s the only benefit.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a replacement for the discontinued Redken Fresh Curls Curl Refiner, because the word on the internet is that their new curl line isn&#x27;t nearly as good.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and healthy without a leave in conditioner, I was looking for something to act more like  a mousse.  </li>
            <li>Works great to define curls Ruben your hair is wet.</li>
            <li>tried Paul Mitchell firmstyle Super Clean Sculpting Gel.</li>
            <li>But that stuff was like super glue.</li>
            <li>It also separates individual curls nicely.</li>
            <li>used Redken Fresh Curls, Curl Refiner until they obsoleted it.</li>
            <li>Sadly, I will continue my quest for the perfect hair product that works for me.</li>
            <li>i cant say enough how much i love this item.</li>
            <li>The Beyond he Zone cream prevents my hair from staying crunchy from the gel and really does kick up the curls!</li>
            <li>The Cream Style Conditioner or Soft Sculpting Gel or the Got2B Smooth Operator in my opinion, though you may want to try the Paul Mitchell Fast Form Cream Gel when wanting curling iron defined curls  </li>
            <li>My preferred straight look holds very well!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong, holds all day, but leaves hair soft and natural looking (not crispity-crunchety).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great product, highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Fast service.  </li>
            <li>This product didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li>Only drawback is that it is less effective in controlling the frizzies during very humid weather.</li>
            <li>At first I thought maybe I put too much in it, so the following day I used it again sparingly.</li>
            <li>This is a fine product for women who have thin or fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I expected nice loose curls</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>I never run a brush through my hair cuz the frizz and static electricity could bring down a major city&#x27;s power grid.</li>
            <li>It comes out in a very soft creamy texture.</li>
            <li>Buy a smaller size first to try it out.</li>
            <li>My hair looks exactly the same as it does when I don&#x27;t use a product at all.  </li>
            <li>I use this item in place of conditioner and the hair is soooo soft! .</li>
            <li>After that, I use 2 small pumps of this cream to add more curl, bounce, and softness before diffusing again.</li>
            <li>Leaves curls soft and flowing not hard like gel does.</li>
            <li>It has a light texture, and does not weigh down the hair, as gels can.  </li>
            <li>I have curly, thick, super frizzy damaged hair and this product is effective at keeping all the little frayed strands of hair in place to reduce the frizz.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft and styled without the crunch and stiffness.</li>
            <li>Luckily I purchased it for much less</li>
            <li>exactly what I expected after having tried at my salon</li>
            <li>I never dry my hair completely as the frizz just won&#x27;t be tamed</li>
            <li>Wide comb brush to even out as much as possible.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>The product was broken and all over envelope.not able to use had to throw in the trash.</li>
            <li>First, this is half the price if you buy it at Sally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> First, this is half the price if you buy it at Sally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it actually made my curls go flat.  </li>
            <li> The creamy texture gives me plenty of time to style my hair before it starts to firm up, also makes hair soft and flexible</li>
            <li> I use and love TIGI Curls Rock and was hoping for a less expensive alternative.  </li>
            <li> My hair is exceptionally frizzy and horrible in the high humidity.</li>
            <li> However, after putting in the product and watching it dry, I noticed that my hair had flakiness all over.</li>
            <li> Like the Redken cream, I use it after using gel and diffusing my hair until it&#x27;s almost dry.</li>
            <li> Towel dry</li>
            <li> Allow to air dry for an hour or two.</li>
            <li> Inevitably my hair is weighed down and gets greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not much hold</li>
            <li> Since I like straighter hair, I will thoroughly apply Noodle Head Kick-Up-Your-Curls in my hair, then use a wide comb brush to shape.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even use a wide comb or break apart the stiffness with my fingers and palms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have long blonde hair down past shoulder height.</li>
            <li> split end mender or &amp;#34;Redken Extreme anti-snap&amp;#34; throughout hair, not just ends.</li>
            <li> The only con is that it tends to leave a thick residue at my scalp.</li>
            <li> Works well to hold my curls and not weigh them down.</li>
            <li> so I save money, my hair doesn&#x27;t get weighed down, the process is shorter</li>
            <li> I find this uses a heck of a lot less product.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s naturally tight curly</li>
            <li> I finish this off with a little bit of humidity proof hairspray</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for a product to make my hair a little curlier at the ends.</li>
            <li> After looking around a few review sites and message boards to see what people were using as a replacement, I came across this product--</li>
            <li> I have slightly wavy/curly hair that has been straightening out over the past few years</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little crusty and hard.</li>
            <li> Just a small amount is needed, scrunch and go.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I had the same results and will not be using this product again.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair which is not easily managed.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s curly, frizzy and hard to control.</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly Italian/African hair and this creme</li>
            <li> My routine for washing my hair in the horrible countryside water softener shower every second or third day...</li>
            <li> notice some people are writing reviews for the wrong product.</li>
            <li> I fairly hate my hair.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Best stuff for curly hair!</li>
            <li> Noodlehead is the best product out there for curly or wavy hair.    Just a small amount is needed, scrunch and go.  My hair is wavy   and frizzy without it.   With it, I get so many compliments!    Couldn&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> very nice product.....I use it a lot for my permed hair</li>
            <li> Great leave in for wet/damp hair .  keeps curls/frizz under control.</li>
            <li> Works well to hold my curls and not weigh them down.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, but a TON of it that&#x27;s curly, frizzy and hard to control. I fairly hate my hair. I always put a product on that help the curls and then an anti-frizz product (in addition to all the in-shower stuff that&#x27;s supposed to help.) Inevitably my hair is weighed down and gets greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found Noodle Head Kick up Your Curls by accident on a sale and have a graveyard of hair products, so what&#x27;s one more? But hey, this stuff is amazing! It has the curl and anti-frizz in one product so I save money, my hair doesn&#x27;t get weighed down, the process is shorter and I love the way it makes my curls look!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve already gone through three bottles so I&#x27;ve been using it for a while and am still in love with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For reference: I don&#x27;t have ethnic hair but it&#x27;s naturally tight curly and I perm it about every four years to even the curls out. I never run a brush through my hair cuz the frizz and static electricity could bring down a major city&#x27;s power grid. I use cheap Suave clarifying shampoo and Nexxus Humectress. Then Noodle Head my way to happiness. I&#x27;ve used it with and without a diffuser on my blow dryer and while both are fine the diffuser works best. I never dry my hair completely as the frizz just won&#x27;t be tamed then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, highly recommend! The slogan &amp;#34;Tasty looks with saucy style&amp;#34; cracks me up.</li>
            <li> Fast service.  Excellent product.</li>
            <li> This stuff totally changed my opinion on my hair. I thought that my hair was unmanageable and a lost cause but this stuff was the key all along. I get so many compliments on how my hair looks and the smell is amazing! I get told I smell good all the time now! If you&#x27;re considering getting this stuff, get it!</li>
            <li> * I like this product, and it is great.  * It is comparable to the Paul Mitchell The Cream Style Conditioner or Soft Sculpting Gel or the Got2B Smooth Operator in my opinion, though you may want to try the Paul Mitchell Fast Form Cream Gel when wanting curling iron defined curls  * A great find for the price!</li>
            <li> exactly what I expected after having tried at my salon</li>
            <li> Works great to define curls Ruben your hair is wet.</li>
            <li> I expected nice loose curls but it actually made my curls go flat.  Buy a smaller size first to try it out.</li>
            <li> My hair looks exactly the same as it does when I don&#x27;t use a product at all.  Luckily I purchased it for much less $ locally (at Sally Beauty).  It seems more like a leave in conditioner than a styling product.  My hair is soft and healthy without a leave in conditioner, I was looking for something to act more like  a mousse.  I use and love TIGI Curls Rock and was hoping for a less expensive alternative.  Oh well, back to the TIGI.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Catwalk-Collection-Curlesque-Amplifier-Packaging/dp/B0007506U2/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1400811856&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;curls+rock</li>
            <li> LOVE this product! Leaves hair soft and styled without the crunch and stiffness. However, just bought the same product and size at Sally&#x27;s for $7.49.</li>
            <li> Like wearing nothing, in a great way! Leaves curls soft and flowing not hard like gel does. Last all day. Has changed my curly hair life</li>
            <li> Love this product and it is a pain to find it when i want it. Lighter than gel but works as well. Only problem is on hotter/humid days when it wont last all day.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! I have thick, curly Italian/African hair and this creme is the best &#x27;gel&#x27; product I&#x27;ve used yet. It&#x27;s strong, holds all day, but leaves hair soft and natural looking (not crispity-crunchety). The creamy texture gives me plenty of time to style my hair before it starts to firm up, also makes hair soft and flexible so styling is easy. I finish this off with a little bit of humidity proof hairspray and I&#x27;m good to go. Great price for the quality of product you&#x27;re getting, especially if you buy the 12oz insetad of the 6oz. Smells great too, like coconuts!</li>
            <li> So I have tried almost every curly hair product out on the market. After reading such awesome reviews, I figured I would love this product as well. I must say, I appreciate how light the cream is. However, after putting in the product and watching it dry, I noticed that my hair had flakiness all over. At first I thought maybe I put too much in it, so the following day I used it again sparingly. Unfortunately, I had the same results and will not be using this product again. Sadly, I will continue my quest for the perfect hair product that works for me.</li>
            <li> Best product for my curly hair, Light, natural looking but gets rid of all the frizz.</li>
            <li> love it works great on my hair happy with it make my hair hold curl better</li>
            <li> I have curly, thick, super frizzy damaged hair and this product is effective at keeping all the little frayed strands of hair in place to reduce the frizz. The only con is that it tends to leave a thick residue at my scalp. I have been able to reduce this problem by diluting the cream with water and mixing it well before application. Make sure to get it at Sally&#x27;s rather than ordering it here, it&#x27;s a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li> Took my thinning hair and gave it volume.  Won&#x27;t leave my home without it on my hair!</li>
            <li> Great item for the curly hair I have , it smells amazingly good like coconut .  I use this item in place of conditioner and the hair is soooo soft! . Not much hold so I have to use some styling mousse after . My hair has never been easier to brush</li>
            <li> This product is great for my curly hair and controls the curl without any stiffness or stickiness.  Also has a pleasant smell.  Only drawback is that it is less effective in controlling the frizzies during very humid weather.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair which is not easily managed.  This product makes my hair look and feel great.  It limits the frizz, streamlines my curls and goes on like butter.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my granddaughter, whose hair is ethnic. My daughter loves this product as it helps hold curls while moisturizing. Great product for ethnic hair.</li>
            <li> This is a fine product for women who have thin or fine hair.  It has a light texture, and does not weigh down the hair, as gels can.  It also separates individual curls nicely. I&#x27;ll purchase it again!</li>
            <li> The product was broken and all over envelope.not able to use had to throw in the trash.</li>
            <li> yes yes and yes! i cant say enough how much i love this item. Buy it, use it, and be happy :)</li>
            <li> I was looking for a replacement for the discontinued Redken Fresh Curls Curl Refiner, because the word on the internet is that their new curl line isn&#x27;t nearly as good. After looking around a few review sites and message boards to see what people were using as a replacement, I came across this product--And I&#x27;m glad I did! It works wonders--and may even be better (for my needs) than the Redken curl cream. Like the Redken cream, I use it after using gel and diffusing my hair until it&#x27;s almost dry. After that, I use 2 small pumps of this cream to add more curl, bounce, and softness before diffusing again. The Beyond he Zone cream prevents my hair from staying crunchy from the gel and really does kick up the curls! It also smells great--like coconut, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> First, this is half the price if you buy it at Sally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I notice some people are writing reviews for the wrong product. This is the &amp;#34;KICK UP YOUR CURLS&amp;#34; brand of Noodle Head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long blonde hair down past shoulder height. My hair is exceptionally frizzy and horrible in the high humidity. My routine for washing my hair in the horrible countryside water softener shower every second or third day...&lt;br /&gt;1. Redken Hair Cleansing Cream Shampoo&lt;br /&gt;2. Towel dry&lt;br /&gt;3. Rub through either &amp;#34;Bed Head Ego Boost&amp;#34; split end mender or &amp;#34;Redken Extreme anti-snap&amp;#34; throughout hair, not just ends. Sometimes I will spray in &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10 for Blondes&amp;#34;. Wide comb brush to even out as much as possible.&lt;br /&gt;4. Since I like straighter hair, I will thoroughly apply Noodle Head Kick-Up-Your-Curls in my hair, then use a wide comb brush to shape. Allow to air dry for an hour or two. It&#x27;s a little crusty and hard. Then I take my hands, clasp around my forehead, glide my hands along my hair to the ends. This softens the stiffness and brings out individual strands. My preferred straight look holds very well! I am impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried Paul Mitchell firmstyle Super Clean Sculpting Gel. But that stuff was like super glue. I couldn&#x27;t even use a wide comb or break apart the stiffness with my fingers and palms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used Redken Fresh Curls, Curl Refiner until they obsoleted it. I freaked out because it worked best. Someone online recommended this as a replacement. I find this uses a heck of a lot less product. It comes out in a very soft creamy texture.</li>
            <li> I have slightly wavy/curly hair that has been straightening out over the past few years (probably something to do with hormones) and I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for a product to make my hair a little curlier at the ends. This product didn&#x27;t do much. In fact, I feel like I made it even straighter! The Garnier Fructis Curl Creme that I&#x27;ve used has worked much better than the Noodle Head product on my hair. It smells GREAT though; that&#x27;s the only benefit.</li>
