            <li>Very good cleaning and exfoliating</li>
            <li>My skin has never looked so good!</li>
            <li>I loved it while it worked!</li>
            <li>I found this out after taking mine apart (since it died for good) and there&#x27;s water damage all over the place!  </li>
            <li>Good value!</li>
            <li>It is a beautiful, up-scale, looking unit.    </li>
            <li>It still works beautifully, and even tho</li>
            <li>what and awesome thing at a good price.</li>
            <li>Mine still works beautifully.  </li>
            <li>If you have beautiful skin you probably won&#x27;t even need make up.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it a good review because when it was working, it worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>I saw a lady in a restaurant and noticed how beautiful her skin was.</li>
            <li>Works great as a grinder.</li>
            <li>Great power, bristles and holds a charge for days.</li>
            <li>does a great job cleaning skin and keeping blemishes at bay.</li>
            <li>Great item.  </li>
            <li>This was great until it died soon after the time it could be returned.  </li>
            <li>Worked great for about a year.</li>
            <li>Still working great.</li>
            <li>anyone else experienced this problem with mold growing on it?</li>
            <li>and it has already done great things for my skin.</li>
            <li>It is an attractive looking unit and I keep it on my bathroom</li>
            <li>This product works really great.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for anyone with acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>And yes, it&#x27;s great for guys too.</li>
            <li>so I was happy when I found the Pretika.</li>
            <li>while it worked it was great</li>
            <li>I thought I would give this face brush a try since the reviews sounded great.  </li>
            <li>The compliments fly from everyone.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>Great price.</li>
            <li>If you place it in the cradle to charge after every use, you will greatly diminish the longevity of your brush.</li>
            <li>It works great.</li>
            <li>It worked great for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>If you want a sonic brush that doesn&#x27;t break the bank like the MIA this is a great alternative and two brush heads are included</li>
            <li>The product itself works great</li>
            <li>This brush is assume and i have to say am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>but for someone who doesn&#x27;t want to shell out a a lot of money for one brush then this would be a great replacement for that.</li>
            <li>and i have notice a great change in my skin.</li>
            <li>I have experienced none of these issues and I&#x27;ve had mine for months.  </li>
            <li>For the price I think this brush does a great job.</li>
            <li>Really happy with the results already.  </li>
            <li>Worked great while it worked.  </li>
            <li>Really happy with it, my skin feels great after each use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This worked great in the beginning.</li>
            <li>For the price this brush works great and just as well as the $200.00 version that I have used at the dermatologist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li>the brush, size and effect was great until then.</li>
            <li>Great product, but I tend toward a simpler routine.</li>
            <li>Great for cleaning and exfoliation.</li>
            <li>This product would be a great buy if it worked longer than 6 months.</li>
            <li>It does a great job</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>, Brush almost everynight.it workes great.</li>
            <li>this brush STILL works great....</li>
            <li>Pretika sells them for twenty bucks for a four pack which is a great value.is a great value.</li>
            <li>This works great, because when using it for lotion, it works the lotion into the skin.</li>
            <li>The brush works great otherwise and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>It was great while it lasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When it works, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>This is a great item when it works.</li>
            <li>It has stood up over time and given me great service.  </li>
            <li>The item worked great, while it worked.</li>
            <li>This worked really great for a while, about 8 months or so.</li>
            <li>It works great for the price it was.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>This product worked great for about 7 months.</li>

            <li>And i&#x27;m happy i did because i like it</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve read some great reviews.</li>
            <li>I used it both in the shower and at the sink, it worked great</li>
            <li>Great value, brush does rotate.  </li>
            <li>unlike Amazon they have a great return policy.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>A great gift for a teenager or anyone with skin problems.</li>
            <li>and it was great</li>
            <li>Happy with the purchase though, I just set it on</li>
            <li>It worked great for a week.</li>
            <li>But the vibration was doing a great job.</li>
            <li>Great for a week then stopped charging.</li>
            <li>cuz it&#x27;s great when it works.</li>
            <li>Love it!!....</li>
            <li>Fantastic !!!  </li>
            <li>This one does not hold the charge for more than three days!!  </li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re great, but I&#x27;m here to tell you the Pretika does an excellent job at a fraction of the cost.  </li>
            <li>excellent love it would recommend it to a friend</li>
            <li>Love love this brush, I even got my mom one! !!!!!!</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s a great sidekick to good hygiene.&lt;br</li>
            <li>this one was the most consistant and very fair pricing.</li>
            <li>My skin looks amazing, the wrinkles are greatly reduced, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li>but this seems good.</li>
            <li>It worked good when it worked  </li>
            <li>I bought this item about 3 months ago loved it</li>
            <li>From day one...I loved it.</li>
            <li>Product wise, it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>this is a good alternative.</li>
            <li>For a product I initially loved</li>
            <li>I got this product two years ago &amp; LOVED the way it cleaned &amp; how my skin looked.</li>
            <li>-this works just as good.</li>
            <li>It is a good product for the price.  </li>
            <li>Again, this brush is good bang for your buck...</li>
            <li>and I am good.</li>
            <li>Dont buy, the thing worked good when it ran, but it should be considered as a disposable product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>Good price, too.  </li>
            <li>I would have given this 5 stars because I loved it.</li>
            <li>I bought this because it had really good reviews.</li>
            <li>Its a shame because I really  loved it.</li>
            <li>This is a really, really good product.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t deny that it feels good.</li>
            <li>Pretika has good customer service.</li>
            <li>I used the Pretika at my daughter&#x27;s this summer and loved it.  </li>
            <li>Skin feels great after using and I can use it with my own cleansers.  </li>
            <li>I have been using my Pretika for a good two weeks</li>
            <li>Good thing</li>
            <li>I LOVED the way my skin felt after using it.</li>
            <li>it does a great job, nice size for the shower, even feels like it has substance and comes in a travel bag.</li>
            <li>This was a good purchase.</li>
            <li>I was thinking I would have to spend a lot of money to have a good one</li>
            <li>clock wise</li>
            <li>I used mine under 7 times --did a good job</li>
            <li>Good luck with yours if you choose to buy one.</li>
            <li>Loved it until that time.  </li>
            <li>I loved using this to wash my face.</li>
            <li>My foundation looks so good,</li>
            <li>Good product for the price point: $30</li>
            <li>Anyway, I knew I already had a good skin regimen.  </li>
            <li>This is a very good item, my skin feels so clean and looks great while using this.</li>
            <li>This product might cause more damage than good!  </li>
            <li>If someone gave me a Clarisonic, I&#x27;d be happy and delighted to use it, but I find that this machine does not lack in anything and is a much better expenditure of my money.  </li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with the choice and using amazon.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve tried many things for exfoliation and this seems to work great.</li>
            <li>Love this face cleaner, works great.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the product</li>
            <li>Hers was fantastic and her skin looked incredible after using it.</li>
            <li>Love this thing, works great.</li>
            <li>its ok it work great</li>
            <li>Soooo glad I found this great product.  </li>

            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!.</li>
            <li>but I am so glad I didn&#x27;t!</li>

            <li>and i just love it!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>and I love it!  </li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>Very happy with the fast and prompt service!</li>
            <li>Like it better than the clarasonic!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>LOVE this brush!</li>
            <li>You can dampen the brush head, but make sure the rest stays dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li>so good skin care is very important to keep her pimples from getting out of control.</li>
            <li>Amazing results.</li>
            <li>Her skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li>This is amazing.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say its AMAZING</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, not an amazing product</li>
            <li>My adolescent son, who notices nothing, even remarked how nice his sister&#x27;s skin looked.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;m very happy with this pretika, and i seriously am very picky and return almost everything i buy.</li>
            <li>and it feels nice on skin..</li>
            <li>and now I admit that this product is really effective in exfoliating and cleansing your skin.</li>
            <li>I liked it while it worked for all of 2 months.</li>
            <li>I honestly haven&#x27;t looked because I haven&#x27;t had the need to.  </li>
            <li>I figured if I liked the way it worked with my skin</li>
            <li>I just used it, on the 2nd setting, and I am VERY impressed, and VERY happy with how the brush felt on my skin, as well as how smooth my skin feels after just one use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did that, as well as taking the brush off the unit and have it drying on its own on a Kleenex.</li>
            <li>but honestly I haven&#x27;t found one that cost a &amp;#34;few&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Its nice that it recharges.  </li>
            <li>.....not an effective exfoliatior or cleansing device.</li>
            <li>It was, however, kind of scratchy.</li>
            <li>I cannot honestly tell you whether or not this product works because mine never worked.  </li>
            <li>Which is handy</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>The two speeds are a nice option.  </li>
            <li>I would love to be able to buy this product again if I am happy with it, and know what I am getting.</li>
            <li>I also liked the fact that it was rechargable.</li>
            <li>I liked the product alot</li>
            <li>really liked this brush when I had nothing to compare it to.  </li>
            <li>Although I didn&#x27;t use it as often as I would have liked to because it was a hassle to recharge once I moved it</li>
            <li>This is a really nice product.</li>
            <li>I use my own soap.</li>
            <li>Broke after a week, it wouldn&#x27;t start and then it would turn on its own.</li>
            <li>I liked the brush in the beginning.</li>
            <li>The model I own</li>
            <li>and it leaves my faces feeling very clean and rejuvenated!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a wonderful product, and the price is more than right.</li>
            <li>In addition, my original brush is still in great condition.</li>
            <li>easy for use and function is good.</li>
            <li>Skin is clear and awesome!</li>
            <li>As first I would have given this machine 5 stars because it cleaned my skin beautifully</li>
            <li>I have ordered this product three times because it was really good at cleaning my face and helping keep it blemish free.</li>
            <li>Both are more effective than using your fingers or a washcloth with your soap/facial cleansers for getting into the pores and removing dirt, oil, and makeup.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does a good job of exfoliating and is pleasant to use and gentle.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend you do not buy this item!</li>
            <li>This brush works beautifully and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>Now first off this is a great brush</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve felt the Clarisonic brush heads in stores and thought they were incredibly wimpy, even the normal and body brushes.</li>
            <li>The first one I purchased almost 4 years ago, was great.</li>
            <li>When I first bought the brush it was great for my skin</li>
            <li>The first time I charged the brush the recommended time it worked great.</li>
            <li>and it is still working just fine!</li>
            <li>Two very important things you need to know for your brush to last:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very cheap quality.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to get carried away as it feels SO good and leaves your face wonderfully smooth.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks wonderful and feels very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;M IN LOVE AND</li>
            <li>So make sure you get the battery pack that consists of 3x AAA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Replacement battery that I was able to acquire is rated 700mA, so it should take me approx</li>
            <li>I wanted to make sure I had no issues before I reviewed.</li>
            <li>Glad I bought it&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>This brush is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>Very happy that I made the decision to finally buy one.</li>
            <li>My skin feels better the nights I use it.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it more than 2-3 times a week.    </li>
            <li>seemed to be a bit too much for my skin, but it&#x27;s still working great.  </li>
            <li>Conversely, I have read reviews by people who have had Clairsonics which continued to function for many years.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s especially good with whiteheads, and the blackheads on my nose are smaller.  </li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>Love it, really LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>ok</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.    </li>
            <li>I love this thing.</li>
            <li>It does not spin, but vibrates on the skin, which I think is better for my skin anyways.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>am thinking of returning this item for a better quality</li>
            <li>Im happy that the package was delivered fast.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I recommend this to everyone suffering from acne :))</li>
            <li>Overall I was very happy with it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better then those that cost a hundred dollars.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>what more can you ask for?</li>
            <li>I love the,  pretika  sonic  brush.</li>
            <li>It really does a great  job.</li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>You should get one! :)</li>
            <li>, then im ok.</li>
            <li>I had read a lot of good reviews, but also some iffy ones--but for the price it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li>Just be sure to follow the instructions regarding the moisture issue.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin glow and is   nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll pay more for a brand that lasts.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure replacement heads could be found on Amazon.com as well.</li>
            <li>how many times I charged it.</li>
            <li>Too unreliable to put your money into, there are more reliable products out there for cheaper.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll make sure to keep moisture out of it.</li>
            <li>Skin feels smoother and seems to absorb the creams I put on my skin even better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for two week and love the way my skin feels and looks.</li>
            <li>I sincerely disencourage buying this product.</li>
            <li>product has not had any enhancement or upgrade for improving better operation over the past&lt;br /&gt;two years.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Disappointed for sure.</li>
            <li>; dollars more.</li>
            <li>For the price, I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Lets hope it lasts because i love it</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>it continues to work, then i will be satisfied.</li>
            <li>I love this brush.  </li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s rechargeable</li>
            <li>I ride horses and love DIYprojects</li>
            <li>My face looks and feels better every time I use it.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for years and just love the way it smooths and cleans my skin.</li>
            <li>or, spend more and get a better brush.</li>
            <li>I so enjoyed.</li>
            <li>As it turns out, my investments in the products I purchased from Amazon for my routine work even better.</li>
            <li>I have oily acne prone skin and long-term use of the Pretika would just cause more inflammation.</li>
            <li>would be better.</li>
            <li>Two weeks later my skin was FLAWLESS!!!  </li>
            <li>Love not having to change the batteries.</li>
            <li>and I was quite satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoyed my pretika for about 4 months</li>
            <li>I have had this for a couple of years, and really love it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE it</li>
            <li>It would be even better</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>My skin has a more even skin tone since using Pretika dermabrasion brush.</li>
            <li>Such great service!</li>
            <li>I bought one for myself when I got home and now find the battery does not hold a charge for more than two uses.  </li>
            <li>I spend most of my  time charging it .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I decided to try this for myself before giving one as a gift.</li>
            <li>Love that it holds a charge forever.</li>
            <li>If you want a product that lasts you six months at the most?...</li>
            <li>and I have to let you know that I love it.</li>
            <li>You used to be able to put the brush into the plastic stand and it would charge in the stand via metal prongs in the stand.  </li>
            <li>The method of charging is even better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought this item.  </li>
            <li>Love the brush side and the power.</li>
            <li>GLAD</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll bet anything you&#x27;ll love it and never be without one again.</li>
            <li>The Clairisonic is more water proof if you are going to use it in the shower</li>
            <li>Love the timer feature also.</li>
            <li>The price makes it an outstanding value.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>However, it can make the effort to better describe how it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The one it comes with is eh, okay.</li>
            <li>Yeah sure,</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love it, but after I ordered it I heard of one that is timed to each area on your face so you don&#x27;t over scrub.  </li>
            <li>The olay spin brush was more reliable than this</li>
            <li>I am however going to get a clarisonic, the reviews are so much better.</li>
            <li>I also make sure the rubber plug that covers the charging connection is fully engaged.  </li>
            <li>Since it has improved my appearance still got alot more to go</li>
            <li>I really want to give it no stars, if the product held up it would have been a great brush ,because I saw a difference in my skin, but like I said save your money because it looses it charge in about four months</li>
            <li>It feels even better after I apply a toner and my moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>It would be better to invest in a Clarisonic since it has softer bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think the vibrating one may work better than the one I have (</li>
            <li>Thanks again for a great product.</li>
            <li>Not all the way but still better than it was</li>
            <li>I also like how refreshing it is</li>
            <li>But when I got this, I found it to be better then</li>
            <li>I decided it was time to upgrade to a more dependable unit and bought</li>
            <li>If I didn&#x27;t have problems charging I probably would have been satisfied with just this brush, but now having felt the bristles on the Clarisonic</li>
            <li>Clarisonic feels like pampering and this brush feels more like an exfoliation/scrub.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I think it works best with a microdermabrasion scrub, but I also use it with my favorite facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I have no irritation and I&#x27;m so pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Overall, very happy with the way it cleans and gets all my makeup off.</li>
            <li>Great exfoliation and really helps closing pores as it helps my products penetrate my skin.</li>
            <li>then let the brush do its magic.</li>
            <li>but this was just ok,</li>
            <li>Clarisonic is much better...</li>
            <li>Manufacturer provided outstanding customer service and follow up.</li>
            <li>It may not have as many bells and whistles, but it does the job</li>
            <li>and I think you&#x27;ll be pleased.</li>
            <li>Washes your face better than using a cloth or your hands.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>This would be an okay backup cleaner to keep under the sink for emergencies,  but please keep in mind...</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>I have Rosacea that shows most by causing pimples on and around my nose.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m using the Olay spinning brush, and I like it better.</li>
            <li>It cleaned ok but now the softest brush.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin, so it&#x27;s great to have control of where and how intensely to apply pressure.  </li>
            <li>; IMO, that is what causes most failures.  </li>
            <li>I would like it much more if it were to have the pulsing vibrations instead of the rotating head.  </li>
            <li>I think a much better design could have been made.  </li>
            <li>So far so good!  </li>
            <li>Great product would highly recommend to use for renewing your skin.  </li>
            <li>Originally wanted the clarisonic, but the Pretika is a great alternative and very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>and I loved it for the first two months.</li>
            <li>I loved the first one</li>
            <li>When I first got it, it worked really good.</li>
            <li>This one is definitely worth it!!</li>
            <li>It works great and appears that it is a new unit.</li>
            <li>This product works well to smooth skin and give a gentle dermabrasion at a great price point.</li>
            <li>so I decided to tell my teen daughter about this incredible magic brush.</li>
            <li>Purchased this for my wife, she had a very old one that just gave up, this one works great</li>
            <li>My skin felt amazing the first time I used it!</li>
            <li>There is a very good reason this product only has a one-month warranty</li>
            <li>First time I used it my skin looked fresh and felt great.   </li>
            <li>/&gt;So far, this has been a great purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I enjoy what this product does for my skin, but do not trust that it&#x27;s lifespan will be more than 3 or 4 months.</li>
            <li>It is best to wet your face and put on the cleanser all over and then use the brush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a great product for its price if you dont have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable to use and even without the brush moving it does a better job washing my face</li>
            <li>in all this product helped me decide that this kind of brush would be beneficial to my skin care routine and why I was willing to shell out more money for the Clarisonic.  </li>
            <li>I bought this one for my teen grand daughter to keep her face beautiful.  </li>
            <li>Its good, but I really wanted something that made exfoliation easy and this does not do that.</li>
            <li>For $29 bucks this product is more than worth it!</li>
            <li>It has just the same bells and whistles as the $100-$200 ones and is just as good!</li>
            <li>If you have used a Sonicare toothbrush before, you will probably find the results very comparable: your skin feels fresh, clean and healthy and looks great.  </li>
            <li>&quot; but water can enter easily enter through it&#x27;s bottom charging hardware.</li>
            <li>this means possibility of electical shock or the product will be easily damaged.&lt;br /&gt;3.  </li>
            <li>Someone asked me what I am doing with my makeup because my face is so bright and vibrant looking.</li>
            <li>It gets 2 stars for easy set-up, ease of use and having the vibrating power of the clarisonic.    </li>
            <li>It is lightweight, easy to hold and has two speeds.</li>
            <li>I wanted to buy it from Walmart because I know that if I am unsatisfied with the product, I could easily go to any Walmart store and return it with in 90 days of purchase.</li>
            <li>Amazing it has just enough pressure, feels like your getting a good scrub.  </li>
            <li>Replacement brushes can be found easily as well.  </li>
            <li>your face is worth stepping up the quality...and by investing in a better quality product your face will have greater noticeable improvements.</li>
            <li>the power is strong also.</li>
            <li>2015 Update: Still going strong.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li>This facial brush worked beautifully for about 4 months - then the time between charges got shorter and shorter</li>
            <li>Since I could not find another rotating brush (according to reviews), and since I wasn&#x27;t ready to spend the money for a Clarisonic, my intention was to purchase the Pretika and the Nutrasonic, keep the one I liked best, and return the other one.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Replace the battery, follow the charging procedure on the &#x27;for NEW buyers&#x27; section and you should be good.  </li>
            <li>Fine lines on my forehead are smoothing out.</li>
            <li>it has worked fine for me with no rust or working problems...</li>
            <li>I thought fine</li>
            <li>Pretika does an excellent job for so much less than the Clairisonic.</li>
            <li>This one works just fine for me</li>
            <li>It did fine for about two weeks until it needed to be charged</li>
            <li>and my skin appeared fine.</li>
            <li>The Pretika worked fine.</li>
            <li>it worked fine for 1 month</li>
            <li>This little brush is just awesome!  </li>
            <li>I noticed a huge difference when i started using it.</li>
            <li>and I think that&#x27;s a huge plus.</li>
            <li>There were consecutive days that I forgot to use it, and my skin didn&#x27;t feel as smooth</li>
            <li>This is such a great alternative.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin, and this is amazing for cleansing if you moisturize afterwards.</li>
            <li>Sounds like a really cheap motor.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>i have a few friends who use it and their skin is flawless!</li>
            <li>This product was great for only about three months!  </li>
            <li>It filled up with water in the shower and has not worked since.</li>
            <li>really because I really liked the thing when it worked.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this product as it was as cheap as it is priced.</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re looking for a cheap Clarisonic</li>
            <li>Even though it was warranties the company wanted more $ to repair it or whatever than what it was worth.</li>
            <li>Great product for the entire week it was working.</li>
            <li>I tried a few others and like this one the best.</li>
            <li>This Pretika facial brush is great when it works.</li>
            <li>Great price especially when compared to the Clairsonic.</li>
            <li>Great facial brush!  </li>
            <li>This is a great facial tool.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feels so smooth after use.</li>
            <li>I think I will enjoy it.</li>
            <li>It made my skin feel smooth.</li>
            <li>This is a great facial brush.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>My skin is so smooth and glows..</li>
            <li>but this one is great and the battery last forever!</li>
            <li>Works great for my teen.</li>
            <li>My skin feels great after only a month of use.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t compare to Clarisonic, because I&#x27;ve never used it, but this one was cheap and has been helping me</li>
            <li>The facial brush WAS working great for about 4 months.</li>
            <li>The charger doesn&#x27;t fit the unit well while in the stand.</li>
            <li>Pretika SonicDermabrasion facial brush is a great product.</li>
            <li>I really liked it,worked really well.</li>
            <li>and the light will turn on indicating it has decided to charge again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My skin is as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom</li>
            <li>I purchased this facial brush about 2 years ago and it&#x27;s still working great.</li>
            <li>Works really well and is a cost effective alternative to the Clairsonic.</li>
            <li>my face is smooth..</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t come with a body brush, but that wasn&#x27;t important to me.</li>
            <li>It worked great as a facial scrub but within a month when I tried to recharge it, it wouldnt do anything.</li>
            <li>Important, this model (ST255) cannot charge while on the stand, the plug goes into the bottom of the unit and prevents it from being on the stand.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and keep charged.  </li>
            <li>After I use the Pretika Facial Brush, I use a gentle toner and my face feels wonderful.</li>
            <li>This really is the best facial brush out there if you aren&#x27;t looking to spend $100</li>
            <li>Good price - high quality - quick delivery</li>
            <li>Get&#x27;s my skin super clean!</li>
            <li>and I was looking for this for a long time, and it&#x27;s easy to use and charges great</li>
            <li>I do not like this product because I did not find it very useful.</li>
            <li>....Makes one.s skin feel fresh and squeaky clean and refreshing.</li>
            <li>It feels great and my face feels really clean after using any facial cleanser with it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After I use it my face feels very clean and fresh</li>
            <li>I was really excited about this product because it&#x27;s so cheap</li>
            <li>My face never felt so clean and smooth until I used the pretika brush.  </li>
            <li>My skin felt so smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>It makes my face feel so refreshed, smooth, and clean.</li>
            <li>so smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>I thought this was a pretty good deal, being so much cheaper than the clarisonic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m enjoying it very much.</li>
            <li>I originally gave this brush four stars, but have since downgraded my review to two stars since it stopped working after seven months.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just downgraded my original five-star review to three stars.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>I WAS SOOOO EXCITED WHEN IT ARRIVED ON TIME.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the investment!</li>
            <li>It is water friendly and gets the job done...</li>
            <li>My acne scars have significantly faded away faster than before.</li>
            <li>I have had this over a year, still on the original charge when I received it and charged it up.</li>
            <li>it was so excited the adapter was not there</li>
            <li>I was originally wanting to get the clarisonic, but it just seemed like a lot of money to spend.</li>
            <li>Why would u make a stand and not make it accessible?</li>
            <li>Its well worth buying !</li>
            <li>This product stopped working within the first 30 days of use and I was able to return it and receive a credit.  </li>
            <li>However, I had a Pretika in the past that was wonderful and</li>
            <li>Keeps me lookin fresh!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to use this product once I got this.</li>
            <li>I had Homedics that was replaces 3 times and it was a great idea but just never worked very long..</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin really clean and evens out the pores.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling smooth and the appearance has really gotten better.</li>
            <li>Since using the Pretika, however, the cotton pad has been completely clean -- with no makeup residue!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Skin super clean, smooth.   </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Now while this isn&#x27;t the product that I ordered... It does clean well..</li>
            <li>&gt; Clean the brush</li>
            <li>I find that I can clean my face well without the use of this brush.</li>
            <li>but nothing has gotten my face as clean as this brush.</li>
            <li>So I just clean mine in the dishwasher.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, it&#x27;s still working very well after more than a year.  </li>
            <li>Awesome, no problems and with the proper face wash will really clear up your face.</li>
            <li>Both get the job done, but if you have more sensitive skin another brush may be better for you.  </li>
            <li>I keep it in the shower and use it to clean my face with body gel.  </li>
            <li>Now after about three weeks of use I am having many positive comments from people who don&#x27;t even know I am using something.</li>
            <li>When i brought it in December I was excited love it clean face really well and inexpensive now in June</li>
            <li>special  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as good as a Clarisonic, and doesn&#x27;t have brush head choices, but it still leaves your face extra clean, well-exfoliated and softer and it&#x27;s a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>It is more like a brush rotating at a very high speed.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m really happy with the small improvements I was able to get on my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had to change my rating.</li>
            <li>WHEN IT DOES SUCH A GOOD JOB.</li>
            <li>Hence, full charge should be attained within 1 hour.  </li>
            <li>a full charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it with St Ives apricot scrub and aluminum oxide crystals for a true micro demabrasion treatment.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I enjoy using the machine,  My face feels tingly and fresh.  </li>
            <li>I have only used this item for about one month, but I see really good results already.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true the brush was harsher, but my skin became used to it</li>
            <li>and now it won&#x27;t stay on for the full one minute.</li>
            <li>I loved this brush, but it died the second week I had it.</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t need the full 18 hours or whatever it says.</li>
            <li>/&gt;IMO, Fork out the extra $$ for the good version.</li>
            <li>Love it so much I bought another.</li>
            <li>It is deep cleansing, exfoliating, and good for spore also.</li>
            <li>I hear the Olay brush is good and is similarly priced but rotates instead of pulses.</li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised at how nice my face feels after.  </li>
            <li>The same is true for this Pretika, and I&#x27;ve found that it does a really good job of cleansing.  </li>
            <li>I really, really wanted a rotating brush, but after using the Olay product, I was less than impressed.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for over 3 weeks on the first charge, and it&#x27;s still going strong.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powerful and my skin feels extremely clean after use.</li>
            <li>I did not expect to see anything that quickly.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Although many people think that the the Clarisonic is an exfoliator, it does NOT exfoliate; instead, it deep cleans your skin so that your skin care and anti-aging products can better penetrate the epidermis.  </li>
            <li>This company really went the extra distance to insure a happy customer experience.  </li>
            <li>my forehead would be super shiny.</li>
            <li>but if you want it to last you are better off spending more money for the clarisonic which has a 2 year warranty and truly is water proof.</li>
            <li>Luckily; I bought this from B&amp;B, so I returned it with digust.</li>
            <li>So I quickly emailed Pretika&#x27;s customer service about this and asked them what happened to my brush.</li>
            <li>A lot of people said their battery burned out quickly;</li>
            <li>My skin is now smooth and much more clear.</li>
            <li>Luckily it comes with 2.</li>
            <li>I was instantly excited to use it right away.</li>
            <li>I could not recommend this more highly.</li>
            <li>When I first tried the Pretika facial brush I loved it so much I bought 3 more for my family.</li>
            <li>The price is right, when it works it does a good job, but if you want a facebrush that&#x27;s disposable go to your local drugstore.&lt;br</li>
            <li>No complaint at all :-)</li>
            <li>I use Burt&#x27;s Bees Rosemary and Peppermint bar soap with my Pretika, and I get a nice exfoliation and deep clean.</li>
            <li>I am glad I purchased this very reasonably priced and capable alternative.</li>
            <li>:  make sure you also move the foam strip stuck on the defective battery to the new one.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have wrinkles yet, but I am sure it would help bring out fresher new skin.  </li>
            <li>I got the new one and am so pleased.  </li>
            <li>I was bummed and considered buying a new one however the more</li>
            <li>And now after using it for months, Im happy that it helped my skin becomes smoother, less acne breakouts</li>
            <li>Other than that I guess it would clean your face good.</li>
            <li>Absolute garbage!!</li>
            <li>It comes with a little stand which is great but</li>
            <li>I have never had more people comment on how glowy and bright my skin has looked lately.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too harsh and it feels really great on my skin.</li>
            <li>Amazing reduction of acne and cysts back there too!  </li>
            <li>love this so far....</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;m using it more and more, I&#x27;m wondering if it is too rough for my skin to be using it every day.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I have to say I rarely write a review but feel the need here.  </li>
            <li>Whatever you choose Have Fun...</li>
            <li>The money was by no means worth the use for just one year.</li>
            <li>It also came with an extra brush, which I thought was a nice touch.</li>
            <li>Push it two times and it goes to a lighter force/pressure/function for more sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Worked great initially, but just completely died 8 months after purchase.</li>
            <li>this is honestly worth the price.</li>
            <li>I still have had no problems with it at all, so well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>While being recharged, the appropriate lights are on, but when you try to use it, the moving device is completely motionless.</li>
            <li>Its Much more soft and my makeup glides on.</li>
            <li>It is worth the money.</li>
            <li>with extra brush which is nice</li>
            <li>I got this brush thinking it would have a rotating head, but I guess I didn&#x27;t read the description correctly because it is simply the vibrating kind.  </li>
            <li>Larger brush than most, bristles are soft, yet effective.  </li>
            <li>And washing my face is actually fun for me.</li>
            <li>And the brush isn&#x27;t as powerful in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>For the money I would say the Pretika wins.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>The brush itself is really good, it has enough power to do a thorough cleaning but not so much that it hurts my skin</li>
            <li>I love the slower speed as I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and I thought this was worth the money.</li>
            <li>Simple and effective.</li>
            <li>So worth the money...</li>
            <li>Ergonomic and powerful.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have time to do the product review and can&#x27;t return or have it fixed any more.</li>
            <li>So that was exciting, but the charging issue was still there.</li>
            <li>The pad does not seem to abrasive and it is a sturdier brush than the Olay facial spinning brush, which I also own.  </li>
            <li>I stopped wearing makeup which was very hard to do because of my self esteem, used it twice a day faithfully sometimes 3 times a day, used cheap astringent, and a good moisturizer!</li>
            <li>I love it so far, as the brush heads are a good texture (not like the super-soft brushes other products have included).  </li>
            <li>So there are fewer breakouts if that area is kept very clean and free from facial oils.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t fathom paying more than $60 for something like this, so overall, I am very satisfied with the Pretika Sonic Dermabrasion Facial</li>
            <li>Another good thing about this brush is that you can recharge it unlike some other clarisonic alternatives like Olay&#x27;s brush which requires batteries.</li>
            <li>This product wouldn&#x27;t take a charge right out of the box.</li>
            <li>i use it once a day on the lowest setting and its the right amount for my skin.</li>
            <li>RIGHT AWAY,,,AND</li>
            <li>and I noticed a difference right away.</li>
            <li>Since the word &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; is right there in the name, and it advertises &amp;#34;Micro-Pulsating Vibration Cleansing&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Now the cord plugs right into the bottom of the brush.  </li>
            <li>Because I use mine twice a day, I purchased a set of the replacement brushes right away.</li>
            <li>Found the right cleanser for me but still had some flakes.</li>
            <li>Also, you notice the difference in your skin right away.</li>
            <li>Broke right away and the company wouldn&#x27;t replace it for me.</li>
            <li>I purchased one brush for myself as an alternative of the clarisonic and it worked great for the first few weeks.  </li>
            <li>Really made a difference in how clean I can get my face.</li>
            <li>I asked her what did she do to keep her skin looking so smooth and vibrant.</li>
            <li>The brush is smooth even on high speed.  </li>
            <li>, I dry it after each use, I don&#x27;t leave it in the charger unless I am charging it, and I LOVE it!  </li>
            <li>While I&#x27;m happy to have had the opportunity to try it out before investing in the more expensive Clairsonic, I don&#x27;t believe the cost is worth a short-term trial.</li>
            <li>Because the first one worked as described &amp;#34;Featuring Micro-Pulsating Vibration Cleansing Technology&amp;#34; and so much cheaper than the Clarisonic brand, I was excited to purchase a replacement.</li>
            <li>this is a great little exfoliating brush at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Hope they will send me a new one and it is fabulous.</li>
            <li>I bought the Pretika spin brush for the good price and because as a black man, my facial skin can easily break out from ingrown hairs if I don&#x27;t clean thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Found the Pretika Sonic Dermabrasion Facial Brush on Amazon at a great price &amp; after using just once my skin truly was different!</li>
            <li>The Pretika facial brush is a high-tech replacement for the good old flannel and bar of soap.</li>
            <li>Also, it appears that several reviewers have experienced problems likely caused by moisture in the cradle.</li>
            <li>This is a gentle but effective way to deeply cleanse and exfoliate.  </li>
            <li>Seems clean well without the high sticker price.</li>
            <li>Got this \\&quot;very fast from Amazon\\</li>
            <li>It arrived very fast without any problems.</li>
            <li>What a difference this brush has made on my complexion and at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Such a bummer, since it scrubbed my skin very smooth.  </li>
            <li>This was very much appreciated.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brush does not spin - it vibrates, so it&#x27;s very gentle</li>
            <li>90 days , but were very nice, replaced it, but now, 100 days later, it stopped working, &amp; now is turning itself on in the middle of the night!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to use my new pretika.  </li>
            <li>My skin felt soft and clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>The good news is that it&#x27;s very easy to avoid these problems: just dry the brush with a towel after use and store it in a dry place, and make sure you never set it into its cradle if it&#x27;s wet.    </li>
            <li>At the same time that I started using this, I also started using Skin Laboratory&#x27;s Lactic 35% &amp; Glycolic 25% Combo Gel Peel, and the two products have made a huge difference in my skin!  </li>
            <li>My wife bought this product over competition that is more than double the price.  </li>
            <li>As most reviewers already posted, it does a terrific job doing its intended purpose.  </li>
            <li>As for the charge, I charged mine fully the first day.</li>
            <li>I really like this brush because the bristles aren&#x27;t wimpy!</li>
            <li>The first day she used it, there was a noticeable difference.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Smooth and soft like never before, except maybe when I was a baby.</li>
            <li>I wanted to buy the Clarsonic, but I wasn&#x27;t willing to fork up the money for it.</li>
            <li>and it is still running on the first charge.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had to charge it at all since I first bought it.  </li>
            <li>The blackheads that I&#x27;ve always had on my nose are gone for the first time ever, and my skin looks radiant and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would have given this product 5 stars except for the fact that the contact metal parts in the recharger rusted on the first day</li>
            <li>Based on my experience I went back and re-read reviews, and realized that most of the glowing reviews are based on using the brush for a couple of days up to a month.</li>
            <li>Find it effective - although the brush is too rough.  </li>
            <li>This has been wonderful for my acne and the overall appearance of my skin, NO more acne...</li>
            <li>I have no idea the exact date I bought this</li>
            <li>got mine, charged it &amp; used for 1 whole week!  </li>
            <li>I use glytone skin care products, and the brush definitely helps my skin better absorb them.</li>
            <li>I even go a step further, and place a plastic ziploc bag over the charging cradle while i wash my face, to make sure i dont splash water on it.</li>
            <li>I recently bought 3 more for presents.</li>
            <li>It comes with two brushes and I am still on the first brush.</li>
            <li>This will only make your skin peel even more because it&#x27;s tearing at it rather than just polishing it.</li>
            <li>I have the Olay one now, and it does so much better and actually works.</li>
            <li>The entire inside was corroded, but the light was still blinking!  </li>
            <li>The first time it stopped working within 2 or 3 months.</li>
            <li>I used the first one for about 6 months before I dropped it and broke it.</li>
            <li>I really, really (really) wanted a Clarisonic!</li>
            <li>i simply love this facial brush!!</li>
            <li>I seem to be a bit more red and ruddy now, but just slightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first time it just stopped charging correctly and I had to throw it away.</li>
            <li>But instead of getting an inexpensive SONIC brush I received a pretty fancy ROTATING brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pretty confident it will last.  </li>
            <li>first brush (identical at first glance) vibrated and did not rotate.  </li>
            <li>It looks like I have used it for quite some time, not just for the first time.</li>
            <li>It still charges up, it still holds a charge, and the bristles hold pretty well still</li>
            <li>&gt; Charge it for atleast 1 hour the first time</li>
            <li>The first one lasted 60 days before it stopped working.</li>
            <li>Since using for about 3 weeks now, my skin feels so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Love the way my skin feels after I use the facial brush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Follow the rules for the first charge.</li>
            <li>I top it all off with skin cream with 30 SPF for day, and a wrinkle reducing moisturizer such as ROC at night.    </li>
            <li>Tonight, I used the Pretika for the first time</li>
            <li>Returning it, and going to order a Clarisonic, which I should have done in the first place.</li>
            <li>My wife used this for 10 months without a problem, then she said she had just used it in the shower for the first time.</li>
            <li>my first facial Brush is Pretica.purchased about more then a year</li>
            <li>I used it the first day that I received it.</li>
            <li>They could make this face brush better by improving the charging system, so that it can be used and left in the shower.</li>
            <li>MY skin feels so soft and smooth after using with a grainy scrub.</li>
            <li>I love the product while it worked especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I first received this brush</li>
            <li>The first one I purchasrd worked well 2 yrs ago, when it died</li>
            <li>I love this brush, it is sorta big brush but works well.</li>
            <li>I wish there were more options on the actual brush heads the way clarisonic does.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently looking for a a more reliable brush.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe when I receive the first of 2 of these....</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this facial brush.  </li>
            <li>do not recommend this product for people with sensitive skin or people who have acne filled with pus.  </li>
            <li>the first one I had.</li>
            <li>The first 2 weeks I had it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned this brush for about four years but during the first year the charging problem began.  </li>
            <li>but its movement is more noticeable to the naked eye</li>
            <li>Her face was smooth, clear, and glowing.  </li>
            <li>When you first get it, you MUST allow the brush to charge fully for 24 hours</li>
            <li>I love this facial brush!</li>
            <li>Within the first 3 months three out of four units stopped working.</li>
            <li>First one died after three weeks of use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d love to tell you that it made a difference, but it hasn&#x27;t - perhaps I need to try a different cleanser?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just remember to charge it once a week (on a dresser higher than your dog can reach)</li>
            <li>Within a week, my face cleared up immensely and I was able to wear makeup again.</li>
            <li>If you need more cleaning, just turn it back on.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and will definitely buy another one, when this one needs replacing.</li>
            <li>But I found that it would charge again, but not stay charged consistently.</li>
            <li>But still no guarantee it&#x27;ll work consistently.</li>
            <li>(unfortunately I do not have the model number) charges from the stand, which makes sense.</li>
            <li>I tried it, and the spinning, although I&#x27;m sure it deep cleans, it much harsher and pulls my skin to the right.  </li>
            <li>It broke within a month despite the fact that I took great care to keep it as dry as possible.</li>
            <li>Instead, I make sure my skin is wet and soapy, then I use my Pretika like a super scrubby washcloth.  </li>
            <li>I have breakouts on my 38 year old skin, as well as hyperpigmentation, and I am happy to say my breakouts, which seem to be bumps (build up of dead skin) under the skin are almost gone, and the hyperpigmentation is getting better with each daily use.  </li>
            <li>Right out of the box, this facial brush was easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I have kept the same one very clean since the start</li>
            <li>I considered the popular &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; brand but decided to try this brand due to the rave reviews.</li>
            <li>AFTER JUST ONE USE MY SKIN FELT SMOOTHER, CLEANER, AND ACTUALLY HAD A FRESH GLOW!!</li>
            <li>seriously why pay $200 when this one works great</li>
            <li>When it worked, my skin was soft and clean and I saw a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li>The brush is soft and my face feels clean after using it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely loved the Pretika Facial Brush and used it religiously until it stopped working around 2 months after I purchased it...</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s what I love: The Pretika facial brush really scrubs away all makeup.</li>
            <li>I like to use this not only on facial but good on the feet also  </li>
            <li>, it does not hold a full charge and has not helped a full charge since I got it even after following all the directions!</li>
            <li>They work very well, and are very reasonable.</li>
            <li>It seems like it has smoothed fine lines, cleans deep, shrinks pores and leaves my face soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Why pay over a $100.00 more for another brand unit unless you just like spending more of your money so you can name drop, if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li>With these positive reviews, I decided to get 1.</li>
            <li>stand is just pretty much just to store it.</li>
            <li>I have been a customer of Amazon for a long time and have bought many items</li>
            <li>I was interested in the clairsonic microdermabrasion brush but couldn&#x27;t justify paying that much to try a product.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t trust this being kept in a shower or even in a really steamy bathroom, but that&#x27;s based off other reviews and not my own experience.</li>
            <li>Maybe if replaced I can write a more long term review.</li>
            <li>This is just as good, if not better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it is 100% as good as a Clarisonic since I&#x27;ve never used one before</li>
            <li>I turned it on, right out of the box, and got excited because it seemed to have the same power as the clarisonic.</li>
            <li>Only good thing is that it was cheap, so I didn&#x27;t waste too much money.</li>
            <li>&quot; a few days ago, and so far I am just loving it!  </li>
            <li>than I make for sure that the metal is completely dry before charging again.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m less than thrilled with this brush.</li>
            <li>When it needs to be recharged I will make sure it is completely dry before putting it on the power stand.</li>
            <li>I was very satisfied with this facial scrubber until it stopped working after only 2 months!</li>
            <li>only thing it take s time to get use to the brush as it move very quickly</li>
            <li>recharge it is easy and last along time  </li>
            <li>It is super loud.</li>
            <li>It has a pretty crappy rubber cover for the hole where you charge it, and even though i made a point to make sure it was closed before each use, i still had to drain out rusty water each night.</li>
            <li>Followed all instructions and even made sure it was completely dry before charging as some reviews suggested.  </li>
            <li>So taking good care of it will definitely benefit you in the long run.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t pulse it just spins strongly and has two different settings.</li>
            <li>All and all this product is a good product, But beware you only have a 30day  limited warranty and anything</li>
            <li>The second time it was working fine until it just stopped turning on no matter</li>
            <li>It seemed to have pretty decent  reviews, so I got it for my daughter for Christmas.</li>
            <li>I just wish it was a little more powerful.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve dropped it in the shower really hard a good couple of times</li>
            <li>IT REALLY FEELS LIKE</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t precisely say if this is the link above is the correct one.  </li>
            <li>This is a fantastic facial brush.</li>
            <li>It is much cheaper than the Clarisonic.  </li>
            <li>I recommend it highly!</li>
            <li>and my face stays moisturized for much longer than ever before.</li>
            <li>Pretika&#x27;s customer service was very helpful answering my questions.</li>
            <li>really well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That being said, I really don&#x27;t know how much longer this brush will last.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE ON 12/26/10:  I just received a Clarisonic Mia for Christmas, and the difference between the Clarisonic and the Pretika brush are very noticeable.  </li>
            <li>The Clarisonic brush is *much* softer, and the sonic vibrations are much stronger.  </li>
            <li>For just over twice the cost of this brush, you can have a much nicer</li>
            <li>one.over twice the cost of this brush, you can have a much nicer one.</li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t really get any microdermabrasion happening until I add baking soda.</li>
            <li>Morning I use the gentle setting and just the soap.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin with a very oily forehead.</li>
            <li>I also get very flaky around my chin and nose</li>
            <li>- I don&#x27;t think the manufacturers expect it to work much longer than that.     </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it every night for two weeks, and there is zero makeup residue when I use toner (gentle toner</li>
            <li>before this my forehead and tzone were very oily.</li>
            <li>but i see a real improvement in my skin.     </li>
            <li>, my face is so much cleaner</li>
            <li>She really likes it.</li>
            <li>My skin,its smooth and my pores are smaller...</li>
            <li>I cant really afford to buy a Clairsonic</li>
            <li>I wish I had thought of returning it while I still could but too much time has passed...</li>
            <li>I wish I could find Pretika MD170 for a reasonable price,</li>
            <li>the scrubber I used before this one, but it looks like they discontinued it and now want to charge way to much for it.</li>
            <li>I really like the brush.</li>
            <li>I am now using the product on the gentle setting twice a day</li>
            <li>and it really works for me.</li>
            <li>My face is much cleaner using this product then from washing with cleanser alone.</li>
            <li>but this product works well for me at a much lower price.</li>
            <li>I was very dissapointed.</li>
            <li>Thanks 😃</li>
            <li>You really cannot beat the price.  </li>
            <li>I cant afford much</li>
            <li>So the only alternative I have to that is just a light touch to your skin.</li>
            <li>I have had this about 8 months, does very well for me.</li>
            <li>It really made a difference.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all guesswork because they don&#x27;t really tell you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Debi</li>
            <li>I like the fast speed&lt;br</li>
            <li>so can&#x27;t really say how it works.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got really oily skin, so oily in fact that come afternoon</li>
            <li>maybe I&#x27;d get a real Clarisonic when it died.</li>
            <li>but I really wished it pulsed too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read several reviews on this brush that recommend spending a few dollars more to get a better one</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>Instead of a mechanism much like any rechargeable tooth brush the brush unit have to be connected much like a mobile phone or portable boombox.  </li>
            <li>It makes your face feel very refreshed after each use.</li>
            <li>I like this product so much.</li>
            <li>I like the way it worked so much</li>
            <li>The Pretika worked very well in the beginning</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!      </li>
            <li>I have used the clairsonic, and did not like it as much as the pretika.</li>
            <li>plugged in so it is always ready for use.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that if I insist too much, I over exfoliate, and it leads to irritation.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but you can really feel the difference.  </li>
            <li>Just let it ride gently around your face - don&#x27;t pull at your skin.  </li>
            <li>It feels &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; but not in a drying way, it all really depends on your skin type.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never experienced GREAT customer service like this before.</li>
            <li>I have really began to concentrate on skin care.</li>
            <li>so I won&#x27;t buy again unless it was much cheaper, like $10 I would buy again</li>
            <li>Really efficient face brush cleaner.</li>
            <li>So I have to say for the price it works really well.</li>
            <li>Worked better than expected.</li>
            <li>I charge it fully, hit the button and nothing happens, just a blinking red light.</li>
            <li>Oh, BTW, shipping was very prompt, too.</li>
            <li>However, when it rotates, it feels too much for my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After using the Pretika every night, my face feels soooo much smoother and cleaner.  </li>
            <li>and i noticed my skin was really improving.</li>
            <li>I swear, this thing is either really crappy or possessed.</li>
            <li>i need to refund her money and buy her the real thing..</li>
            <li>Really like it wish it has a pumice stone brush thing.</li>
            <li>didnt make  much difference to my skin</li>
            <li>I tried everything and nothing worked very well</li>
            <li>Brush heads are also very inexpensive, compared to the Clarisonic.  </li>
            <li>Then apply a gentle cleanser made for daily exfoliation all over face (avoiding eye area), wet brush (a good quality rechargeable brush) gently allow the brush to do</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very concerned about my looks</li>
            <li>It really cleans my face.</li>
            <li>Love this so far, will update later as to the product quality!</li>
            <li>last week someone asked me if i was wearing make up because my skin was so clear : )</li>
            <li>It did however work nice for the few days before it tanked out on me.</li>
            <li>so i am not going to waste that kind of money</li>
            <li>When I use mine, the contacts don&#x27;t really get wet, but just in case, I wipe it with a cloth to be sure.</li>
            <li>Like most of the others, I had a professional facial</li>
            <li>I am still on the first brush and it looks brand new...</li>
            <li>Please be aware to purchase a adaptor plug if you live in the UK though.</li>
            <li>After each use, one for cleansing and one for lotion, I rinse the brushes under hot water, and they are still like new.</li>
            <li>My skin care products are more readily asorbed into the skin because of the stimulation and cleansing of my face due to this product.</li>
            <li>I use Clean and Clear Foaming Cleanser for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>The result is extremely clean skin, no irritation, and a much brighter facial tone.  </li>
            <li>This is quite different from those of you who are familiar with rechargeable</li>
            <li>My husband told me the other day that my skin looked fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I had dropped it many other times with no effect</li>
            <li>Whether the battery is drained or full I still get a green light.  </li>
            <li>*not* reduce wrinkles, but will rather just deep clean your skin.)&lt;br</li>
            <li>I liked it, it seemed to work well, but didn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used a Clairsonic, because I&#x27;m cheap, but after reading lots of reviews I&#x27;ve found the Pretika is compared favourably, with the exception that the bristles are a little harder, so not as good for sensitive skin.    </li>
            <li>It also would spontaneously start in the middle of the night, and was loud enough to wake up the whole house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dont</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this as a much cheaper alternative to the clarisonic, which I wanted but couldn&#x27;t bring myself to spend the money on.</li>
            <li>you the first time buyer,lets say you have found the right Facial Brush Pretica.go for it.&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li>You could get an expensive facial brush or you can get this one at a great price and it is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It is actually really easy to use, but, as others have said, not in the shower; must be kept dry inside!  </li>
            <li>Even though it worked well and made my skin ok, it&#x27;s not worth it</li>
            <li>Love this brush...had an expensive Clarisonic, but this brush works so much better and is much lighter.</li>
            <li>(My first brush was 2 years old when I broke it....</li>
            <li>One full charge last you 45 one minute washes.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean...just pop the brush head off, wash it with mild soap....let it completely dry and then pop it back on.</li>
            <li>Be sure to read the other reviews; I wish I had before purchasing!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great with the timer, so it&#x27;s not too long or to short cleaning in order not to worry about the skin gets dry with overdo.</li>
            <li>Who do I have to call or email to return this or to exchange for a new one?!</li>
            <li>The new design is defective!</li>
            <li>This one is crazy amazing, the brush head now spins!!</li>
            <li>I liked the product for a couple of months, although my skin never felt as clean as other more expensive brands (which I now use).</li>
            <li>I missed it so much, I bought a new one.</li>
            <li>I soak it in a dixie cup of water occasionally and all of the product that hasn&#x27;t rinsed off will float off and it&#x27;s clean as new.</li>
            <li>The only way to get the unit working is to plug in the charger (pretika side), unplug it and quickly turn on the device.  </li>
            <li>Love it, but this is the third time I buy this item, and stops working after a month of daily use.</li>
            <li>Initially I was pleased that I saved money on the Pretika SonicDermabrashion Facial Brush until it wound up in the trash can.  </li>
            <li>This should be a no brainer, but I read the reviews and well, I felt the need to chime in on this particular issue.</li>
            <li>What I do not like is the machine is WHITE (that&#x27;s OK) but the plug and cord are BACK.  </li>
            <li>It made my skin super dehydrated and coarse because it over exfoliated.  </li>
            <li>So this is probably a better option than the Olay brush or similar ones you see in the facial care aisle in the department</li>
            <li>Love this facial brush - actually</li>
            <li>The unit gradually stopped vibrating effectively, and after a few months, it completely stopped rotating.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely going to buy something similar from a more trustworthy brand.</li>
            <li>your face and neck feels vibrant.  </li>
            <li>It has smoothed out some older bumps, but doesn&#x27;t make them disappear.....</li>
            <li>Also, another way to ensure the charging contacts don&#x27;t rust would be to keep it out of the bathroom, particularly if you use the base/holder because condensation would collect in the holder and the metal would rust.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace an older unit that stopped working.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this particular one for over a year now</li>
            <li>I mainly bought this to use as part of my night time regimen.  </li>
            <li>Love using this with my facial cleanser, it feels so good.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend use on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m  suppose to be able to use it in the shower it should be somewhat more difficult to brake</li>
            <li>Luckily, I scraped off the rust and it came back to life.</li>
            <li>It does a decent job of removing makeup/</li>
            <li>well, not too strong or rough on skin while rotating.</li>
            <li>Really gets deep down and cleans my pores and leaves skin feeling clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li>highly recommended.</li>
            <li>so started to charge it when it started emitting this high pitched whine.</li>
            <li>the machine is designed to turn off automatically on the high setting after your treatment is up.     </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I rates this high at the beginning,  not</li>
            <li>but my friend says it&#x27;s comparable without the high price tag.</li>
            <li>I always use the high.</li>
            <li>Bristles are super soft, exfoliates very well, holds facial cleanser</li>
            <li>This does what you think it will but just a little bit better.  </li>
            <li>Had I researched it a little better rather than going off the advice from my derm.</li>
            <li>There are many features that I appreciate about this little machine.  </li>
            <li>My advice is not to bother with the pretika, just wait and save a little more for the clarisonic.</li>
            <li>There is a gentle mode for every day cleaning AND an exfoliating mode, which works excellent to remove dead skin and tough dirt.  </li>
            <li>It does clean my face, and battery life is very long.</li>
            <li>The unit that I got always show a &#x27;green&#x27; light during charging and never showed the &#x27;red&#x27; blinking light.</li>
            <li>So far, I am really amazed with this product</li>
            <li>My 15 year old daughter says \\&quot;I want one too\\&quot; I was not about to spend that much money on her or let her use mine</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and gentle to my face.</li>
            <li>I contacted the company directly and after much to do</li>
            <li>Sometimes I use it with a dry clean face.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s flattering that no one ever knows how old I really am.</li>
            <li>I rotate it in gentle circles, avoiding sensitive areas like just under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll be sure to update this review again to see it holds up longer than just a few</li>
            <li>I definitely got my moneys worth</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use any face wash, just my normal body soap-DOVE.  </li>
            <li>I love this and use if everyday&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I started out using the brush once a day at night with my normal Bliss cleanser</li>
            <li>It does heavy vibration, but I do wish the brush was more softer.</li>
            <li>Truthfully I didn&#x27;t even use it that often because it was so harsh on my face</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t use it in the shower, make sure that it is dried after each use to prevent rusting.</li>
            <li>It was a nice run while i had it but not worth the price if it will only work for 2 months.</li>
            <li>The first one is fast, the second control is slower, tho</li>
            <li>Did make it through the warranty period, but only because it was rarely used.  </li>
            <li>This is my first facial brush and it works really well.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall it is an economical facial cleansing system.</li>
            <li>It does not take any longer than normal to wash your face.  </li>
            <li>I think the Pretika is here to stay because I love the firm brush heads.</li>
            <li>I had to contact Pretika because of time that had passed, they said normally they wouldn &#x27;t replace as it was beyond.</li>
            <li>Well after the third drop it pretty much stopped working.</li>
            <li>A slot at the back of the stand will also be useful</li>
            <li>Make sure the brush is completely dry before setting back to charge!!</li>
            <li>and I make sure that it is completely dry befor putting back on the charger.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this product right before a vacation and charged it before I packed it; 10 days later it was still working without an additional charging.</li>
            <li>Remember clean face with a  regular gentle facial cleaner before using the brush.  </li>
            <li>This recent one was purchased for my daughter at her request as she dropped the first one I got her a few too many times.  </li>
            <li>so I honestly can&#x27;t speak for how long this will last with proper care.</li>
            <li>I bought this one 16 months ago and was at first worried it would die right away like some other reviewers stated.  </li>
            <li>NEW buyers]&lt;br /&gt;Buy</li>
            <li>This is to condition the new battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using it along with a new face wash, moisturizer, and the Glycolic Acid 35%.</li>
            <li>suck got to buy a new one I will not buy pretik product again .</li>
            <li>I ordered a new one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 43 and live in a tropical climate, however, I don&#x27;t like to spend money on facials.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t image n to live with out it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have to buy a new unit.</li>
            <li>This one is new and improved.</li>
            <li>but I could live without</li>
            <li>I had a pretika for 5 years and it died the new one stopped working after one use</li>
            <li>It was such a disappointment, since I thought I had found the perfect skin care tool.</li>
            <li>If the description was honest I&#x27;d likely hold off on a review for a few weeks and give it a rating based on results/if it broke after a week/etc.</li>
            <li>The brush speed is not as smooth as the initial one I bought, and it died last month.</li>
            <li>this one doesn&#x27;t run as long and also not sure if it is the pads or the machine itself doesn&#x27;t do as good of a job of scrubbing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s embarrassing to be an older adult with skin issues, but I&#x27;m in Perimenopause</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this PRETIKA for anyone wishing to obtain a deep clean of facial skin.</li>
            <li>I have very, very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>very soft the skin.</li>
            <li>The brushes are very soft and gentile on your skin.</li>
            <li>The bottom line is, while the Clairsonic is much more expensive, it sounds like it&#x27;s actually a more sensible economic choice for anyone who plans to continue to use sonic dermabrasion over the long term.</li>
            <li>I use it 2x daily with my usual cleanser and microdermabrasion srub once weekly, and it leaves my face beautifully clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li>The head is large enough to use on my rough knees and elbows, leaving them smooth.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I like the way the brush is gentle to clean, then after you rinse and dry - put on moisturizer with the sponge, it actually does help your skin accept it</li>
            <li>First thing that I have ever received from Amazon that was total junk.</li>
            <li>I have had it for about a year, use it every other day and have used it with many different cleansers.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that fine wrinkles and black heads have been dissapearing.</li>
            <li>However, when I recharged it for the first time, it quit working properly.  </li>
            <li>Operation is pretty basic.</li>
            <li>And the topical medication that I use to keep my face clear sinks in farther and works 8x better.</li>
            <li>so far!...</li>
            <li>I am returning my second one, the first one broke after about a week.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After each treatment ( I used hot water to soften the facial brush before applying to my face with soap)</li>
            <li>it was pretty obvious what had happened.</li>
            <li>I purchased the first one at Marshall&#x27;s for about the same money as Amazon, the item lasted 4 months.</li>
            <li>Also, the first brush would turn itself on in the middle of the night.  </li>
            <li>Then after I charged it the first time, I noticed the charge only lasted a 2 days.</li>
            <li>From the first time I used it, my face responded to the deep cleaning.</li>
            <li>The first couple of days, I had a couple of dry, hard patches on my face that were kind of scaly and peeling.</li>
            <li>I always charge it after it hasn&#x27;t been used for a day, to make sure it&#x27;s dry, and I also store it in a dry place, as per instructions.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its not as gentle as the older model and when I called the company they said the feed back from customers was the reason they changed it.</li>
            <li>So if you do use this product, Do not press down, lightly press to your skin.</li>
            <li>When first using the brush, I break out a lot, as the brush brings the pimples to the surface and uncovers them, a similar thing happens with acne medicne, it sluffs off the old skin and exposes the new acne underneath.</li>
            <li>Topical medications were not working that great due to all the oil and dead skin.</li>
            <li>Night I use the strong setting and add baking soda to my trouble area.  </li>
            <li>I made a special effort to keep the charging port area extremely dry/not exposed to any elements but that did not help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it once a day (at night, to deep clean and get rid of my makeup) and am still using the sensitive setting, but the brush feels really soft and it hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Today, I emailed Sonic asking where can I buy a new charger since I seemed to have misplaced it, they said they would send me a free charger.  </li>
            <li>IF you place the brush back on the UNPLUGGED cradle, you must make sure that the entire brush handle is bone DRY</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this brush actually made my face dry out and become flaky instead of smooth.</li>
            <li>I bought this knowing that several reviewers said theirs stopped working after a certain amount of time.  </li>
            <li>I feel the unit is a bit large and should be a bit smaller for all the curves of the face.</li>
            <li>But the little charger prong doesn&#x27;t even fit all the way through so its no use.</li>
            <li>My first one died and my face didn&#x27;t feel as clean only a few weeks after.</li>
            <li>This is my second Pretika Brush, I accidently left the first in a pool of water....not advised!  </li>
            <li>This is my second Pretika facial brush , I had the first one for years!</li>
            <li>skin is a bit hard to exfoliate so this brush really helps to get the smooth effect afterwards.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t comment much on battery life yet as I just fixed it last week.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have acne prone skin and tried everything to get clear skin, nothing worked.</li>
            <li>Used on my shoulders for a week for those bumps and they stayed clear for a year.</li>
            <li>,My skin is clear and shines.</li>
            <li>This combination has kept my face clear for over a month.  </li>
            <li>my face was clear of bumps.</li>
            <li>They need to clear up some quality control/manufacturing problems.</li>
            <li>It has helped brighten my skin, clear up blemishes</li>
            <li>ITS DONE CHARGING WHEN THE LIGHT GOES GREEN.</li>
            <li>WOW IS ALL I CAN SAY...</li>
            <li>JUST WOW</li>
            <li>sure you get a replacement battery that is at least 500mAh rating&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>the status light &#x27;Green&#x27;</li>
            <li>Then, if you have sensitive skin as I do, don&#x27;t overuse.</li>
            <li>and my skin is so soft and impurities non-existent.</li>
            <li>B000F0GNT2 DermaNew Facial Rejuvenation System has a cleansing Brush and real crystal cream that works.</li>
            <li>It works very well for a deep face scrubber.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>B003FP86SK IQ Natural Microdermabrasion Exfoliate Crystals Aluminum Oxide 1.5oz]]</li>
            <li>I compared at least 4 others and decided this one is the closest to the clarisonic which is more than twice the price.  </li>
            <li>I like the whole idea of sonic facial brush.</li>
            <li>I apply the cleanser to my face first, not directly on the pretika....</li>
            <li>The facial brush systems really do work</li>
            <li>The brush is soft but it cleans my face well.</li>
            <li>I got the SonicDermabrasion for Christmas 2009 - and on December 16 2010 it stopped working completely.</li>
            <li>To be 42 years old and walk out with out any makeup says a lot about a product.</li>
            <li>and I would recommend this to anyone who has acne prone - sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>My face looks feels so soft.  </li>
            <li>IT RETAINS WATER AND SHOOTS OUT BROWN OLD WATER ONTO YOUR FACE.</li>
            <li>My father opened it up to fix it and the inside was completely corroded.</li>
            <li>I researched the Clarisonic and decided I couldn&#x27;t pay that much for a facial tool.  </li>
            <li>After about two to three weeks of this it completely died.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t even have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>But used with caution, I&#x27;d still recommend it to people whose skin isn&#x27;t overly sensitive.    </li>
            <li>Also, an added unexpected bonus, wrinkles I had are deminishing tremendously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am 35 with a natural T-zone oil issue.  </li>
            <li>The extra firm brush head is still soft and doesn&#x27;t scratch, but it does a better job at scrubbing.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even think the loud vibrations add any cleaning effects.</li>
            <li>and my skin is baby soft after I use it.</li>
            <li>The charge does not hold longer than 24 hours and when the head rotates, it makes a really loud grinding noise.</li>
            <li>This thing is going straight back to Walmart.</li>
            <li>The product does the job and is not harsh.</li>
            <li>which is a bit sensitive.</li>
            <li>I got this for my 14 year old stepdaughter after I got myself a Susan Lucci set.  </li>
            <li>but so far I like it.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Reading the title &amp;#34;SonicDermabrasion&amp;#34; lead me to believe that this was a sonic action</li>
            <li>It no longer has that loud beep every 30 seconds or so.  </li>
            <li>This thing is not water proof- do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>So far, I have not used the unit in the shower, just at the sink on my face.  </li>
            <li>I have never heard mine beep, but how big of a deal is that really?</li>
            <li>Not even two months old</li>
            <li>I bought this item off of Amazon because it was by far the cheapest place I found it for sale</li>
            <li>a Clarisonic Plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles on this brush are much stiffer than the brushes on the Clarisonic Deep Pore and even Body brushes.  </li>
            <li>It moves in much the same way as the Clarisonic</li>
            <li>how soft they are even without comparing them to this one.  </li>
            <li>they have changed something from my old pretika.</li>
            <li>I am in my 20s with sensitive, acne prone skin and the brush head has worked well for me.</li>
            <li>Unlike some of the others, I don&#x27;t have an oily T-zone or acne issues, but I am 61 years old and am still plagued with blackheads on my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Product arrived complete.  </li>
            <li>This by far is the dumbest design I have ever seen with a rechargeable item.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The battery is dead, Pretika uses the same battery with most cordless telephones.</li>
            <li>After only a few weeks it wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge any more.</li>
            <li>Definately a good substitute for the expensive brands.</li>
            <li>the brush is way more thick and soft.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ve ever used a real Clarisonic you know what I mean when I say there is a huge difference.</li>
            <li>My face always feels so clean and tight when I am done.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so clean and tight and soaks up any product I use afterwards.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other battery powered brushes, but this is larger, and definitely has more</li>
            <li>A lot of reviews were warning about it braking down easily, but I wasn&#x27;t gonna pay over 200$ for some fancy product that would basically do the same job.&lt;br /&gt;  </li>
            <li>so I will only use it every other day, but after almost a week of use it has made a huge difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that I haven&#x27;t been able to find replacement brushes at a decent price</li>
            <li>This is my second Pretika Facial Brush (my first one got lost during a recent move) and it really makes a difference in the smoothness of my skin.</li>
            <li>I make sure it is very dry before placing back in the recharger like other reviewers have suggested and found that this is not hard to do.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve only had my Pretika for about a week, so I will be sure to update this review since several people have commented that it breaks down after a month or two.  </li>
            <li>keeps my face clean scrubbing the dead skins off</li>
            <li>I started out the first day only with the low setting.  </li>
            <li>it has been acting funny the last week or so.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t work the same as the older one I will b returning</li>
            <li>It only worked for two second in my first time use.</li>
            <li>I have a similar product that I like and thought I was buying another one just like it for a friend, however the main difference is in the charging.</li>
            <li>Unless some previous comments, I found the brush very soft and just the right length for the purpose.  </li>
            <li>But now I only use the high setting and it takes about 3 or 4 re-starts to finish the job.  </li>
            <li>High and low settings.</li>
            <li>Works as expected, very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Now, the motor is starting to sound strange and laboured while I use it, and I suspect it will stop working permanently before too long.</li>
            <li>first wet the bristles thoroughly to soften them.</li>
            <li>First, the bristles are SO ROUGH</li>
            <li>I never put it in the cradle wet, I followed the instructions exactly.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is too harsh at all, and I use it on full force about 2x/day.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product over others I have tried where the brushes are too soft to be effective or they run on batteries (too expensive) or they don&#x27;t stand up to the water which inevitably gets on the machine.</li>
            <li>I was hoping that something that looks like it could be named Turbo Face Blaster 5000 would rough up my skin a little more.</li>
            <li>Leaves silly smooth skin at first try!</li>
            <li>I am able to mimic the little \\&quot;scrubbing sand\\&quot; particles in Proactive minus the chemicals.  </li>
            <li>other reviewers, I really wanted to buy a Clarisonic brush, but couldn&#x27;t justify spending that much on a tool that is essentially just a glorified face cleaner.  </li>
            <li>so I returned it and got a new one that lasted about the same time and</li>
            <li>The Pretika gets rid of the dry, flaky skin, and leaves my skin feeling really</li>
            <li>once I let the insides dry out, much like drying a cellphone after dropping it in a pool.</li>
            <li>The previous one I bought on HSN some 5 or so years ago only vibrated, but this one actually spins giving more deep cleansing power.</li>
            <li>The light will indicate that it is fully charged but the second you unplug it the battery is dead against without any use.</li>
            <li>The whole brush spins so I can get beside my nose unlike the clarasonic that only spins in the middle.  </li>
            <li>When I plug the unit in to charge it, the light immediately glows green but the charge does not last.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really rotate as such, rather it vibrates 300 times per second.</li>
            <li>I purchased this item because it seemed to function much like the much higher priced Clairsonic (not sure of spelling).  </li>
            <li>Its useless its only good in one use then</li>
            <li>Breaks down in a month, you can only get one full charge from the product.</li>
            <li>I do know that after cleaning my skin with this, there is a major difference in feeling.</li>
            <li>it would be a major improvement.</li>
            <li>I dont see any major improvements in my skin</li>
            <li>It seems to hold a charge well and has made a major difference in the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li>I was okay with the fact that I would be getting a sonic facial brush for about $30 that might only last a few months.</li>
            <li>It seems better than the Olay face brush since it&#x27;s rechargeable and probably equally water-resistant at only a few extra dollars (but money saved in batteries), along with having variable speeds.</li>
            <li>A full charge lasts several months and their is a little plug over the charging port that needs to be kept in place to keep water out.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still not as secure as we like, but at least it&#x27;s not laying out on its side while being charged.</li>
            <li>then I have too, and I generally stick with the time it gives me for each face section.</li>
            <li>and I finally have clear skin.</li>
            <li>I bought this back in April &#x27;11 looking for something to help me clear up my skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is loud, that is the only issue I have with it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve cut back to using this just once a day on the sensitive setting since twice a day</li>
            <li>At some point I had left the brush in a damp area and the contacts at the bottom of the handle developed rust.</li>
            <li>Although I think this facial brush would work well for those who do not have sensitive skin or problems with cystic acne</li>
            <li>I did call the maufacturer for differnt heads for sensitive skin, but they only had the one set.</li>
            <li>The reacharching hole is barely covered by a piece of plastic, therefore I  dont see how the unit can be operate in the shower i havent tried it in the shower</li>
            <li>She used it for only a couple of months before it completely stopped functioning.  </li>
            <li>I bought this just to see if I wanted a clarisonic, so I bought a cheaper version of it especially because a majority of the reviews said it just completely stops working after a month.</li>
            <li>I kept it &amp; opened it back in June, charge it &amp; it went haywire, wouldn&#x27;t shut off, then completely stopped.</li>
            <li>and wow it is in another class entirely.</li>
            <li>My skin is only mildly sensitive.  </li>
            <li>So far my only issue is the stand.</li>
            <li>Only had it a week so far..</li>
            <li>I wish i would have spent the extra money in the first place for the clarisonic, since i&#x27;m now in the market for one.</li>
            <li>The heads can be a bit rough, but soaking them in hot water while pre-cleansing helps immensely</li>
            <li>Sad, because it was nice while it lasted.</li>
            <li>After a few uses, charging the battery didn&#x27;t even last through a full cycle.</li>
            <li>However I really love this brush it hasn&#x27;t broken at all</li>
            <li>i bought this because the clarisonic mia was too expensive, i still dont own one of those</li>
            <li>It is because so many false reviews are posted here.</li>
            <li>I like the Pretika because it vibrated like the more expensive models out there,but when I received the new one it now spins and vibrates.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only now shopping for a new unit as the brush is starting to wear.  </li>
            <li>I currently remove and  clean the brush head after use, then I dry the unit completely and put a little clipper oil on the part that rotates the brush head before I store it.  </li>
            <li>This works OK, but no better than any other brush that just spins.</li>
            <li>The motor sounds like it is ready to break at any minute due to inferior product.  </li>
            <li>I used it every other day on the gentle setting as directed, 20 seconds on each area.</li>
            <li>hard to clean nose area bc of that.</li>
            <li>The brush is a little coarse but gives your skin a thorough cleaning and leaves your face feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>I think that I had so much build up of dead skin in those areas that it took the Pretika a couple of days to break through them to the soft, glowing skin underneath.   </li>
            <li>I dont have sensitive skin, so I use it daily on the lower setting as part of my regular skin care routine.. and once a week on stronger setting to exfoliate.</li>
            <li>I upgraded to the more expensive brand six months ago and wish I would have never wasted my time with this Pretika brand.</li>
            <li>I bought it because the Clarisonic is too expensive and wanted to see if i even liked it, but the brush broke very shortly after my purchase.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, so I figured I don&#x27;t need to buy the more expensive Clarisonic with softer bristles.  </li>
            <li>I loved the results so much that I stupidly exchanged it again.</li>
            <li>HAVEN&#x27;T HAD A SINGLE NEW BUMP POP UP SENSE</li>
            <li>Due to this, and my daughter&#x27;s inexperience in facial cleansing, I will be using the new one and give her the old one.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I am happy with the product, but notably disappointed.  </li>
            <li>Not worth it, just splurge and buy the real thing.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t help with my dark circles, but I&#x27;ve never found anything that REALLY takes care of that.</li>
            <li>the price is very affordable compared to the other sonic facial systems out there.</li>
            <li>When I ordered this I expected that this would operate much like a Clarisonic, but obviously for the price would not be as well made or last near as long as one would expect for the price of a Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>Surprised how long battery lasts between charges.</li>
            <li>I used a clarasonic in the past and it wasnt worth the pricetag attached to it.</li>
            <li>My first one died a few weeks ago after a year of ownership.</li>
            <li>but they really let their customers down on this one.</li>
            <li>Very sensitive, rosecea, milia and very dry.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had acne or major issue with zits, but do occasionally get smaller ones.  </li>
            <li>, I would have determined that due to this brush having ONE stlye of brush head and the fact that a more firm brissle will irritate my acne, I could have waited a bit longer and applied what I actually spent on this to a Clairsonic Mia.</li>
            <li>My skin seems much smoother and needs much less product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this for two months now, and the bristles have developed mold at the bases, even though I dry it off every time I use it.  </li>
            <li>I noticed less breakouts and much cleaner feeling skin.  </li>
            <li>You really need to dry the bottom thoroughly after use, especially where the charger is inserted, to ensure a long lasting brush.  </li>
            <li>This product would be rated at least a four if it didn&#x27;t break so quickly.</li>
            <li>There are no other brush heads you can get, no sensitive, no delicate, just this one rough bristled brush.  </li>
            <li>but i guess that because there rubbing it too rough on there skin because i have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had the Petrika a few weeks, and have been pretty faithful to the twice daily use they recommend.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Pretika makes shoddy products that are nothing like the quality of my new real brush.</li>
            <li>I know that&#x27;s a little odd, but it gets it clean.</li>
            <li>Decent facial brush, but not worth the extra hassle or expense.&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>

            <li> Good value!</li>
            <li> It is a beautiful, up-scale, looking unit.    </li>
            <li> It still works beautifully, and even tho</li>
            <li> what and awesome thing at a good price.</li>
            <li> Mine still works beautifully.  </li>
            <li> If you have beautiful skin you probably won&#x27;t even need make up.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it a good review because when it was working, it worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> I saw a lady in a restaurant and noticed how beautiful her skin was.</li>
            <li> Works great as a grinder.</li>
            <li> Great power, bristles and holds a charge for days.</li>
            <li> does a great job cleaning skin and keeping blemishes at bay.</li>
            <li> Great item.  </li>
            <li> This was great until it died soon after the time it could be returned.  </li>
            <li> Worked great for about a year.</li>
            <li> Still working great.</li>
            <li> anyone else experienced this problem with mold growing on it?</li>
            <li> and it has already done great things for my skin.</li>
            <li> It is an attractive looking unit and I keep it on my bathroom</li>
            <li> This product works really great.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for anyone with acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> And yes, it&#x27;s great for guys too.</li>
            <li> so I was happy when I found the Pretika.</li>
            <li> while it worked it was great</li>
            <li> I thought I would give this face brush a try since the reviews sounded great.  </li>
            <li> The compliments fly from everyone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Great price.</li>
            <li> If you place it in the cradle to charge after every use, you will greatly diminish the longevity of your brush.</li>
            <li> It works great.</li>
            <li> It worked great for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> If you want a sonic brush that doesn&#x27;t break the bank like the MIA this is a great alternative and two brush heads are included</li>
            <li> The product itself works great</li>
            <li> This brush is assume and i have to say am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> but for someone who doesn&#x27;t want to shell out a a lot of money for one brush then this would be a great replacement for that.</li>
            <li> and i have notice a great change in my skin.</li>
            <li> I have experienced none of these issues and I&#x27;ve had mine for months.  </li>
            <li> For the price I think this brush does a great job.</li>
            <li> Really happy with the results already.  </li>
            <li> Worked great while it worked.  </li>
            <li> Really happy with it, my skin feels great after each use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This worked great in the beginning.</li>
            <li> For the price this brush works great and just as well as the $200.00 version that I have used at the dermatologist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> the brush, size and effect was great until then.</li>
            <li> Great product, but I tend toward a simpler routine.</li>
            <li> Great for cleaning and exfoliation.</li>
            <li> This product would be a great buy if it worked longer than 6 months.</li>
            <li> It does a great job</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> , Brush almost everynight.it workes great.</li>
            <li> this brush STILL works great....</li>
            <li> Pretika sells them for twenty bucks for a four pack which is a great value.is a great value.</li>
            <li> This works great, because when using it for lotion, it works the lotion into the skin.</li>
            <li> The brush works great otherwise and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> It was great while it lasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When it works, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> This is a great item when it works.</li>
            <li> It has stood up over time and given me great service.  </li>
            <li> The item worked great, while it worked.</li>
            <li> This worked really great for a while, about 8 months or so.</li>
            <li> It works great for the price it was.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>

            <li> A great gift for a teenager or anyone with skin problems.</li>
            <li> and it was great</li>
            <li> Happy with the purchase though, I just set it on</li>
            <li> It worked great for a week.</li>
            <li> But the vibration was doing a great job.</li>
            <li> Great for a week then stopped charging.</li>
            <li> cuz it&#x27;s great when it works.</li>

            <li> This one does not hold the charge for more than three days!!  </li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re great, but I&#x27;m here to tell you the Pretika does an excellent job at a fraction of the cost.  </li>
            <li> excellent love it would recommend it to a friend</li>
            <li> Love love this brush, I even got my mom one! !!!!!!</li>

            <li> this one was the most consistant and very fair pricing.</li>
            <li> My skin looks amazing, the wrinkles are greatly reduced, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> but this seems good.</li>
            <li> It worked good when it worked  </li>
            <li> I bought this item about 3 months ago loved it</li>
            <li> From day one...I loved it.</li>
            <li> Product wise, it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> this is a good alternative.</li>
            <li> For a product I initially loved</li>
            <li> I got this product two years ago &amp; LOVED the way it cleaned &amp; how my skin looked.</li>
            <li> -this works just as good.</li>
            <li> It is a good product for the price.  </li>
            <li> Again, this brush is good bang for your buck...</li>
            <li> and I am good.</li>
            <li> Dont buy, the thing worked good when it ran, but it should be considered as a disposable product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> Good price, too.  </li>
            <li> I would have given this 5 stars because I loved it.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it had really good reviews.</li>
            <li> Its a shame because I really  loved it.</li>
            <li> This is a really, really good product.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t deny that it feels good.</li>
            <li> Pretika has good customer service.</li>
            <li> I used the Pretika at my daughter&#x27;s this summer and loved it.  </li>
            <li> Skin feels great after using and I can use it with my own cleansers.  </li>
            <li> I have been using my Pretika for a good two weeks</li>
            <li> Good thing</li>
            <li> I LOVED the way my skin felt after using it.</li>
            <li> it does a great job, nice size for the shower, even feels like it has substance and comes in a travel bag.</li>
            <li> This was a good purchase.</li>
            <li> I was thinking I would have to spend a lot of money to have a good one</li>
            <li> clock wise</li>
            <li> I used mine under 7 times --did a good job</li>
            <li> Good luck with yours if you choose to buy one.</li>
            <li> Loved it until that time.  </li>
            <li> I loved using this to wash my face.</li>
            <li> My foundation looks so good,</li>
            <li> Good product for the price point: $30</li>
            <li> Anyway, I knew I already had a good skin regimen.  </li>
            <li> This is a very good item, my skin feels so clean and looks great while using this.</li>
            <li> This product might cause more damage than good!  </li>
            <li> If someone gave me a Clarisonic, I&#x27;d be happy and delighted to use it, but I find that this machine does not lack in anything and is a much better expenditure of my money.  </li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with the choice and using amazon.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried many things for exfoliation and this seems to work great.</li>
            <li> Love this face cleaner, works great.</li>

            <li> and i just love it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> and I love it!  </li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> Very happy with the fast and prompt service!</li>
            <li> Like it better than the clarasonic!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  </li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> LOVE this brush!</li>
            <li> You can dampen the brush head, but make sure the rest stays dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> so good skin care is very important to keep her pimples from getting out of control.</li>
            <li> Amazing results.</li>
            <li> Her skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li> This is amazing.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say its AMAZING</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, not an amazing product</li>
            <li> My adolescent son, who notices nothing, even remarked how nice his sister&#x27;s skin looked.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;m very happy with this pretika, and i seriously am very picky and return almost everything i buy.</li>
            <li> and it feels nice on skin..</li>
            <li> and now I admit that this product is really effective in exfoliating and cleansing your skin.</li>
            <li> I liked it while it worked for all of 2 months.</li>
            <li> I honestly haven&#x27;t looked because I haven&#x27;t had the need to.  </li>
            <li> I figured if I liked the way it worked with my skin</li>
            <li> I just used it, on the 2nd setting, and I am VERY impressed, and VERY happy with how the brush felt on my skin, as well as how smooth my skin feels after just one use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did that, as well as taking the brush off the unit and have it drying on its own on a Kleenex.</li>
            <li> but honestly I haven&#x27;t found one that cost a &amp;#34;few&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Its nice that it recharges.  </li>
            <li> .....not an effective exfoliatior or cleansing device.</li>
            <li> It was, however, kind of scratchy.</li>
            <li> I cannot honestly tell you whether or not this product works because mine never worked.  </li>
            <li> Which is handy</li>
            <li> Nice product.</li>
            <li> The two speeds are a nice option.  </li>
            <li> I would love to be able to buy this product again if I am happy with it, and know what I am getting.</li>
            <li> I also liked the fact that it was rechargable.</li>
            <li> I liked the product alot</li>
            <li> really liked this brush when I had nothing to compare it to.  </li>
            <li> Although I didn&#x27;t use it as often as I would have liked to because it was a hassle to recharge once I moved it</li>
            <li> This is a really nice product.</li>
            <li> I use my own soap.</li>
            <li> Broke after a week, it wouldn&#x27;t start and then it would turn on its own.</li>
            <li> I liked the brush in the beginning.</li>
            <li> The model I own</li>
            <li> and it leaves my faces feeling very clean and rejuvenated!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful product, and the price is more than right.</li>
            <li> In addition, my original brush is still in great condition.</li>
            <li> easy for use and function is good.</li>
            <li> Skin is clear and awesome!</li>
            <li> As first I would have given this machine 5 stars because it cleaned my skin beautifully</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product three times because it was really good at cleaning my face and helping keep it blemish free.</li>
            <li> Both are more effective than using your fingers or a washcloth with your soap/facial cleansers for getting into the pores and removing dirt, oil, and makeup.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does a good job of exfoliating and is pleasant to use and gentle.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend you do not buy this item!</li>
            <li> This brush works beautifully and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> Now first off this is a great brush</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve felt the Clarisonic brush heads in stores and thought they were incredibly wimpy, even the normal and body brushes.</li>
            <li> The first one I purchased almost 4 years ago, was great.</li>
            <li> When I first bought the brush it was great for my skin</li>
            <li> The first time I charged the brush the recommended time it worked great.</li>
            <li> and it is still working just fine!</li>
            <li> Two very important things you need to know for your brush to last:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very cheap quality.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to get carried away as it feels SO good and leaves your face wonderfully smooth.  </li>
            <li> My skin looks wonderful and feels very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M IN LOVE AND</li>
            <li> So make sure you get the battery pack that consists of 3x AAA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Replacement battery that I was able to acquire is rated 700mA, so it should take me approx</li>
            <li> I wanted to make sure I had no issues before I reviewed.</li>
            <li> Glad I bought it&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This brush is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> Very happy that I made the decision to finally buy one.</li>
            <li> My skin feels better the nights I use it.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it more than 2-3 times a week.    </li>
            <li> seemed to be a bit too much for my skin, but it&#x27;s still working great.  </li>
            <li> Conversely, I have read reviews by people who have had Clairsonics which continued to function for many years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s especially good with whiteheads, and the blackheads on my nose are smaller.  </li>
            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> Love it, really LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> ok</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.    </li>
            <li> I love this thing.</li>
            <li> It does not spin, but vibrates on the skin, which I think is better for my skin anyways.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> am thinking of returning this item for a better quality</li>
            <li> Im happy that the package was delivered fast.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I recommend this to everyone suffering from acne :))</li>
            <li> Overall I was very happy with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better then those that cost a hundred dollars.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> what more can you ask for?</li>
            <li> I love the,  pretika  sonic  brush.</li>
            <li> It really does a great  job.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.</li>
            <li> You should get one! :)</li>
            <li> , then im ok.</li>
            <li> I had read a lot of good reviews, but also some iffy ones--but for the price it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li> Just be sure to follow the instructions regarding the moisture issue.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin glow and is   nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll pay more for a brand that lasts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure replacement heads could be found on Amazon.com as well.</li>
            <li> how many times I charged it.</li>
            <li> Too unreliable to put your money into, there are more reliable products out there for cheaper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll make sure to keep moisture out of it.</li>
            <li> Skin feels smoother and seems to absorb the creams I put on my skin even better.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for two week and love the way my skin feels and looks.</li>
            <li> I sincerely disencourage buying this product.</li>
            <li> product has not had any enhancement or upgrade for improving better operation over the past&lt;br /&gt;two years.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Disappointed for sure.</li>
            <li> ; dollars more.</li>
            <li> For the price, I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Lets hope it lasts because i love it</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> it continues to work, then i will be satisfied.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.  </li>
            <li> Love that it&#x27;s rechargeable</li>
            <li> I ride horses and love DIYprojects</li>
            <li> My face looks and feels better every time I use it.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and just love the way it smooths and cleans my skin.</li>
            <li> or, spend more and get a better brush.</li>
            <li> I so enjoyed.</li>
            <li> As it turns out, my investments in the products I purchased from Amazon for my routine work even better.</li>
            <li> I have oily acne prone skin and long-term use of the Pretika would just cause more inflammation.</li>
            <li> would be better.</li>
            <li> Two weeks later my skin was FLAWLESS!!!  </li>
            <li> Love not having to change the batteries.</li>
            <li> and I was quite satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoyed my pretika for about 4 months</li>
            <li> I have had this for a couple of years, and really love it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE it</li>
            <li> It would be even better</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> My skin has a more even skin tone since using Pretika dermabrasion brush.</li>
            <li> Such great service!</li>
            <li> I bought one for myself when I got home and now find the battery does not hold a charge for more than two uses.  </li>
            <li> I spend most of my  time charging it .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I decided to try this for myself before giving one as a gift.</li>
            <li> Love that it holds a charge forever.</li>
            <li> If you want a product that lasts you six months at the most?...</li>
            <li> and I have to let you know that I love it.</li>
            <li> You used to be able to put the brush into the plastic stand and it would charge in the stand via metal prongs in the stand.  </li>
            <li> The method of charging is even better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought this item.  </li>
            <li> Love the brush side and the power.</li>
            <li> GLAD</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll bet anything you&#x27;ll love it and never be without one again.</li>
            <li> The Clairisonic is more water proof if you are going to use it in the shower</li>
            <li> Love the timer feature also.</li>
            <li> The price makes it an outstanding value.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> However, it can make the effort to better describe how it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The one it comes with is eh, okay.</li>
            <li> Yeah sure,</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Love it, but after I ordered it I heard of one that is timed to each area on your face so you don&#x27;t over scrub.  </li>
            <li> The olay spin brush was more reliable than this</li>
            <li> I am however going to get a clarisonic, the reviews are so much better.</li>
            <li> I also make sure the rubber plug that covers the charging connection is fully engaged.  </li>
            <li> Since it has improved my appearance still got alot more to go</li>
            <li> I really want to give it no stars, if the product held up it would have been a great brush ,because I saw a difference in my skin, but like I said save your money because it looses it charge in about four months</li>
            <li> It feels even better after I apply a toner and my moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> It would be better to invest in a Clarisonic since it has softer bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think the vibrating one may work better than the one I have (</li>
            <li> Thanks again for a great product.</li>
            <li> Not all the way but still better than it was</li>
            <li> I also like how refreshing it is</li>
            <li> But when I got this, I found it to be better then</li>
            <li> I decided it was time to upgrade to a more dependable unit and bought</li>
            <li> If I didn&#x27;t have problems charging I probably would have been satisfied with just this brush, but now having felt the bristles on the Clarisonic</li>
            <li> Clarisonic feels like pampering and this brush feels more like an exfoliation/scrub.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I think it works best with a microdermabrasion scrub, but I also use it with my favorite facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li> I have no irritation and I&#x27;m so pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Overall, very happy with the way it cleans and gets all my makeup off.</li>
            <li> Great exfoliation and really helps closing pores as it helps my products penetrate my skin.</li>
            <li> then let the brush do its magic.</li>
            <li> but this was just ok,</li>
            <li> Clarisonic is much better...</li>
            <li> Manufacturer provided outstanding customer service and follow up.</li>
            <li> It may not have as many bells and whistles, but it does the job</li>
            <li> and I think you&#x27;ll be pleased.</li>
            <li> Washes your face better than using a cloth or your hands.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> This would be an okay backup cleaner to keep under the sink for emergencies,  but please keep in mind...</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> I have Rosacea that shows most by causing pimples on and around my nose.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m using the Olay spinning brush, and I like it better.</li>
            <li> It cleaned ok but now the softest brush.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, so it&#x27;s great to have control of where and how intensely to apply pressure.  </li>
            <li> ; IMO, that is what causes most failures.  </li>
            <li> I would like it much more if it were to have the pulsing vibrations instead of the rotating head.  </li>
            <li> I think a much better design could have been made.  </li>
            <li> So far so good!  </li>
            <li> Great product would highly recommend to use for renewing your skin.  </li>
            <li> Originally wanted the clarisonic, but the Pretika is a great alternative and very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> and I loved it for the first two months.</li>
            <li> I loved the first one</li>
            <li> When I first got it, it worked really good.</li>
            <li> This one is definitely worth it!!</li>
            <li> It works great and appears that it is a new unit.</li>
            <li> This product works well to smooth skin and give a gentle dermabrasion at a great price point.</li>
            <li> so I decided to tell my teen daughter about this incredible magic brush.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my wife, she had a very old one that just gave up, this one works great</li>
            <li> My skin felt amazing the first time I used it!</li>
            <li> There is a very good reason this product only has a one-month warranty</li>
            <li> First time I used it my skin looked fresh and felt great.   </li>
            <li> /&gt;So far, this has been a great purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I enjoy what this product does for my skin, but do not trust that it&#x27;s lifespan will be more than 3 or 4 months.</li>
            <li> It is best to wet your face and put on the cleanser all over and then use the brush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is a great product for its price if you dont have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable to use and even without the brush moving it does a better job washing my face</li>
            <li> in all this product helped me decide that this kind of brush would be beneficial to my skin care routine and why I was willing to shell out more money for the Clarisonic.  </li>
            <li> I bought this one for my teen grand daughter to keep her face beautiful.  </li>
            <li> Its good, but I really wanted something that made exfoliation easy and this does not do that.</li>
            <li> For $29 bucks this product is more than worth it!</li>
            <li> It has just the same bells and whistles as the $100-$200 ones and is just as good!</li>
            <li> If you have used a Sonicare toothbrush before, you will probably find the results very comparable: your skin feels fresh, clean and healthy and looks great.  </li>
            <li> &quot; but water can enter easily enter through it&#x27;s bottom charging hardware.</li>
            <li> this means possibility of electical shock or the product will be easily damaged.&lt;br /&gt;3.  </li>
            <li> Someone asked me what I am doing with my makeup because my face is so bright and vibrant looking.</li>
            <li> It gets 2 stars for easy set-up, ease of use and having the vibrating power of the clarisonic.    </li>
            <li> It is lightweight, easy to hold and has two speeds.</li>
            <li> I wanted to buy it from Walmart because I know that if I am unsatisfied with the product, I could easily go to any Walmart store and return it with in 90 days of purchase.</li>
            <li> Amazing it has just enough pressure, feels like your getting a good scrub.  </li>
            <li> Replacement brushes can be found easily as well.  </li>
            <li> your face is worth stepping up the quality...and by investing in a better quality product your face will have greater noticeable improvements.</li>
            <li> the power is strong also.</li>
            <li> 2015 Update: Still going strong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> This facial brush worked beautifully for about 4 months - then the time between charges got shorter and shorter</li>
            <li> Since I could not find another rotating brush (according to reviews), and since I wasn&#x27;t ready to spend the money for a Clarisonic, my intention was to purchase the Pretika and the Nutrasonic, keep the one I liked best, and return the other one.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Replace the battery, follow the charging procedure on the &#x27;for NEW buyers&#x27; section and you should be good.  </li>
            <li> Fine lines on my forehead are smoothing out.</li>
            <li> it has worked fine for me with no rust or working problems...</li>
            <li> I thought fine</li>
            <li> Pretika does an excellent job for so much less than the Clairisonic.</li>
            <li> This one works just fine for me</li>
            <li> It did fine for about two weeks until it needed to be charged</li>
            <li> and my skin appeared fine.</li>
            <li> The Pretika worked fine.</li>
            <li> it worked fine for 1 month</li>
            <li> This little brush is just awesome!  </li>
            <li> I noticed a huge difference when i started using it.</li>
            <li> and I think that&#x27;s a huge plus.</li>
            <li> There were consecutive days that I forgot to use it, and my skin didn&#x27;t feel as smooth</li>
            <li> This is such a great alternative.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin, and this is amazing for cleansing if you moisturize afterwards.</li>
            <li> Sounds like a really cheap motor.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> i have a few friends who use it and their skin is flawless!</li>
            <li> This product was great for only about three months!  </li>
            <li> It filled up with water in the shower and has not worked since.</li>
            <li> really because I really liked the thing when it worked.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product as it was as cheap as it is priced.</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re looking for a cheap Clarisonic</li>
            <li> Even though it was warranties the company wanted more $ to repair it or whatever than what it was worth.</li>
            <li> Great product for the entire week it was working.</li>
            <li> I tried a few others and like this one the best.</li>
            <li> This Pretika facial brush is great when it works.</li>
            <li> Great price especially when compared to the Clairsonic.</li>
            <li> Great facial brush!  </li>
            <li> This is a great facial tool.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feels so smooth after use.</li>
            <li> I think I will enjoy it.</li>
            <li> It made my skin feel smooth.</li>
            <li> This is a great facial brush.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> My skin is so smooth and glows..</li>
            <li> but this one is great and the battery last forever!</li>
            <li> Works great for my teen.</li>
            <li> My skin feels great after only a month of use.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t compare to Clarisonic, because I&#x27;ve never used it, but this one was cheap and has been helping me</li>
            <li> The facial brush WAS working great for about 4 months.</li>
            <li> The charger doesn&#x27;t fit the unit well while in the stand.</li>
            <li> Pretika SonicDermabrasion facial brush is a great product.</li>
            <li> I really liked it,worked really well.</li>
            <li> and the light will turn on indicating it has decided to charge again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My skin is as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom</li>
            <li> I purchased this facial brush about 2 years ago and it&#x27;s still working great.</li>
            <li> Works really well and is a cost effective alternative to the Clairsonic.</li>
            <li> my face is smooth..</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t come with a body brush, but that wasn&#x27;t important to me.</li>
            <li> It worked great as a facial scrub but within a month when I tried to recharge it, it wouldnt do anything.</li>
            <li> Important, this model (ST255) cannot charge while on the stand, the plug goes into the bottom of the unit and prevents it from being on the stand.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and keep charged.  </li>
            <li> After I use the Pretika Facial Brush, I use a gentle toner and my face feels wonderful.</li>
            <li> This really is the best facial brush out there if you aren&#x27;t looking to spend $100</li>
            <li> Good price - high quality - quick delivery</li>
            <li> Get&#x27;s my skin super clean!</li>
            <li> and I was looking for this for a long time, and it&#x27;s easy to use and charges great</li>
            <li> I do not like this product because I did not find it very useful.</li>
            <li> ....Makes one.s skin feel fresh and squeaky clean and refreshing.</li>
            <li> It feels great and my face feels really clean after using any facial cleanser with it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After I use it my face feels very clean and fresh</li>
            <li> I was really excited about this product because it&#x27;s so cheap</li>
            <li> My face never felt so clean and smooth until I used the pretika brush.  </li>
            <li> My skin felt so smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> It makes my face feel so refreshed, smooth, and clean.</li>
            <li> so smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a pretty good deal, being so much cheaper than the clarisonic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m enjoying it very much.</li>
            <li> I originally gave this brush four stars, but have since downgraded my review to two stars since it stopped working after seven months.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just downgraded my original five-star review to three stars.  </li>
            <li> Worth the money!</li>
            <li> I WAS SOOOO EXCITED WHEN IT ARRIVED ON TIME.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the investment!</li>
            <li> It is water friendly and gets the job done...</li>
            <li> My acne scars have significantly faded away faster than before.</li>
            <li> I have had this over a year, still on the original charge when I received it and charged it up.</li>
            <li> it was so excited the adapter was not there</li>
            <li> I was originally wanting to get the clarisonic, but it just seemed like a lot of money to spend.</li>
            <li> Why would u make a stand and not make it accessible?</li>
            <li> Its well worth buying !</li>
            <li> This product stopped working within the first 30 days of use and I was able to return it and receive a credit.  </li>
            <li> However, I had a Pretika in the past that was wonderful and</li>
            <li> Keeps me lookin fresh!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to use this product once I got this.</li>
            <li> I had Homedics that was replaces 3 times and it was a great idea but just never worked very long..</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin really clean and evens out the pores.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling smooth and the appearance has really gotten better.</li>
            <li> Since using the Pretika, however, the cotton pad has been completely clean -- with no makeup residue!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Skin super clean, smooth.   </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Now while this isn&#x27;t the product that I ordered... It does clean well..</li>
            <li> &gt; Clean the brush</li>
            <li> I find that I can clean my face well without the use of this brush.</li>
            <li> but nothing has gotten my face as clean as this brush.</li>
            <li> So I just clean mine in the dishwasher.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, it&#x27;s still working very well after more than a year.  </li>
            <li> Awesome, no problems and with the proper face wash will really clear up your face.</li>
            <li> Both get the job done, but if you have more sensitive skin another brush may be better for you.  </li>
            <li> I keep it in the shower and use it to clean my face with body gel.  </li>
            <li> Now after about three weeks of use I am having many positive comments from people who don&#x27;t even know I am using something.</li>
            <li> When i brought it in December I was excited love it clean face really well and inexpensive now in June</li>
            <li> special  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as good as a Clarisonic, and doesn&#x27;t have brush head choices, but it still leaves your face extra clean, well-exfoliated and softer and it&#x27;s a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> It is more like a brush rotating at a very high speed.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m really happy with the small improvements I was able to get on my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had to change my rating.</li>
            <li> WHEN IT DOES SUCH A GOOD JOB.</li>
            <li> Hence, full charge should be attained within 1 hour.  </li>
            <li> a full charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it with St Ives apricot scrub and aluminum oxide crystals for a true micro demabrasion treatment.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I enjoy using the machine,  My face feels tingly and fresh.  </li>
            <li> I have only used this item for about one month, but I see really good results already.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true the brush was harsher, but my skin became used to it</li>
            <li> and now it won&#x27;t stay on for the full one minute.</li>
            <li> I loved this brush, but it died the second week I had it.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t need the full 18 hours or whatever it says.</li>
            <li> /&gt;IMO, Fork out the extra $$ for the good version.</li>
            <li> Love it so much I bought another.</li>
            <li> It is deep cleansing, exfoliating, and good for spore also.</li>
            <li> I hear the Olay brush is good and is similarly priced but rotates instead of pulses.</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised at how nice my face feels after.  </li>
            <li> The same is true for this Pretika, and I&#x27;ve found that it does a really good job of cleansing.  </li>
            <li> I really, really wanted a rotating brush, but after using the Olay product, I was less than impressed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for over 3 weeks on the first charge, and it&#x27;s still going strong.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powerful and my skin feels extremely clean after use.</li>
            <li> I did not expect to see anything that quickly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Although many people think that the the Clarisonic is an exfoliator, it does NOT exfoliate; instead, it deep cleans your skin so that your skin care and anti-aging products can better penetrate the epidermis.  </li>
            <li> This company really went the extra distance to insure a happy customer experience.  </li>
            <li> my forehead would be super shiny.</li>
            <li> but if you want it to last you are better off spending more money for the clarisonic which has a 2 year warranty and truly is water proof.</li>
            <li> Luckily; I bought this from B&amp;B, so I returned it with digust.</li>
            <li> So I quickly emailed Pretika&#x27;s customer service about this and asked them what happened to my brush.</li>
            <li> A lot of people said their battery burned out quickly;</li>
            <li> My skin is now smooth and much more clear.</li>
            <li> Luckily it comes with 2.</li>
            <li> I was instantly excited to use it right away.</li>
            <li> I could not recommend this more highly.</li>
            <li> When I first tried the Pretika facial brush I loved it so much I bought 3 more for my family.</li>
            <li> The price is right, when it works it does a good job, but if you want a facebrush that&#x27;s disposable go to your local drugstore.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No complaint at all :-)</li>
            <li> I use Burt&#x27;s Bees Rosemary and Peppermint bar soap with my Pretika, and I get a nice exfoliation and deep clean.</li>
            <li> I am glad I purchased this very reasonably priced and capable alternative.</li>
            <li> :  make sure you also move the foam strip stuck on the defective battery to the new one.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have wrinkles yet, but I am sure it would help bring out fresher new skin.  </li>
            <li> I got the new one and am so pleased.  </li>
            <li> I was bummed and considered buying a new one however the more</li>
            <li> And now after using it for months, Im happy that it helped my skin becomes smoother, less acne breakouts</li>
            <li> Other than that I guess it would clean your face good.</li>
            <li> Absolute garbage!!</li>
            <li> It comes with a little stand which is great but</li>
            <li> I have never had more people comment on how glowy and bright my skin has looked lately.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too harsh and it feels really great on my skin.</li>
            <li> Amazing reduction of acne and cysts back there too!  </li>
            <li> love this so far....</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;m using it more and more, I&#x27;m wondering if it is too rough for my skin to be using it every day.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have to say I rarely write a review but feel the need here.  </li>
            <li> Whatever you choose Have Fun...</li>
            <li> The money was by no means worth the use for just one year.</li>
            <li> It also came with an extra brush, which I thought was a nice touch.</li>
            <li> Push it two times and it goes to a lighter force/pressure/function for more sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Worked great initially, but just completely died 8 months after purchase.</li>
            <li> this is honestly worth the price.</li>
            <li> I still have had no problems with it at all, so well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> While being recharged, the appropriate lights are on, but when you try to use it, the moving device is completely motionless.</li>
            <li> Its Much more soft and my makeup glides on.</li>
            <li> It is worth the money.</li>
            <li> with extra brush which is nice</li>
            <li> I got this brush thinking it would have a rotating head, but I guess I didn&#x27;t read the description correctly because it is simply the vibrating kind.  </li>
            <li> Larger brush than most, bristles are soft, yet effective.  </li>
            <li> And washing my face is actually fun for me.</li>
            <li> And the brush isn&#x27;t as powerful in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> For the money I would say the Pretika wins.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> The brush itself is really good, it has enough power to do a thorough cleaning but not so much that it hurts my skin</li>
            <li> I love the slower speed as I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and I thought this was worth the money.</li>
            <li> Simple and effective.</li>
            <li> So worth the money...</li>
            <li> Ergonomic and powerful.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have time to do the product review and can&#x27;t return or have it fixed any more.</li>
            <li> So that was exciting, but the charging issue was still there.</li>
            <li> The pad does not seem to abrasive and it is a sturdier brush than the Olay facial spinning brush, which I also own.  </li>
            <li> I stopped wearing makeup which was very hard to do because of my self esteem, used it twice a day faithfully sometimes 3 times a day, used cheap astringent, and a good moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I love it so far, as the brush heads are a good texture (not like the super-soft brushes other products have included).  </li>
            <li> So there are fewer breakouts if that area is kept very clean and free from facial oils.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t fathom paying more than $60 for something like this, so overall, I am very satisfied with the Pretika Sonic Dermabrasion Facial</li>
            <li> Another good thing about this brush is that you can recharge it unlike some other clarisonic alternatives like Olay&#x27;s brush which requires batteries.</li>
            <li> This product wouldn&#x27;t take a charge right out of the box.</li>
            <li> i use it once a day on the lowest setting and its the right amount for my skin.</li>
            <li> RIGHT AWAY,,,AND</li>
            <li> and I noticed a difference right away.</li>
            <li> Since the word &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; is right there in the name, and it advertises &amp;#34;Micro-Pulsating Vibration Cleansing&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Now the cord plugs right into the bottom of the brush.  </li>
            <li> Because I use mine twice a day, I purchased a set of the replacement brushes right away.</li>
            <li> Found the right cleanser for me but still had some flakes.</li>
            <li> Also, you notice the difference in your skin right away.</li>
            <li> Broke right away and the company wouldn&#x27;t replace it for me.</li>
            <li> I purchased one brush for myself as an alternative of the clarisonic and it worked great for the first few weeks.  </li>
            <li> Really made a difference in how clean I can get my face.</li>
            <li> I asked her what did she do to keep her skin looking so smooth and vibrant.</li>
            <li> The brush is smooth even on high speed.  </li>
            <li> , I dry it after each use, I don&#x27;t leave it in the charger unless I am charging it, and I LOVE it!  </li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m happy to have had the opportunity to try it out before investing in the more expensive Clairsonic, I don&#x27;t believe the cost is worth a short-term trial.</li>
            <li> Because the first one worked as described &amp;#34;Featuring Micro-Pulsating Vibration Cleansing Technology&amp;#34; and so much cheaper than the Clarisonic brand, I was excited to purchase a replacement.</li>
            <li> this is a great little exfoliating brush at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Hope they will send me a new one and it is fabulous.</li>
            <li> I bought the Pretika spin brush for the good price and because as a black man, my facial skin can easily break out from ingrown hairs if I don&#x27;t clean thoroughly.</li>
            <li> Found the Pretika Sonic Dermabrasion Facial Brush on Amazon at a great price &amp; after using just once my skin truly was different!</li>
            <li> The Pretika facial brush is a high-tech replacement for the good old flannel and bar of soap.</li>
            <li> Also, it appears that several reviewers have experienced problems likely caused by moisture in the cradle.</li>
            <li> This is a gentle but effective way to deeply cleanse and exfoliate.  </li>
            <li> Seems clean well without the high sticker price.</li>
            <li> Got this \\&quot;very fast from Amazon\\</li>
            <li> It arrived very fast without any problems.</li>
            <li> What a difference this brush has made on my complexion and at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Such a bummer, since it scrubbed my skin very smooth.  </li>
            <li> This was very much appreciated.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brush does not spin - it vibrates, so it&#x27;s very gentle</li>
            <li> 90 days , but were very nice, replaced it, but now, 100 days later, it stopped working, &amp; now is turning itself on in the middle of the night!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to use my new pretika.  </li>
            <li> My skin felt soft and clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> The good news is that it&#x27;s very easy to avoid these problems: just dry the brush with a towel after use and store it in a dry place, and make sure you never set it into its cradle if it&#x27;s wet.    </li>
            <li> At the same time that I started using this, I also started using Skin Laboratory&#x27;s Lactic 35% &amp; Glycolic 25% Combo Gel Peel, and the two products have made a huge difference in my skin!  </li>
            <li> My wife bought this product over competition that is more than double the price.  </li>
            <li> As most reviewers already posted, it does a terrific job doing its intended purpose.  </li>
            <li> As for the charge, I charged mine fully the first day.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush because the bristles aren&#x27;t wimpy!</li>
            <li> The first day she used it, there was a noticeable difference.  </li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Smooth and soft like never before, except maybe when I was a baby.</li>
            <li> I wanted to buy the Clarsonic, but I wasn&#x27;t willing to fork up the money for it.</li>
            <li> and it is still running on the first charge.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had to charge it at all since I first bought it.  </li>
            <li> The blackheads that I&#x27;ve always had on my nose are gone for the first time ever, and my skin looks radiant and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would have given this product 5 stars except for the fact that the contact metal parts in the recharger rusted on the first day</li>
            <li> Based on my experience I went back and re-read reviews, and realized that most of the glowing reviews are based on using the brush for a couple of days up to a month.</li>
            <li> Find it effective - although the brush is too rough.  </li>
            <li> This has been wonderful for my acne and the overall appearance of my skin, NO more acne...</li>
            <li> I have no idea the exact date I bought this</li>
            <li> got mine, charged it &amp; used for 1 whole week!  </li>
            <li> I use glytone skin care products, and the brush definitely helps my skin better absorb them.</li>
            <li> I even go a step further, and place a plastic ziploc bag over the charging cradle while i wash my face, to make sure i dont splash water on it.</li>
            <li> I recently bought 3 more for presents.</li>
            <li> It comes with two brushes and I am still on the first brush.</li>
            <li> This will only make your skin peel even more because it&#x27;s tearing at it rather than just polishing it.</li>
            <li> I have the Olay one now, and it does so much better and actually works.</li>
            <li> The entire inside was corroded, but the light was still blinking!  </li>
            <li> The first time it stopped working within 2 or 3 months.</li>
            <li> I used the first one for about 6 months before I dropped it and broke it.</li>
            <li> I really, really (really) wanted a Clarisonic!</li>
            <li> i simply love this facial brush!!</li>
            <li> I seem to be a bit more red and ruddy now, but just slightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first time it just stopped charging correctly and I had to throw it away.</li>
            <li> But instead of getting an inexpensive SONIC brush I received a pretty fancy ROTATING brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pretty confident it will last.  </li>
            <li> first brush (identical at first glance) vibrated and did not rotate.  </li>
            <li> It looks like I have used it for quite some time, not just for the first time.</li>
            <li> It still charges up, it still holds a charge, and the bristles hold pretty well still</li>
            <li> &gt; Charge it for atleast 1 hour the first time</li>
            <li> The first one lasted 60 days before it stopped working.</li>
            <li> Since using for about 3 weeks now, my skin feels so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Love the way my skin feels after I use the facial brush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Follow the rules for the first charge.</li>
            <li> I top it all off with skin cream with 30 SPF for day, and a wrinkle reducing moisturizer such as ROC at night.    </li>
            <li> Tonight, I used the Pretika for the first time</li>
            <li> Returning it, and going to order a Clarisonic, which I should have done in the first place.</li>
            <li> My wife used this for 10 months without a problem, then she said she had just used it in the shower for the first time.</li>
            <li> my first facial Brush is Pretica.purchased about more then a year</li>
            <li> I used it the first day that I received it.</li>
            <li> They could make this face brush better by improving the charging system, so that it can be used and left in the shower.</li>
            <li> MY skin feels so soft and smooth after using with a grainy scrub.</li>
            <li> I love the product while it worked especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I first received this brush</li>
            <li> The first one I purchasrd worked well 2 yrs ago, when it died</li>
            <li> I love this brush, it is sorta big brush but works well.</li>
            <li> I wish there were more options on the actual brush heads the way clarisonic does.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently looking for a a more reliable brush.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe when I receive the first of 2 of these....</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this facial brush.  </li>
            <li> do not recommend this product for people with sensitive skin or people who have acne filled with pus.  </li>
            <li> the first one I had.</li>
            <li> The first 2 weeks I had it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this brush for about four years but during the first year the charging problem began.  </li>
            <li> but its movement is more noticeable to the naked eye</li>
            <li> Her face was smooth, clear, and glowing.  </li>
            <li> When you first get it, you MUST allow the brush to charge fully for 24 hours</li>
            <li> I love this facial brush!</li>
            <li> Within the first 3 months three out of four units stopped working.</li>
            <li> First one died after three weeks of use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d love to tell you that it made a difference, but it hasn&#x27;t - perhaps I need to try a different cleanser?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just remember to charge it once a week (on a dresser higher than your dog can reach)</li>
            <li> Within a week, my face cleared up immensely and I was able to wear makeup again.</li>
            <li> If you need more cleaning, just turn it back on.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and will definitely buy another one, when this one needs replacing.</li>
            <li> But I found that it would charge again, but not stay charged consistently.</li>
            <li> But still no guarantee it&#x27;ll work consistently.</li>
            <li> (unfortunately I do not have the model number) charges from the stand, which makes sense.</li>
            <li> I tried it, and the spinning, although I&#x27;m sure it deep cleans, it much harsher and pulls my skin to the right.  </li>
            <li> It broke within a month despite the fact that I took great care to keep it as dry as possible.</li>
            <li> Instead, I make sure my skin is wet and soapy, then I use my Pretika like a super scrubby washcloth.  </li>
            <li> I have breakouts on my 38 year old skin, as well as hyperpigmentation, and I am happy to say my breakouts, which seem to be bumps (build up of dead skin) under the skin are almost gone, and the hyperpigmentation is getting better with each daily use.  </li>
            <li> Right out of the box, this facial brush was easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I have kept the same one very clean since the start</li>
            <li> I considered the popular &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; brand but decided to try this brand due to the rave reviews.</li>
            <li> AFTER JUST ONE USE MY SKIN FELT SMOOTHER, CLEANER, AND ACTUALLY HAD A FRESH GLOW!!</li>
            <li> seriously why pay $200 when this one works great</li>
            <li> When it worked, my skin was soft and clean and I saw a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> The brush is soft and my face feels clean after using it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved the Pretika Facial Brush and used it religiously until it stopped working around 2 months after I purchased it...</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s what I love: The Pretika facial brush really scrubs away all makeup.</li>
            <li> I like to use this not only on facial but good on the feet also  </li>
            <li> , it does not hold a full charge and has not helped a full charge since I got it even after following all the directions!</li>
            <li> They work very well, and are very reasonable.</li>
            <li> It seems like it has smoothed fine lines, cleans deep, shrinks pores and leaves my face soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Why pay over a $100.00 more for another brand unit unless you just like spending more of your money so you can name drop, if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> With these positive reviews, I decided to get 1.</li>
            <li> stand is just pretty much just to store it.</li>
            <li> I have been a customer of Amazon for a long time and have bought many items</li>
            <li> I was interested in the clairsonic microdermabrasion brush but couldn&#x27;t justify paying that much to try a product.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t trust this being kept in a shower or even in a really steamy bathroom, but that&#x27;s based off other reviews and not my own experience.</li>
            <li> Maybe if replaced I can write a more long term review.</li>
            <li> This is just as good, if not better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it is 100% as good as a Clarisonic since I&#x27;ve never used one before</li>
            <li> I turned it on, right out of the box, and got excited because it seemed to have the same power as the clarisonic.</li>
            <li> Only good thing is that it was cheap, so I didn&#x27;t waste too much money.</li>
            <li> &quot; a few days ago, and so far I am just loving it!  </li>
            <li> than I make for sure that the metal is completely dry before charging again.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m less than thrilled with this brush.</li>
            <li> When it needs to be recharged I will make sure it is completely dry before putting it on the power stand.</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with this facial scrubber until it stopped working after only 2 months!</li>
            <li> only thing it take s time to get use to the brush as it move very quickly</li>
            <li> recharge it is easy and last along time  </li>
            <li> It is super loud.</li>
            <li> It has a pretty crappy rubber cover for the hole where you charge it, and even though i made a point to make sure it was closed before each use, i still had to drain out rusty water each night.</li>
            <li> Followed all instructions and even made sure it was completely dry before charging as some reviews suggested.  </li>
            <li> So taking good care of it will definitely benefit you in the long run.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t pulse it just spins strongly and has two different settings.</li>
            <li> All and all this product is a good product, But beware you only have a 30day  limited warranty and anything</li>
            <li> The second time it was working fine until it just stopped turning on no matter</li>
            <li> It seemed to have pretty decent  reviews, so I got it for my daughter for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I just wish it was a little more powerful.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve dropped it in the shower really hard a good couple of times</li>
            <li> IT REALLY FEELS LIKE</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t precisely say if this is the link above is the correct one.  </li>
            <li> This is a fantastic facial brush.</li>
            <li> It is much cheaper than the Clarisonic.  </li>
            <li> I recommend it highly!</li>
            <li> and my face stays moisturized for much longer than ever before.</li>
            <li> Pretika&#x27;s customer service was very helpful answering my questions.</li>
            <li> really well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That being said, I really don&#x27;t know how much longer this brush will last.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE ON 12/26/10:  I just received a Clarisonic Mia for Christmas, and the difference between the Clarisonic and the Pretika brush are very noticeable.  </li>
            <li> The Clarisonic brush is *much* softer, and the sonic vibrations are much stronger.  </li>
            <li> For just over twice the cost of this brush, you can have a much nicer</li>
            <li> one.over twice the cost of this brush, you can have a much nicer one.</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t really get any microdermabrasion happening until I add baking soda.</li>
            <li> Morning I use the gentle setting and just the soap.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin with a very oily forehead.</li>
            <li> I also get very flaky around my chin and nose</li>
            <li> - I don&#x27;t think the manufacturers expect it to work much longer than that.     </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it every night for two weeks, and there is zero makeup residue when I use toner (gentle toner</li>
            <li> before this my forehead and tzone were very oily.</li>
            <li> but i see a real improvement in my skin.     </li>
            <li> , my face is so much cleaner</li>
            <li> She really likes it.</li>
            <li> My skin,its smooth and my pores are smaller...</li>
            <li> I cant really afford to buy a Clairsonic</li>
            <li> I wish I had thought of returning it while I still could but too much time has passed...</li>
            <li> I wish I could find Pretika MD170 for a reasonable price,</li>
            <li> the scrubber I used before this one, but it looks like they discontinued it and now want to charge way to much for it.</li>
            <li> I really like the brush.</li>
            <li> I am now using the product on the gentle setting twice a day</li>
            <li> and it really works for me.</li>
            <li> My face is much cleaner using this product then from washing with cleanser alone.</li>
            <li> but this product works well for me at a much lower price.</li>
            <li> I was very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> Thanks 😃</li>
            <li> You really cannot beat the price.  </li>
            <li> I cant afford much</li>
            <li> So the only alternative I have to that is just a light touch to your skin.</li>
            <li> I have had this about 8 months, does very well for me.</li>
            <li> It really made a difference.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all guesswork because they don&#x27;t really tell you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Debi</li>
            <li> I like the fast speed&lt;br</li>
            <li> so can&#x27;t really say how it works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got really oily skin, so oily in fact that come afternoon</li>
            <li> maybe I&#x27;d get a real Clarisonic when it died.</li>
            <li> but I really wished it pulsed too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read several reviews on this brush that recommend spending a few dollars more to get a better one</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> Instead of a mechanism much like any rechargeable tooth brush the brush unit have to be connected much like a mobile phone or portable boombox.  </li>
            <li> It makes your face feel very refreshed after each use.</li>
            <li> I like this product so much.</li>
            <li> I like the way it worked so much</li>
            <li> The Pretika worked very well in the beginning</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!      </li>
            <li> I have used the clairsonic, and did not like it as much as the pretika.</li>
            <li> plugged in so it is always ready for use.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that if I insist too much, I over exfoliate, and it leads to irritation.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but you can really feel the difference.  </li>
            <li> Just let it ride gently around your face - don&#x27;t pull at your skin.  </li>
            <li> It feels &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; but not in a drying way, it all really depends on your skin type.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never experienced GREAT customer service like this before.</li>
            <li> I have really began to concentrate on skin care.</li>
            <li> so I won&#x27;t buy again unless it was much cheaper, like $10 I would buy again</li>
            <li> Really efficient face brush cleaner.</li>
            <li> So I have to say for the price it works really well.</li>
            <li> Worked better than expected.</li>
            <li> I charge it fully, hit the button and nothing happens, just a blinking red light.</li>
            <li> Oh, BTW, shipping was very prompt, too.</li>
            <li> However, when it rotates, it feels too much for my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After using the Pretika every night, my face feels soooo much smoother and cleaner.  </li>
            <li> and i noticed my skin was really improving.</li>
            <li> I swear, this thing is either really crappy or possessed.</li>
            <li> i need to refund her money and buy her the real thing..</li>
            <li> Really like it wish it has a pumice stone brush thing.</li>
            <li> didnt make  much difference to my skin</li>
            <li> I tried everything and nothing worked very well</li>
            <li> Brush heads are also very inexpensive, compared to the Clarisonic.  </li>
            <li> Then apply a gentle cleanser made for daily exfoliation all over face (avoiding eye area), wet brush (a good quality rechargeable brush) gently allow the brush to do</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very concerned about my looks</li>
            <li> It really cleans my face.</li>
            <li> Love this so far, will update later as to the product quality!</li>
            <li> last week someone asked me if i was wearing make up because my skin was so clear : )</li>
            <li> It did however work nice for the few days before it tanked out on me.</li>
            <li> so i am not going to waste that kind of money</li>
            <li> When I use mine, the contacts don&#x27;t really get wet, but just in case, I wipe it with a cloth to be sure.</li>
            <li> Like most of the others, I had a professional facial</li>
            <li> I am still on the first brush and it looks brand new...</li>
            <li> Please be aware to purchase a adaptor plug if you live in the UK though.</li>
            <li> After each use, one for cleansing and one for lotion, I rinse the brushes under hot water, and they are still like new.</li>
            <li> My skin care products are more readily asorbed into the skin because of the stimulation and cleansing of my face due to this product.</li>
            <li> I use Clean and Clear Foaming Cleanser for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> The result is extremely clean skin, no irritation, and a much brighter facial tone.  </li>
            <li> This is quite different from those of you who are familiar with rechargeable</li>
            <li> My husband told me the other day that my skin looked fantastic!  </li>
            <li> I had dropped it many other times with no effect</li>
            <li> Whether the battery is drained or full I still get a green light.  </li>
            <li> *not* reduce wrinkles, but will rather just deep clean your skin.)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I liked it, it seemed to work well, but didn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used a Clairsonic, because I&#x27;m cheap, but after reading lots of reviews I&#x27;ve found the Pretika is compared favourably, with the exception that the bristles are a little harder, so not as good for sensitive skin.    </li>
            <li> It also would spontaneously start in the middle of the night, and was loud enough to wake up the whole house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dont</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this as a much cheaper alternative to the clarisonic, which I wanted but couldn&#x27;t bring myself to spend the money on.</li>
            <li> you the first time buyer,lets say you have found the right Facial Brush Pretica.go for it.&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li> You could get an expensive facial brush or you can get this one at a great price and it is fantastic.</li>
            <li> It is actually really easy to use, but, as others have said, not in the shower; must be kept dry inside!  </li>
            <li> Even though it worked well and made my skin ok, it&#x27;s not worth it</li>
            <li> Love this brush...had an expensive Clarisonic, but this brush works so much better and is much lighter.</li>
            <li> (My first brush was 2 years old when I broke it....</li>
            <li> One full charge last you 45 one minute washes.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean...just pop the brush head off, wash it with mild soap....let it completely dry and then pop it back on.</li>
            <li> Be sure to read the other reviews; I wish I had before purchasing!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great with the timer, so it&#x27;s not too long or to short cleaning in order not to worry about the skin gets dry with overdo.</li>
            <li> Who do I have to call or email to return this or to exchange for a new one?!</li>
            <li> The new design is defective!</li>
            <li> This one is crazy amazing, the brush head now spins!!</li>
            <li> I liked the product for a couple of months, although my skin never felt as clean as other more expensive brands (which I now use).</li>
            <li> I missed it so much, I bought a new one.</li>
            <li> I soak it in a dixie cup of water occasionally and all of the product that hasn&#x27;t rinsed off will float off and it&#x27;s clean as new.</li>
            <li> The only way to get the unit working is to plug in the charger (pretika side), unplug it and quickly turn on the device.  </li>
            <li> Love it, but this is the third time I buy this item, and stops working after a month of daily use.</li>
            <li> Initially I was pleased that I saved money on the Pretika SonicDermabrashion Facial Brush until it wound up in the trash can.  </li>
            <li> This should be a no brainer, but I read the reviews and well, I felt the need to chime in on this particular issue.</li>
            <li> What I do not like is the machine is WHITE (that&#x27;s OK) but the plug and cord are BACK.  </li>
            <li> It made my skin super dehydrated and coarse because it over exfoliated.  </li>
            <li> So this is probably a better option than the Olay brush or similar ones you see in the facial care aisle in the department</li>
            <li> Love this facial brush - actually</li>
            <li> The unit gradually stopped vibrating effectively, and after a few months, it completely stopped rotating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely going to buy something similar from a more trustworthy brand.</li>
            <li> your face and neck feels vibrant.  </li>
            <li> It has smoothed out some older bumps, but doesn&#x27;t make them disappear.....</li>
            <li> Also, another way to ensure the charging contacts don&#x27;t rust would be to keep it out of the bathroom, particularly if you use the base/holder because condensation would collect in the holder and the metal would rust.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an older unit that stopped working.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this particular one for over a year now</li>
            <li> I mainly bought this to use as part of my night time regimen.  </li>
            <li> Love using this with my facial cleanser, it feels so good.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend use on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m  suppose to be able to use it in the shower it should be somewhat more difficult to brake</li>
            <li> Luckily, I scraped off the rust and it came back to life.</li>
            <li> It does a decent job of removing makeup/</li>
            <li> well, not too strong or rough on skin while rotating.</li>
            <li> Really gets deep down and cleans my pores and leaves skin feeling clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li> highly recommended.</li>
            <li> so started to charge it when it started emitting this high pitched whine.</li>
            <li> the machine is designed to turn off automatically on the high setting after your treatment is up.     </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I rates this high at the beginning,  not</li>
            <li> but my friend says it&#x27;s comparable without the high price tag.</li>
            <li> I always use the high.</li>
            <li> Bristles are super soft, exfoliates very well, holds facial cleanser</li>
            <li> This does what you think it will but just a little bit better.  </li>
            <li> Had I researched it a little better rather than going off the advice from my derm.</li>
            <li> There are many features that I appreciate about this little machine.  </li>
            <li> My advice is not to bother with the pretika, just wait and save a little more for the clarisonic.</li>
            <li> There is a gentle mode for every day cleaning AND an exfoliating mode, which works excellent to remove dead skin and tough dirt.  </li>
            <li> It does clean my face, and battery life is very long.</li>
            <li> The unit that I got always show a &#x27;green&#x27; light during charging and never showed the &#x27;red&#x27; blinking light.</li>
            <li> So far, I am really amazed with this product</li>
            <li> My 15 year old daughter says \\&quot;I want one too\\&quot; I was not about to spend that much money on her or let her use mine</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and gentle to my face.</li>
            <li> I contacted the company directly and after much to do</li>
            <li> Sometimes I use it with a dry clean face.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s flattering that no one ever knows how old I really am.</li>
            <li> I rotate it in gentle circles, avoiding sensitive areas like just under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll be sure to update this review again to see it holds up longer than just a few</li>
            <li> I definitely got my moneys worth</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use any face wash, just my normal body soap-DOVE.  </li>
            <li> I love this and use if everyday&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I started out using the brush once a day at night with my normal Bliss cleanser</li>
            <li> It does heavy vibration, but I do wish the brush was more softer.</li>
            <li> Truthfully I didn&#x27;t even use it that often because it was so harsh on my face</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t use it in the shower, make sure that it is dried after each use to prevent rusting.</li>
            <li> It was a nice run while i had it but not worth the price if it will only work for 2 months.</li>
            <li> The first one is fast, the second control is slower, tho</li>
            <li> Did make it through the warranty period, but only because it was rarely used.  </li>
            <li> This is my first facial brush and it works really well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall it is an economical facial cleansing system.</li>
            <li> It does not take any longer than normal to wash your face.  </li>
            <li> I think the Pretika is here to stay because I love the firm brush heads.</li>
            <li> I had to contact Pretika because of time that had passed, they said normally they wouldn &#x27;t replace as it was beyond.</li>
            <li> Well after the third drop it pretty much stopped working.</li>
            <li> A slot at the back of the stand will also be useful</li>
            <li> Make sure the brush is completely dry before setting back to charge!!</li>
            <li> and I make sure that it is completely dry befor putting back on the charger.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this product right before a vacation and charged it before I packed it; 10 days later it was still working without an additional charging.</li>
            <li> Remember clean face with a  regular gentle facial cleaner before using the brush.  </li>
            <li> This recent one was purchased for my daughter at her request as she dropped the first one I got her a few too many times.  </li>
            <li> so I honestly can&#x27;t speak for how long this will last with proper care.</li>
            <li> I bought this one 16 months ago and was at first worried it would die right away like some other reviewers stated.  </li>
            <li> NEW buyers]&lt;br /&gt;Buy</li>
            <li> This is to condition the new battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it along with a new face wash, moisturizer, and the Glycolic Acid 35%.</li>
            <li> suck got to buy a new one I will not buy pretik product again .</li>
            <li> I ordered a new one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 43 and live in a tropical climate, however, I don&#x27;t like to spend money on facials.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t image n to live with out it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to buy a new unit.</li>
            <li> This one is new and improved.</li>
            <li> but I could live without</li>
            <li> I had a pretika for 5 years and it died the new one stopped working after one use</li>
            <li> It was such a disappointment, since I thought I had found the perfect skin care tool.</li>
            <li> If the description was honest I&#x27;d likely hold off on a review for a few weeks and give it a rating based on results/if it broke after a week/etc.</li>
            <li> The brush speed is not as smooth as the initial one I bought, and it died last month.</li>
            <li> this one doesn&#x27;t run as long and also not sure if it is the pads or the machine itself doesn&#x27;t do as good of a job of scrubbing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s embarrassing to be an older adult with skin issues, but I&#x27;m in Perimenopause</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this PRETIKA for anyone wishing to obtain a deep clean of facial skin.</li>
            <li> I have very, very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> very soft the skin.</li>
            <li> The brushes are very soft and gentile on your skin.</li>
            <li> The bottom line is, while the Clairsonic is much more expensive, it sounds like it&#x27;s actually a more sensible economic choice for anyone who plans to continue to use sonic dermabrasion over the long term.</li>
            <li> I use it 2x daily with my usual cleanser and microdermabrasion srub once weekly, and it leaves my face beautifully clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li> The head is large enough to use on my rough knees and elbows, leaving them smooth.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I like the way the brush is gentle to clean, then after you rinse and dry - put on moisturizer with the sponge, it actually does help your skin accept it</li>
            <li> First thing that I have ever received from Amazon that was total junk.</li>
            <li> I have had it for about a year, use it every other day and have used it with many different cleansers.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that fine wrinkles and black heads have been dissapearing.</li>
            <li> However, when I recharged it for the first time, it quit working properly.  </li>
            <li> Operation is pretty basic.</li>
            <li> And the topical medication that I use to keep my face clear sinks in farther and works 8x better.</li>
            <li> so far!...</li>
            <li> I am returning my second one, the first one broke after about a week.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After each treatment ( I used hot water to soften the facial brush before applying to my face with soap)</li>
            <li> it was pretty obvious what had happened.</li>
            <li> I purchased the first one at Marshall&#x27;s for about the same money as Amazon, the item lasted 4 months.</li>
            <li> Also, the first brush would turn itself on in the middle of the night.  </li>
            <li> Then after I charged it the first time, I noticed the charge only lasted a 2 days.</li>
            <li> From the first time I used it, my face responded to the deep cleaning.</li>
            <li> The first couple of days, I had a couple of dry, hard patches on my face that were kind of scaly and peeling.</li>
            <li> I always charge it after it hasn&#x27;t been used for a day, to make sure it&#x27;s dry, and I also store it in a dry place, as per instructions.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its not as gentle as the older model and when I called the company they said the feed back from customers was the reason they changed it.</li>
            <li> So if you do use this product, Do not press down, lightly press to your skin.</li>
            <li> When first using the brush, I break out a lot, as the brush brings the pimples to the surface and uncovers them, a similar thing happens with acne medicne, it sluffs off the old skin and exposes the new acne underneath.</li>
            <li> Topical medications were not working that great due to all the oil and dead skin.</li>
            <li> Night I use the strong setting and add baking soda to my trouble area.  </li>
            <li> I made a special effort to keep the charging port area extremely dry/not exposed to any elements but that did not help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it once a day (at night, to deep clean and get rid of my makeup) and am still using the sensitive setting, but the brush feels really soft and it hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Today, I emailed Sonic asking where can I buy a new charger since I seemed to have misplaced it, they said they would send me a free charger.  </li>
            <li> IF you place the brush back on the UNPLUGGED cradle, you must make sure that the entire brush handle is bone DRY</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this brush actually made my face dry out and become flaky instead of smooth.</li>
            <li> I bought this knowing that several reviewers said theirs stopped working after a certain amount of time.  </li>
            <li> I feel the unit is a bit large and should be a bit smaller for all the curves of the face.</li>
            <li> But the little charger prong doesn&#x27;t even fit all the way through so its no use.</li>
            <li> My first one died and my face didn&#x27;t feel as clean only a few weeks after.</li>
            <li> This is my second Pretika Brush, I accidently left the first in a pool of water....not advised!  </li>
            <li> This is my second Pretika facial brush , I had the first one for years!</li>
            <li> skin is a bit hard to exfoliate so this brush really helps to get the smooth effect afterwards.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment much on battery life yet as I just fixed it last week.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin and tried everything to get clear skin, nothing worked.</li>
            <li> Used on my shoulders for a week for those bumps and they stayed clear for a year.</li>
            <li> ,My skin is clear and shines.</li>
            <li> This combination has kept my face clear for over a month.  </li>
            <li> my face was clear of bumps.</li>
            <li> They need to clear up some quality control/manufacturing problems.</li>
            <li> It has helped brighten my skin, clear up blemishes</li>
            <li> ITS DONE CHARGING WHEN THE LIGHT GOES GREEN.</li>
            <li> WOW IS ALL I CAN SAY...</li>
            <li> JUST WOW</li>
            <li> sure you get a replacement battery that is at least 500mAh rating&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> the status light &#x27;Green&#x27;</li>
            <li> Then, if you have sensitive skin as I do, don&#x27;t overuse.</li>
            <li> and my skin is so soft and impurities non-existent.</li>
            <li> B000F0GNT2 DermaNew Facial Rejuvenation System has a cleansing Brush and real crystal cream that works.</li>
            <li> It works very well for a deep face scrubber.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> B003FP86SK IQ Natural Microdermabrasion Exfoliate Crystals Aluminum Oxide 1.5oz]]</li>
            <li> I compared at least 4 others and decided this one is the closest to the clarisonic which is more than twice the price.  </li>
            <li> I like the whole idea of sonic facial brush.</li>
            <li> I apply the cleanser to my face first, not directly on the pretika....</li>
            <li> The facial brush systems really do work</li>
            <li> The brush is soft but it cleans my face well.</li>
            <li> I got the SonicDermabrasion for Christmas 2009 - and on December 16 2010 it stopped working completely.</li>
            <li> To be 42 years old and walk out with out any makeup says a lot about a product.</li>
            <li> and I would recommend this to anyone who has acne prone - sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> My face looks feels so soft.  </li>
            <li> IT RETAINS WATER AND SHOOTS OUT BROWN OLD WATER ONTO YOUR FACE.</li>
            <li> My father opened it up to fix it and the inside was completely corroded.</li>
            <li> I researched the Clarisonic and decided I couldn&#x27;t pay that much for a facial tool.  </li>
            <li> After about two to three weeks of this it completely died.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t even have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> But used with caution, I&#x27;d still recommend it to people whose skin isn&#x27;t overly sensitive.    </li>
            <li> Also, an added unexpected bonus, wrinkles I had are deminishing tremendously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am 35 with a natural T-zone oil issue.  </li>
            <li> The extra firm brush head is still soft and doesn&#x27;t scratch, but it does a better job at scrubbing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even think the loud vibrations add any cleaning effects.</li>
            <li> and my skin is baby soft after I use it.</li>
            <li> The charge does not hold longer than 24 hours and when the head rotates, it makes a really loud grinding noise.</li>
            <li> This thing is going straight back to Walmart.</li>
            <li> The product does the job and is not harsh.</li>
            <li> which is a bit sensitive.</li>
            <li> I got this for my 14 year old stepdaughter after I got myself a Susan Lucci set.  </li>
            <li> but so far I like it.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Reading the title &amp;#34;SonicDermabrasion&amp;#34; lead me to believe that this was a sonic action</li>
            <li> It no longer has that loud beep every 30 seconds or so.  </li>
            <li> This thing is not water proof- do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> So far, I have not used the unit in the shower, just at the sink on my face.  </li>
            <li> I have never heard mine beep, but how big of a deal is that really?</li>
            <li> Not even two months old</li>
            <li> I bought this item off of Amazon because it was by far the cheapest place I found it for sale</li>
            <li> a Clarisonic Plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles on this brush are much stiffer than the brushes on the Clarisonic Deep Pore and even Body brushes.  </li>
            <li> It moves in much the same way as the Clarisonic</li>
            <li> how soft they are even without comparing them to this one.  </li>
            <li> they have changed something from my old pretika.</li>
            <li> I am in my 20s with sensitive, acne prone skin and the brush head has worked well for me.</li>
            <li> Unlike some of the others, I don&#x27;t have an oily T-zone or acne issues, but I am 61 years old and am still plagued with blackheads on my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Product arrived complete.  </li>
            <li> This by far is the dumbest design I have ever seen with a rechargeable item.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The battery is dead, Pretika uses the same battery with most cordless telephones.</li>
            <li> After only a few weeks it wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge any more.</li>
            <li> Definately a good substitute for the expensive brands.</li>
            <li> the brush is way more thick and soft.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ve ever used a real Clarisonic you know what I mean when I say there is a huge difference.</li>
            <li> My face always feels so clean and tight when I am done.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so clean and tight and soaks up any product I use afterwards.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other battery powered brushes, but this is larger, and definitely has more</li>
            <li> A lot of reviews were warning about it braking down easily, but I wasn&#x27;t gonna pay over 200$ for some fancy product that would basically do the same job.&lt;br /&gt;  </li>
            <li> so I will only use it every other day, but after almost a week of use it has made a huge difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I haven&#x27;t been able to find replacement brushes at a decent price</li>
            <li> This is my second Pretika Facial Brush (my first one got lost during a recent move) and it really makes a difference in the smoothness of my skin.</li>
            <li> I make sure it is very dry before placing back in the recharger like other reviewers have suggested and found that this is not hard to do.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve only had my Pretika for about a week, so I will be sure to update this review since several people have commented that it breaks down after a month or two.  </li>
            <li> keeps my face clean scrubbing the dead skins off</li>
            <li> I started out the first day only with the low setting.  </li>
            <li> it has been acting funny the last week or so.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t work the same as the older one I will b returning</li>
            <li> It only worked for two second in my first time use.</li>
            <li> I have a similar product that I like and thought I was buying another one just like it for a friend, however the main difference is in the charging.</li>
            <li> Unless some previous comments, I found the brush very soft and just the right length for the purpose.  </li>
            <li> But now I only use the high setting and it takes about 3 or 4 re-starts to finish the job.  </li>
            <li> High and low settings.</li>
            <li> Works as expected, very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Now, the motor is starting to sound strange and laboured while I use it, and I suspect it will stop working permanently before too long.</li>
            <li> first wet the bristles thoroughly to soften them.</li>
            <li> First, the bristles are SO ROUGH</li>
            <li> I never put it in the cradle wet, I followed the instructions exactly.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is too harsh at all, and I use it on full force about 2x/day.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product over others I have tried where the brushes are too soft to be effective or they run on batteries (too expensive) or they don&#x27;t stand up to the water which inevitably gets on the machine.</li>
            <li> I was hoping that something that looks like it could be named Turbo Face Blaster 5000 would rough up my skin a little more.</li>
            <li> Leaves silly smooth skin at first try!</li>
            <li> I am able to mimic the little \\&quot;scrubbing sand\\&quot; particles in Proactive minus the chemicals.  </li>
            <li> other reviewers, I really wanted to buy a Clarisonic brush, but couldn&#x27;t justify spending that much on a tool that is essentially just a glorified face cleaner.  </li>
            <li> so I returned it and got a new one that lasted about the same time and</li>
            <li> The Pretika gets rid of the dry, flaky skin, and leaves my skin feeling really</li>
            <li> once I let the insides dry out, much like drying a cellphone after dropping it in a pool.</li>
            <li> The previous one I bought on HSN some 5 or so years ago only vibrated, but this one actually spins giving more deep cleansing power.</li>
            <li> The light will indicate that it is fully charged but the second you unplug it the battery is dead against without any use.</li>
            <li> The whole brush spins so I can get beside my nose unlike the clarasonic that only spins in the middle.  </li>
            <li> When I plug the unit in to charge it, the light immediately glows green but the charge does not last.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really rotate as such, rather it vibrates 300 times per second.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item because it seemed to function much like the much higher priced Clairsonic (not sure of spelling).  </li>
            <li> Its useless its only good in one use then</li>
            <li> Breaks down in a month, you can only get one full charge from the product.</li>
            <li> I do know that after cleaning my skin with this, there is a major difference in feeling.</li>
            <li> it would be a major improvement.</li>
            <li> I dont see any major improvements in my skin</li>
            <li> It seems to hold a charge well and has made a major difference in the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> I was okay with the fact that I would be getting a sonic facial brush for about $30 that might only last a few months.</li>
            <li> It seems better than the Olay face brush since it&#x27;s rechargeable and probably equally water-resistant at only a few extra dollars (but money saved in batteries), along with having variable speeds.</li>
            <li> A full charge lasts several months and their is a little plug over the charging port that needs to be kept in place to keep water out.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still not as secure as we like, but at least it&#x27;s not laying out on its side while being charged.</li>
            <li> then I have too, and I generally stick with the time it gives me for each face section.</li>
            <li> and I finally have clear skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this back in April &#x27;11 looking for something to help me clear up my skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is loud, that is the only issue I have with it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve cut back to using this just once a day on the sensitive setting since twice a day</li>
            <li> At some point I had left the brush in a damp area and the contacts at the bottom of the handle developed rust.</li>
            <li> Although I think this facial brush would work well for those who do not have sensitive skin or problems with cystic acne</li>
            <li> I did call the maufacturer for differnt heads for sensitive skin, but they only had the one set.</li>
            <li> The reacharching hole is barely covered by a piece of plastic, therefore I  dont see how the unit can be operate in the shower i havent tried it in the shower</li>
            <li> She used it for only a couple of months before it completely stopped functioning.  </li>
            <li> I bought this just to see if I wanted a clarisonic, so I bought a cheaper version of it especially because a majority of the reviews said it just completely stops working after a month.</li>
            <li> I kept it &amp; opened it back in June, charge it &amp; it went haywire, wouldn&#x27;t shut off, then completely stopped.</li>
            <li> and wow it is in another class entirely.</li>
            <li> My skin is only mildly sensitive.  </li>
            <li> So far my only issue is the stand.</li>
            <li> Only had it a week so far..</li>
            <li> I wish i would have spent the extra money in the first place for the clarisonic, since i&#x27;m now in the market for one.</li>
            <li> The heads can be a bit rough, but soaking them in hot water while pre-cleansing helps immensely</li>
            <li> Sad, because it was nice while it lasted.</li>
            <li> After a few uses, charging the battery didn&#x27;t even last through a full cycle.</li>
            <li> However I really love this brush it hasn&#x27;t broken at all</li>
            <li> i bought this because the clarisonic mia was too expensive, i still dont own one of those</li>
            <li> It is because so many false reviews are posted here.</li>
            <li> I like the Pretika because it vibrated like the more expensive models out there,but when I received the new one it now spins and vibrates.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only now shopping for a new unit as the brush is starting to wear.  </li>
            <li> I currently remove and  clean the brush head after use, then I dry the unit completely and put a little clipper oil on the part that rotates the brush head before I store it.  </li>
            <li> This works OK, but no better than any other brush that just spins.</li>
            <li> The motor sounds like it is ready to break at any minute due to inferior product.  </li>
            <li> I used it every other day on the gentle setting as directed, 20 seconds on each area.</li>
            <li> hard to clean nose area bc of that.</li>
            <li> The brush is a little coarse but gives your skin a thorough cleaning and leaves your face feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> I think that I had so much build up of dead skin in those areas that it took the Pretika a couple of days to break through them to the soft, glowing skin underneath.   </li>
            <li> I dont have sensitive skin, so I use it daily on the lower setting as part of my regular skin care routine.. and once a week on stronger setting to exfoliate.</li>
            <li> I upgraded to the more expensive brand six months ago and wish I would have never wasted my time with this Pretika brand.</li>
            <li> I bought it because the Clarisonic is too expensive and wanted to see if i even liked it, but the brush broke very shortly after my purchase.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, so I figured I don&#x27;t need to buy the more expensive Clarisonic with softer bristles.  </li>
            <li> I loved the results so much that I stupidly exchanged it again.</li>
            <li> HAVEN&#x27;T HAD A SINGLE NEW BUMP POP UP SENSE</li>
            <li> Due to this, and my daughter&#x27;s inexperience in facial cleansing, I will be using the new one and give her the old one.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I am happy with the product, but notably disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Not worth it, just splurge and buy the real thing.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t help with my dark circles, but I&#x27;ve never found anything that REALLY takes care of that.</li>
            <li> the price is very affordable compared to the other sonic facial systems out there.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this I expected that this would operate much like a Clarisonic, but obviously for the price would not be as well made or last near as long as one would expect for the price of a Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> Surprised how long battery lasts between charges.</li>
            <li> I used a clarasonic in the past and it wasnt worth the pricetag attached to it.</li>
            <li> My first one died a few weeks ago after a year of ownership.</li>
            <li> but they really let their customers down on this one.</li>
            <li> Very sensitive, rosecea, milia and very dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had acne or major issue with zits, but do occasionally get smaller ones.  </li>
            <li> , I would have determined that due to this brush having ONE stlye of brush head and the fact that a more firm brissle will irritate my acne, I could have waited a bit longer and applied what I actually spent on this to a Clairsonic Mia.</li>
            <li> My skin seems much smoother and needs much less product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for two months now, and the bristles have developed mold at the bases, even though I dry it off every time I use it.  </li>
            <li> I noticed less breakouts and much cleaner feeling skin.  </li>
            <li> You really need to dry the bottom thoroughly after use, especially where the charger is inserted, to ensure a long lasting brush.  </li>
            <li> This product would be rated at least a four if it didn&#x27;t break so quickly.</li>
            <li> There are no other brush heads you can get, no sensitive, no delicate, just this one rough bristled brush.  </li>
            <li> but i guess that because there rubbing it too rough on there skin because i have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had the Petrika a few weeks, and have been pretty faithful to the twice daily use they recommend.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Pretika makes shoddy products that are nothing like the quality of my new real brush.</li>
            <li> I know that&#x27;s a little odd, but it gets it clean.</li>
            <li> Decent facial brush, but not worth the extra hassle or expense.&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li> This is the cause of unit failure from my experience (and my assumption of most product failures posted by reviewers).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Short Answer for people with a dead Pretika]&lt;br</li>
            <li> All the other ones I tried had soft brushes and it seemed like it wasn&#x27;t cleaning my face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I had read reviews on other sites that said that this Pretika brush is very harsh when compared to the Clarisonic, I was worried that it would be too harsh on my sensitive, rosacea-prone skin, but it&#x27;s just been fine.  </li>
            <li> I guess this company only makes this brush work just long enough for their warranty period to end as well.</li>
            <li> I bought one - loved it - within a very few months I was unable to charge it.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t get too much pimples, usually get one every week on my chin.  </li>
            <li> It is extremely unreliable though as I have had to send it back twice and would have sent it back the first time if it wasn&#x27;t past the time frame to do so.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve read enough reviews stating this is not near as water-resistant as it claims to be so when I do use it</li>
            <li> Overall for the price I can&#x27;t complain I don&#x27;t think I will be buying a clarisonic as long as this is around</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m on my third brush) because eventually the charge began to not hold as long as it should before the warranty was up.  </li>
            <li> the circuit.&lt;br /&gt;The dual power level would not work when you tried to turn on the unit and then from there it would not power off despite pressing the power button repeatedly, the entire one minute long cycle would have to end in order for the device to turn off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i think this might be for me o_o its a tad on the harder side, the bristles.</li>
            <li> I have ordered two of these now, and both were operating normally for a few days</li>
            <li> First day I tried to use it, it slowly stopped working.  </li>
            <li> The head spins and sometimes is a little rough but really cleans skin well.</li>
            <li> Even with a green light, the charger will continue charging and will eventually destroy the battery due to overcharging.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Be prepared that the bristles on the brush don&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> Especially living or visiting the dry and often arid southwest of the US.</li>
            <li> The people who say \\&quot;it rusts\\&quot; obviously did not read the directions that say to dry it off after each use.  </li>
            <li> Try to keep it as dry as possible.  </li>
            <li> Although the directions say it can be used in the shower, I would recommend not doing so and keeping it as dry as possible.  </li>
            <li> but it has helped the old acne heal up and go away faster none the less.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;ve spent the extra money for the Clarisonic facial brush for my wife.  </li>
            <li> The Pretika SonicDermabrasion facial brush does not live up to the product</li>
            <li> I will NOT purchase it again since it is not dependable and has such a limited warranty.</li>
            <li> ive always had bad skin but since using this product, its gotten much better!</li>
            <li> far as what it really is-a rotating facial brush, it really doesn&#x27;t seem that bad.</li>
            <li> I would try this before spending the money on the other more expensive brand.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical, since in the last few years or so, these types of machines have really flooded the market, with various types of brushes.</li>
            <li> The charging system of the Pretika brush is a little disappointing and it&#x27;s clearly its weak point, however once you know to keep the brush dry and never, never set it into the cradle while it&#x27;s still wet, just a little TLC will net you an excellent ultrasonic facial brush at a rock bottom price.</li>
            <li> instructions say to turn on the facial brush on a dry towel to dry it off.</li>
            <li> get me wrong, It WILL Clean you skin, I used this religiously every day.</li>
            <li> Rinse, pat dry, use a simple toner (apply with a cotton ball/pad), allow to dry, moisturize (I use coconut oil, let it sink in then pat off excess with a hand towel).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve felt both the brushes and they seem comparable - except the Pretika is active out to the edge whereas the Clairsonic seems to only moves in the middle - seems outer edge is does nothing.  </li>
            <li> I was really having a hard time with my acne.</li>
            <li> They had also offered to send me four sensitive brush heads because I had let them know that the brush head was a little rough for my skin for daily use.</li>
            <li> so I get dirty compared to most girls.</li>
            <li> Oh, by the way, I am 70 years old, and look at least 30 years younger, thanks to avoiding excessive sun exposure and the sort of cleaning and toning done by products like Pretika.  </li>
            <li> It is not sonic at all it just spins that wrapped my long hair up when cleansing around my hairline.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I guess we&#x27;ll see how long it stays working.</li>
            <li> : I should have ordered it a long time ago.</li>
            <li> i am almost 40 years old and my skin tzone has been oily for a few years and</li>
            <li> My skin was sensitive, oily, and uneven in tone and texture.</li>
            <li> The charge is really long, I haven&#x27;t even charged it once</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve had it for a long time.</li>
            <li> The charge lasts a long time and I can take it in shower with me.</li>
            <li> The battery charge lasted a long time.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it was the use of it in the shower or whether normal wear and tear</li>
            <li> I have also dried off the whole unit, and I even opened up the plug where the wall charger goes, and dried that off, and still have it open to continue the drying process.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m now wondering WHOSE LASTS THAT LONG???</li>
            <li> Charge lasts a long time (about a week).</li>
            <li> The one minute auto shut off is a minor annoyance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It lives in the shower with no problem as long as you keep the cover over the battery outlet.  </li>
            <li> life- after having this and using for sooo long, I have to leave it</li>
            <li> I bought this brush from Walmart.com for $29.97 (I don&#x27;t know how long they will keep it at this price).</li>
            <li> It also seems to hold a long charge.</li>
            <li> but how long could I do that before I got fed</li>
            <li> The battery lasts long about almost 2 weeks with one charge.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Today I purchased one of the inexpensive Olay facial brushes (which spins), and I&#x27;m curious to see if it makes a difference.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are soft, yet firm</li>
            <li> The bristles are clumped similar to the bristles of a hairbrush (not very dense), yet softer.  </li>
            <li> It made no difference to my skin, and the bristles are not soft.</li>
            <li> So don&#x27;t drop it if you want to use it for long term.</li>
            <li> No matter how long I charged it.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t use it everyday and when I do I press it softly to the skin.</li>
            <li> The hole it has at the bottom is not large enough for the charge cord to go through.</li>
            <li> My less expensive one is a lot more reliable.</li>
            <li> My pores are unclogged not only on the nose area but everywhere and are smaller and much less noticeable.</li>
            <li> like a dummy, I ordered a 3rd one .. a month and a half later it</li>
            <li> I was careful to only charge the unit once it was dry</li>
            <li> , i wipe it completely down, let it dry, before i put back on the charging station i remove the brush head, obviously that stays damp</li>
            <li> And the battery lasts a long time, too!</li>
            <li> Some other brushes on the market the head keeps falling off while using, this one is the opposite.</li>
            <li> Also, ladies, if you get those bumps on the backs of your arms, this is a jewel for getting rid of them-use every other day for about 3 weeks (about 2 minutes on each arm for each use), and bumps totally disappear.</li>
            <li> should have listened to all the other reviewers who thought the same.</li>
            <li> It holds a charge for a very long time and it was a fraction of the price of the name brand ones.</li>
            <li> Holds a charge for a very long time.</li>
            <li> She keeps the contacts dry, and follows all of the directions.  </li>
            <li> The downside is you have to completely dry the unit before charging again.</li>
            <li> I removed the bristle head to rinse the bristles , and laid the head out to dry as I put the dry machine into it the charging cradle.</li>
            <li> I dry it immediately after using, wash the brush, and let it air dry.  </li>
            <li> I let it dry after every use on its holder.</li>
            <li> you have to dry it off after the shower, and I use it exclusively in the shower and never have any issues.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as water resistant as a dry sponge.  </li>
            <li> I use it at the sink to wash my face and then dry it off with a towel.</li>
            <li> I bought this over a few months back and never used it up until 2 months ago in which i was using religiously morning and nite.</li>
            <li> Now 6 weeks after purchase and only using it a few times a week, it will only stay charged for about 10 seconds.  </li>
            <li> I only place back on charger every few days.</li>
            <li> Only allow the brush to scrub the same area for a few seconds.</li>
            <li> every single time after you use them&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I WILL NOT EVEN GIVE THIS A SINGLE STAR.</li>
            <li> Admittedly I don&#x27;t use it every single day, but when I do use it, I use it for a longer time than others probably.  </li>
            <li> but thats my own fault due to stress and some bad skin care products I&#x27;ve been using, but</li>
            <li> My wife normally charge the unit overnight at least 8 hours!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t used very often and failed after only the third recharge.</li>
            <li> THE CHARGER FOR THIS ITEM CONNECTS DIRECTLY TO THE BRUSH WHERE AS IN TE PAST, I HAVE PURCHASED</li>
            <li> THIS WAS A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY!</li>
            <li> At first it feels a little hard but after some usage it softens up a bit.</li>
            <li> you shake the water off after rinsing after use - there is something loose like a screw or something rattling</li>
            <li> brush started to loose the charge and then just died soon after.</li>
            <li> The brush is a bit hard for my taste but for this price I can live with that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is the baking soda mixed with Burt&#x27;s Bees soap suds that is polishing down the acne scarring on my cheek.  </li>
            <li> Within four months of owning the brush the initial charge had worn down.  </li>
            <li> Tthe only down side (thats why i gave it 4 stars) is I can&#x27;t find replacement heads for it.</li>
            <li> I followed the very specific directions &amp; comments posted by other users and the brush still broke after just ONE WEEK!</li>
            <li> My pores seems to be less clogged where they are larger by my cheeks</li>
            <li> I think there is only a slight difference between the 2.</li>
            <li> I use this product about 3 times a week (only for a minute on my entire face), and it has prevented the small zits from appearing.  </li>
            <li> not so, the second one lasted less the six months.</li>
            <li> this facial brush did not resemble my previous one in any way.  </li>
            <li> Never used in shower so it has only gotten slightly damp during use.</li>
            <li> Just be careful and do not use it on high everyday!!</li>
            <li> For Diabetics, like myself, our skin is very dry.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this product, but I am very unhappy that it is 6 months old and now it is not working.</li>
            <li> I have owned other more expensive sonic products in the past.  </li>
            <li> i think the brush may be a little harsh for those with sensitive skin types.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid the Clarisonic will be too soft for me, and my skin has never appreciated the gentle treatment.</li>
            <li> Be careful when closing the unit to ensure water resistance.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product was not as expected.</li>
            <li> The brush bristles are rough, but for dermabrasion-especially for scarred skin, they need to be rough to get the job done.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> after using this pretika for a few weeks the oiliness is virtually gone and my pores are definately smaller.</li>
            <li> The brush holds enough charge for a few dozen uses and recharges in an hour or two when you place it into its cradle.  </li>
            <li> and it just died a few weeks ago, so above in 2011 I said I already about a year...</li>
            <li> Suggestion, Do not get the unit wet and try to charge, it will break.</li>
            <li> I believe that this will happen if u recharge the brush while its wet.</li>
            <li> Never charge it while it&#x27;s wet.</li>
            <li> and the brush is NOT dripping wet</li>
            <li> I was sooooo careful knowing that others had issues.  </li>
            <li> I promise I did not get it wet, never ran it under water.  </li>
            <li> I recommend making the bristles wet before applying it to the face.</li>
            <li> Also i see a lot of people complaining about how its rough on the skin</li>
            <li> In regard to the rusting, this is also what happens to metal if you put it into a charger while wet.</li>
            <li> They warn you against charging the unit if the contacts are wet, yet have you store your wet unit in the charging</li>
            <li> I use a microbead cleanser on my face and then use the device for an extra boost in getting rid of all the dead skin and oil on my face.  </li>
            <li> it is gental enough to use everyday</li>
            <li> This is just a spin brush and it&#x27;s way too rough on the skin.  </li>
            <li> FEW MONTHS LATER...</li>
            <li> i have only had it a few months.</li>
            <li> I have dark skin like Nia Long&#x27;s color.  </li>
            <li> and then one day it would go on and not turn off, a few days later it would not charge.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t press harder</li>
            <li> No problems with water damage etc if one is careful about placing it away from dripping water etc.</li>
            <li> No real problem - just don&#x27;t get over enthused.  </li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t use it too roughly when the bristles are still stiff.&lt;br</li>
            <li> things considered this Pretika was a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> We were careful to remove the brush to wet and rinse it.  </li>
            <li> The bristles itself are quite dense and rough...</li>
            <li> I used it for roughly two months</li>
            <li> These are NOT real Pretika Sonic Microdermabrasions brushes..</li>
            <li> It only spins for a few seconds then cuts off.</li>
            <li> I wet my face, apply the cleansing product on my face</li>
            <li> I will report back in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> By the 2nd time, it had gotten rid of all the dead skin on my face.</li>
            <li> One caution:  Avoid getting the electrical part of the unit wet</li>
            <li> The cleansing action was so slow it was like not using a machine at all.  </li>
            <li> the only thing need to improve is some details, not fine.</li>
            <li> Based on all of the other responses where people had this same issue, do not waste your money on such a poor product, don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
            <li> I find it very difficult to use a facial cleansing brush sans water, so these are doomed to break quickly.</li>
            <li> I work around the stiff bristles by applying only the lightest pressure when using it, which I do about three or four times a week.    </li>
            <li> A few days went by and Pretika responded back and let me know that the newer model had a spinning brush and the timer was removed due to customer feedback.</li>
            <li> Amazon sells this for less than half the price the local dermatologist does.  </li>
            <li> The tiny rubber that covers the connector is difficult to manage unless you have smallish and steady hands.  </li>
            <li> I have left it in the bathroom a few times during hot showers, nothing has gone wrong with it.</li>
            <li> Call me crazy but out of desperation I was using my spinning toothbrush (without toothpaste) to clean my face when pores</li>
            <li> I agree with previous reviews in that you need to keep it dry when you charge it.</li>
            <li> This brush was a total waste of money!</li>
            <li> But I expect things to last, so not sure about getting another one.</li>
            <li> So I continued using it every other day for 2 weeks, and it stopped working.</li>
            <li> What I don&#x27;t like is the unit does not beep every 15 seconds like my other unit.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers said that it was just like a Clarisonic, so perhaps Petrika changed this with newer models.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping this will allow it to last past the 3 month warranty time.  </li>
            <li> Read other reviews sayin the device dies.  </li>
            <li> because you need one hand to hold the unit and the tab open at the same time, then use the other hand to put the plug into the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the motor a bit weak.  </li>
            <li> The brush does vibrate and has the sonic benefit if it is not working like the other review said call customer service</li>
            <li> This item tops the other brand I had tried that just didn&#x27;t hold its charge.</li>
            <li> Usually I used the \\&quot;timed-routine auto shut off\\&quot; 3 times for my daily treatment</li>
            <li> I decided to tear it open to see what might be wrong before committing to buying a more expensive brand.</li>
            <li> I think the stand for the machine is pretty but useless.  </li>
            <li> I do think that the brush may be stiffer than some other brands, but it doesn&#x27;t bother my skin</li>
            <li> , I use it every other day.</li>
            <li> I dont want any other people ending up just like me.</li>
            <li> But other than than I like it.  </li>
            <li> I still have questions about why some of the Pretikas vibrate (according to other reviews, and even Pretika&#x27;s product descriptions), and why some of them rotate.  </li>
            <li> Only a couple of small complaints.</li>
            <li> After I realized I was only using it for \\&quot;special\\&quot; occasions and not enjoying it as often as I deserved</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thankful for the timer because before my dog chewed up my other brush</li>
            <li> Not sure if the replacement pads are the same either.  </li>
            <li> Also, keep in mind that if you leave the brush portion on, leave it wet, and put the product upright in the charger or holder, then the water will drip down, again creating rust.  </li>
            <li> , I am very careful not to get any water inside the handle.  </li>
            <li> My only problem is that the brushes are a little to stiff, so I&#x27;m now using it every other day.</li>
            <li> I recharge it after it is dead and dry...</li>
            <li> If you are expecting this to be an exact dupe for the very expensive well known facial brush</li>
            <li> The only reason I did another order of the Pretika was because my previous one lasted for two and half &amp;#34;years&amp;#34;!!  </li>
            <li> The bristles felt a little rough, but it didn&#x27;t look like it was hurting my skin the way an abrasive exfoliating wash does.  </li>
            <li> so I have such a hard time finding a product that works for both problems my skin has.</li>
            <li> but you should not charge it unless battery is depleted as this ruins battery.</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth the money.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint at this point would be the battery</li>
            <li> I am wondering if it was a real Pretika at all and was a fake instead.</li>
            <li> I sent the first one back because I thought it was defective and was shocked when I received the replacement.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, no I cannot turn it on, it turns on when IT wants.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this brush, b/c there was so much hype over the Clarisonic.  </li>
            <li> i love the compact design and the rechargeable base it sits in.</li>
            <li> separate cradle built in to the charger base would make more sense.&lt;br</li>
            <li> We cut into our cradle to be able to have spec for the charging cord while sitting in the base.</li>
            <li> As soon as it was used with any regularity it started getting loud and just proved itself to be a poor product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s obvious that I&#x27;m not the only one with a broken Pretika after a few months.</li>
            <li> I read the review and thought if I took care of the brush and dried it carefully after each use, it would work.  </li>
            <li> (of course) and only when it began to slow down.</li>
            <li> this breaks down</li>
            <li> --you will wear down the battery.</li>
            <li> having washed my face in the morning, I can slide my hands down the \\&quot;T\\&quot; of the forehead and come away with oil on them.</li>
            <li> so I guess when the two included brushes wear down</li>
            <li> This thing dramatically reduced my acne breakouts and broke down areas of hyperpigmentation.  </li>
            <li> THIS  ITEM  HAS TO BE LAID DOWN</li>
            <li> no scaling and my acne is drying up and the swelling going down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve discovered that if you store it and use it upside down, for whatever reason it will hold a charge longer.</li>
            <li> The unit broke down in less than a week.</li>
            <li> A little much money for a really lousy product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush less than a week</li>
            <li> and I see significantly less blackheads there as well.</li>
            <li> I used it for less than a week</li>
            <li> now they seem much less clogged.</li>
            <li> About $100 less than a brand competitor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This Product is half a dupe for the clarisonic.</li>
            <li> I wish i had paid attention to previous reviews when it came to this issue.</li>
            <li> I previously purchased one that required disposable batteries and return it because no one could get the battery compartment cover off.</li>
            <li> The seals are not adequate.</li>
            <li> But now that that phase is over, my skin looks pinker, healthier and less breakouts and blackheads.  </li>
            <li> I ignored all previous reviews of this thing dying after 1 month, and of course, 45 days after I purchased this thing, it died.</li>
            <li> After less than a month, it broke.</li>
            <li> does the job at half the cost of the brand items.  </li>
            <li> I have had mine for about a year and a half.</li>
            <li> It rotated in a circle - not a &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; motion like my previous one did.  </li>
            <li> This priduct is a less ezpensive version of th sonic mia l❤️</li>
            <li> One day we thought we were hearing dripping perhaps in the apartment below us, but later discovered this thing was randomly turning itself on and off, even waking us  up in the middle of the night.</li>
            <li> so I very disappointed that it only holds enough charge for one use each time, no longer blinks red while charging, just steady green.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still uncomfortable about the high price of this beauty item (the retailer I purchased it from will accept returns after 30</li>
            <li> This thing seized up so tight it has less movement than my constipated grandpa.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately a friend of mine purchased the same one and she had the same issues, 5 months and dead as a doornail.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now had two of them fail on me only after a few short months.  </li>
            <li> but this just didn&#x27;t last long and that is sad.</li>
            <li> Takes of all my heavy layers of make up in less than a minute.</li>
            <li> It appeared to offer little to no abrasive effects.    </li>
            <li> When you turn it on it has the cutest little beep noise, and the brush starts to vibrate.</li>
            <li> and some people have said it&#x27;s a little rougher, but it literally sweeps stuff out of my pores.  </li>
            <li> Little</li>
            <li> I read about this device having ultrasonic properties to it and that factor is what compelled me into buying this little friend.  </li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m not sure what the other reviewers were talking about when they said it didn&#x27;t hold a charge.</li>
            <li> it and my face peeled a little.  </li>
            <li> It does its job.&lt;br /&gt;The device itself is east to hold and has little grips on the side.</li>
            <li> A little dissapointing</li>
            <li> it just needs a little improvment.</li>
            <li> I used to get little pimples but not anymore.</li>
            <li> A little harsh</li>
            <li> However our unit also died in a few months and will no longer charge or work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After leaving it for a few days it started working again, and I didn&#x27;t have any problems.</li>
            <li> It sluffs away bumps and dead skin.</li>
            <li> This one lasted a few weeks.</li>
            <li> i got it a few weeks ago</li>
            <li> both times it stopped working after a few months.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> The bristles on this brush are way too harsh.</li>
            <li> only use it for 6 months is broken</li>
            <li> I have used it everyday since i got it</li>
            <li> and I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your</li>
            <li> But It refuses to charge and is dead after a year.</li>
            <li> Now, 1.5 year later its broken.</li>
            <li> I will be leaving another comment if it lasts a few months.  </li>
            <li> Bettery went out after a couple months, waste of money</li>
            <li> the charging port isn&#x27;t well protected and after a few months, it stopped charging.  </li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m going to have to bite the bullet and just consider my expensive toy as an early Christmas gift to myself.</li>
            <li> The batteries can&#x27;t be replaced so once it&#x27;s dead, that&#x27;s it.  </li>
            <li> I started to see a few brands at TJMaxx and Marshalls, and gave in.</li>
            <li> I researched reviews and chose the Pretika because of the firm brush heads that some people can&#x27;t stand.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I had to charge the brush for a few hours before I could use it</li>
            <li> So it was a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using this a few times a week for few weeks now.</li>
            <li> A few weeks ago, it just wouldn&#x27;t turn on anymore, and when I put it n</li>
            <li> to charge every few days.</li>
            <li> My hubby can tell by looking at my face when I use it everyday and when I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I will write an update in a few weeks, because I think it will help others.  </li>
            <li> I dont think it reduced the size of my pores, but seems to have decreased the amount of white heads</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t seen her in a few years and she came to visit.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product on 9/14/14 and as of 1/28/15, I believe the unit is dead.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday on my face and neck.  </li>
            <li> Totally NOT a sonic move, the motor sounds like almost broken.</li>
            <li> dead skin from the face,  but</li>
            <li> but then the battery went dead</li>
            <li> This item is a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> and I think it&#x27;s a waste of money</li>
            <li> I thought that may have been myh fault for some odd reason, so I bought another one!</li>
            <li> Broke quickly :-(</li>
            <li> The brush is too stiff, which is why I gave this product 4 stars as opposed to 5.</li>
            <li> (Other facial brushes too expensive for my budget).&lt;br /&gt;Downside:  if I press too hard against the skin, the brush slows down and makes me think it needs charging, but it&#x27;s just the way it works.  </li>
            <li> Since I live abroad, sending the brush to claim the warranty is rather expensive (and probably useless because of the time postal services take to send and deliver international packages).</li>
            <li> It also rusts at the base, and I&#x27;ve had to clean that up, too.  </li>
            <li> brush head IS NOT easy to pull off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think this caused battery failure due to overcharging.  </li>
            <li> i was skeptical because the brush looks like it barely moves.</li>
            <li> One thing I was afraid of, is that the brush head would be too soft and not clean my face</li>
            <li> I would scrub my face raw.</li>
            <li> Lasted me a little over a month!</li>
            <li> I think the brush heads are a little too hard.</li>
            <li> The bristles are just as harsh as a hard bristled toothbrush, so if you want this, you might as well get a vibrating toothbrush to save you money.</li>
            <li> Not sure what others problems were</li>
            <li> (I usually trust the advice of dermatologists Leslie Baumann and Neal Schultz, and they both agreed that it will</li>
            <li> I usually have to wash my face twice at night to get rid of makeup -- once with a cleansing oil</li>
            <li> Even after that, I usually find traces of my makeup on the cotton pad I swipe my toner on with.  </li>
            <li> It seems to me like this one is a fake, or a different model...</li>
            <li> I thought for the price this thing would at least spin but its just a buzzing vibrating brush, waste of money if you ask me, i&#x27;m thinking of buying the oil of olay brush instead since i found out than one spins around.</li>
            <li> There is a small rubber plug that you can attach to the recharge port that keeps coming out.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> however it is useless if it won&#x27;t last a week out of the box.</li>
            <li> There is a small silicone plug that stays inserted when you use the brush in the shower but that you must pull out to plug in the charging cord.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still advertised as using &amp;#34;Micro-Pulsating Vibration Cleansing Technology&amp;#34; but the brush no longer vibrates and there&#x27;s definitely no more &amp;#</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I was disappointed -</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I found an alternate gift.</li>
            <li> I end up using the brush to wash my face without it even working, waste of money!</li>
            <li> What a waste!</li>
            <li> In the beginning, I was so anxious that I &#x27;overdid&#x27;</li>
            <li> I was disappointed at first the brush just spins.</li>
            <li> died!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Now it doesn&#x27;t work, and when I tried to go through amazon to return, it was past the return time.</li>
            <li> and then I was a little afraid it would finally die on me.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it was too late to send it back.  </li>
            <li> I wish I had just saved up for the real thing. :(</li>
            <li> Pretty annoying because now I just lay it there to charge.</li>
            <li> Very bummed out :(</li>
            <li> Buyer beware and not dumb like me. :(</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bristles may be a little tough.</li>
            <li> Save your hard earned money and put it toward a Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> Hard to maneuver</li>
            <li> We all work too hard for our money to throw it away.</li>
            <li> also hard to tell 2 speeds apart.</li>
            <li> , I went for a few months without until I got around to reordering, and my skin looked flaky, dull and tired.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this a couple months ago and waited to review based on some of the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> I did not need to plug it in to charge again for at least 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> It will not charge and it is now too late to return it.  </li>
            <li> Duh.</li>
            <li> there is a fee you have to pay, so thats a negative.</li>
            <li> Such a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I had to give it at least one star to post this</li>
            <li> therefore I think it sucks.</li>
            <li> This device is absolute crap.</li>
            <li> A slowly spinning brush.  </li>
            <li> Like the clarisonic, the Pretika vibrates MINUS the rotation so it is very irritating to the skin.</li>
            <li> So, that would mean that you wouldn&#x27;t run it under the tap in the sink either.</li>
            <li> was surprised and quite disappointed that the brush head doesn&#x27;t rotate at all; just the sonic vibration.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was a little annoying that I had to constantly keep it charged, but that&#x27;s life.</li>
            <li> Looks clear and brighter,  had a few pores on my nose that I hated</li>
            <li> If you can afford to buy a Mia (which is the less expensive brush that Clarisonic makes), I would recommend getting that one over this Pretika.  </li>
            <li> I have a patch of shallow acne scars on one cheek that are already softening.</li>
            <li> But I have given it serious thought</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would be a less expensive alternative to the Clarisonic, but it&#x27;s not</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge and actually just stayed running if it wasn&#x27;t plugged in which made using it at any point in time, impossible.</li>
            <li> This brush has stopped my break outs and is much less expensive than it&#x27;s competitors but a lot less expensive.  </li>
            <li> I started getting serious break-outs about two months ago.  </li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about purchasing this brush since Im use to another brand.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually leave a bad review, unless it&#x27;s something pretty bad.</li>
            <li> it is starting to go bad.</li>
            <li> NOT GOOD</li>
            <li> I have purchased this brush twice, after a few months-it failed to charge.</li>
            <li> Not good at all.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not good.  </li>
            <li> NOT A GOOD PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> The brush itself had two small metal plates and when the brush needed to be charged, it would sit in the white charging base which also had two metal plates.  </li>
            <li> because my skin is begging for it, it looks horrible right now.</li>
            <li> It was a big disappointment for me when I found the rechargeable connection was very poorly designed.  </li>
            <li> ahead and try, the unit is broken anyway.</li>
            <li> I even stored the charging base outside of the bathroom!</li>
            <li> After using it for 2 weeks now I just have to say that I am addicted to it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve written the co. to see if they&#x27;ll stand behind it or not.</li>
            <li> As soon as I realized it was broken</li>
            <li> you know its broken.</li>
            <li> Just used mine in 2 days and it was broken after that.</li>
            <li> and I am NOT happy</li>
            <li> The pore size on my nose definitely decreased.  </li>
            <li> Broken.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a poorly made product.</li>
            <li> This Item is totally false</li>
            <li> ;, I had to give this 1 star for false advertisement.</li>
            <li> the info on this page regarding the brush is outdated.  </li>
            <li> false advertising..</li>
            <li> The claim that this product uses \\&quot;Micro-Pulsating Vibration Cleansing Technology\\&quot; is completely false.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sorry their prices are ridiculous.</li>
            <li> What I learned from this is that you must carefully dry the unit before replacing it in the recharging base.  </li>
            <li> I have a girlfiend in her late 30&#x27;s who suffered from red skin and terrible acne.  </li>
            <li> For those who are considering changing the brush head and use for other purposes, you&#x27;ll be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> needed cleaning -not ideal, I admit.</li>
            <li> I kept it from getting wet at the base where it charges.</li>
            <li> Do not replace the unit in the charging base while it is damp or wet.  </li>
            <li> You cannot get the base wet.</li>
            <li> Now, for the bad news, unlike the pricey Clarisonic, the Pretika brush does not use induction charging but plain metallic contacts.</li>
            <li> Disappointed that I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I bought one from BB&amp;B a few weeks ago and was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Waste of money. :-(</li>
            <li> one thing I hate is that there&#x27;s a little hole at the bottom of the stand which I believe is so that u could charge it while its on there -- so u would think.</li>
            <li> Sad to say the word Sonic seems to be misused in the name of this product.</li>
            <li> Sorry sweetie.</li>
            <li> It would turn on randomly by it self for a couple nights and now it won&#x27;t turn on at all.</li>
            <li> My friends all have the expensive Ulta brand</li>
            <li> Buy this, you will be sorry.</li>
            <li> The Clarisonic was too expensive for me.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, it was trash.  </li>
            <li> then it would turn itself on at random times of the day</li>
            <li> Sad</li>
            <li> After that, the battery lost strength (even after being recharged) and it is now absolutely useless.</li>
            <li> I am sorry to say, I had to return this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought brushes for $15-20 at RiteAid that lasted me years longer than this expensive piece of junk lasted.</li>
            <li> WRONG ITEM..</li>
            <li> but then they would turn on by themselves at random times and wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge.</li>
            <li> The worst part was not only one but 2 because I bought one for my mom.</li>
            <li> Buy with confidence, but don&#x27;t have unrealistic expectations.</li>
            <li> I have didn&#x27;t like it &amp; too expensive.</li>
            <li> and, sorry to say, it stopped working thereafter.  </li>
            <li> the brush is useless.</li>
            <li> Design of the holder is flawed.</li>
            <li> unfortunately the machine vibrate; it does not spin</li>
            <li> FALSE ADVERTISEMENT!</li>
            <li> False advertisement!</li>
            <li> There is no more charging base.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely disappointed to say the least.</li>
            <li> very disappointed and mad to find what is in the box is NOT what is on the outside of the box...</li>
            <li> I really hate having to write a bad review, but I feel like I have to warn other people about this product.  </li>
            <li> I returned this disappointing product.</li>
            <li> As I recall it went through AA batteries like crazy.</li>
            <li> My wife was distraught when this device stopped working.</li>
            <li> However, the connectors became dirty and it stopped charging.  </li>
            <li> Signed, Sad Woman!</li>
            <li> and the base is merely a stand for it to rest on.  </li>
            <li> This product is really bad.</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t bad either.</li>
            <li> So you can imagine how bad these break-outs traumatized me.  </li>
            <li> It was really disappointing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed that it stopped working.  </li>
            <li> I hate this product.</li>
            <li> The brush doesn&#x27;t charge from the base anymore</li>
            <li> What a piece of crap.</li>
            <li> There was a cord which plugged into the base itself and the brush would sit in the base charging.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is a base, but it&#x27;s to be used when the brush doesn&#x27;t need to be charged.</li>
            <li> The base itself is just to hold the brush.</li>
            <li> It has been a really annoying experience.</li>
            <li> I dinged them a star because I hate planned obsolescence.</li>
            <li> then it stoped charging on the base.</li>
            <li> and I do my research because I hate wasting money.</li>
            <li> I hate having to buy batteries over and over.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve cleaned the metal charging nodes on the base and unit with alcohol on a q-tip and it WILL charge after you \\&quot;play\\&quot; with it.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe that I have gotten 5 brushes and all of then have been CRAP.</li>
            <li> I also do not like that the power supply is not connected to the base at all.  </li>
            <li> For the price, this is a bad purchase!</li>
            <li> I am disappointed!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed and will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Very, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> You wont be disappointed!!!!</li>
            <li> You have got to be stone crazy if you don&#x27;t have one of these!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is the worst product that I bought in years.</li>
            <li> WELL IT IS HORRIBLE!</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> This is the worst experience I&#x27;ve ever had with a battery device.</li>
            <li> It spins rather than vibrating, causing a horrible irritation on the skin.</li>
            <li> DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This thing is a piece of crap!!</li>
            <li> The brush worked well when it was functional, but the reliability is horrible.  </li>

            <li> Sad to say the word Sonic seems to be misused in the name of this product. Grinder is a better description! Works great as a grinder.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin really clean and evens out the pores. Seems clean well without the high sticker price. Never tried the Clarisonics but this seems good.</li>
            <li> THIS THING IS AWESOME! IF YOU WANT YOUR FACE TO FEEL LIKE A BABYS BUTT THEN BUY THIS. IT&#x27;S JUST PERFECT FOR THE PRICE. ALL I HAVE TO DO IS PLUG IT IN WHEN BATTERY GOES LOW AND IT TELLS ME ITS DONE CHARGING WHEN THE LIGHT GOES GREEN. I USE IT TWICE A DAY WITH LEMON JUICE OR WHAT EVER HOMEMADE CONCOCTION I THINK UP. THE ONLY THING I DON&#x27;T LIKE BUT DOESN&#x27;T BOTHER ME IS IT HAS A 60 SECOND AUTO SHUT OFF SO I HAVE TO TURN IT BACK ON 3 OR 4 TIMES BUT, WHO CARES WHEN IT DOES SUCH A GOOD JOB. IT HAS THOSE SHORT BRISTLES SO IT REALLY FEELS LIKE ITS DOING WHAT IT&#x27;S SUPERPOSE TO DO. PLUS IT CAME WITH AN EXTRA HEAD.. I&#x27;M IN LOVE AND HAVEN&#x27;T HAD A SINGLE NEW BUMP POP UP SENSE I STARTED USING IT.. WOW IS ALL I CAN SAY... JUST WOW AND I RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYONE EVEN MEN</li>
            <li> It worked good when it worked  I think I got 5 months out of it. Cant seem to find one that lasts</li>
            <li> I bought this item about 3 months ago loved it but it has stopped charging and doesn&#x27;t work hubby says parts are plastic.</li>
            <li> My wife bought this product over competition that is more than double the price.  As most reviewers already posted, it does a terrific job doing its intended purpose.  However our unit also died in a few months and will no longer charge or work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We managed to get this thing working like new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[For NEW buyers]&lt;br /&gt;Buy this product, but do not follow the manual on the charging procedure.  The unit that I got always show a &#x27;green&#x27; light during charging and never showed the &#x27;red&#x27; blinking light. Whether the battery is drained or full I still get a green light.  Recommended charging procedure as follows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1st time charging - charge the unit for 12 hours, then unplug the charger. This is to condition the new battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Succeeding charges - charge the unit for 1 hour only, then unplug the charger.&lt;br /&gt;IMPORTANT!&lt;br /&gt;Do not leave the charger plugged to the unit for extended periods of time.  Even with a green light, the charger will continue charging and will eventually destroy the battery due to overcharging.  This is the cause of unit failure from my experience (and my assumption of most product failures posted by reviewers).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Short Answer for people with a dead Pretika]&lt;br /&gt;The battery is dead, Pretika uses the same battery with most cordless telephones. Pretika uses a Battery pack that consists of 3xAAA merged together with 500mAh rating.  Should look similar to this [[ASIN:B003LMOVQS 3.6v 600 mAh Cordless Phone Battery for V Tech 89-1323-00-00]]&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you get a replacement battery that is at least 500mAh rating&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  I did not buy my replacement battery from Amazon so I can&#x27;t precisely say if this is the link above is the correct one.  As phone battery packs has two versions. 3x AA or 3x AAA size that looks similar via photo.  So make sure you get the battery pack that consists of 3x AAA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Replace the battery, follow the charging procedure on the &#x27;for NEW buyers&#x27; section and you should be good.  I can&#x27;t comment much on battery life yet as I just fixed it last week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will need some DIY skills to get it back working.&lt;br /&gt;Go ahead and try, the unit is broken anyway. There is no additional harm in trying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[DIY and Technical section]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to open Pretika Unit&lt;br /&gt;a. remove the brush&lt;br /&gt;b. with brush removed, there will be a white hexagonal plastic that holds the brush.  Pry it off. (friction held)&lt;br /&gt;c. pretika has 2 blue grip strips where you hold the unit, peel them off. (sticker type, I used double sided tape to put them back)&lt;br /&gt;d. with the brush side facing you, there are 5x blue rubber/silicone plugs, remove them&lt;br /&gt;e. below the plugs are 5x screws, remove them and open the unit&lt;br /&gt;note: the pretika plastic housing has a transparent gasket that is sandwiched when between them. Be careful when closing the unit to ensure water resistance.&lt;br /&gt;f. there you will see a PCB mounted to the frame with 2x screws.  Remove them.&lt;br /&gt;g. now you have access to the battery.&lt;br /&gt;h. buying replacement batteries may not match the plug.  You can either transplant the plug or just cut and connect the wires, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Note:  make sure you also move the foam strip stuck on the defective battery to the new one.  This acts like a vibration/shock absorber.  Not doing so may cause a lot of vibration/noise when you operate the unit.&lt;br /&gt;i. reverse the procedure&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the status light &#x27;Green&#x27;, the charger still delivers 4.2V to the battery. I think this caused battery failure due to overcharging.  My wife normally charge the unit overnight at least 8 hours!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery is only rated 500mAh, charger gives an output of 500mA.  Hence, full charge should be attained within 1 hour.  Replacement battery that I was able to acquire is rated 700mA, so it should take me approx 1.5 hours to get a full charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charging time &#x3D; replacement battery mAh rating / 500mA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2013-07-16:&lt;br /&gt;Well after 2 weeks of use, it is time to recharge the device.  I tried charging it and now the motor will no longer start.  The only way to get the unit working is to plug in the charger (pretika side), unplug it and quickly turn on the device.  Its like using the charger to jump start the device.  This method is too unusable for me.  Back to the drawing board.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Technically usable, but a BIG HASSLE to use.&lt;br /&gt;Now I suspect that the PCB board is the problem.  I don&#x27;t want to spend money to try out another battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck buying this product.&lt;br /&gt;The product is very good to use, but unless Pretika fixes the charging issue, Im not buying another product from Pretika.  Or simply said, I may be the unlucky percentage among reviewers to get a defective unit.</li>
            <li> I purchased this a couple months ago and waited to review based on some of the negative reviews. I wanted to make sure I had no issues before I reviewed. From day one...I loved it. As for the people that say it hurt their skin....first wet the bristles thoroughly to soften them. Then, if you have sensitive skin as I do, don&#x27;t overuse. I run it over my entire face twice only. I do this morning and night. I have had no issues at all and my skin is so soft and impurities non-existent. As for the charge, I charged mine fully the first day. I did not need to plug it in to charge again for at least 6 weeks. Not sure what others problems were but you should not charge it unless battery is depleted as this ruins battery. For $29 bucks this product is more than worth it!</li>
            <li> I really like this brush because the bristles aren&#x27;t wimpy! All the other ones I tried had soft brushes and it seemed like it wasn&#x27;t cleaning my face. This one does! And the battery lasts a long time, too! Glad I bought it&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Wow! This is a fantastic facial brush. Great power, bristles and holds a charge for days. I used a clarasonic in the past and it wasnt worth the pricetag attached to it. This one is definitely worth it!! You wont be disappointed!!!!</li>
            <li> This Item is totally false advertising.&lt;br /&gt;1- It is not sonic at all it just spins that wrapped my long hair up when cleansing around my hairline.&lt;br /&gt;2- It is not Microdermabrasion ether there is no crystals only a cleansing brush.[[ASIN:B000F0GNT2 DermaNew Facial Rejuvenation System has a cleansing Brush and real crystal cream that works.</li>
            <li> love this so far....does a great job cleaning skin and keeping blemishes at bay. would buy this again anytime! highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this product, but I am very unhappy that it is 6 months old and now it is not working.</li>
            <li> This brush is fantastic!  It is much cheaper than the Clarisonic.  I bought it for my daughter as a Christmas gift.  She is having some breakout issues.  The first day she used it, there was a noticeable difference.  I did not expect to see anything that quickly.  My adolescent son, who notices nothing, even remarked how nice his sister&#x27;s skin looked.  She keeps the contacts dry, and follows all of the directions.  I recommend it highly!</li>
            <li> After getting the product, I used it about 5 times and just let it sit for about 4 months because it seemed to irritate my skin. Recently I thought I&#x27;d try using it again but it was out of juice so started to charge it when it started emitting this high pitched whine. I pressed the button to try to shut it off but not responsive. this one goes to the landfill...</li>
            <li> It works very well for a deep face scrubber.</li>
            <li> Got this \\&quot;very fast from Amazon\\&quot; a few days ago, and so far I am just loving it!  First time I used it my skin looked fresh and felt great.   I have sensitive skin so I will only use it every other day, but after almost a week of use it has made a huge difference in my skin. Looks clear and brighter,  had a few pores on my nose that I hated and they are no longer in sight!!  Love this so far, will update later as to the product quality!</li>
            <li> I bought this instead of the Clarisonic, but I wish I wouldn&#x27;t have.  This brush was a total waste of money! The company claims these brushes are \\&quot;waterproof\\&quot; but water can enter easily enter through it&#x27;s bottom charging hardware. I find it very difficult to use a facial cleansing brush sans water, so these are doomed to break quickly. It broke within a month despite the fact that I took great care to keep it as dry as possible. I even stored the charging base outside of the bathroom! When I received my Clarisonic for x-mas, I realized the Pretika could never ever compare to it!! Save your hard earned money and put it toward a Clarisonic. Pretika makes shoddy products that are nothing like the quality of my new real brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m noticing a difference in my skin since using this. Very happy that I made the decision to finally buy one.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for. After 1 week my acne has stopped appearing. It leaves my face feeling smooth and the appearance has really gotten better. I use it with St Ives apricot scrub and aluminum oxide crystals for a true micro demabrasion treatment.[[ASIN:B003FP86SK IQ Natural Microdermabrasion Exfoliate Crystals Aluminum Oxide 1.5oz]]</li>
            <li> Great item.  I compared at least 4 others and decided this one is the closest to the clarisonic which is more than twice the price.  Seems to do everything.  I am very satisfied with the choice and using amazon.  It arrived very fast without any problems.</li>
            <li> Call me crazy but out of desperation I was using my spinning toothbrush (without toothpaste) to clean my face when pores needed cleaning -not ideal, I admit. Found the Pretika Sonic Dermabrasion Facial Brush on Amazon at a great price &amp; after using just once my skin truly was different! Smooth and soft like never before, except maybe when I was a baby. I like the way the brush is gentle to clean, then after you rinse and dry - put on moisturizer with the sponge, it actually does help your skin accept it and my face stays moisturized for much longer than ever before. I would recommend this to any woman of any age. Especially living or visiting the dry and often arid southwest of the US.</li>
            <li> I bought this instead of the expensive brand name one, I love this one.  I ave used it for one week nwo and my skin in glowing!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is loud, that is the only issue I have with it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this breaks down i will repurcahse!</li>
            <li> I like the whole idea of sonic facial brush. This brush works beautifully and the price is reasonable. Pretika&#x27;s customer service was very helpful answering my questions. I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I wanted to buy the Clarsonic, but I wasn&#x27;t willing to fork up the money for it. I&#x27;ve used it for two months now. Product wise, it&#x27;s good. I&#x27;ve only charged it once and it is still running on the first charge. I don&#x27;t recharge it every day. My skin feels better the nights I use it. There were consecutive days that I forgot to use it, and my skin didn&#x27;t feel as smooth and I broke out. I&#x27;m using it along with a new face wash, moisturizer, and the Glycolic Acid 35%. So, it could be a combination of things. As I&#x27;m using it more and more, I&#x27;m wondering if it is too rough for my skin to be using it every day.</li>
            <li> This was great until it died soon after the time it could be returned.  It wasn&#x27;t used very often and failed after only the third recharge.</li>
            <li> The product was not as expected. It appeared to offer little to no abrasive effects.    I returned the product with no actual use.</li>
            <li> Worked great for about a year. Now it no longer workes. Took the unit apart to find broke plastic part and can&#x27;t seem to find the part online anywhere. Now I&#x27;ve spent the extra money for the Clarisonic facial brush for my wife.  I guess we&#x27;ll see how long it stays working. Save your money an stay away from the Pretika Sonic Dermabrasion Facial Brush.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for my friend. She said that she \\&quot;...loves it\\&quot;. I went ot her house to see the unit - and now I want one.    When you turn it on it has the cutest little beep noise, and the brush starts to vibrate. It has two cycles and is medium-soft to the touch. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it more than 2-3 times a week.    It is a beautiful, up-scale, looking unit.    AND I WANT ONE!</li>
            <li> Recommended to me by my daughter. My skin seems much smoother and needs much less product.  Dec. 19,2011 Still working great.</li>
            <li> *I originally gave this brush four stars, but have since downgraded my review to two stars since it stopped working after seven months.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only had my Pretika for about a week, so I will be sure to update this review since several people have commented that it breaks down after a month or two.  In the short time I&#x27;ve had it, though, it works really well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like other reviewers, I really wanted to buy a Clarisonic brush, but couldn&#x27;t justify spending that much on a tool that is essentially just a glorified face cleaner.  (I usually trust the advice of dermatologists Leslie Baumann and Neal Schultz, and they both agreed that it will *not* reduce wrinkles, but will rather just deep clean your skin.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although many people think that the the Clarisonic is an exfoliator, it does NOT exfoliate; instead, it deep cleans your skin so that your skin care and anti-aging products can better penetrate the epidermis.  The same is true for this Pretika, and I&#x27;ve found that it does a really good job of cleansing.  I usually have to wash my face twice at night to get rid of makeup -- once with a cleansing oil and then once again with a regular cleaner.  Even after that, I usually find traces of my makeup on the cotton pad I swipe my toner on with.  Since using the Pretika, however, the cotton pad has been completely clean -- with no makeup residue!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I had read reviews on other sites that said that this Pretika brush is very harsh when compared to the Clarisonic, I was worried that it would be too harsh on my sensitive, rosacea-prone skin, but it&#x27;s just been fine.  I&#x27;ve only been using it once a day (at night, to deep clean and get rid of my makeup) and am still using the sensitive setting, but the brush feels really soft and it hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a final note, one of the biggest selling points for me is that this gets rid of the flaky skin that my Retin-A leaves in its wake.  Twice a week, I&#x27;ve been using the Olay Microdermabrasion kit to get rid of the flakes and it works fantastically for that, but the flaky skin comes back and you can only use the Olay kit twice a week.  The Pretika gets rid of the dry, flaky skin, and leaves my skin feeling really soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, this has been a great purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE ON 3/27/10:  I&#x27;ve cut back to using this just once a day on the sensitive setting since twice a day seemed to be a bit too much for my skin, but it&#x27;s still working great.  I haven&#x27;t had to charge it at all since I first bought it.  At the same time that I started using this, I also started using Skin Laboratory&#x27;s Lactic 35% &amp; Glycolic 25% Combo Gel Peel, and the two products have made a huge difference in my skin!  The blackheads that I&#x27;ve always had on my nose are gone for the first time ever, and my skin looks radiant and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be sure to update this review again to see it holds up longer than just a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE ON 5/4/10:  I just downgraded my original five-star review to three stars.  I&#x27;ve had this for two months now, and the bristles have developed mold at the bases, even though I dry it off every time I use it.  It also rusts at the base, and I&#x27;ve had to clean that up, too.  I did contact Pretika&#x27;s customer service about the mold issue, and they assure me that the brushes are anti-microbial and offered to send me replacement brush heads.  So their customer service is really outstanding!  That being said, I really don&#x27;t know how much longer this brush will last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has anyone else experienced this problem with mold growing on it? Does the Clarisonic brush have the same problem?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE ON 12/26/10:  I just received a Clarisonic Mia for Christmas, and the difference between the Clarisonic and the Pretika brush are very noticeable.  The Clarisonic brush is *much* softer, and the sonic vibrations are much stronger.  If you can afford to buy a Mia (which is the less expensive brush that Clarisonic makes), I would recommend getting that one over this Pretika.  For just over twice the cost of this brush, you can have a much nicer one.over twice the cost of this brush, you can have a much nicer one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush less than a week and it has already done great things for my skin. I have a patch of shallow acne scars on one cheek that are already softening. The brush bristles are rough, but for dermabrasion-especially for scarred skin, they need to be rough to get the job done. My pores are already looking tighter. Fine lines on my forehead are smoothing out. I use Burt&#x27;s Bees Rosemary and Peppermint bar soap with my Pretika, and I get a nice exfoliation and deep clean. But I don&#x27;t really get any microdermabrasion happening until I add baking soda. It is the baking soda mixed with Burt&#x27;s Bees soap suds that is polishing down the acne scarring on my cheek.  I use my Pretika twice a day, morning and night. Morning I use the gentle setting and just the soap. Night I use the strong setting and add baking soda to my trouble area.  The first couple of days, I had a couple of dry, hard patches on my face that were kind of scaly and peeling. I think that I had so much build up of dead skin in those areas that it took the Pretika a couple of days to break through them to the soft, glowing skin underneath.   So far, I am really amazed with this product and I wish I had bought it years ago.</li>
            <li> I have had this for about two weeks and am in love with it! I have combination skin with a very oily forehead. I also get very flaky around my chin and nose so I have such a hard time finding a product that works for both problems my skin has. Let me tell you I have never had more people comment on how glowy and bright my skin has looked lately. My pores seems to be less clogged where they are larger by my cheeks and I see significantly less blackheads there as well. I use this in conjuction with my Pro Activ and I use it twice a day on the lower setting. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too harsh and it feels really great on my skin. I was itching for a Clarisonic but I&#x27;m sorry their prices are ridiculous. This is such a great alternative. I agree with previous reviews in that you need to keep it dry when you charge it. It says that in the directions as well.</li>
            <li> I would have given this product 5 stars except for the fact that the contact metal parts in the recharger rusted on the first day I used the brush.  What I learned from this is that you must carefully dry the unit before replacing it in the recharging base.  This is quite different from those of you who are familiar with rechargeable toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit comes with a spare brush and the timer signal when it is time to move to another quadrant of one&#x27;s face.  It is an attractive looking unit and I keep it on my bathroom counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does a good job of exfoliating and is pleasant to use and gentle.</li>
            <li> This is a knockoff of the Clairsonic dermabrasion brush. I haven&#x27;t used a Clairsonic, because I&#x27;m cheap, but after reading lots of reviews I&#x27;ve found the Pretika is compared favourably, with the exception that the bristles are a little harder, so not as good for sensitive skin.    I have had my Pretika for two months now, and have followed all instructions correctly. I used it for less than a week and it stopped working. After leaving it for a few days it started working again, and I didn&#x27;t have any problems. Now, the motor is starting to sound strange and laboured while I use it, and I suspect it will stop working permanently before too long. There is a very good reason this product only has a one-month warranty - I don&#x27;t think the manufacturers expect it to work much longer than that.     Based on my experience I went back and re-read reviews, and realized that most of the glowing reviews are based on using the brush for a couple of days up to a month. The majority of reviews from anyone using the Pretika longer than a month or two begin to mention malfunctions and defects.     I enjoy what this product does for my skin, but do not trust that it&#x27;s lifespan will be more than 3 or 4 months. Conversely, I have read reviews by people who have had Clairsonics which continued to function for many years. The bottom line is, while the Clairsonic is much more expensive, it sounds like it&#x27;s actually a more sensible economic choice for anyone who plans to continue to use sonic dermabrasion over the long term. While I&#x27;m happy to have had the opportunity to try it out before investing in the more expensive Clairsonic, I don&#x27;t believe the cost is worth a short-term trial.</li>
            <li> Product arrived as promised, as described.  This company really went the extra distance to insure a happy customer experience.  Excellent customer service!!</li>
            <li> This product wouldn&#x27;t take a charge right out of the box. Total waste of money. First thing that I have ever received from Amazon that was total junk.</li>
            <li> This product works really great. I have acne prone skin and tried everything to get clear skin, nothing worked. I have been using this product for about 8 weeks and I finally have clear skin. This is a great product for anyone with acne prone skin. It sluffs away bumps and dead skin.</li>
            <li> What a difference this brush has made on my complexion and at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> This does what you think it will but just a little bit better.  It&#x27;s cheaper than the clarisonic (that&#x27;s why I bought it) and some people have said it&#x27;s a little rougher, but it literally sweeps stuff out of my pores.  It&#x27;s especially good with whiteheads, and the blackheads on my nose are smaller.  I&#x27;ve used it every night for two weeks, and there is zero makeup residue when I use toner (gentle toner is a definite need if you use this).  I have very oily skin, and this is amazing for cleansing if you moisturize afterwards.</li>
            <li> After using it for 2 weeks now I just have to say that I am addicted to it.  Amazing results. Skin super clean, smooth.   You can buy it with confidence.  I was sceptical because of the price but I am sure the expensive Sonic version will give the same results.  The charge lasts. After 2 weeks I do not to charge it yet. The brush is smooth even on high speed.  Perfect product for a very good price.   I just have a regret: I should have ordered it a long time ago.</li>
            <li> did the job but broke before a year was up, couldn&#x27;t fix it.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using the pretika for about 4 weeks daily. before this my forehead and tzone were very oily. i would wake up in the morning and my face would be soooo greasy i couldn&#x27;t stand it. about 10 minutes after i applied my makeup my forehead would be super shiny. i am almost 40 years old and my skin tzone has been oily for a few years and my pores just keep getting larger. after using this pretika for a few weeks the oiliness is virtually gone and my pores are definately smaller. i&#x27;m not going to say the pores are gone but i see a real improvement in my skin.     before this i have been getting tca peels for over a year with no improvement in oiliness or pore size. especially on my forehead which would almost never peel because it was so oily. i was skeptical because the brush looks like it barely moves. but it does something because it is working. the price is very affordable compared to the other sonic facial systems out there. i think the brush may be a little harsh for those with sensitive skin types. the machine is designed to turn off automatically on the high setting after your treatment is up.     i&#x27;ve tried many things for exfoliation and this seems to work great. my pores used to be so clogged i used to say, every pore i have is a blackhead. now they seem much less clogged. i&#x27;m very happy with this pretika, and i seriously am very picky and return almost everything i buy.</li>
            <li> I like this product and continue to use it.  Find it effective - although the brush is too rough.  Wish I had bit the bullet and invested in the Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased the clarisonic for myself and I love it, my face is so much cleaner and I have noticed it is firmer too. My 15 year old daughter says \\&quot;I want one too\\&quot; I was not about to spend that much money on her or let her use mine (I may never see it again) Sorry sweetie. I found this alternative at amazon. It seemed to have pretty decent  reviews, so I got it for my daughter for Christmas. She really likes it. She has noticed her pores are getting smaller and feels her face it cleaner.  If you don&#x27;t or can&#x27;t spend the money for a clarisonic this is a good alternative.</li>
            <li> FALSE ADVERTISEMENT! this isn&#x27;t the pretika that is listed. It seems to me like this one is a fake, or a different model... This one I got does not have the sonic technology nor does it charge when you place on stand.&lt;br /&gt;It is a rotation technology, which is completely different from sonic-or vibrating tech-&lt;br /&gt;The stand is just pretty much just to store it. The hole at the bottom of stand serves no purpose..&lt;br /&gt;Now while this isn&#x27;t the product that I ordered... It does clean well.. and it feels nice on skin..&lt;br /&gt;BUT IT IS NOT SONIC TECH! WHICH IS WHAT IT&#x27;S ADVERTISED AS!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product Dec. 1, 2010 and it stopped working Feb.15, 2011.  It will not charge and it is now too late to return it.  I checked and it could not be returned after 1/31/11.  I have been a customer of Amazon for a long time and have bought many items but they really let their customers down on this one.</li>
            <li> I thought for the price this thing would at least spin but its just a buzzing vibrating brush, waste of money if you ask me, i&#x27;m thinking of buying the oil of olay brush instead since i found out than one spins around.</li>
            <li> Love it, really LOVE IT. how is that for a glowing review. It does as it says, but one word of advice, do not use it every day. ok</li>
            <li> My face never felt so clean and smooth until I used the pretika brush.  My Mother came to visit and she showed me hers and she let me try it and I was hooked!  I had been looking at the more expensive brand name one for a while, but I&#x27;m very happy with this one. I have very, very sensitive skin and I use my brush on low and have had no problems with it.  I love it!</li>
            <li> The Pretika facial brush is a high-tech replacement for the good old flannel and bar of soap. It comes with a spare brush and a charging cradle. The brush itself is waterproof and can be used in the shower. If you have used a Sonicare toothbrush before, you will probably find the results very comparable: your skin feels fresh, clean and healthy and looks great.  The brush holds enough charge for a few dozen uses and recharges in an hour or two when you place it into its cradle.  Now, for the bad news, unlike the pricey Clarisonic, the Pretika brush does not use induction charging but plain metallic contacts. At some point I had left the brush in a damp area and the contacts at the bottom of the handle developed rust. Also, it appears that several reviewers have experienced problems likely caused by moisture in the cradle. The good news is that it&#x27;s very easy to avoid these problems: just dry the brush with a towel after use and store it in a dry place, and make sure you never set it into its cradle if it&#x27;s wet.    The charging system of the Pretika brush is a little disappointing and it&#x27;s clearly its weak point, however once you know to keep the brush dry and never, never set it into the cradle while it&#x27;s still wet, just a little TLC will net you an excellent ultrasonic facial brush at a rock bottom price. And yes, it&#x27;s great for guys too.</li>
            <li> Love it, but this is the third time I buy this item, and stops working after a month of daily use.</li>
            <li> This little brush is just awesome!  I use it 2x daily with my usual cleanser and microdermabrasion srub once weekly, and it leaves my face beautifully clean and smooth.  I&#x27;ve even got my husband using it!  And he does not believe in \\&quot;personal care\\&quot;.  I did not want to pay over $100 for something like this but for around $40, I gave it a try and I&#x27;m glad I did.    The people who say \\&quot;it rusts\\&quot; obviously did not read the directions that say to dry it off after each use.  Otherwise yes, the metal charger contacts will rust.  Duh.</li>
            <li> Broke quickly :-( not well made. I wish Amazon still sold the prior brand i had, that one lasted four years. This one lasted a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin....with cystic acne on my chin...I have had it since I was a teen, and now still at 40...This has been wonderful for my acne and the overall appearance of my skin, NO more acne...My skin,its smooth and my pores are smaller...and I swear the wrinkles are going away, but I cant guarantee that. I just know I never want to bee without it...I have had it for about a year, use it every other day and have used it with many different cleansers. I have had no problems with it at all....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For people with problems with it working or getting gunky...I apply the cleanser to my face first, not directly on the pretika....I recharge it after it is dead and dry...it has worked fine for me with no rust or working problems...I am still on the first brush and it looks brand new...I just rinse it well after every use..I hope this helps someone.....Buy it, it has been the best product I have ever bought for my skin...people have even noticed that my skin looks better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;********This is an update...I have no idea the exact date I bought this but it is now October 2013 and it just died a few weeks ago, so above in 2011 I said I already about a year...I am now getting another one because my skin is begging for it, it looks horrible right now. I definitely got my moneys worth I love this thing.******</li>
            <li> I cant really afford to buy a Clairsonic so I was happy when I found the Pretika. I am very happy with the product. It does not spin, but vibrates on the skin, which I think is better for my skin anyways. My face always feels so clean and tight when I am done. I have noticed that fine wrinkles and black heads have been dissapearing. Worth the money!</li>
            <li> I initially gave this 5 stars... while it worked it was great, problem is it only worked for 3 months before it bit the dust. It is NOT water proof. The button does let water leak into the device, and one day the thing would not shut off. It would turn on randomly by it self for a couple nights and now it won&#x27;t turn on at all. I opened the charger cover and all this water came out of it. You get what you pay for. The facial brush systems really do work but if you want it to last you are better off spending more money for the clarisonic which has a 2 year warranty and truly is water proof.</li>
            <li> I used to be a Proactive faithful user, but had stopped using the product because of all the chemicals that could potentially enter my system while trying to conceive.  So, I stopped that product and was worried about my face acting up again.  I thought I would give this face brush a try since the reviews sounded great.  Hands down-best investment.  I am able to mimic the little \\&quot;scrubbing sand\\&quot; particles in Proactive minus the chemicals.  I don&#x27;t use any face wash, just my normal body soap-DOVE.  Skin is clear and awesome!</li>
            <li> Well, I bought this product because my sister LOVES her brush  . . . got mine, charged it &amp; used for 1 whole week!  My sister told me her brush held a charge for over a month . . . so I took mine with me when I went out of town (without a charger) for a week.  First day I tried to use it, it slowly stopped working.  Shoot!  When I got home I immediately put on the charger . . next day, NOTHING HAPPENED!  The lights come on, but nothing else happens!  I was so looking forward to using this product!!!  What happened???  Signed, Sad Woman!</li>
            <li> You have got to be stone crazy if you don&#x27;t have one of these!!!!! Love it Love it Love it!. My skin was sensitive, oily, and uneven in tone and texture. I changed my routine, products, and added this tool. The compliments fly from everyone. I love it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this!!!! I almost gave in and paid $200 for a clairisonic... but I am so glad I didn&#x27;t! This is just as good, if not better. Well worth the money. My skin has never looked so good! I am now ordering more for Christmas presents!</li>
            <li> The Pretika SonicDermabrasion facial brush does not live up to the product description.&lt;br /&gt;1.  The machine keeps going off after 60 seconds even when fully charged&lt;br /&gt;2.  The product is supposed to be water proof.  There is a small rubber plug that you can attach to the recharge port that keeps coming out.  this means possibility of electical shock or the product will be easily damaged.&lt;br /&gt;3.  The motor sounds like it is ready to break at any minute due to inferior product.  Sounds like a really cheap motor.&lt;br /&gt;I am thinking of returning this item for a better quality product.[[ASIN:B001SERK9G Pretika SonicDermabrasion Facial Brush]]</li>
            <li> I was so excited to use my new pretika.  I went to plug it in and it does not work.  It will not charge.  I emailed the customer care last night and have not heard back from them. Hope they will send me a new one and it is fabulous.</li>
            <li> i bought this item bc i have a few friends who use it and their skin is flawless! i got it a few weeks ago and i just love it! i use it once a day on the lowest setting and its the right amount for my skin. ive always had bad skin but since using this product, its gotten much better! last week someone asked me if i was wearing make up because my skin was so clear : )</li>
            <li> I was really having a hard time with my acne. I have breakouts all over my face plus with an oily skin too and I know it is caused by air pollution and stress. Im surfing the net and accidentally seen the ads about the Pretika Dermabrasion Brush; I browsed the reviews here at amazon and I did searched about it also in youtube. With these positive reviews, I decided to get 1. and I ordered it last 2months ago, and Im happy that the package was delivered fast. And now after using it for months, Im happy that it helped my skin becomes smoother, less acne breakouts and now I admit that this product is really effective in exfoliating and cleansing your skin. :) I recommend this to everyone suffering from acne :))</li>
            <li> I have to say I rarely write a review but feel the need here.  I absolutely loved the Pretika Facial Brush and used it religiously until it stopped working around 2 months after I purchased it...just does not hold a charge at all.  I wish I had thought of returning it while I still could but too much time has passed...oh well.  For a product I initially loved I am very disappointed and will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> For the Cost, Can&#x27;t be beat. Suggestion, Do not get the unit wet and try to charge, it will break. I keep my unit charging in my bedroom and I take just the machine in to the bathroom and than I make for sure that the metal is completely dry before charging again. Why pay over a $100.00 more for another brand unit unless you just like spending more of your money so you can name drop, if you know what I mean. But, Of course.  Whatever you choose Have Fun...</li>
            <li> I WAS SOOOO EXCITED WHEN IT ARRIVED ON TIME. I USED IT RIGHT AWAY,,,AND I WAS IMPRESSED!! AFTER JUST ONE USE MY SKIN FELT SMOOTHER, CLEANER, AND ACTUALLY HAD A FRESH GLOW!! MY HUSBAND EVEN ASKED ME TO USE IT ON HIS FACE!! AND YES, THE BRUSHES ACTUALLY ROTATE.</li>
            <li> I got this product two years ago &amp; LOVED the way it cleaned &amp; how my skin looked. But after about two years of use it will no longer take a charge... I&#x27;ve written the co. to see if they&#x27;ll stand behind it or not. Overall I was very happy with it. But I expect things to last, so not sure about getting another one.</li>
            <li> This does nothing for my skin, Ive given it a chance for two months and nothing. I wish I could find Pretika MD170 for a reasonable price, the scrubber I used before this one, but it looks like they discontinued it and now want to charge way to much for it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great. I noticed a huge difference when i started using it. My first one died and my face didn&#x27;t feel as clean only a few weeks after. I missed it so much, I bought a new one. The brush is soft but it cleans my face well.</li>
            <li> As first I would have given this machine 5 stars because it cleaned my skin beautifully HOWEVER the battery stopped holding a charge after a year. I got the SonicDermabrasion for Christmas 2009 - and on December 16 2010 it stopped working completely. The money was by no means worth the use for just one year. I am disappointed!</li>
            <li> I purchased the Pretika Sonic Dermabrasion brush about 4 weeks ago, and it is a wonderful product! Originally wanted the clarisonic, but the Pretika is a great alternative and very reasonable price. My skin is combination (oily tzone). I dont have sensitive skin, so I use it daily on the lower setting as part of my regular skin care routine.. and once a week on stronger setting to exfoliate. My skin has never been smoother!! Its glowing, and keeps the blackheads away from my nose! I absolutely love it! I use glytone skin care products, and the brush definitely helps my skin better absorb them. Ive read alot of people who complain about the pretika brush dying on them after a short time... I believe that this will happen if u recharge the brush while its wet. Make sure the brush is completely dry before setting back to charge!! Especially the metal charging plates. I even go a step further, and place a plastic ziploc bag over the charging cradle while i wash my face, to make sure i dont splash water on it. If you take care of this brush, it will take care of you!!</li>
            <li> I bought this item TWICE...both times it stopped working after a few months. I loved it while it worked! I wrote to Pretika and did not get a response.</li>
            <li> Initially I was pleased that I saved money on the Pretika SonicDermabrashion Facial Brush until it wound up in the trash can.  Within four months of owning the brush the initial charge had worn down.  I used once or twice a month.  I thought fine I&#x27;ll just set it on the charger and use the following day.  Little did I know that it just doesn&#x27;t charge a second time.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I love this and use if everyday&#x27;. It&#x27;s better then those that cost a hundred dollars.</li>
            <li> I really like the brush. As the reviews say, take care of the brush and it will take care of you.  Never charge it while it&#x27;s wet. Try to keep it as dry as possible.  The charge is really long, I haven&#x27;t even charged it once, I&#x27;ve had it for a long time.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Great price. My friends all have the expensive Ulta brand-this works just as good. My skin now looks great!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t aford the \\&quot;C\\&quot; pricey one. I have used this one for over a year and am very happy with it.  I recently bought 3 more for presents.</li>
            <li> It is a good product for the price.  The downside is you have to completely dry the unit before charging again. If you do not it will rust on the bottom. The cleanser seems to spray all over the place also.</li>
            <li> The unit will rust in 2 days while charging. The unit does not have an international charger. The unit has a 30 days warranty. The unit broke down in less than a week. It is because so many false reviews are posted here. I have to let the truth be known. Luckily; I bought this from B&amp;B, so I returned it with digust. This is the worst product that I bought in years. Buy this, you will be sorry. Try MIA by Clarisonic instead of this junk.</li>
            <li> The Clarisonic was too expensive for me. The Pretika facial brush does everything it promises. The head is large enough to use on my rough knees and elbows, leaving them smooth. It has helped reduce the lines on my neck and hyperpigmentation on my chest.</li>
            <li> I hate this product. There&#x27;s  nothing &amp;#34;sonic &amp;#34; about it . It simply rotates (&amp; tangles up any stray hairs that get in it&#x27;s way). I would give 0 stars if I could. Only good thing is that it was cheap, so I didn&#x27;t waste too much money.</li>
            <li> Although I think this facial brush would work well for those who do not have sensitive skin or problems with cystic acne ( I get them on my chin), I&#x27;m less than thrilled with this brush. Had I researched it a little better rather than going off the advice from my derm., I would have determined that due to this brush having ONE stlye of brush head and the fact that a more firm brissle will irritate my acne, I could have waited a bit longer and applied what I actually spent on this to a Clairsonic Mia. Again, this brush is good bang for your buck...but you need to know what works for your skin.     On a side note...I advise you to follow the instructions...you need to charge it for 24 hours and don&#x27;t put it back on the cradle unless it&#x27;s (the cradle) unplugged. If you place it in the cradle to charge after every use, you will greatly diminish the longevity of your brush. I charged mine once...for 24 hours and still, after a month of daily use, I don&#x27;t need to charge it. This should be a no brainer, but I read the reviews and well, I felt the need to chime in on this particular issue. IF you place the brush back on the UNPLUGGED cradle, you must make sure that the entire brush handle is bone DRY and the brush is NOT dripping wet or you will find yourself with a rust problem - which will further cause issue with charging your brush in the future.</li>
            <li> I was interested in the clairsonic microdermabrasion brush but couldn&#x27;t justify paying that much to try a product. I am glad I purchased this very reasonably priced and capable alternative. I was looking for something to brighten my complexion and help manage oil and unclog pores on my nose. I started out using the brush once a day at night with my normal Bliss cleanser and I noticed a difference right away. The brush has two speeds and automatically times for you when you should move it to a different area of your face. Now after about three weeks of use I am having many positive comments from people who don&#x27;t even know I am using something. Someone asked me what I am doing with my makeup because my face is so bright and vibrant looking. My answer was, I AM NOT WEARING MAKEUP! To be 42 years old and walk out with out any makeup says a lot about a product. I just use the bush and some SPF moisturizer and I am good. My pores are unclogged not only on the nose area but everywhere and are smaller and much less noticeable. I am very happy with the product. I charged it up one time and have been using that same charge this entire time. When it needs to be recharged I will make sure it is completely dry before putting it on the power stand. I also watched a youtube video of someone demoing the use of the brush and that was helpful to me. It is best to wet your face and put on the cleanser all over and then use the brush. Don&#x27;t put the cleanser on the brush. I am now using the product on the gentle setting twice a day and it really works for me. My face is much cleaner using this product then from washing with cleanser alone. It comes with two brushes and I am still on the first brush. I will buy some replacements to have around. I&#x27;ve never used the clairsonic but this product works well for me at a much lower price. what more can you ask for?</li>
            <li> After only 3 months, the brush will not hold a charge, so we will have to throw it away.  Waste of money!</li>
            <li> Junk! Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Mine broke in 1 week from the day I got it.  Absolute garbage!! It just totally stopped working.</li>
            <li> You could get an expensive facial brush or you can get this one at a great price and it is fantastic. The charge lasts a long time and I can take it in shower with me. This is my second Pretika Facial Brush (my first one got lost during a recent move) and it really makes a difference in the smoothness of my skin.</li>
            <li> This product would be rated at least a four if it didn&#x27;t break so quickly. It lasted me about three weeks. I was very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> I have had my Pretika for 5 months and I love it!  I have seen a definate difference in my skin and I would recommend this to anyone who has acne prone - sensitive skin.  I only use it twice a week and I make sure that it is completely dry befor putting back on the charger.  My husband told me the other day that my skin looked fantastic!  I would try this before spending the money on the other more expensive brand.</li>
            <li> The bristles on this brush are way too harsh. The bristles are just as harsh as a hard bristled toothbrush, so if you want this, you might as well get a vibrating toothbrush to save you money. This will only make your skin peel even more because it&#x27;s tearing at it rather than just polishing it. I have the Olay one now, and it does so much better and actually works.</li>
            <li> When i brought it in December I was excited love it clean face really well and inexpensive now in June only use it for 6 months is broken already it didn&#x27;t charge at all it won&#x27;t even turn on . suck got to buy a new one I will not buy pretik product again .</li>
            <li> I love the,  pretika  sonic  brush. It really does a great  job. My face looks feels so soft.  Thanks 😃</li>
            <li> This product was great for only about three months!  I noticed less breakouts and much cleaner feeling skin.  The battery charge lasted a long time.  However, when I recharged it for the first time, it quit working properly.  It wouldn&#x27;t turn off for hours!!!  I had to put it in my garage to get any sleep and to keep the dogs from freaking out.  The next day, after recharging again and not getting it to turn on this time, I took the unit apart to investigate.  The entire inside was corroded, but the light was still blinking!  Needless to say, it was trash.  It was such a disappointment, since I thought I had found the perfect skin care tool.</li>
            <li> This product works well to smooth skin and give a gentle dermabrasion at a great price point.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using the machine,  My face feels tingly and fresh.  What I do not like is the machine is WHITE (that&#x27;s OK) but the plug and cord are BACK.  It&#x27;s seems they should both be white.</li>
            <li> This thing is supposed to be waterproof.... Well, it is NOT!!!  This thing lasted about a week then it would turn itself on at random times of the day then it wouldn&#x27;t turn on when I tried to use it.  Then it just died.  It did however work nice for the few days before it tanked out on me.</li>
            <li> Amazon sells this for less than half the price the local dermatologist does.  It works great.</li>
            <li> Cleans very good, removing the death cells, thas the way i fell. very soft the skin. Excellent</li>
            <li> I bought this knowing that several reviewers said theirs stopped working after a certain amount of time.  I didnt think it would happen to me, so I ordered it. It worked great for 2 weeks. My skin felt so smooth and clean. The bristles felt a little rough, but it didn&#x27;t look like it was hurting my skin the way an abrasive exfoliating wash does.  So I continued using it every other day for 2 weeks, and it stopped working. I was sooooo careful knowing that others had issues.  I kept it from getting wet at the base where it charges. I promise I did not get it wet, never ran it under water.  I removed the bristle head to rinse the bristles , and laid the head out to dry as I put the dry machine into it the charging cradle. Next morning it just would not work.  I tried and tried to attempt to charge, recharge and it just never worked again. Of course I didn&#x27;t keep the packing slip so I can&#x27;t return it to amazon. Now I just use the brush head by pushing it around my face in my thumb and finger grip... Hard to maneuver but it is still exfoliating for my skin. Buyer beware and not dumb like me. :(</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife. she likes it a lot. easy for use and function is good. the only thing need to improve is some details, not fine. Anyway, the price and quality are very nice!</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THIS ITEM FOR MY DAUGHTER ON XMAS THINKING I WOULD SAVE MONEY-INSTEAD OF BUYING THE CLARISONIC MINI... WELL IT IS HORRIBLE! IT RETAINS WATER AND SHOOTS OUT BROWN OLD WATER ONTO YOUR FACE. HORRIBLE PRODUCT! INVEST IN THE CLARISONIC!</li>
            <li> This brush is my baby. My first one died a few weeks ago after a year of ownership. I see an improvement with the charger. The brush doesn&#x27;t charge from the base anymore and I think that&#x27;s a huge plus. If you want a sonic brush that doesn&#x27;t break the bank like the MIA this is a great alternative and two brush heads are included</li>
            <li> I have had two of these products. The first time it stopped working within 2 or 3 months. I thought that may have been myh fault for some odd reason, so I bought another one! This time around it only lasted about a week. I&#x27;m sending it back and want a refund. The product itself works great however it is useless if it won&#x27;t last a week out of the box.</li>
            <li> This is my second Pretika machine; this one is for my teen daughter. It works great and appears that it is a new unit. What I don&#x27;t like is the unit does not beep every 15 seconds like my other unit. Due to this, and my daughter&#x27;s inexperience in facial cleansing, I will be using the new one and give her the old one.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. I&#x27;m currently on my 2nd brush. I used the first one for about 6 months before I dropped it and broke it. I had dropped it many other times with no effect but I guess this time was the charm. As soon as I realized it was broken I ordered a new one. I didn&#x27;t want to be without it. I used it every other day on the gentle setting as directed, 20 seconds on each area. My skin looks wonderful and feels very soft and smooth. I could not recommend this more highly. I&#x27;m not sure if it is 100% as good as a Clarisonic since I&#x27;ve never used one before but for about 25% of the price I think this is an EXCELLENT product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for only a week but I actually look years younger.  It seems like it has smoothed fine lines, cleans deep, shrinks pores and leaves my face soft and smooth.  My skin actually glows. I have only used my regular over the counter facial soap with it.  You really cannot beat the price.  I say try this one before spending the money on the clarisonic.</li>
            <li> I have always wanted to have a facial cleanser like this. I cant afford much that&#x27;s why I decided to try this one! And I&#x27;m happy I did! It&#x27;s soft and gentle to my face. This is a very wonderful product. You should get one! :)</li>
            <li> False advertisement! The description states &amp;#34;Featuring Micro-Pulsating Vibration Cleansing Technology&amp;#34;, it does neither. It only spins.  In 2010 I punched one at a TJ Max, it lasted four years before it stopped charging. Because the first one worked as described &amp;#34;Featuring Micro-Pulsating Vibration Cleansing Technology&amp;#34; and so much cheaper than the Clarisonic brand, I was excited to purchase a replacement. I returned this disappointing product. Be forewarned.</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with this facial scrubber until it stopped working after only 2 months! Be sure to read the other reviews; I wish I had before purchasing! Wanted to save money by buying this unit rather than spend $$ for a Clarisonic but you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> Love it!!....Every time I use it I feel like I&#x27;m doing something  special  for my skin.</li>
            <li> Great product! About $100 less than a brand competitor.&lt;br /&gt;Bristles may be a little tough. I recommend making the bristles wet before applying it to the face.</li>
            <li> I like this brush b/c it has a larger head than the Olay product and the head moves faster as well. But after 6 months the unit stopped working. My father opened it up to fix it and the inside was completely corroded. I refuse to buy another one if the unit isn&#x27;t water resistant.</li>
            <li> This brush is assume and i have to say am happy with my purchase.Now first off this is a great brush it may not be the clarisonic brush but what do u expect its way cheaper and its not as advance but for someone who doesn&#x27;t want to shell out a a lot of money for one brush then this would be a great replacement for that.I have used it everyday since i got it and i have notice a great change in my skin.Also i see a lot of people complaining about how its rough on the skin but i guess that because there rubbing it too rough on there skin because i have very sensitive skin and i have had no problems with it on my skin.All I have to say this product is the best and it works wonders with my skincare products.</li>
            <li> This Product is half a dupe for the clarisonic. It does heavy vibration, but I do wish the brush was more softer. So if you do use this product, Do not press down, lightly press to your skin. It does make my skin feel cleaner, it is not an acne solution, that has a lot to do with your food intake and that lifestyle, also with what cleanser  you decide to use. I thought after i kept using this product that the bristles would soften up, but it did not. So the only alternative I have to that is just a light touch to your skin. I did call the maufacturer for differnt heads for sensitive skin, but they only had the one set. All and all this product is a good product, But beware you only have a 30day  limited warranty and anything were to happen after that point there is a fee you have to pay, so thats a negative. But just take care of it, dont let fluid leak to the charging station, what I do after im finished, i wipe it completely down, let it dry, before i put back on the charging station i remove the brush head, obviously that stays damp, then im ok. I have had this about 8 months, does very well for me. But I have given it serious thought and I do what the Clarisonic, and will be making a future purcahse. Hope this Review does help.</li>
            <li> I really, really (really) wanted a Clarisonic! I&#x27;m 43 and live in a tropical climate, however, I don&#x27;t like to spend money on facials. I researched the Clarisonic and decided I couldn&#x27;t pay that much for a facial tool.  I stumbled across this Pretika and took a chance. I had read a lot of good reviews, but also some iffy ones--but for the price it was worth a try.  Right out of the box, this facial brush was easy to use.  It also came with an extra brush, which I thought was a nice touch. So I get to work with the brush.  My skin felt amazing the first time I used it! It really made a difference. I don&#x27;t know why I thought these brushes were supposed to spin as that would tear your skin.  This brush pulsates (as I guess the Clarisonic does too).    Now I would like to address the issues others have written about--others said that the item stopping work after awhile and rusting.  I have experienced none of these issues and I&#x27;ve had mine for months.  As with anything cordless, you should only leave it in the charger while it is charging--do not store it in there and charge it 24/7--you will wear down the battery. In regard to the rusting, this is also what happens to metal if you put it into a charger while wet. I don&#x27;t even charge mine that often. When I use it, I towel it off afterwards. In addition, my original brush is still in great condition. I soak it in a dixie cup of water occasionally and all of the product that hasn&#x27;t rinsed off will float off and it&#x27;s clean as new. I recommend this Pretika!</li>
            <li> I was leaning toward the much more expensive Clarisonic but decided to save some money and try this.  I love it!  Just be sure to follow the instructions regarding the moisture issue.  Do not replace the unit in the charging base while it is damp or wet.  It makes my skin glow and is   nice and smooth.  My skin care products are more readily asorbed into the skin because of the stimulation and cleansing of my face due to this product.</li>
            <li> i simply love this facial brush!! i love the compact design and the rechargeable base it sits in. the power is strong also.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had the Petrika a few weeks, and have been pretty faithful to the twice daily use they recommend.&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised and quite disappointed that the brush head doesn&#x27;t rotate at all; just the sonic vibration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush head IS NOT easy to pull off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the holder design is sorely lacking.  They warn you against charging the unit if the contacts are wet, yet have you store your wet unit in the charging base????&lt;br /&gt;A separate cradle built in to the charger base would make more sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed some change to my skin; no reduction to pore size or clogged pores, but it does feel a bit tighter.  I seem to be a bit more red and ruddy now, but just slightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you shake the water off after rinsing after use - there is something loose like a screw or something rattling around!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy this unit if I knew then what I know now?  Probably not!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus they could use work on their instructions, soap or no, scrubs? lotion?  It&#x27;s all guesswork because they don&#x27;t really tell you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Debi</li>
            <li> Using every day.Can&#x27;t image n to live with out it.</li>
            <li> As described, Came on time...would order again.</li>
            <li> I received this product for Christmas and I loved it for the first two months. It made my skin cleaner and softer. Then it started to only work intermittently. After about two to three weeks of this it completely died. It was a gift and was not under warranty so I ended up just throwing it away. It was really disappointing! I want to purchase another one but I&#x27;ll pay more for a brand that lasts.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the fast and prompt service! Product as described. Love this product!!! I have had it for a while and it works great!! A++++ Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> i just received the product in the mail today and i guess they&#x27;ve changed the charging method since they kept breaking?... Mine has a charging hole on the bottom of the brush and the charger is actually just a chord separate from the apparatus itself. You cannot sit the brush on the dock that came with it while charging since the wire will be in the way. The dock that it came with was just plastic and doesn&#x27;t do anything besides letting the brush sit on your counter...(charging doesn&#x27;t go through this) anyone else got theirs like this?</li>
            <li> This facial brush worked beautifully for about 4 months - then the time between charges got shorter and shorter - now it will no longer work at all.  Would definitely not purchase another.</li>
            <li> This product is of very low quality. It has already died, I have only had it for six months. Disappointed that I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> My mom got this for me as a gift&lt;br /&gt;And It works great&lt;br /&gt; I like the fast speed&lt;br /&gt;After I use it my face feels very clean and fresh</li>
            <li> It filled up with water in the shower and has not worked since. Got about a week of use out of it so can&#x27;t really say how it works.</li>
            <li> Buyer beware. I really hate having to write a bad review, but I feel like I have to warn other people about this product.  First, the bristles are SO ROUGH and I don&#x27;t even have sensitive skin.  There are no other brush heads you can get, no sensitive, no delicate, just this one rough bristled brush.  Second, the warranty is only for 30 days!!  What&#x27;s up with that??  Third, this thing just broke on me after having it only 6 months.  I never put it in the cradle wet, I followed the instructions exactly.  Truthfully I didn&#x27;t even use it that often because it was so harsh on my face and I went to give it another try 2 days ago and it buzzed and wouldn&#x27;t stop.  I tried charging it, tapping it against my hand, changing the heads and it just wouldn&#x27;t stop buzzing.  It finally just up and died. I wish I had never bought it. I was hoping it would be a less expensive alternative to the Clarisonic, but it&#x27;s not and I wasted my money. I wish I had just saved up for the real thing. :(</li>
            <li> Great product would highly recommend to use for renewing your skin.  Just be careful and do not use it on high everyday!!</li>
            <li> Dont buy, the thing worked good when it ran, but it should be considered as a disposable product. the end</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product. I just don&#x27;t understand why they made a cradle for it that doesn&#x27;t hold it while its charging. We cut into our cradle to be able to have spec for the charging cord while sitting in the base. It&#x27;s still not as secure as we like, but at least it&#x27;s not laying out on its side while being charged.</li>
            <li> I liked it while it worked for all of 2 months. Then, it would be charged, but wouldn&#x27;t turn on.</li>
            <li> excellent love it would recommend it to a friend only thing it take s time to get use to the brush as it move very quickly</li>
            <li> --edit 02/03/12--- Downgrading my review because the device stopped functioning correctly after just under 10 months. The button got stuck in the on position and the brush head stopped moving. Sad really because I really liked the thing when it worked. I wish the warranty lasted longer than 90 days.---  --edit 02/21/12--- This is *NOT* water resistant. If you use it in the shower expect it to die shortly after you bought it. If you don&#x27;t use it in the shower, make sure that it is dried after each use to prevent rusting. I found this out after taking mine apart (since it died for good) and there&#x27;s water damage all over the place!  I bought this back in April &#x27;11 looking for something to help me clear up my skin. I&#x27;ve got really oily skin, so oily in fact that come afternoon having washed my face in the morning, I can slide my hands down the \\&quot;T\\&quot; of the forehead and come away with oil on them. Plus I have big pores. All this is perfect breeding grounds for cystic acne. Topical medications were not working that great due to all the oil and dead skin. I read about this device having ultrasonic properties to it and that factor is what compelled me into buying this little friend.  Operation is pretty basic. One button. Push it once and you&#x27;ve got the standard force//pressure/function. Push it two times and it goes to a lighter force/pressure/function for more sensitive skin. Use it will soap, facial cleanser, microbead cleanser. I use a microbead cleanser on my face and then use the device for an extra boost in getting rid of all the dead skin and oil on my face.  I have never had a microdermabrasion procedure done so I can&#x27;t compare the two. I do know that after cleaning my skin with this, there is a major difference in feeling. And the topical medication that I use to keep my face clear sinks in farther and works 8x better. And I don&#x27;t limit myself to just using it on my face. I use it on my upper back as well with regular body wash. Amazing reduction of acne and cysts back there too!  It comes with two brush heads. I have kept the same one very clean since the start and it is still working just fine! So taking good care of it will definitely benefit you in the long run. I&#x27;m sure replacement heads could be found on Amazon.com as well. I honestly haven&#x27;t looked because I haven&#x27;t had the need to.  Definitely recommend this one!</li>
            <li> For the price I think this brush does a great job. My skin does feel cleaner after using it and when applying a toner after washing with this the cotton doesn&#x27;t show any residue of make up. I haven&#x27;t used it in the shower so I don&#x27;t know how well it resists the water. My only complaint is that I haven&#x27;t been able to find replacement brushes at a decent price so I guess when the two included brushes wear down I&#x27;ll have to buy a new unit.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product three times because it was really good at cleaning my face and helping keep it blemish free. It is extremely unreliable though as I have had to send it back twice and would have sent it back the first time if it wasn&#x27;t past the time frame to do so. The first time it just stopped charging correctly and I had to throw it away. The second time it was working fine until it just stopped turning on no matter how many times I charged it. This last time it never even turned on out of the box, so I will be returning as soon as possible. Too unreliable to put your money into, there are more reliable products out there for cheaper.</li>
            <li> Great ! it is gental enough to use everyday</li>
            <li> Worked great initially, but just completely died 8 months after purchase. Warranty is only 90 days. What a piece of crap.</li>
            <li> This is just a spin brush and it&#x27;s way too rough on the skin.  I literally ended up peeling back a layer of skin and ended up with what looked like a burn mark on the side of the lip/chin area.  It made my skin super dehydrated and coarse because it over exfoliated.  I would not recommend this product as it was as cheap as it is priced.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this I expected that this would operate much like a Clarisonic, but obviously for the price would not be as well made or last near as long as one would expect for the price of a Clarisonic. I was okay with the fact that I would be getting a sonic facial brush for about $30 that might only last a few months. I figured if I liked the way it worked with my skin maybe I&#x27;d get a real Clarisonic when it died. But instead of getting an inexpensive SONIC brush I received a pretty fancy ROTATING brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve ever used a real Clarisonic you know what I mean when I say there is a huge difference. Yes, both will exfoliate. Both are more effective than using your fingers or a washcloth with your soap/facial cleansers for getting into the pores and removing dirt, oil, and makeup. But a Clarisonic actually does what this advertises when it says &amp;#34;Micro-Pulsating Vibration Cleansing&amp;#34;. This doesn&#x27;t vibrate, it spins. That means as you glide this over the face it&#x27;s going to twist and pull at your skin, which is no bueno. It stretches the skin, and at my age that&#x27;s something that makes me nervous about using this-especially when I saw the skin under my eyes twist up when I used it on my cheeks. Since the word &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; is right there in the name, and it advertises &amp;#34;Micro-Pulsating Vibration Cleansing&amp;#34;, I had to give this 1 star for false advertisement. I actually had to check to see if I received this through Amazon and not another merchant because I thought perhaps this was a knock-off. Other reviewers said that it was just like a Clarisonic, so perhaps Petrika changed this with newer models. If so they should update the description too, because this doesn&#x27;t pulse or vibrate at all. It only spins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as what it really is-a rotating facial brush, it really doesn&#x27;t seem that bad. I do like the fact that this is rechargeable instead of requiring batteries like one I owned years ago. As I recall it went through AA batteries like crazy. So this is probably a better option than the Olay brush or similar ones you see in the facial care aisle in the department stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read enough reviews stating this is not near as water-resistant as it claims to be so when I do use it I&#x27;ll make sure to keep moisture out of it. I wouldn&#x27;t trust this being kept in a shower or even in a really steamy bathroom, but that&#x27;s based off other reviews and not my own experience. I only opened it and charged it yesterday so I honestly can&#x27;t speak for how long this will last with proper care. All I can say is that it works, it charged like it should, it has two speeds like it says. It turns itself off after one minute but it doesn&#x27;t beep like it says it does. Not that that bothers me-but don&#x27;t scrub a hole in your forehead waiting for an alert to scrub your cheek.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line-for a rotating brush this is honestly worth the price. It seems better than the Olay face brush since it&#x27;s rechargeable and probably equally water-resistant at only a few extra dollars (but money saved in batteries), along with having variable speeds. If the description was honest I&#x27;d likely hold off on a review for a few weeks and give it a rating based on results/if it broke after a week/etc. But if you&#x27;re looking for a cheap Clarisonic this is not it and don&#x27;t let the buzzwords above trick you into thinking this is comparable.</li>
            <li> I bought this over a few months back and never used it up until 2 months ago in which i was using religiously morning and nite. Not sure if it was the use of it in the shower or whether normal wear and tear but the thing just stopped working! I went to use and realized it was just making a \\&quot;vibration\\&quot; noise but the bristles didnt move. I wish i had paid attention to previous reviews when it came to this issue. Figured that maybe they received a faulty untit or were not charging the device properly. It was a nice run while i had it but not worth the price if it will only work for 2 months.</li>
            <li> Pretika does an excellent job for so much less than the Clairisonic. The 2 speeds give an excellent choice for exfoliating the face!</li>
            <li> This is a gentle but effective way to deeply cleanse and exfoliate.  Please be aware to purchase a adaptor plug if you live in the UK though.</li>
            <li> Pit died within 60 days.  Even though it was warranties the company wanted more $ to repair it or whatever than what it was worth. Even though it worked well and made my skin ok, it&#x27;s not worth it</li>
            <li> I have only used this item for about one month, but I see really good results already.  I use it all over my face (not under my eyes) and neck and decollete.  I started out the first day only with the low setting.  But now I only use the high setting and it takes about 3 or 4 re-starts to finish the job.  I use it almost daily (sometimes I just don&#x27;t have the time)  Really happy with the results already.  Skin feels smoother and seems to absorb the creams I put on my skin even better.  It is actually really easy to use, but, as others have said, not in the shower; must be kept dry inside!  To prevent rusting, etc., I am very careful not to get any water inside the handle.  I dry it immediately after using, wash the brush, and let it air dry.  I&#x27;m hoping this will allow it to last past the 3 month warranty time.  Pretty confident it will last.  Good price, too.  (Other facial brushes too expensive for my budget).&lt;br /&gt;Downside:  if I press too hard against the skin, the brush slows down and makes me think it needs charging, but it&#x27;s just the way it works.  Sometimes I&#x27;m in a hurry and want the brush to turn faster.  Definitely worth the investment!</li>
            <li> Received it as scheduled. I&#x27;ve been using it for two week and love the way my skin feels and looks. My only problem is that the brushes are a little to stiff, so I&#x27;m now using it every other day.</li>
            <li> I used to have a Clarisonic but after a year or so, it stopped working. I bought this brush to replace it. It was wonderful and worked for two years. It&#x27;s true the brush was harsher, but my skin became used to it and I believe the Pretika sonic brush was an excellent value. Finally, after 2 years and three months, the brush stopped working. So, of course, I bought another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first brush (identical at first glance) vibrated and did not rotate.  The brush itself had two small metal plates and when the brush needed to be charged, it would sit in the white charging base which also had two metal plates.  There was a cord which plugged into the base itself and the brush would sit in the base charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The newer replacement model is not at all the same.  It is no longer a sonic brush although they have not changed the name. This brush rotates now, does not vibrate. I tried it, and the spinning, although I&#x27;m sure it deep cleans, it much harsher and pulls my skin to the right.  There is no more charging base. There is a base, but it&#x27;s to be used when the brush doesn&#x27;t need to be charged. Now the cord plugs right into the bottom of the brush.  There is a small silicone plug that stays inserted when you use the brush in the shower but that you must pull out to plug in the charging cord.  The base itself is just to hold the brush. .. it&#x27;s no longer a charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the info on this page regarding the brush is outdated.  It&#x27;s still advertised as using &amp;#34;Micro-Pulsating Vibration Cleansing Technology&amp;#34; but the brush no longer vibrates and there&#x27;s definitely no more &amp;#34;micro-pulsing&amp;#34;.  This brush was returned. Waste of money.  Before buying a Clarisonic again, however, I&#x27;m just bought a Sirius Sonic through Groupon for 19.  Haven&#x27;t received it yet, but looking forward to trying that one.</li>
            <li> I wound up buying the Pretika Sonic Dermabrasion Facial Brush at a local retailer, plus I had a 20% coupon. At first I was skeptical, since in the last few years or so, these types of machines have really flooded the market, with various types of brushes. I just used it, on the 2nd setting, and I am VERY impressed, and VERY happy with how the brush felt on my skin, as well as how smooth my skin feels after just one use.&lt;br /&gt;The instructions say to turn on the facial brush on a dry towel to dry it off. I did that, as well as taking the brush off the unit and have it drying on its own on a Kleenex. I have also dried off the whole unit, and I even opened up the plug where the wall charger goes, and dried that off, and still have it open to continue the drying process. I do have the unit in another room so that condensation doesn&#x27;t build in the unit, so there is no worries of rust, or issues of it not working in a month, like some people have had a problem with.&lt;br /&gt;Be prepared that the bristles on the brush don&#x27;t last very long. It looks like I have used it for quite some time, not just for the first time. What I do like, is that Amazon has a 4pk for about $22 and the Pretika site has the same pack for $20 so that is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;I do like the fact that you have 2 power controls. The first one is fast, the second control is slower, tho I think there is only a slight difference between the 2. I can&#x27;t fathom paying more than $60 for something like this, so overall, I am very satisfied with the Pretika Sonic Dermabrasion Facial Brush.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE.........I Have had this Pretika brush for quit awhile now. It still works beautifully, and even tho I have left it in the bathroom a few times during hot showers, nothing has gone wrong with it. It still charges up, it still holds a charge, and the bristles hold pretty well still, I haven&#x27;t changed the brush head. I still have had no problems with it at all, so well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo7H88S38PEZQW]]Very starnge  SPINS does not vibrate even though it says Sonic Demabrassion .Also I DONT THINK THE ENITRE UNIT IS WATERPROOF The reacharching hole is barely covered by a piece of plastic, therefore I  dont see how the unit can be operate in the shower i havent tried it in the shower and i dont plan to.  Does not beep after 20 seconds(not that i care) but does shut off after one minute.  Here are some tips on how to use it:&lt;br /&gt; Donot use it in the shower and donot get the chairging hole wet.&lt;br /&gt; Clean the brush every single time after you use them&lt;br /&gt; Charge it for atleast 1 hour the first time</li>
            <li> Breaks down in a month, you can only get one full charge from the product. When attempting to charge the product for the second time it stops working. The light will indicate that it is fully charged but the second you unplug it the battery is dead against without any use.</li>
            <li> This is the worst experience I&#x27;ve ever had with a battery device. The brush was functional for about 4-5 weeks. After that, the battery lost strength (even after being recharged) and it is now absolutely useless. While being recharged, the appropriate lights are on, but when you try to use it, the moving device is completely motionless. Since I live abroad, sending the brush to claim the warranty is rather expensive (and probably useless because of the time postal services take to send and deliver international packages). I sincerely disencourage buying this product. It has been a really annoying experience.</li>
            <li> Worked great while it worked.  Did make it through the warranty period, but only because it was rarely used.  As soon as it was used with any regularity it started getting loud and just proved itself to be a poor product.  Sad, because it was nice while it lasted.</li>
            <li> Purchased this Facial Brush 3 times.  Each time it stopped working. Don&#x27;t waste your money.&lt;br /&gt;The product has not had any enhancement or upgrade for improving better operation over the past&lt;br /&gt;two years.  It will work for awhile in the beginning then it just dies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed for sure.</li>
            <li> it cleans my face well. It doesn&#x27;t pulse it just spins strongly and has two different settings. It is water friendly and gets the job done...but I really wished it pulsed too.</li>
            <li> I would have given this 5 stars because I loved it. But It refuses to charge and is dead after a year. Such a disappointment. I see that you can buy four extra heads and I&#x27;m now wondering WHOSE LASTS THAT LONG???</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read several reviews on this brush that recommend spending a few dollars more to get a better one but honestly I haven&#x27;t found one that cost a &amp;#34;few&amp;#34; dollars more. This one works just fine for me and I really like it.</li>
            <li> Really happy with it, my skin feels great after each use. My skin feels so clean and tight and soaks up any product I use afterwards.</li>
            <li> this is a great little exfoliating brush at a reasonable price. seriously why pay $200 when this one works great</li>
            <li> This is my first facial brush and it works really well.  The battery lasts quite a while before it has to be recharged.  It comes with two brushes also.  I&#x27;m enjoying it very much.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it had really good reviews. I used this in the shower each night but never submerged it in water. I let it dry after every use on its holder. Piece of junk! The first one lasted 60 days before it stopped working. The replacement about the same length of time.</li>
            <li> Hi. According to the package, there was supposed to be 2 replacement heads and a charger, neither of which was in the package. Only the facial brush as is in pic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s obvious that I&#x27;m not the only one with a broken Pretika after a few months. Its a shame because I really  loved it. I will NOT purchase it again since it is not dependable and has such a limited warranty. We all work too hard for our money to throw it away.</li>
            <li> It worked well fro the beginning. Now, 1.5 year later its broken. Not well design, don&#x27;t recomend to ppurchase this product.</li>
            <li> Brush moves in a circular motion. Charge lasts a long time (about a week). For the price, I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other battery powered brushes, but this is larger, and definitely has more power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This worked great in the beginning. I don&#x27;t usually leave a bad review, unless it&#x27;s something pretty bad. This product is really bad. After a few uses, charging the battery didn&#x27;t even last through a full cycle. For the price, this is a bad purchase! My less expensive one is a lot more reliable.</li>
            <li> gift for my daughter.</li>
            <li> So far so good!  After second use i can see and feel a difference in my skin.  Its Much more soft and my makeup glides on. The brush head dows not vibrate it spins.  I will be leaving another comment if it lasts a few months.  Read other reviews sayin the device dies.  Lets hope it lasts because i love it so far!...FEW MONTHS LATER...mine broke. no idea why.just stopped charging.</li>
            <li> It was a big disappointment for me when I found the rechargeable connection was very poorly designed.  Instead of a mechanism much like any rechargeable tooth brush the brush unit have to be connected much like a mobile phone or portable boombox.  So the unit have to be laying about while being charged instead of sitting in its cradle.  The tiny rubber that covers the connector is difficult to manage unless you have smallish and steady hands.  Noticed I said hands, because you need one hand to hold the unit and the tab open at the same time, then use the other hand to put the plug into the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the motor a bit weak.  For those who are considering changing the brush head and use for other purposes, you&#x27;ll be disappointed.  The one minute auto shut off is a minor annoyance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit does what it is suppose to - cleans the face.  Unless some previous comments, I found the brush very soft and just the right length for the purpose.  The unit is very quiet while operating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it is an economical facial cleansing system.</li>
            <li> Great product for the entire week it was working. It is not resistant to even the lightest of exposure to water. Total piece of garbage.</li>
            <li> I love this. It makes your face feel very refreshed after each use. It is worth the money. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I do not like this product because I did not find it very useful. I wish I could return this product because after using it for about 4 times total since I got it, it sits on the side of my tub collecting duct!. I find that I can clean my face well without the use of this brush. another product to take up room and create clutter in our home.</li>
            <li> it has been acting funny the last week or so. i have only had it a few months. it&#x27;s definitely no clarisonic but that broke on me too so i am not going to waste that kind of money again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it is &amp;#34;slidey&amp;#34; as one reviewer said. hard to clean nose area bc of that. also hard to tell 2 speeds apart. wish slower speed was just that. it&#x27;s still quite fast and feels harsh on my face sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;comes with extra brush which is nice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if it continues to work, then i will be satisfied. but will be hopeful that clarisonic comes out a $100 model and i will get insurance if possible this time.</li>
            <li> I am returning my second one, the first one broke after about a week. The replacement lasted about a month. It would not re-charge and kept beeping even when it was on the charger. It woke my husband and I up at 2:30am last night. I will NOT be getting another replacement.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.  Since using for about 3 weeks now, my skin feels so soft and smooth. I make sure it is very dry before placing back in the recharger like other reviewers have suggested and found that this is not hard to do.  For the price this brush works great and just as well as the $200.00 version that I have used at the dermatologist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> Fantastic !!!  Love this facial brush - actually, this is the 2nd brush that I have bought.  Gave several brushes as a gift for Xmas gifts.  It stimulates my skin and cleanses it thoroughly.</li>
            <li> The only reason I did another order of the Pretika was because my previous one lasted for two and half &amp;#34;years&amp;#34;!!  This one does not hold the charge for more than three days!!  I tried to return it today (June 25, 2014), but was informed &amp;#34;no&amp;#34; return.  I purchased it on May 22, 2014.  Therefore, under these conditions, I would &amp;#34;not&amp;#34; recommend this item.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Love the way my skin feels after I use the facial brush. Also like that it automatically turns off at the recommended max time because I have a tendency to overdo things. Good price - high quality - quick delivery</li>
            <li> Its nice that it recharges.  I tried a few others and like this one the best.</li>
            <li> Bettery went out after a couple months, waste of money</li>
            <li> Purchased this 3 months ago at husband&#x27;s request.  We both use it.  It lives in the shower with no problem as long as you keep the cover over the battery outlet.  Love that it&#x27;s rechargeable and it&#x27;s only had to be charged twice in 3 months.  I previously purchased one that required disposable batteries and return it because no one could get the battery compartment cover off.</li>
            <li> Its good, but I really wanted something that made exfoliation easy and this does not do that.</li>
            <li> Like it better than the clarasonic! The whole brush spins so I can get beside my nose unlike the clarasonic that only spins in the middle.  Used on my shoulders for a week for those bumps and they stayed clear for a year. Really made a difference in how clean I can get my face. I ride horses and love DIYprojects so I get dirty compared to most girls. Because my skin is cleaner I feel like my moisturizer can work better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow the rules for the first charge. Just like we did on our cell phones back in the day and the battery last for about 6 months for me. The brush does vibrate and has the sonic benefit if it is not working like the other review said call customer service it is awesome. I am going to buy the microderm abrasion tool next I like this product so much.</li>
            <li> My face looks and feels better every time I use it.  It does not take any longer than normal to wash your face.  Great!</li>
            <li> I opted for this unit as opposed to the more expensive brands after reading some reviews and wanting to save some money. I liked the product for a couple of months, although my skin never felt as clean as other more expensive brands (which I now use). The unit gradually stopped vibrating effectively, and after a few months, it completely stopped rotating. The motor would come on, but it would not vibrate the head. I called customer service, but to no avail. I upgraded to the more expensive brand six months ago and wish I would have never wasted my time with this Pretika brand.</li>
            <li> the charging port isn&#x27;t well protected and after a few months, it stopped charging.  the brush, size and effect was great until then.</li>
            <li> It does work well when it works. It did fine for about two weeks until it needed to be charged and now it won&#x27;t stay on for the full one minute. When it worked, my skin was soft and clean and I saw a noticeable difference. I&#x27;m definitely going to buy something similar from a more trustworthy brand.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and just love the way it smooths and cleans my skin. I even use it on the.back of my hands.</li>
            <li> I am sorry to say, I had to return this. It did not exfoliate. That is why I ordered it. Other than that I guess it would clean your face good.</li>
            <li> Decent facial brush, but not worth the extra hassle or expense.&lt;br /&gt;Save your money, use a washcloth- or, spend more and get a better brush.</li>
            <li> This item tops the other brand I had tried that just didn&#x27;t hold its charge.I had Homedics that was replaces 3 times and it was a great idea but just never worked very long..</li>
            <li> I purchased one brush for myself as an alternative of the clarisonic and it worked great for the first few weeks.  I notice a difference in my skin so I order one for my sister and one for my mom.  About a month or two later my would not charge and kept beeping so I returned it and got a new one that lasted about the same time and my sisters and moms both did the same thing so I did not bother replacing them.  I would not recommend this product!</li>
            <li> The brush is too stiff, which is why I gave this product 4 stars as opposed to 5. But used with caution, I&#x27;d still recommend it to people whose skin isn&#x27;t overly sensitive.    Here&#x27;s what I love: The Pretika facial brush really scrubs away all makeup. I work around the stiff bristles by applying only the lightest pressure when using it, which I do about three or four times a week.    In between, I use the Skin Laboratory&#x27;s 35% hyrdolic acid gel peel once or twice a week, and the Petrika LightSonic skin therapy, which I use as often as I can -- about four times a week while reading, etc. I top it all off with skin cream with 30 SPF for day, and a wrinkle reducing moisturizer such as ROC at night.    When I lost my job, I was upset that I could no longer afford the facials and skin care I so enjoyed. As it turns out, my investments in the products I purchased from Amazon for my routine work even better. My skin looks amazing, the wrinkles are greatly reduced, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> I thought it would rotate as well as sonic. But it is Sonic only. I feel the unit is a bit large and should be a bit smaller for all the curves of the face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the clarisonic for about a month. I thought I would dislike it, but I don&#x27;t--love it. I&#x27;m still uncomfortable about the high price of this beauty item (the retailer I purchased it from will accept returns after 30 days)and have been looking for a cheaper alternative. I thought I found it in the Pretika.    Yesterday, I purchased the Pretika from TJMAXX (it was $29.99). I turned it on, right out of the box, and got excited because it seemed to have the same power as the clarisonic. I didn&#x27;t use it though. I placed it on the charger for 24 hours per the directions. It gets 2 stars for easy set-up, ease of use and having the vibrating power of the clarisonic.    Tonight, I used the Pretika for the first time about 10 min. ago and my face is still smarting from the experience. Like the clarisonic, the Pretika vibrates MINUS the rotation so it is very irritating to the skin. Your basically dragging a vibrating brush across your face for a minute. Ouch! I have oily acne prone skin and long-term use of the Pretika would just cause more inflammation. I will be returning this to TJMAXX tomorrow. I use the clarisonic once a day and it has never made my face feel like it was scrapped over with a vegetable peeler. I think I&#x27;m going to have to bite the bullet and just consider my expensive toy as an early Christmas gift to myself.</li>
            <li> Folks, do not buy this product.  I read the review and thought if I took care of the brush and dried it carefully after each use, it would work.  I did that, and it still stopped working within a month of purchase.    Rather than buy a Clarisonic, I&#x27;m just going to buy a simple face brush and use it instead.    Please save your money!!</li>
            <li> Great product, but I tend toward a simpler routine. Great for cleaning and exfoliation. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone concerned about clogged pores.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t not oscillate. .....not an effective exfoliatior or cleansing device. You want a device that oscillates.</li>
            <li> I bought it because the Clarisonic is too expensive and wanted to see if i even liked it, but the brush broke very shortly after my purchase. Not worth it, just splurge and buy the real thing.</li>
            <li> I loved this brush, but it died the second week I had it. Returning it, and going to order a Clarisonic, which I should have done in the first place.</li>
            <li> what and awesome thing at a good price. recharge it is easy and last along time  I do recommend you buy extra heads  cause I like to use this not only on facial but good on the feet also  it does come with two heads</li>
            <li> Love this face cleaner, works great.</li>
            <li> This Pretika facial brush is great when it works. I had it for 6 month then it stopped working. It is something with the on/off switch. I like the way it worked so much I brought a second one thinking that I must have received a defective model and the next one I received would be better. No such luck, after 6 months the second stopped working also. This product would be a great buy if it worked longer than 6 months. It is a lot cheaper that the Clarisonic model $225 but I guess you get what you pay for.  I would not buy this product if you want something that last longer that 6 months.</li>
            <li> I used this 2-3 times a week for 2+ years.  It does a great job and I a was very happy with it until it stopped working one day.  The batteries can&#x27;t be replaced so once it&#x27;s dead, that&#x27;s it.  If the battery could be replaced I&#x27;d give it 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I replaced it with a Clarisonic, which seems gentler on my skin.  The model I got was $200.  For the difference in price I think the Pretika is an excellent value.  I dinged them a star because I hate planned obsolescence.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister. She loves it. Her skin looks amazing. She is acne prone so good skin care is very important to keep her pimples from getting out of control. Great product.</li>
            <li> I bought this to cleanse my face.  Trying to get rid of whitehead/blackhead bumps under skin.  Tried everything else, but I have been using this for about 6+ months faithfully and the blemishes are going away, and my pores are smaller (non-acne blemishes).  Also, an added unexpected bonus, wrinkles I had are deminishing tremendously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After each treatment ( I used hot water to soften the facial brush before applying to my face with soap) your face and neck feels vibrant.  I use a.m. and sometimes p.m.  If skin feels irritated, hold off the p.m.  Usually I used the \\&quot;timed-routine auto shut off\\&quot; 3 times for my daily treatment (It automatically shuts off, and if you&#x27;re not done, then you turn it on again).  I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> keeps my face clean scrubbing the dead skins off</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this brush actually made my face dry out and become flaky instead of smooth. I think the brush heads are a little too hard.</li>
            <li> My wife was distraught when this device stopped working. I decided to tear it open to see what might be wrong before committing to buying a more expensive brand. Once I got it open it was pretty obvious what had happened. There was condensation inside the device. My wife used this for 10 months without a problem, then she said she had just used it in the shower for the first time. BINGO! I actually got it to work again once I let the insides dry out, much like drying a cellphone after dropping it in a pool. It&#x27;s a lot uglier now after I tore it open, but it works.    If you have symptoms like the thing beeping incessantly, the device not turning on or off properly, rust, etc. then you probably had some water get into the device.    Bottom line: DO NOT USE IN THE SHOWER regardless of what the manufacturer says. The seals are not adequate.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! This thing dramatically reduced my acne breakouts and broke down areas of hyperpigmentation.  I stopped wearing makeup which was very hard to do because of my self esteem, used it twice a day faithfully sometimes 3 times a day, used cheap astringent, and a good moisturizer! Two weeks later my skin was FLAWLESS!!!  I have dark skin like Nia Long&#x27;s color.  I think the stand for the machine is pretty but useless.  They should&#x27;ve made it into a charging station.</li>
            <li> It stopped working after a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful!! Really gets deep down and cleans my pores and leaves skin feeling clean and smooth.  Great price especially when compared to the Clairsonic.</li>
            <li> I got this brush thinking it would have a rotating head, but I guess I didn&#x27;t read the description correctly because it is simply the vibrating kind.  I gave it to my younger sister thinking she might like this type of brush.  She used it for only a couple of months before it completely stopped functioning.  Unfortunately it was too late to send it back.  Definitely not worth the money.  I&#x27;ve bought brushes for $15-20 at RiteAid that lasted me years longer than this expensive piece of junk lasted.</li>
            <li> Great facial brush!  Larger brush than most, bristles are soft, yet effective.  Love not having to change the batteries.</li>
            <li> Love this brush...had an expensive Clarisonic, but this brush works so much better and is much lighter.</li>
            <li> I would have given it zero stars if I could. This brush is NOT a sonic dermabrasion brush! It spins rather than vibrating, causing a horrible irritation on the skin.</li>
            <li> This is the second Pretika facial brush for me. I loved the first one but it quit working after 3 years of use. This one is crazy amazing, the brush head now spins!! It feels like a face massage!</li>
            <li> The Pretika worked very well in the beginning and I was quite satisfied with it.  But then after six months, it stopped holding the charge and then it died.  I decided to take it apart and discovered oxidation throughout.  Although the directions say it can be used in the shower, I would recommend not doing so and keeping it as dry as possible.  The plastic tab on the bottom does not offer protection from moisture.</li>
            <li> I like this product. The previous one I bought on HSN some 5 or so years ago only vibrated, but this one actually spins giving more deep cleansing power. Would like a third speed on it in the future. I would definately recommend this product.</li>
            <li> WRONG ITEM.. THE CHARGER FOR THIS ITEM CONNECTS DIRECTLY TO THE BRUSH WHERE AS IN TE PAST, I HAVE PURCHASED PRETIKA BRUSHES THANT SIT IN THE  CHARGER UNIT IT SELF.  THIS  ITEM  HAS TO BE LAID DOWN WHILE IT IS BEING CARGED...NOT GOOD</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t charge properly anymore.  Such a bummer, since it scrubbed my skin very smooth.  It was, however, kind of scratchy.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my wife, she had a very old one that just gave up, this one works great and she likes it a lot and uses it often.</li>
            <li> I have ordered two of these now, and both were operating normally for a few days but then they would turn on by themselves at random times and wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed my pretika for about 4 months and then one day it would go on and not turn off, a few days later it would not charge.  I&#x27;m so disappointed that it stopped working.  I wish i would have spent the extra money in the first place for the clarisonic, since i&#x27;m now in the market for one.</li>
            <li> my first facial Brush is Pretica.purchased about more then a year a go.brought this with me to Afghanistan where we got lots of dust.I been using this Pretica SonicDermabrasion, Brush almost everynight.it workes great.My face got alot cleaner then used to be.After,I wash my face with this Brush,any face cream I use it works.I needed a replacement heads for this Brush,I looked, in walmart and Target, could not find it there.hope to find one in Amazan.I don&#x27;t have anymore Acni,My skin is clear and shines.I have brown Skin color.if you the first time buyer,lets say you have found the right Facial Brush Pretica.go for it.&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li> This is a really, really good product. I purchased this item when recommended by a friend. I used it the first day that I received it. The brush is a little coarse but gives your skin a thorough cleaning and leaves your face feeling fresh. After I use the Pretika Facial Brush, I use a gentle toner and my face feels wonderful.</li>
            <li> I am 35 with a natural T-zone oil issue.  I&#x27;ve never had acne or major issue with zits, but do occasionally get smaller ones.  I use this product about 3 times a week (only for a minute on my entire face), and it has prevented the small zits from appearing.  I am allergic to almost all facial cleansers, so I just use anti-bacterial Dial hand soap on my face.  This combination has kept my face clear for over a month.  I highly recommend it!      I read some reviews on issues with the charger - I haven&#x27;t had to charge this yet, so the charger is still in the box.</li>
            <li> This is a great facial tool. I have had this for a couple of years, and really love it. I have used the clairsonic, and did not like it as much as the pretika. My only complaint at this point would be the battery life- after having this and using for sooo long, I have to leave it plugged in so it is always ready for use.</li>
            <li> This is my second Pretika Brush, I accidently left the first in a pool of water....not advised!  I LOVE it, I went for a few months without until I got around to reordering, and my skin looked flaky, dull and tired.  When first using the brush, I break out a lot, as the brush brings the pimples to the surface and uncovers them, a similar thing happens with acne medicne, it sluffs off the old skin and exposes the new acne underneath. But now that that phase is over, my skin looks pinker, healthier and less breakouts and blackheads.  It has smoothed out some older bumps, but doesn&#x27;t make them disappear.....yet....it has plenty of power for me, and I will never be without it again!  Update....this brush STILL works great....you have to dry it off after the shower, and I use it exclusively in the shower and never have any issues.  (My first brush was 2 years old when I broke it....and it was always used in the shower.)  I never have had a mold issue on the brush either.  I do think that the brush may be stiffer than some other brands, but it doesn&#x27;t bother my skin, I use it every other day.</li>
            <li> I have used regular manual face brushes for years and was skeptical that a mechanical one would be that much better. I started to see a few brands at TJMaxx and Marshalls, and gave in. I researched reviews and chose the Pretika because of the firm brush heads that some people can&#x27;t stand. I&#x27;ve felt the Clarisonic brush heads in stores and thought they were incredibly wimpy, even the normal and body brushes. Anyway, I had to charge the brush for a few hours before I could use it but it didn&#x27;t need the full 18 hours or whatever it says. The brush vibrates, with the bristles sort of shaking back and forth. The first time I used it I was disappointed - I was hoping that something that looks like it could be named Turbo Face Blaster 5000 would rough up my skin a little more. I don&#x27;t think this is too harsh at all, and I use it on full force about 2x/day. I can&#x27;t deny that it feels good. I went away for a weekend without it and couldn&#x27;t wait to get back home and wash my face with it. Pretika has good customer service. I emailed the company about different brush heads (I wanted to try something even firmer), and they sent me a stronger brush head at no charge. The extra firm brush head is still soft and doesn&#x27;t scratch, but it does a better job at scrubbing. I think the Pretika is here to stay because I love the firm brush heads. I&#x27;m afraid the Clarisonic will be too soft for me, and my skin has never appreciated the gentle treatment. They could make this face brush better by improving the charging system, so that it can be used and left in the shower. It would be even better if the brush spinned in addition to the vibrations - that would be divine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE - The vibrations were pissing me off. It is super loud. I don&#x27;t even think the loud vibrations add any cleaning effects. Any dermabrasian is probably caused by the firmness of the bristles. I&#x27;ve started using the detached brush heads by themselves and I love it. Pretika sells them for twenty bucks for a four pack which is a great value.is a great value.</li>
            <li> This exfoliating brush works great! MY skin feels so soft and smooth after using with a grainy scrub. I don&#x27;t use it the shower so it lasts longer. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> awesome brush for the price.  The heads can be a bit rough, but soaking them in hot water while pre-cleansing helps immensely</li>
            <li> This is an excellent dermabrasion brush. It makes my skin feels so smooth after use. After couple days of use along with my facial wash my face was clear of bumps. My skin has a more even skin tone since using Pretika dermabrasion brush. I like the fact is rechargeable, I don&#x27;t have to constantly replace batteries. Some other brushes on the market the head keeps falling off while using, this one is the opposite. Love love this brush, I even got my mom one! !!!!!!</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!! TOTALLY BOGUS! Its useless its only good in one use then next thing you know its broken. Its not water proof at all. Just used mine in 2 days and it was broken after that. The worst part was not only one but 2 because I bought one for my mom. I dont want any other people ending up just like me. DISAPPOINTED!!!!!! IF POSSIBLE I WILL NOT EVEN GIVE THIS A SINGLE STAR.</li>
            <li> This is the best addition to my morning and bedtime routine. The brushes are very soft and gentile on your skin. It is lightweight, easy to hold and has two speeds. It has a rechargeable battery and runs for a longtime between recharges. When you purchase the SomicDermabrasion  Brush, it comes with an extra brush. Because I use mine twice a day, I purchased a set of the replacement brushes right away. However, I haven&#x27;t had to use them. After each use, one for cleansing and one for lotion, I rinse the brushes under hot water, and they are still like new. For Diabetics, like myself, our skin is very dry. This works great, because when using it for lotion, it works the lotion into the skin. I ordered mine through Amazon, it arrived two days later. Such great service!</li>
            <li> I used the Pretika at my daughter&#x27;s this summer and loved it.  I bought one for myself when I got home and now find the battery does not hold a charge for more than two uses.  I spend most of my  time charging it . I did not have this problem with the one I used at my daughter&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this brush twice, after a few months-it failed to charge. The brush works great otherwise and you can&#x27;t beat the price. This is not a quality product and may stop working.</li>
            <li> I bought one - loved it - within a very few months I was unable to charge it.  I returned it and received another.  This one stopped charging with a month as well.  Do not buy.</li>
            <li> Very good cleaning and exfoliating</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I decided to try this for myself before giving one as a gift. Needless to say, I found an alternate gift. This works OK, but no better than any other brush that just spins. I have no intention to purchase another of this brand.</li>
            <li> I followed the very specific directions &amp; comments posted by other users and the brush still broke after just ONE WEEK!</li>
            <li> Purchased the pretika soni dermabrasion facial brush to use daily.  Skin feels great after using and I can use it with my own cleansers.  Very pleased with the product and it&#x27;s price.  I will continue to use and purchase brushes when needed.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a pretty good deal, being so much cheaper than the clarisonic. I ignored all previous reviews of this thing dying after 1 month, and of course, 45 days after I purchased this thing, it died. It has a pretty crappy rubber cover for the hole where you charge it, and even though i made a point to make sure it was closed before each use, i still had to drain out rusty water each night. Maybe water is getting in somewhere else. It also would spontaneously start in the middle of the night, and was loud enough to wake up the whole house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dont get me wrong, It WILL Clean you skin, I used this religiously every day. It was great while it lasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMO, Fork out the extra $$ for the good version. This thing is a piece of crap!!</li>
            <li> I love the product while it worked especially for the price. I have owned other more expensive sonic products in the past.  However, within 3 months it quit working.</li>
            <li> I have a multitude of skin of skin problems. Very sensitive, rosecea, milia and very dry. Couldn&#x27;t justify the cost of laser treatments that a skin care place suggested. I figured if I could just find a cleanser that didn&#x27;t fry my skin and get rid of the flakes it would be a major improvement. Found the right cleanser for me but still had some flakes. Started using this brush and it got rid of the flaky skin. Still have skin issues but I&#x27;m really happy with the small improvements I was able to get on my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had to change my rating. Item will not hold a charge longer than a day. When it works, it&#x27;s great. Just purchased a different brand to replace. This item did not last two months before the issues started.</li>
            <li> Was a Gift for my Doughter. She loves it.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Awesome brush. I don&#x27;t know what I did before I had it. Love that it holds a charge forever.</li>
            <li> Love it so much I bought another.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely helped my flaky skin. Pores haven&#x27;t minimized like described, though</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a week and I am NOT happy, it does not hold a full charge and has not helped a full charge since I got it even after following all the directions! I end up using the brush to wash my face without it even working, waste of money! I had to give it at least one star to post this but it doesn&#x27;t deserve any stars.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product on a recommendation from a friend. Hers was fantastic and her skin looked incredible after using it. I was worried about getting one, but wanted the same results! After less than a month, it broke. Wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge and actually just stayed running if it wasn&#x27;t plugged in which made using it at any point in time, impossible. I contacted the company directly and after much to do they sent me another one which lasted all of two weeks.</li>
            <li> I purchased the first one at Marshall&#x27;s for about the same money as Amazon, the item lasted 4 months. Then I purchased another one from Amazon because I though it just got banged around at Marshall&#x27;s... not so, the second one lasted less the six months. They just stop charging. Unfortunately a friend of mine purchased the same one and she had the same issues, 5 months and dead as a doornail. If you want a product that lasts you six months at the most?... buy this one!! For me? A little much money for a really lousy product.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush from Walmart.com for $29.97 (I don&#x27;t know how long they will keep it at this price). I wanted to buy it from Walmart because I know that if I am unsatisfied with the product, I could easily go to any Walmart store and return it with in 90 days of purchase. So anyways... on with the review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first received this brush I was instantly excited to use it right away. So I opened and tried it. What is this? Why does the brush spin? Why doesn&#x27;t it have a 20 second timer as advertised? So I quickly emailed Pretika&#x27;s customer service about this and asked them what happened to my brush. A few days went by and Pretika responded back and let me know that the newer model had a spinning brush and the timer was removed due to customer feedback. They had also offered to send me four sensitive brush heads because I had let them know that the brush head was a little rough for my skin for daily use. This was very much appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I have been using my Pretika for a good two weeks and I have to let you know that I love it. The \\&quot;new\\&quot; spinning brush head cleans my face so well and my skin is baby soft after I use it. My acne scars have significantly faded away faster than before. And washing my face is actually fun for me. After experiencing an electronic face brush, I don&#x27;t think I can ever go back to using a manual one or using my hands. I also hope to try the Clairsonic one day. But for now, Pretika is a staple in my skin care routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I guess if any of you do not want a vibrating brush but rather a spinning brush, try buying it from Walmart.com. It won&#x27;t disappoint! And plus if you don&#x27;t buy it you can always get your money back if you return it within 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*********EDIT 11/30/12*************&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;ve had this thing for almost 3 months and it is starting to go bad. The charge does not hold longer than 24 hours and when the head rotates, it makes a really loud grinding noise. Not good at all. This thing is going straight back to Walmart. Good thing this has happened within the 90 day return period for Walmart. I guess this company only makes this brush work just long enough for their warranty period to end as well. Pretika&#x27;s guarantee period is 90 days. Hrmmmm how fishy.</li>
            <li> They changed the design on this and it&#x27;s not good.  You used to be able to put the brush into the plastic stand and it would charge in the stand via metal prongs in the stand.  Now, you have to plug the cord into the bottom of the brush.  When it&#x27;s not being charged there is a rubber plug to keep water out.  The stand is now just a plastic stand.  Not an upgrade in my opionion.  Also, the brush used to beep when it was time to move to another part of your face.  Not anymore.  And the brush isn&#x27;t as powerful in my opinion.  I won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> Just got this one to, just by looking at it I think I will enjoy it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that I hadn&#x27;t reviewed this product yet. I have had this over a year, still on the original charge when I received it and charged it up. So, I&#x27;m not sure what the other reviewers were talking about when they said it didn&#x27;t hold a charge. Admittedly I don&#x27;t use it every single day, but when I do use it, I use it for a longer time than others probably.  With regard to those who said that the contacts rusted, the product does tell you not to use it in the shower. So, that would mean that you wouldn&#x27;t run it under the tap in the sink either. When I use mine, the contacts don&#x27;t really get wet, but just in case, I wipe it with a cloth to be sure. Also, another way to ensure the charging contacts don&#x27;t rust would be to keep it out of the bathroom, particularly if you use the base/holder because condensation would collect in the holder and the metal would rust. I keep mine elsewhere. Also, keep in mind that if you leave the brush portion on, leave it wet, and put the product upright in the charger or holder, then the water will drip down, again creating rust.  2015 Update: Still going strong. And no rust.</li>
            <li> This is my second Pretika facial brush , I had the first one for years! This one is new and improved. The method of charging is even better. The product does the job and is not harsh.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for over an year now. When I bought it, it was around 46$, different website. A lot of reviews were warning about it braking down easily, but I wasn&#x27;t gonna pay over 200$ for some fancy product that would basically do the same job.&lt;br /&gt;  Well, it&#x27;s still going! I use it about three times a week, on the lower setting out of the two it has. I don&#x27;t press harder then I have too, and I generally stick with the time it gives me for each face section. I&#x27;ve noticed that if I insist too much, I over exfoliate, and it leads to irritation.&lt;br /&gt;  I always charge it after it hasn&#x27;t been used for a day, to make sure it&#x27;s dry, and I also store it in a dry place, as per instructions.&lt;br /&gt;  It&#x27;s a wonderful product, and the price is more than right. Buy with confidence, but don&#x27;t have unrealistic expectations. It won&#x27;t perform miracles. But it&#x27;s a great sidekick to good hygiene.&lt;br /&gt;  Yes, use it under the shower! That&#x27;s what it&#x27;s for, and how you get best results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought this item.  does the job at half the cost of the brand items.  No problems with water damage etc if one is careful about placing it away from dripping water etc.</li>
            <li> This is a great item when it works. Love the brush side and the power. However after the 2nd one dying it was time to find an alternative. They need to clear up some quality control/manufacturing problems.</li>
            <li> Now 6 weeks after purchase and only using it a few times a week, it will only stay charged for about 10 seconds.  Followed all instructions and even made sure it was completely dry before charging as some reviews suggested.  What a waste!</li>
            <li> I read reviews about how this brush stops working, was rusting, etc., so I was waiting to leave my review. I have been using it daily for about a month, and have had NO problems.  I don&#x27;t keep it in the bathroom, I dry it after each use, I don&#x27;t leave it in the charger unless I am charging it, and I LOVE it!  I have breakouts on my 38 year old skin, as well as hyperpigmentation, and I am happy to say my breakouts, which seem to be bumps (build up of dead skin) under the skin are almost gone, and the hyperpigmentation is getting better with each daily use.  I don&#x27;t have wrinkles yet, but I am sure it would help bring out fresher new skin.  Highly recommend this as a much cheaper alternative to the clarisonic, which I wanted but couldn&#x27;t bring myself to spend the money on.</li>
            <li> I HAVE HAD THIS ITEM FOR A MONTH NOW, AND I AFTER RECEIVING IT I USE IT THE NEXT DAY, AND IT WORKED REALY WELL. I HAVE NOT HAD ANY PROBLEMS WITH THE PRETIKA SONICDERMABRASION I&#x27;M GLAD I PURCHASE THE ITEM.  THANK YOU,</li>
            <li> I have had mine for over 2 years and will never be without one.  This recent one was purchased for my daughter at her request as she dropped the first one I got her a few too many times.  Mine still works beautifully.  I&#x27;ve never used a Clairsonic but I don&#x27;t know what the difference would be.  I&#x27;ve felt both the brushes and they seem comparable - except the Pretika is active out to the edge whereas the Clairsonic seems to only moves in the middle - seems outer edge is does nothing.  The brush does not spin - it vibrates, so it&#x27;s very gentle but you can really feel the difference.  In the beginning, I was so anxious that I &#x27;overdid&#x27; it and my face peeled a little.  No real problem - just don&#x27;t get over enthused.  It&#x27;s easy to get carried away as it feels SO good and leaves your face wonderfully smooth.  The pore size on my nose definitely decreased.  BTW, I&#x27;m 70 and I wish they had something like this when I was much younger and I would probably have had a flawless complexion.  It would be wonderful for teens - anyone!  Just let it ride gently around your face - don&#x27;t pull at your skin.  Then I use an astringent followed by my moisturizer.  If you have beautiful skin you probably won&#x27;t even need make up.  I&#x27;ll bet anything you&#x27;ll love it and never be without one again.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed at first the brush just spins. Not sonic so I bought a Clairisonic for $125.00 I have been using both. The Clairisonic is more water proof if you are going to use it in the shower and it doesn&#x27;t spin it oscillates the middle bristles which makes washing the top and sides of your nose difficult. For the money I would say the Pretika wins.</li>
            <li> Awesome product..Well worth the money. I have tried numerous sponges,cloths etc. but nothing has gotten my face as clean as this brush. It holds a charge for days. I only place back on charger every few days. Well made and water resistant. Love the timer feature also. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product right before a vacation and charged it before I packed it; 10 days later it was still working without an additional charging. Now I know I can pack it for trips without worrying about the charger at all. The brush itself is really good, it has enough power to do a thorough cleaning but not so much that it hurts my skin which is a bit sensitive. I would highly recommend this product over others I have tried where the brushes are too soft to be effective or they run on batteries (too expensive) or they don&#x27;t stand up to the water which inevitably gets on the machine.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I bought one for myself to test it out and ended up buying one for my mom and sister.  A lot of people said their battery burned out quickly; my solution: don&#x27;t keep the brush on the charger!  I haven&#x27;t set it on the stand since I bought it in August, I use it almost every day and the charge just ran out this week (that&#x27;s over 4 months on 1 charge!).  Definately a good substitute for the expensive brands.</li>
            <li> I got this for my 14 year old stepdaughter after I got myself a Susan Lucci set.  Well, I wish I&#x27;d have gotten us BOTH this brush since it&#x27;s rechargeable, sturdy and the brush is way more thick and soft.</li>
            <li> I bought this just to see if I wanted a clarisonic, so I bought a cheaper version of it especially because a majority of the reviews said it just completely stops working after a month. However I really love this brush it hasn&#x27;t broken at all and I&#x27;ve dropped it in the shower really hard a good couple of times, only occasionally it will freeze or won&#x27;t shut off.  It is fully waterproof as well. I dont see any major improvements in my skin but thats my own fault due to stress and some bad skin care products I&#x27;ve been using, but I do feel a difference in my skin after I wash it. It feels &amp;#34;squeaky clean&amp;#34; but not in a drying way, it all really depends on your skin type. Overall for the price I can&#x27;t complain I don&#x27;t think I will be buying a clarisonic as long as this is around</li>
            <li> I cannot honestly tell you whether or not this product works because mine never worked.  So it was a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using this a few times a week for few weeks now. I love the slower speed as I have sensitive skin. I have not had any redness and my skin feels smoother and cleaner. It also seems to hold a long charge. Which is handy you can just pick it up and use it.</li>
            <li> Only used this item for about two weeks but so far I like it. It seems to hold a charge well and has made a major difference in the texture of my skin. If you are expecting this to be an exact dupe for the very expensive well known facial brush it is not but for the price it seems to be giving me results that I am very happy with.</li>
            <li> Nice product. It made my skin feel smooth.</li>
            <li> I purchased this in January of 2015.  It has quit working and won&#x27;t charge.  Not Amazon says I can&#x27;t return it or exchange it.  I rates this high at the beginning,  not I would not rate it at all.  NOT A GOOD PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> This is a great facial brush.  It has stood up over time and given me great service.  The price makes it an outstanding value.</li>
            <li> The item worked great, while it worked. After only a few weeks it wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge any more. Of course this was after the time period to return or replace the item had ended.</li>
            <li> I did not buy my brush from Amazon but from TJMaxx almost 2 yrs ago.  I gave this a 5-star rating because of the exemplary customer service shown by Sonic.  They&#x27;ve replaced my brush twice (I&#x27;m on my third brush) because eventually the charge began to not hold as long as it should before the warranty was up.  Also, the first brush would turn itself on in the middle of the night.  Today, I emailed Sonic asking where can I buy a new charger since I seemed to have misplaced it, they said they would send me a free charger.  So all of you who said that your brush gave up, you should&#x27;ve have emailed Sonic&#x27;s customer service before YOU gave up.  I&#x27;ve never experienced GREAT customer service like this before.</li>
            <li> This worked really great for a while, about 8 months or so. I LOVED the way my skin felt after using it. It was a little annoying that I had to constantly keep it charged, but that&#x27;s life. A few weeks ago, it just wouldn&#x27;t turn on anymore, and when I put it n the charger, I got no response. I&#x27;m giving it a good review because when it was working, it worked perfectly. Also, ladies, if you get those bumps on the backs of your arms, this is a jewel for getting rid of them-use every other day for about 3 weeks (about 2 minutes on each arm for each use), and bumps totally disappear.</li>
            <li> This really is the best facial brush out there if you aren&#x27;t looking to spend $100+. I have sensitive skin. It has helped brighten my skin, clear up blemishes and it leaves my faces feeling very clean and rejuvenated!</li>
            <li> The first one I purchasrd worked well 2 yrs ago, when it died not quite a yr later I replaced it with a 2nd it lasted 3 mos. I thought.. maybe there was a defect, so like a dummy, I ordered a 3rd one .. a month and a half later it died!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money! It&#x27;s cheap. The price is right, when it works it does a good job, but if you want a facebrush that&#x27;s disposable go to your local drugstore.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve replaced it with NutraSonic it does a great job, nice size for the shower, even feels like it has substance and comes in a travel bag. By the way if you&#x27;re wonding why I didn&#x27;t just buy the Clairsonic I have didn&#x27;t like it &amp; too expensive.</li>
            <li> This is amazing. I have really began to concentrate on skin care. I saw a lady in a restaurant and noticed how beautiful her skin was. I asked her what did she do to keep her skin looking so smooth and vibrant. She said she used an electric facial brush and recommended this. I wash my face in the morning and at night. I have been using this religiously for months and what a transformation. My skin is so smooth and glows.. especially when I use my Microdermabrasion.. I love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an older unit that stopped working. I like the Pretika because it vibrated like the more expensive models out there,but when I received the new one it now spins and vibrates.Its not as gentle as the older model and when I called the company they said the feed back from customers was the reason they changed it.I wish they would have stated that on the website because if they had I might not have bought it. I do like the fact that its not battery run.</li>
            <li> when i got the item i open it was so excited the adapter was not there and i had to wait for return authorization</li>
            <li> This was a good purchase. It works great for the price it was. I use it just about every day.</li>
            <li> I love this brush, it is sorta big brush but works well. The head spins and sometimes is a little rough but really cleans skin well. Rechargeable and waterproof.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 6/2013&lt;br /&gt;My brush started to loose the charge and then just died soon after. I liked it, it seemed to work well, but didn&#x27;t last long so I won&#x27;t buy again unless it was much cheaper, like $10 I would buy again but this just didn&#x27;t last long and that is sad.</li>
            <li> Sonic Brush....Makes one.s skin feel fresh and squeaky clean and refreshing. The brush cleans off in a jiffy to keep one&#x27;s skin gleaming.</li>
            <li> Reading the title &amp;#34;SonicDermabrasion&amp;#34; lead me to believe that this was a sonic action product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The prodct has a rotating head.  It just rotates.  I don&#x27;t want a friction brushing action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, a low cost item is low cost.  However, it can make the effort to better describe how it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sent it back.</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t what it said it was a spin brush not a sonic vibration one it isn&#x27;t like the mia</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 weeks now, and I can already feel and see a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Really efficient face brush cleaner. I was thinking I would have to spend a lot of money to have a good one but this one is great and the battery last forever!</li>
            <li> I was originally wanting to get the clarisonic, but it just seemed like a lot of money to spend. So I actually found this and thought I&#x27;d give it a shot. I think it does the job. I can&#x27;t say its AMAZING but it isn&#x27;t bad either. I wish there were more options on the actual brush heads the way clarisonic does. The one it comes with is eh, okay. At first it feels a little hard but after some usage it softens up a bit. Just don&#x27;t use it too roughly when the bristles are still stiff.&lt;br /&gt;The pretika device only runs one way- clock wise I believe ... Do I wish it was clarisonic and had the two parts going in opposite directions? Yeah sure, but like I said. It does its job.&lt;br /&gt;The device itself is east to hold and has little grips on the side. It comes with a little stand which is great but one thing I hate is that there&#x27;s a little hole at the bottom of the stand which I believe is so that u could charge it while its on there -- so u would think. But the little charger prong doesn&#x27;t even fit all the way through so its no use. Pretty annoying because now I just lay it there to charge. The face part doesn&#x27;t touch anything but still. Why would u make a stand and not make it accessible? The device has two speeds. One faster, one slower. Not rocket science.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, not an amazing product but I still use it.</li>
            <li> Works great for my teen.</li>
            <li> I have purchased 4 of these! One for myself, and one for each of my granddaughters. They work very well, and are very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I had one that I dropped and broke.  I got the new one and am so pleased.  It no longer has that loud beep every 30 seconds or so.  The brush also moves around now instead of remaining in one place and spinning.  It feels gentler to my skin and my face feels cleaner.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I used mine under 7 times --did a good job but I took it in the shower once and, sorry to say, it stopped working thereafter.  I charged it for 2 days (hoping) because the lights work but the brush does not start its \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; business. I&#x27;m currently looking for a a more reliable brush.  I can&#x27;t afford to shell out $30 after every 7 uses.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  My skin feels great after only a month of use.  The two speeds are a nice option.  It also holds a charge for quite some time, as I&#x27;ve been using it every day for a month and still haven&#x27;t had to recharge it.</li>
            <li> Not highly impressed but works ok.</li>
            <li> Bought this facial brush a couple years ago, it worked well for about 1 year then died. I bought a second one in March 2014, a couple parts were slightly different. The brush speed is not as smooth as the initial one I bought, and it died last month. Very disappointed, would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold charge, need to send back but my daughter loves hers.</li>
            <li> Shipped on time. Came with two brush heads, charger, and stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Need to charge every few days. However, the product has definitely helped my skin! I use it 1x a day at night before bed with whichever cleanser I&#x27;m using at the moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t compare to Clarisonic, because I&#x27;ve never used it, but this one was cheap and has been helping me so I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Amazing it has just enough pressure, feels like your getting a good scrub.  The oscillates and timer lets you know your done. One full charge last you 45 one minute washes. Great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely disappointed to say the least. The facial brush WAS working great for about 4 months. Now it doesn&#x27;t work, and when I tried to go through amazon to return, it was past the return time. Do not buy!!!</li>
            <li> This machine is malfunctioning! I charged it overnight and when I tried to use it the next night it starts off but fades off within minutes of using it as if there is a battery dying out!  I have only used it for two weeks and it has already been dying on me!!!&lt;br /&gt;:,(&lt;br /&gt;I would like to give it another chance being that I need to exfoliate. Who do I have to call or email to return this or to exchange for a new one?!</li>
            <li> I have had mine for about a year and a half. It&#x27;s still going strong. My hubby can tell by looking at my face when I use it everyday and when I don&#x27;t. So I have to say for the price it works really well.Tthe only down side (thats why i gave it 4 stars) is I can&#x27;t find replacement heads for it. So I just clean mine in the dishwasher. I know that&#x27;s a little odd, but it gets it clean.</li>
            <li> This is a very good item, my skin feels so clean and looks great while using this. The button can stick sometimes, but i can get it to work. Its well worth buying !</li>
            <li> I bought this one 16 months ago and was at first worried it would die right away like some other reviewers stated.  Fortunately, it&#x27;s still working very well after more than a year.  I use it daily for face.  I didn&#x27;t use it for the body though.  The battery holds for about a week for me.  The brush is soft and my face feels clean after using it. No complaint at all :-)</li>
            <li> I like it when it actually works. But sometimes it won&#x27;t even turn on. Even when fully charged. A little dissapointing</li>
            <li> Started off well and power charge lasted through. 2 weeks.  After using in the shower...would never accept a charge again.  Broken.  Will not buy this brand again</li>
            <li> This thing is not water proof- do not waste your money. It works for a month max</li>
            <li> This product stopped working within the first 30 days of use and I was able to return it and receive a credit.  However, I had a Pretika in the past that was wonderful and this facial brush did not resemble my previous one in any way.  The cleansing action was so slow it was like not using a machine at all.  It rotated in a circle - not a &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; motion like my previous one did.  I am wondering if it was a real Pretika at all and was a fake instead.</li>
            <li> This product worked great for about 7 months. Then, it just stopped working without reason.  Based on all of the other responses where people had this same issue, do not waste your money on such a poor product, don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
            <li> I have had 2 Pretika Sonic facial brushes before this one. They worked great! I couldn&#x27;t believe when I receive the first of 2 of these....I sent the first one back because I thought it was defective and was shocked when I received the replacement.  The  originals DID NOT spin like this one.  There is nothing &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; about this one! Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Love it, but after I ordered it I heard of one that is timed to each area on your face so you don&#x27;t over scrub.  But other than than I like it.  It does the job.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this facial brush.  It&#x27;s powerful and my skin feels extremely clean after use. This brush has stopped my break outs and is much less expensive than it&#x27;s competitors but a lot less expensive.  You really need to dry the bottom thoroughly after use, especially where the charger is inserted, to ensure a long lasting brush.  I&#x27;ve had this particular one for over a year now and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> Awesome, no problems and with the proper face wash will really clear up your face. Surprised how long battery lasts between charges.</li>
            <li> I bought two because it was such a bargain compared to clarasonic. However, they both stopped working after two months. Very, very disappointed. Would not recommend it at all.</li>
            <li> Worked better than expected. Leaves silly smooth skin at first try!</li>
            <li> The first one I purchased almost 4 years ago, was great. I purchased a second last Dec as a gift, but my niece had already purchased a similar product. I kept it &amp; opened it back in June, charge it &amp; it went haywire, wouldn&#x27;t shut off, then completely stopped. I had to contact Pretika because of time that had passed, they said normally they wouldn &#x27;t replace as it was beyond. 90 days , but were very nice, replaced it, but now, 100 days later, it stopped working, &amp; now is turning itself on in the middle of the night! They said they had changed design. Don &#x27;t buy it! I&#x27;m sending it back &amp; probably eating my $$. The new design is defective! I&#x27;ve contacted Amazon &amp; told them to discontine relationship with Pretika! Hope this saves someone else the headache!</li>
            <li> The brush was great while it worked. I used it about twice a week for 5 months and it stopped working--I charge it fully, hit the button and nothing happens, just a blinking red light. I can&#x27;t recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> This device is absolute crap. When I first got it, it worked really good. I could feel it deep cleaning my face and I thought this was worth the money.About a week into using it was when it started to malfunction.  Although the manual stated that the device could work in the shower I don&#x27;t believe this is the case. It would seem that water enters into it and probably shorts out the circuit.&lt;br /&gt;The dual power level would not work when you tried to turn on the unit and then from there it would not power off despite pressing the power button repeatedly, the entire one minute long cycle would have to end in order for the device to turn off.&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t stop there though, if I tried to turn on the unit again it wouldn&#x27;t start. The temporary solution after that was to recharge it fully but how long could I do that before I got fed up?&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I realised was that this was supposed to have a beeping timer during operation but mine didn&#x27;t, but I could live without it.&lt;br /&gt;All things considered this Pretika was a total waste of money. If you are considering it think again. The olay spin brush was more reliable than this rubbish.&lt;br /&gt;I should have listened to all the other reviewers who thought the same. I am however going to get a clarisonic, the reviews are so much better.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item a week ago today, as well as the Nutrasonic Companion.  I really, really wanted a rotating brush, but after using the Olay product, I was less than impressed.  Since I could not find another rotating brush (according to reviews), and since I wasn&#x27;t ready to spend the money for a Clarisonic, my intention was to purchase the Pretika and the Nutrasonic, keep the one I liked best, and return the other one.  To my surprise, the Pretika I bought rotates!  I love it so far, as the brush heads are a good texture (not like the super-soft brushes other products have included).  I&#x27;ve used it every day since I bought it, on the initial charge.  I like the fact that it is cordless, rechargeable, and waterproof.  I like the way it feels in my hand, and the way it scrubs my face.  After a week, I am happy.  I have read all of the reviews that state how the product dies after a short time, won&#x27;t take a second or subsequent charge, and how rust gets into some units.  I will definitely be looking out for that. I currently remove and  clean the brush head after use, then I dry the unit completely and put a little clipper oil on the part that rotates the brush head before I store it.  I also make sure the rubber plug that covers the charging connection is fully engaged.  So far, I have not used the unit in the shower, just at the sink on my face.  I will write an update in a few weeks, because I think it will help others.  I still have questions about why some of the Pretikas vibrate (according to other reviews, and even Pretika&#x27;s product descriptions), and why some of them rotate.  I would love to be able to buy this product again if I am happy with it, and know what I am getting.</li>
            <li> Im not big on reviews but I definitely recommend it. I do have oily, problematic skin but adding this to my facial cleansing routine has improved my skins condition.</li>
            <li> It works great and I was looking for this for a long time, and it&#x27;s easy to use and charges great</li>
            <li> Take two $20 bills out of your wallet and simply burn them.  This will prevent you from having to go through the hassle of ordering this piece of trash.  It lasted only two weeks.  It&#x27;s as water resistant as a dry sponge.  We used it in the shower, but took precautions never to submerse it or even saturate it.  We were careful to remove the brush to wet and rinse it.  Yet, it now sits on the counter deader than Ray Rice&#x27;s football career.  This thing seized up so tight it has less movement than my constipated grandpa.  THIS WAS A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY!</li>
            <li> I use this in the shower everday. Works great. Only a couple of small complaints. 1) The charger doesn&#x27;t fit the unit well while in the stand. 2) No notification when battery is low.</li>
            <li> So I got this as a replacement when my iSkin facial brush bit the dust. The product description said it was oscillating, and I had read reviews that said it vibrated, not spun.&lt;br /&gt;Now I don&#x27;t know if mine was defective, or if they changed how they made them but mine spun. It was like the Olay spin brush, which I can&#x27;t stand. They feel like they hack up my face. So in all honesty, I didn&#x27;t try it personally as I just wanted to return it. But the second I saw that spinning brush head.... back in the packaging it went and off to amazon I went to return it and order something else that would sustain me.</li>
            <li> Pretika SonicDermabrasion facial brush is a great product. Since it has improved my appearance still got alot more to go and im almost there. I thought the product wouldnt work for me after reading the reviews. i&#x27;m like what the heck i must try it. And i&#x27;m happy i did because i like it alot. and i would recommend this product to my family and friends. My product still works, i&#x27;m hoping it don&#x27;t stop working then i&#x27;ll have to reorder a replacement.</li>
            <li> Instead of paying for Clarisonic I got this item instead. I had this exacat one before and it was stolen. Does the job. Simple and effective.</li>
            <li> Everyone talks about the Clarisonic being the be all/end all of cleansing brushes.  I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re great, but I&#x27;m here to tell you the Pretika does an excellent job at a fraction of the cost.  I&#x27;ve been using it for over 3 weeks on the first charge, and it&#x27;s still going strong.  There are many features that I appreciate about this little machine.  The brush vibrates, it does not spin.  There are two cleansing levels, regular and deep.  There is a built-in timer that limits your cleansing so you don&#x27;t overdo it.  I almost gave 4 stars because I thought I read in the description that it was supposed to beep every so often to remind you to move to another section of your face.  I have never heard mine beep, but how big of a deal is that really? If someone gave me a Clarisonic, I&#x27;d be happy and delighted to use it, but I find that this machine does not lack in anything and is a much better expenditure of my money.  Replacement brushes can be found easily as well.  The combination of using this cleansing brush and my redesigned skincare routine is giving me the results I&#x27;ve always sought after but always fell short on.  Get the Pretika, it&#x27;s great!  Oh, BTW, shipping was very prompt, too.</li>
            <li> When I first bought the brush it was great for my skin then it stoped charging on the base.It started making all this beeping noise when charging then went belly up. I really want to give it no stars, if the product held up it would have been a great brush ,because I saw a difference in my skin, but like I said save your money because it looses it charge in about four months</li>
            <li> I was really excited about this product because it&#x27;s so cheap and I&#x27;ve read some great reviews. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, so I figured I don&#x27;t need to buy the more expensive Clarisonic with softer bristles.  The description says that the Pretika SonicDermabrasion \\&quot;pulsates\\&quot; or \\&quot;vibrates.\\&quot;  I got one that oscillates!!.... It feels abrasive on my face.  The bristles itself are quite dense and rough...but it doesn&#x27;t bother me.  However, when it rotates, it feels too much for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t get too much pimples, usually get one every week on my chin.  I mainly bought this to use as part of my night time regimen.  I use make-up during the day and feel that cleaning my face manually in not enough.  Also, I have big pores by and around my nose and was hoping that this product would reduce the size of my pores.  After using the Pretika every night, my face feels soooo much smoother and cleaner.  It feels even better after I apply a toner and my moisturizer.  I dont think it reduced the size of my pores, but seems to have decreased the amount of white heads I get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this product for people with sensitive skin or people who have acne filled with pus.  This product might cause more damage than good!  It would be better to invest in a Clarisonic since it has softer bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great product for its price if you dont have sensitive skin.  I think the vibrating one may work better than the one I have (the one that oscillates).  I will continue to use this until it no longer works.  Once this Pretika stops working, I will invest in a Clarisonic!</li>
            <li> Not even two months old and it stopped working.  I followed all the directions to the letter...don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s excellent. It is deep cleansing, exfoliating, and good for spore also. The battery lasts long about almost 2 weeks with one charge. It&#x27;s great with the timer, so it&#x27;s not too long or to short cleaning in order not to worry about the skin gets dry with overdo.</li>
            <li> Lasted me a little over a month! works well when it did. Comes with a dock holder which is neat but the plus gets in the way so you cant charge it while its on the dock.</li>
            <li> Love using this with my facial cleanser, it feels so good.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend use on a daily basis.  Just wish it had info on ordering extra brush heads</li>
            <li> This machine is not built like the same machine 5 years ago. It now swivels all over your face and pulls.</li>
            <li> This brush works great! It holds a charge for a very long time and it was a fraction of the price of the name brand ones. It has just the same bells and whistles as the $100-$200 ones and is just as good! Thanks again for a great product. It has helped my skin quite a bit. Not all the way but still better than it was and my genes just call for a dermatologist but it has helped the old acne heal up and go away faster none the less. I also like how refreshing it is, my skin looks younger as well.</li>
            <li> This priduct is a less ezpensive version of th sonic mia l❤️ This product and advise you to look into this great investment!!</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about purchasing this brush since Im use to another brand. But when I got this, I found it to be better then the first one I had. I like the fact that it comes with additional replacement heads. Also, you notice the difference in your skin right away. So worth the money...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still out or stock so I am still waiting and hoping I will get it soon so I can use it.</li>
            <li> product of excellent quality and arrived ahead of schedule in separate packages, very good, very good very good very good</li>
            <li> I took away two stars, stop working after 6 months.</li>
            <li> I bought this item off of Amazon because it was by far the cheapest place I found it for sale and I do my research because I hate wasting money. I really liked it,worked really well. I also liked the fact that it was rechargable. I hate having to buy batteries over and over. I used it for roughly two months w/no issues.It was used in the shower and inevitably I also dropped it in the shower because that&#x27;s what happens when your lathered up in water. Well after the third drop it pretty much stopped working. I was bummed and considered buying a new one however the more I thought about it I decided that if it&#x27;s water proof and I&#x27;m  suppose to be able to use it in the shower it should be somewhat more difficult to brake then it was. So now I use it just for the brush. It&#x27;s comfortable to use and even without the brush moving it does a better job washing my face then if I do it by hand. I liked the product alot it just needs a little improvment. Good luck with yours if you choose to buy one.</li>
            <li> The first 2 weeks I had it I used it both in the shower and at the sink, it worked great and i noticed my skin was really improving. Then after I charged it the first time, I noticed the charge only lasted a 2 days. One day we thought we were hearing dripping perhaps in the apartment below us, but later discovered this thing was randomly turning itself on and off, even waking us  up in the middle of the night. Then I tried using it one day and it did not turn off! Needless to say, no I cannot turn it on, it turns on when IT wants. I swear, this thing is either really crappy or possessed. I would not buy this again. I am going to spring for the more expensive clarsonic.</li>
            <li> These are NOT real Pretika Sonic Microdermabrasions brushes..these are the cheaper rotary head brushes..false advertising..box states it is a sonic microdermabrasion.brush but it is NOT..One customer had hers break after two trys.now i need to refund her money and buy her the real thing..very disappointed and mad to find what is in the box is NOT what is on the outside of the box...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this brush for about four years but during the first year the charging problem began.  I&#x27;ve cleaned the metal charging nodes on the base and unit with alcohol on a q-tip and it WILL charge after you \\&quot;play\\&quot; with it.  Sometimes it won&#x27;t immediately charge.  I&#x27;d sit it there and nothing sometimes even for days then I&#x27;d hear it beep and the light will turn on indicating it has decided to charge again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really liked this brush when I had nothing to compare it to.  Although I didn&#x27;t use it as often as I would have liked to because it was a hassle to recharge once I moved it and then I was a little afraid it would finally die on me.  After I realized I was only using it for \\&quot;special\\&quot; occasions and not enjoying it as often as I deserved I decided it was time to upgrade to a more dependable unit and bought a Clarisonic Plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles on this brush are much stiffer than the brushes on the Clarisonic Deep Pore and even Body brushes.  It moves in much the same way as the Clarisonic but its movement is more noticeable to the naked eye so I believe the Clarisonic moves faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all this product helped me decide that this kind of brush would be beneficial to my skin care routine and why I was willing to shell out more money for the Clarisonic.  If I didn&#x27;t have problems charging I probably would have been satisfied with just this brush, but now having felt the bristles on the Clarisonic I am @ awe as to how soft they are even without comparing them to this one.  It feels like a newborn&#x27;s hair brush bristles.  Clarisonic feels like pampering and this brush feels more like an exfoliation/scrub.  Both get the job done, but if you have more sensitive skin another brush may be better for you.  I hear the Olay brush is good and is similarly priced but rotates instead of pulses.</li>
            <li> they have changed something from my old pretika. this one doesn&#x27;t run as long and also not sure if it is the pads or the machine itself doesn&#x27;t do as good of a job of scrubbing. rats.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I can see and feel a difference in my skin. I will likely give this to the women in am ily as gifts. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful microdermabrasion brush.  I have a girlfiend in her late 30&#x27;s who suffered from red skin and terrible acne.  I hadn&#x27;t seen her in a few years and she came to visit.  Her face was smooth, clear, and glowing.  When I noticed i said, \\&quot;What did you do to your skin, it&#x27;s awesome?\\&quot;  She told me that she used regular face soap with a DIFFERENT spinng brush about twice the price.  I went for this one.  I LOVE IT!!  I use it everyday.  Sometimes I use it with a dry clean face.  You can use whatever products you like.  I think it works best with a microdermabrasion scrub, but I also use it with my favorite facial cleanser.  My skin is as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom and I&#x27;m 52.  Can&#x27;t help with my dark circles, but I&#x27;ve never found anything that REALLY takes care of that.</li>
            <li> I considered the popular &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; brand but decided to try this brand due to the rave reviews. I purchased this product on 9/14/14 and as of 1/28/15, I believe the unit is dead. It only spins for a few seconds then cuts off. When I plug the unit in to charge it, the light immediately glows green but the charge does not last. I&#x27;ve never used this unit in the shower and when not charging, it sits on the cradle away from water. I made a special effort to keep the charging port area extremely dry/not exposed to any elements but that did not help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it worked I did not have any problems out of it and my skin appeared fine. Time to invest in the official product and not a makeshift dupe.</li>
            <li> Bought mine November 2014, it is now July 2014, and won&#x27;t hold a charge. Love this thing, works great. Have followed manufacturers instructions on charging so I very disappointed that it only holds enough charge for one use each time, no longer blinks red while charging, just steady green. Never used in shower so it has only gotten slightly damp during use. Think they should replace within one year of usage, but they do not! Debating on another purchase of same item, wish I didn&#x27;t like it as we&#x27;ll as I do! Charging issue only reason for two stars, would give five stars otherwise!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this facial brush about 2 years ago and it&#x27;s still working great. It&#x27;s not as good as a Clarisonic, and doesn&#x27;t have brush head choices, but it still leaves your face extra clean, well-exfoliated and softer and it&#x27;s a fraction of the price. I am in my 20s with sensitive, acne prone skin and the brush head has worked well for me. Another good thing about this brush is that you can recharge it unlike some other clarisonic alternatives like Olay&#x27;s brush which requires batteries. Two very important things you need to know for your brush to last:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. When you first get it, you MUST allow the brush to charge fully for 24 hours or it may not hold a charge well later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. You cannot get the base wet. I accidentally did and it got rusty and stopped working. Luckily, I scraped off the rust and it came back to life.</li>
            <li> Love it! Get&#x27;s my skin super clean! Keeps me lookin fresh! I used to get little pimples but not anymore.</li>
            <li> The Pretika worked fine. However, the connectors became dirty and it stopped charging.  I tried to scrape the metal connectors, but it still did not make contact in order to recharge.</li>
            <li> I used it once and it stopped working I had a pretika for 5 years and it died the new one stopped working after one use and it doesn&#x27;t work the same as the older one I will b returning</li>
            <li> LOVE this brush! Bristles are super soft, exfoliates very well, holds facial cleanser well, not too strong or rough on skin while rotating.</li>
            <li> Really like it wish it has a pumice stone brush thing.</li>
            <li> The brush worked well when it was functional, but the reliability is horrible.  I&#x27;ve now had two of them fail on me only after a few short months.  Will not be purchasing a third one.</li>
            <li> Works really well and is a cost effective alternative to the Clairsonic.</li>
            <li> Great value, brush does rotate.  can not sit in stand while charging.</li>
            <li> I love this facial brush! It makes my face feel so refreshed, smooth, and clean. I have noticed my skin improving since I have been using this awesome addition to my beauty routine.</li>
            <li> I bought one from BB&amp;B a few weeks ago and was disappointed. It says it is sonic but I don&#x27;t believe that. It is more like a brush rotating at a very high speed. It actually caused a lot of irritation and I ended up returning it - unlike Amazon they have a great return policy. I decided to buy the clarisonic Mia for 99$ and wow it is in another class entirely. It doesn&#x27;t really rotate as such, rather it vibrates 300 times per second. I have no irritation and I&#x27;m so pleased with it. My advice is not to bother with the pretika, just wait and save a little more for the clarisonic. You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> I read a ton of reviews on these things..this one was the most consistant and very fair pricing. I love it. WOrks great!</li>
            <li> Bought for daughter who kept using mine.  She loves how her face feels now that she uses it regularly. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Pretika SonicDermabrasion Facial Brush for about a year now.  I keep it in the shower and use it to clean my face with body gel.  My skin is only mildly sensitive.  A full charge lasts several months and their is a little plug over the charging port that needs to be kept in place to keep water out.  I&#x27;m only now shopping for a new unit as the brush is starting to wear.  Not used the more expensive facial brushes but, after reading some of the reviews, need to include that this brush spins and has two speeds.  Overall, very happy with the way it cleans and gets all my makeup off.</li>
            <li> I bought this one for my teen grand daughter to keep her face beautiful.  I bought one for myself a&lt;br /&gt;couple years ago and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> This gadget works wonders on my face... Great exfoliation and really helps closing pores as it helps my products penetrate my skin. The brush is a bit hard for my taste but for this price I can live with that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is a bit hard to exfoliate so this brush really helps to get the smooth effect afterwards. I use it everyday on my face and neck.  I wet my face, apply the cleansing product on my face then let the brush do its magic.</li>
            <li> Sent back because it wasn&#x27;t what we were looking for.Why do I have to wrtie words for the heck of it when we sent it back. Telling you that should have been enough.</li>
            <li> Bought this April 4 died on the 18th. The first time I charged the brush the recommended time it worked great. The second time I needed to charge it no results. the brush is useless. I strongly recommend you do not buy this item!</li>
            <li> When I first tried the Pretika facial brush I loved it so much I bought 3 more for my family. Within the first 3 months three out of four units stopped working. They either stopped charging or the sonic head stopped moving.</li>
            <li> i bought this because the clarisonic mia was too expensive, i still dont own one of those but this was just ok, didnt make  much difference to my skin</li>
            <li> Totally NOT a sonic move, the motor sounds like almost broken.</li>
            <li> Clarisonic is much better...</li>
            <li> Awesome brush. Ergonomic and powerful. First one died after three weeks of use. Sent to manufacturer for replacement. Manufacturer provided outstanding customer service and follow up. Replaced unit at no cost.</li>
            <li> product stopped working after about a month.  Loved it until that time.  Maybe if replaced I can write a more long term review.</li>
            <li> I loved using this to wash my face. It feels great and my face feels really clean after using any facial cleanser with it.</li>
            <li> Like most of the others, I had a professional facial and she used a Clarasonic on me.  Of course, the salon sold them and she told me she had one which she personally use.  I purchased my Pretika at one of the discount stores...probably a Ross store.  Started out using it at night with my Cetaphil cleanser.  Unlike some of the others, I don&#x27;t have an oily T-zone or acne issues, but I am 61 years old and am still plagued with blackheads on my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d love to tell you that it made a difference, but it hasn&#x27;t - perhaps I need to try a different cleanser?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today I purchased one of the inexpensive Olay facial brushes (which spins), and I&#x27;m curious to see if it makes a difference.  I will report back in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thankful for the timer because before my dog chewed up my other brush I would scrub my face raw. Just remember to charge it once a week (on a dresser higher than your dog can reach)</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this brush, b/c there was so much hype over the Clarisonic.  I purchased this wanting an inexpensive alternative. Really glad I did, because it works so well!!! I got mine at walmart for $27. I have cystic acne and scaling on my chin.  It&#x27;s embarrassing to be an older adult with skin issues, but I&#x27;m in Perimenopause and I have hormonal acne. I tried everything and nothing worked very well or it had side effects I didn&#x27;t like. The Pretika works like a gem. From the first time I used it, my face responded to the deep cleaning. By the 2nd time, it had gotten rid of all the dead skin on my face. Within a week, my face cleared up immensely and I was able to wear makeup again. My foundation looks so good, b/c my face is smooth..no scaling and my acne is drying up and the swelling going down. This is the best purchase I&#x27;ve made in awhile.    I can&#x27;t vouch for the Clarisonic, since I&#x27;ve never owned one...but my friend says it&#x27;s comparable without the high price tag. It may not have as many bells and whistles, but it does the job and I think you&#x27;ll be pleased. Holds a charge for a very long time. I&#x27;ve had mine 3 weeks, use it every day and have yet to re-charge it. Easy to clean...just pop the brush head off, wash it with mild soap....let it completely dry and then pop it back on. Brush heads are also very inexpensive, compared to the Clarisonic.  One thing I was afraid of, is that the brush head would be too soft and not clean my face well.  Not the case. The brushes are soft, yet firm and you feel like your face is cleaned. It works well, with any cleanser. I use Clean and Clear Foaming Cleanser for sensitive skin.  There is a gentle mode for every day cleaning AND an exfoliating mode, which works excellent to remove dead skin and tough dirt.  It oscillates and it vibrates. Washes your face better than using a cloth or your hands. It cuts off after 60 seconds. If you need more cleaning, just turn it back on.  I can&#x27;t say this will work for everybody.....but it&#x27;s worth a try. A great gift for a teenager or anyone with skin problems. It doesn&#x27;t come with a body brush, but that wasn&#x27;t important to me. I love this product and will definitely buy another one, when this one needs replacing.</li>
            <li> Takes of all my heavy layers of make up in less than a minute. The battery last weeks. I love it</li>
            <li> This is a really nice product. I have priced several facial brushes and this one is made well and delivers. Best pricing of all that I compared.</li>
            <li> Used for about 3 months. Product arrived complete.  Rotating brush &amp;#34;wobbles&amp;#34; while cleaning, so it bounces on the skin&#x27;s surface (I tried reapplying the brush&#x27;s head and using less/more pressure with no differeance).  The bristles are clumped similar to the bristles of a hairbrush (not very dense), yet softer.  I used the rechargeable brush twice a day (morning and night), however the unit stopped working and would no longer hold a charge. I was careful to only charge the unit once it was dry (of course) and only when it began to slow down. It does a decent job of removing makeup/dead skin from the face,  but the quality of the product is low.  This would be an okay backup cleaner to keep under the sink for emergencies,  but please keep in mind... your face is worth stepping up the quality...and by investing in a better quality product your face will have greater noticeable improvements. Remember clean face with a  regular gentle facial cleaner before using the brush.  Then apply a gentle cleanser made for daily exfoliation all over face (avoiding eye area), wet brush (a good quality rechargeable brush) gently allow the brush to do it&#x27;s job. Only allow the brush to scrub the same area for a few seconds. Rinse, pat dry, use a simple toner (apply with a cotton ball/pad), allow to dry, moisturize (I use coconut oil, let it sink in then pat off excess with a hand towel). My makeup  has SPF so, I don&#x27;t have to use additional SPF.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product! I was so excited to use this product once I got this. It only worked for two second in my first time use. I didn&#x27;t have time to do the product review and can&#x27;t return or have it fixed any more.</li>
            <li> I just wish it was a little more powerful. High and low settings. I always use the high. Auto shut off and rechargeable. I use it at the sink to wash my face and then dry it off with a towel. I do not use it in the shower. Good product for the price point: $30</li>
            <li> works great!  Good value!</li>
            <li> Broke right away and the company wouldn&#x27;t replace it for me. Waste of money. :-(</li>
            <li> I love this. My face hasn&#x27;t felt like this in years. so smooth and clean. Totally recommend.</li>
            <li> I have Rosacea that shows most by causing pimples on and around my nose. (age: 60)  So there are fewer breakouts if that area is kept very clean and free from facial oils.  This unit has already shown some benefit and there are fewer pimples forming.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this PRETIKA for anyone wishing to obtain a deep clean of facial skin.</li>
            <li> I used this and it was great but then the battery went dead so I plugged it into charge and hasn&#x27;t worked since. I even tried a different charger to see if that was the problem and nope it was not. Very bummed out :(</li>
            <li> This is not a vibrating brush, this is a spinning brush.  A slowly spinning brush.  No \\&quot;micro pulsation\\&quot; to be found here.  Total garbage.</li>
            <li> I started getting serious break-outs about two months ago.  I&#x27;m 45 and haven&#x27;t had this problem since i was a teen.  I guess it&#x27;s hormones or something.  Anyway, I knew I already had a good skin regimen.  I&#x27;ve been using a regerating serum for ten tears.  It&#x27;s flattering that no one ever knows how old I really am. My kids have even lost track. So you can imagine how bad these break-outs traumatized me.  I started using extra make-up to cover the blemishes.  This just exacerbated the problem.  Then I started using my Pretika. Only one month in and I haven&#x27;t had a blemish since.  It comes with two brush heads so I decided to tell my teen daughter about this incredible magic brush. Guess what?? Her skin has never been clearer.  All I can say is try it!!</li>
            <li> i think this might be for me o_o its a tad on the harder side, the bristles.</li>
            <li> Works as expected, very reasonable price. Design of the holder is flawed. You can&#x27;t charge it on the stand. Happy with the purchase though, I just set it on it&#x27;s back and threw the holder away.</li>
            <li> I used this for a couple of weeks. It made no difference to my skin, and the bristles are not soft. Now I&#x27;m using the Olay spinning brush, and I like it better. I gave this to my daughter.</li>
            <li> I bought this to see if my skin would tolerate the friction of the brush. My skin is now smooth and much more clear. I use my own soap.</li>
            <li> This item is a waste of money.  it worked fine for 1 month then it just died.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product!!! Great price compared to whats out there!</li>
            <li> its ok it work great but when i got it after just a months it stop..</li>
            <li> So far my only issue is the stand. The hole it has at the bottom is not large enough for the charge cord to go through. A slot at the back of the stand will also be useful so the unit could sit in the stand level and charge.  I&#x27;m waiting for pore minimizing results. Only had it a week so far..</li>
            <li> unfortunately the machine vibrate; it does not spin therefore I think it sucks. I&#x27;m very concerned about my looks and I think it&#x27;s a waste of money does nothing</li>
            <li> Very cheap quality. After dropping it in the shower it will not work anymore. It was an accident but i guess that was enough to break it. So don&#x27;t drop it if you want to use it for long term. It cleaned ok but now the softest brush.</li>
            <li> I bought the Pretika spin brush for the good price and because as a black man, my facial skin can easily break out from ingrown hairs if I don&#x27;t clean thoroughly. I bought it from Bed Bath and Beyond. It worked great for a week. It just vibrated. it didnt spin. i didnt know at the time It was suppose to spin. But the vibration was doing a great job. My skin felt soft and clean and fresh. Then it just stopped working. No matter how long I charged it. So I returned it for another one. SAME STORY. Great for a week then stopped charging. RETURNED it again. THe third time, it stopped working after three days. But I found that it would charge again, but not stay charged consistently. I loved the results so much that I stupidly exchanged it again. This time, I got a brush that actually spinned. So that was exciting, but the charging issue was still there. I can&#x27;t believe that I have gotten 5 brushes and all of then have been CRAP. I&#x27;ve discovered that if you store it and use it upside down, for whatever reason it will hold a charge longer. But still no guarantee it&#x27;ll work consistently. It&#x27;s a poorly made product. I hope they fix their issues, cuz it&#x27;s great when it works. But I need some consistency in my beauty routine.</li>
            <li> I bought the Pretika about two years ago, and have used it only occasionally, but what a difference it makes when I do!  I have combination skin, so it&#x27;s great to have control of where and how intensely to apply pressure.  I never use the brush \\&quot;dry.\\&quot;  Instead, I make sure my skin is wet and soapy, then I use my Pretika like a super scrubby washcloth.  I rotate it in gentle circles, avoiding sensitive areas like just under my eyes.  The result is extremely clean skin, no irritation, and a much brighter facial tone.  Oh, by the way, I am 70 years old, and look at least 30 years younger, thanks to avoiding excessive sun exposure and the sort of cleaning and toning done by products like Pretika.  Soooo glad I found this great product.  One caution:  Avoid getting the electrical part of the unit wet; IMO, that is what causes most failures.  You can dampen the brush head, but make sure the rest stays dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Broke after a week, it wouldn&#x27;t start and then it would turn on its own.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item because it seemed to function much like the much higher priced Clairsonic (not sure of spelling).  It seemed to pulsate, not spin like the more expensive counterpart also.  I ordered the product, but when I received it, it does not have the &amp;#34;supersonic pulsing&amp;#34; as described but does, in fact, spin instead.  I would like it much more if it were to have the pulsing vibrations instead of the rotating head.  I also do not like that the power supply is not connected to the base at all.  You have to charge it elsewhere and the base is merely a stand for it to rest on.  I think a much better design could have been made.  Otherwise, I am happy with the product, but notably disappointed.  It does clean my face, and battery life is very long. The pad does not seem to abrasive and it is a sturdier brush than the Olay facial spinning brush, which I also own.  Not sure if the replacement pads are the same either.  Luckily it comes with 2.</li>
            <li> It really cleans my face. A little harsh so I don&#x27;t use it everyday and when I do I press it softly to the skin.</li>
            <li> The claim that this product uses \\&quot;Micro-Pulsating Vibration Cleansing Technology\\&quot; is completely false. It is a rotating brush with no vibration at all, let alone a sonic product. Total lie.</li>
            <li> I liked the brush in the beginning. It worked great as a facial scrub but within a month when I tried to recharge it, it wouldnt do anything. I tried everything and it wouldnt charge. I should have have returned it but I didnt want to deal with the hassle of it so I just threw away since I paid 25.</li>
            <li> I have a similar product that I like and thought I was buying another one just like it for a friend, however the main difference is in the charging. Important, this model (ST255) cannot charge while on the stand, the plug goes into the bottom of the unit and prevents it from being on the stand. This by far is the dumbest design I have ever seen with a rechargeable item. The model I own (unfortunately I do not have the model number) charges from the stand, which makes sense.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and keep charged.  Pleasantly surprised at how nice my face feels after.  Adds a boost to my exfolient.</li>
