            <li>Smells and feels very clean.</li>
            <li>Smells fabulous.</li>
            <li>I sprayed it in the air first as a test to make sure it wouldn&#x27;t be too strong, and then I sprayed the couch.</li>
            <li>Very fresh and airy and not perfumey.</li>
            <li>It has a clean, light fragrance.</li>
            <li>I love the scent and the peaceful feeling</li>
            <li>... clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to spray and the scent and peaceful feeling lasts for hours.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried another spray from this brand and it is my absolute favorite, so I was VERY interested in seeing how this one held up..</li>
            <li>It has a nice, light scent that actually smells a bit tropical.</li>

            <li>I am always happy to try new products that are made with pure and natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>When I read that this spray was intended to calm stress and tension, I knew I needed to have it.</li>

            <li>The name &amp;#34;peace&amp;#34; is very appropriate because the mix of essential oils is very relaxing.</li>
            <li>I love that it says be quiet, be aware, and be significant on the bottle.</li>
            <li>It says that the magic is in the molecules, when sprayed the tiny molecules are released in the air and earn held in absorbed by your skin</li>
            <li>and it makes me feel so relaxed and peaceful.</li>
            <li>fact that this spray reminded me of a place that I used to go to that brought a ridiculous amount of joy</li>
            <li>/&gt;The light, fresh and delicate scent is perfect for use prior to the gym or after the gym.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lavender, chamomile and tangerine won&#x27;t overrwhelm anyone who is sensative to most hard perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even more is the fact that the ingredients are safe enough to spray directly onto your body as a little quick fix aromatherapy session.</li>

            <li>make this my new favorites spray in the world!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>If you like the smell of old folks home mixed with vomit, you&#x27;re looking in the right place.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had something like this actually work, and I have tried so many different things, so I am so thankful that this actually worked.</li>
            <li>When sprayed on furniture, it actually doesn&#x27;t last for very long, which I really like.</li>
            <li>I will be checking out their catalog for other essential oil products which are all 100% pure.  </li>

            <li> blueriver bodycare very nice and clean smelling</li>
            <li> I like to spray this occasionally in my bathrooms! It really gives a calming feeling. Even my guests comment on how lovely it smells.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this spray!!!&lt;br /&gt;It smells so... clean. It&#x27;s the only way that I know how to describe it. It definitely reminds me of going to the spa and getting a massage, going into the steam room, or the sauna... It just smells amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that this spray reminded me of a place that I used to go to that brought a ridiculous amount of joy make this my new favorites spray in the world!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sprayed it before I read any of the stuff on it, I did not know that this was an aromatherapy mist, but I can definitely see how this would work as a tension reliever, especially with the lavender and the chamomile in it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And release angelo wills, so that makes this spray all the more beautiful and unique! It says that the magic is in the molecules, when sprayed the tiny molecules are released in the air and earn held in absorbed by your skin it&#x27;s these minute molecules that provide the therapeutic benefits for the body mind and spirit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which is probably why this reminds me of my happy place, the memories of the spa! I am going to sleep with this sprayed on my pillow, and hopefully I will have one night of peace. I love that it says be quiet, be aware, and be significant on the bottle. Is definitely something that everybody needs to strive for...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted rate for an honest review.</li>
            <li> I just received the Peace aromatherapy spray manufactured by blue river.  It smells so good.  The aroma is very concentrated and very little needs to be used so a bottle will last a long time. I love the scent and the peaceful feeling I get when I spritz it on. This spray will work for a room freshener as well.  I have always been very interested in using all types of essential oils for aromatherapy, body care and medicinal purposes. I will be checking out their catalog for other essential oil products which are all 100% pure.  Oils are hard to find that are made with 100% pure essential oils.  Many oils have added ingredients of alcohol or other filler oils.  I was very excited to receive this item in exchange for my honest review.  I am always happy to try new products that are made with pure and natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I am VERY happy with this purchase. If you love the way your skin smells after a long shower, you will love this body spray.&lt;br /&gt;The light, fresh and delicate scent is perfect for use prior to the gym or after the gym.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lavender, chamomile and tangerine won&#x27;t overrwhelm anyone who is sensative to most hard perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan on purchasing ALL the different body sprays from the Blue River aromatherapy line.</li>
            <li> I like the fact it has a really mild fragrance.  Great body spray, keeps you smelling fresh.</li>
