            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>I am more than satisfied about this purchase!</li>
            <li>but I just love using these on their own.</li>
            <li>They wash nicely and do control feminine odors much better than pads.</li>
            <li>From my wife, hearing good feedback - more comfortable.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean, good absorption and nice folding system...</li>

            <li>I never felt wetness like I do with most maxi pads.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more.</li>

            <li>Also better for the environment.</li>
            <li>I love these but for my size, they are really more of a period pad instead of a liner.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more soon.</li>
            <li>They are the perfect size and absorbency for use as a daily liner.  </li>
            <li>I was able to use them for days 3-5 of my cycle.</li>
            <li>glad I did.</li>
            <li>Anyways if I could give these more than 5 stars</li>
            <li>But overall they are awesome, and I will recommend them to my girlfriends!</li>
            <li>so the wearer can adjust the width would be more helpful.</li>

            <li>So far, so good!</li>
            <li>I think these are good for an intro into using cloth pads (they are the first that I have used).  </li>
            <li>They smell great and looked as new after washings.</li>
            <li>These were the most comfortable I have felt wearing a maxi pad ever.</li>
            <li>Its so comfortable and the temperature control is much better than any maxi pad/panty liner</li>
            <li>These were the first ones I tried and I love them!</li>
            <li>Other than that they are great!</li>
            <li>Love these for night ware and light flow days so comfortable.</li>
            <li>I thought why not they&#x27;re affordable and easy to take care of.</li>
            <li>The size is perfect and they move just a little.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve used these pads for about 3 or 4 cycles now, and I really do enjoy them.  </li>
            <li>comfortable for post menopausal bladder leakage.</li>
            <li>I use these at night.&lt;br /&gt;During the day I use chlorine free disposable pads.</li>
            <li>I was surprised how much more they hold compared to disposable types and, more importantly, how COMFORTABLE I was all day!</li>
            <li>I enjoy using this item.</li>
            <li>Picture doesn&#x27;t show how nice this product really is.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I am happy with my purchase and that I&#x27;ll be helping the planet and saving money as well. :)</li>
            <li>These were the first reusable sanitary pads I have tried and I love them.</li>
            <li>I was able to have wearing reusable maxi&#x27;s for the first time.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this to catch any oops with dutchess cups</li>
            <li>So everything is great, the materials, the little bird design (so cute), the absorbency of course.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Such a greener and more cost effective alternative to disposable pads.</li>

            <li>They don&#x27;t slide around and feel nice and soft.</li>
            <li>I am giving two stars because I was compensated in full by the company.</li>
            <li>Work well, easy to launder, very absorbent, comfortable to wear</li>
            <li>They fit just right.</li>
            <li>We love these with the dark color, very glad we tried this option.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never thought that these menstrual pads would be better than the traditional ones, but they surely are.</li>
            <li>Really absorbent and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Overall very satisfied with the quality and confidence</li>
            <li>They reek of chemicals - exactly what I am trying to avoid!</li>
            <li>they your period will be so much cheaper and comfortable.</li>
            <li>Soft, comfortable, cute, saves tons of money, much better for your health than regular pads.</li>
            <li>Love the idea of not having to throw anything away and the natural feel on my skin</li>
            <li>Other wise they would get 1.</li>
            <li>Plus, I contacted the seller and they answered my question right away.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product especially for beginners easy to take Cara very comfortable and a fordable</li>
            <li>Its funny</li>
            <li>Nobody can tell me exactly what they are made out of.</li>
            <li>Amazed at how easy they are to clean and even after heavy use they remain stain free.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how much they would hold if not used with the Diva Cup, but they are soft and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>I used just one per day and night, and I washed them daily, they are easy to wash with soap.</li>
            <li>After doing some research on reusable menstrual pads, I chose these particular pads for the cute pattern and grey liner.  </li>
            <li>and it held leakage more than expected.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t slide around so much</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m optimistic for my future cycles and feel better about being a tad more green.</li>
            <li>They also wash really well</li>
            <li>They are soft, comfortable and they don&#x27;t have any synthetic or sticky feel like my old disposables.</li>
            <li>WOW!!!</li>
            <li>Other than that, I love them.</li>
            <li>Much better than other reusable pds.</li>
            <li>let&#x27;s just say, these pads are extremely absorbent, no smell and soooo comfortable!</li>
            <li>so I could have 3 sets to last a full 2 week laundry rotation.</li>
            <li>After six washes in my washing machine -- on warm, cold, and hot, I cannot get the strong solvent smell out.</li>
            <li>I am new to the whole class had an idea.</li>
            <li>The material was soft and very absorbent.</li>
            <li>I love not having waste.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too loose, so if you do a fair amount of walking the pads tend to move and slide a little, and if you have nowhere to fix it..</li>
            <li>These are comfortable and extremely absorbent.</li>
            <li>I have a heavy cycle the first 2 days where I normally need to change a super plus tampon every 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Very soft inside.</li>
            <li>Even my underwear aren&#x27;t that soft!</li>
            <li>(I just use a little Charlie&#x27;s soap) and dry nice and soft.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t tell you if it will wash out completely in the wash.</li>
            <li>on - felt like i was 13 years old again and everyone could see my diaper (all in your head).</li>
            <li>So, thanks for the money back but BUYER BEWARE!</li>
            <li>No way I want to put that against sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I frequently checked to see if it needed changing</li>
            <li>However, they are soft and wash well.</li>
            <li>I think an even bigger pad with a wider back would be useful at night as I have to get up and change these once or twice.</li>
            <li>Although it can slip, for the most part it feels like I&#x27;m wearing thick underwear.</li>
            <li>They dry fast, too.</li>
            <li>Water coming from the pad while rinsing was red, red, red which means the waterproof feature really works!</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t perfect -- they do move around a little bit (but disposable pads can be equally difficult), and they also seem warmer!?</li>
            <li>Id say I have an average flow for a 30 something year old as they are much heavier now then when I was younger.</li>
            <li>I was a little unsure when purchasing because I didn&#x27;t know how well they would work and of course no one wants to have an accident!</li>
            <li>I love reusable sanitary products,  However, for a slim girl, these are a little long and wide; i find that the center part &#x27;bunches up&#x27; along the midline.  </li>

            <li> They dry fast, too.</li>
            <li> Water coming from the pad while rinsing was red, red, red which means the waterproof feature really works!</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t perfect -- they do move around a little bit (but disposable pads can be equally difficult), and they also seem warmer!?</li>
            <li> Id say I have an average flow for a 30 something year old as they are much heavier now then when I was younger.</li>
            <li> I was a little unsure when purchasing because I didn&#x27;t know how well they would work and of course no one wants to have an accident!</li>
            <li> I love reusable sanitary products,  However, for a slim girl, these are a little long and wide; i find that the center part &#x27;bunches up&#x27; along the midline.  </li>
            <li> I was able to rinse the pad in cold water to get rid of the contents of the maxi after use.</li>
            <li> I can tell that whatever it is, it is not natural AT ALL.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t recommend sleeping in them necessarily, but larger overnight pads may be on the way from the manufacturer to solve this little issue.  </li>
            <li> They wash well and dry overnight.  </li>
            <li> My heavy days generally require 2 disposable pads while I&#x27;m at work.</li>
            <li> These didn&#x27;t shift like regular maxis do if you sit or lay down.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel itchy or gross down there</li>
            <li> I have a very heavy period and these have held up so far, although I do use a microfiber cloth to boost them at night.</li>
            <li> I had some fluid spill over the black absorbent core.</li>
            <li> Wish they were a little smaller</li>
            <li> They work like expected.</li>
            <li> I wore only ONE of these all day on that heavy day.</li>
            <li> Its a little big for a panty liner so for me its not an everyday thing just for aunt flo times.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that the absorbent core is a dark color.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s my only complaint.</li>
            <li> Ordered them too late to use this month, but can&#x27;t wait to try them next month!</li>
            <li> Less irritating than &amp;#34;bleached&amp;#34; products, on sensitive tissues, and saves money.</li>
            <li> and I like that the lining is black, so</li>
            <li> Previously, I was using plastic liner plus cloth pads, and now I don&#x27;t have to even use the plastic.  </li>
            <li> do move a little bit</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t realize how much had leaked until rinsing the pad in cold water in the tub.</li>
            <li> Hand rinsed and then threw in the machine on gentle cycle on cold.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t seem so messy.  </li>
            <li> Air dried.</li>
            <li> And I have washed them a few times to no avail.</li>
            <li> That night, I even thought &#x27;maybe I&#x27;m not so heavy today?&#x27; and rinsed it out...</li>
            <li> I am a very active person and these pads stay in place all day!  </li>
            <li> Sorry for the short review, but all I have to say is: Why, why, why didn&#x27;t I try these sooner?</li>
            <li> I was afraid of leakage but got less with these than with traditional maxi pads.</li>
            <li> I mean i wanted the smallest thinnest discrete thing i looked at it and put it</li>
            <li> They are comfy and crazy absorbent, I have a heavy flow and did not have a leak didn&#x27;t even come close, with disposables</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry you bought them.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t wash out with cold water</li>
            <li> well things can get a bit awkward.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, as I had hoped to use these and they were a pricey &amp;#34;fail.&amp;#34;</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These pads are very comfortable and very good quality. They work like expected. These were the first ones I tried and I love them! They don&#x27;t slide around or leak.</li>
            <li> Today is my first day using the pads, which is the heaviest day, and I can&#x27;t say how impressed I am! My heavy days generally require 2 disposable pads while I&#x27;m at work. Today, I only needed one of these from the time I left until I got home. Such a great product. I ordered the medium absorbancy.</li>
            <li> Comfortable and easy to clean. Everything I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> Sorry for the short review, but all I have to say is: Why, why, why didn&#x27;t I try these sooner? Soft, comfortable, cute, saves tons of money, much better for your health than regular pads. Love them!</li>
            <li> LOVE these cloth pads with a cute cheerful pattern! Wore it for 8 hrs. with a Lunette cup and it held leakage more than expected. I hadn&#x27;t realize how much had leaked until rinsing the pad in cold water in the tub. WOW!!! This pad holds a LOT of liquid without staining undergarments! Water coming from the pad while rinsing was red, red, red which means the waterproof feature really works!</li>
            <li> These are a great fit. They don&#x27;t slide around and feel nice and soft. I&#x27;m going to get more for my stash.</li>
            <li> I bought these with the Diva Cup.  I love not having waste.  I don&#x27;t know how much they would hold if not used with the Diva Cup, but they are soft and comfortable.  They wash well and dry overnight.  I haven&#x27;t needed to use all 5 yet in one cycle.  Yes, I would buy them again and recommend them.</li>
            <li> Excellent!!! These were the first reusable sanitary pads I have tried and I love them. I was afraid of leakage but got less with these than with traditional maxi pads. These seemed waterproof. Nothing leaked through. These didn&#x27;t shift like regular maxis do if you sit or lay down. I never felt wetness like I do with most maxi pads. These were the most comfortable I have felt wearing a maxi pad ever. The material was soft and very absorbent. I was able to rinse the pad in cold water to get rid of the contents of the maxi after use. I will be purchasing more. I like the fact that the absorbent core is a dark color. I don&#x27;t like staining on underwear let alone maxis that I will have to reuse again and again. I had some fluid spill over the black absorbent core. It didn&#x27;t wash out with cold water so I can&#x27;t tell you if it will wash out completely in the wash. I will try a more through soaking and hand wash to hopefully get the stain out. Overall very satisfied with the quality and confidence I was able to have wearing reusable maxi&#x27;s for the first time.</li>
            <li> These are great but move around a lot. Wish they were a little smaller so they would stay in place better!</li>
            <li> Its funny I read the reviews on this item and some said its like a panty liner and some said its like a maxi pad. I can actually see how its fully both. I mean i wanted the smallest thinnest discrete thing i looked at it and put it on - felt like i was 13 years old again and everyone could see my diaper (all in your head). Its so comfortable and the temperature control is much better than any maxi pad/panty liner Ive ever had I just wouldnt go back. Its a little big for a panty liner so for me its not an everyday thing just for aunt flo times. I originally purchased this to catch any oops with dutchess cups but I just love using these on their own. I wish them by hand at night so I always have enough for the 7-9 days of aunt flo. Id say I have an average flow for a 30 something year old as they are much heavier now then when I was younger.</li>
            <li> We love these with the dark color, very glad we tried this option.</li>
            <li> Love the idea of not having to throw anything away and the natural feel on my skin but I am going to have to rig them so they stay in place. That&#x27;s my only complaint. Other than that, I love them.</li>
            <li> Wicks moisture away from the body; easy to clean. Much better than other reusable pds.</li>
            <li> I really liked them! I was a little unsure when purchasing because I didn&#x27;t know how well they would work and of course no one wants to have an accident! So everything is great, the materials, the little bird design (so cute), the absorbency of course.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that could be improved is the button. It&#x27;s too loose, so if you do a fair amount of walking the pads tend to move and slide a little, and if you have nowhere to fix it.. well things can get a bit awkward. Other than that, I am happy with my purchase and that I&#x27;ll be helping the planet and saving money as well. :)</li>
            <li> Ordered them too late to use this month, but can&#x27;t wait to try them next month! They&#x27;re beautiful, and so soft! Even my underwear aren&#x27;t that soft!</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, good absorption and nice folding system... I am more than satisfied about this purchase!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these pads for about 3 or 4 cycles now, and I really do enjoy them.  They don&#x27;t slide around so much and I like that the lining is black, so it doesn&#x27;t seem so messy.  Plus, I contacted the seller and they answered my question right away. I think these are good for an intro into using cloth pads (they are the first that I have used).  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend sleeping in them necessarily, but larger overnight pads may be on the way from the manufacturer to solve this little issue.  So, yay!</li>
            <li> comfortable for post menopausal bladder leakage. Less irritating than &amp;#34;bleached&amp;#34; products, on sensitive tissues, and saves money. Also better for the environment. I use these at night.&lt;br /&gt;During the day I use chlorine free disposable pads.</li>
            <li> These work wonderfully and are slim considering they are reusable! I rinse them off and then throw into a lingerie bag to wash.</li>
            <li> I love that these are eco-friendly and will save me money over time! They aren&#x27;t perfect -- they do move around a little bit (but disposable pads can be equally difficult), and they also seem warmer!? I guess I this will be nice in the winter! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend buying.</li>
            <li> These are an excellent product. None of the sweating because of plastic that I had with disposable. These are comfortable and extremely absorbent. Hand rinsed and then threw in the machine on gentle cycle on cold. Air dried. These kept their shape after washing.</li>
            <li> I love these but for my size, they are really more of a period pad instead of a liner. Other than that they are great!</li>
            <li> Love them!  Waterproof, and made with sustainable materials.  Who could beat that!  Previously, I was using plastic liner plus cloth pads, and now I don&#x27;t have to even use the plastic.  Re-purchased 2 times so I could have 3 sets to last a full 2 week laundry rotation.</li>
            <li> These are really great! Work well, easy to launder, very absorbent, comfortable to wear</li>
            <li> These are wonderful!!! They fit just right. I am a larger woman who uses them as a substitute for disposable bladder control pads. I am allergic to every brand on the market and am so happy I found these. You won&#x27;t be sorry you bought them. They wash nicely and do control feminine odors much better than pads.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never thought that these menstrual pads would be better than the traditional ones, but they surely are. They absorb a lot, and you won&#x27;t even notice that. I used just one per day and night, and I washed them daily, they are easy to wash with soap. They dry fast, too. The size is perfect and they move just a little. I&#x27;d never had a lick during day or night. They smell great and looked as new after washings. They are my best investment, I ultra recommend them.</li>
            <li> Love these for night ware and light flow days so comfortable. If paired with the divia cup they your period will be so much cheaper and comfortable.</li>
            <li> From my wife, hearing good feedback - more comfortable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with these pads. I will be buying more soon.</li>
            <li> I am giving two stars because I was compensated in full by the company. Other wise they would get 1. I cannot ignore not deny that these STINK! They reek of chemicals - exactly what I am trying to avoid! And I have washed them a few times to no avail. Nobody can tell me exactly what they are made out of. I can tell that whatever it is, it is not natural AT ALL. So, thanks for the money back but BUYER BEWARE!</li>
            <li> I was hoping the reports of chemical smell for some of these reusable pads would be a fluke. After six washes in my washing machine -- on warm, cold, and hot, I cannot get the strong solvent smell out. No way I want to put that against sensitive skin. Very disappointed, as I had hoped to use these and they were a pricey &amp;#34;fail.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> After doing some research on reusable menstrual pads, I chose these particular pads for the cute pattern and grey liner.  I am a very active person and these pads stay in place all day!  They are the perfect size and absorbency for use as a daily liner.  I use them in addition to my Diva cup.</li>
            <li> So far, so good! I was able to use them for days 3-5 of my cycle. I was surprised how much more they hold compared to disposable types and, more importantly, how COMFORTABLE I was all day! I&#x27;m optimistic for my future cycles and feel better about being a tad more green. Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Edited to add*&lt;br /&gt;I just finished my 2nd cycle with these and I am even more impressed! I have a heavy cycle the first 2 days where I normally need to change a super plus tampon every 2 hours. I wore only ONE of these all day on that heavy day. I frequently checked to see if it needed changing but I didn&#x27;t see anything that suggested I did. That night, I even thought &#x27;maybe I&#x27;m not so heavy today?&#x27; and rinsed it out...let&#x27;s just say, these pads are extremely absorbent, no smell and soooo comfortable! Although it can slip, for the most part it feels like I&#x27;m wearing thick underwear. I am such a convert, these rock!</li>
            <li> These pads are incredible. Amazed at how easy they are to clean and even after heavy use they remain stain free. However, I would use caution if you plan to wear these overnight as they do slide around a bit. Such a greener and more cost effective alternative to disposable pads.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this item. I am new to the whole class had an idea. So purchase these as a beginner status. I thought why not they&#x27;re affordable and easy to take care of. Read a lot of good reviews about them and thought I&#x27;d give them a shot glad I did. Highly recommend this product especially for beginners easy to take Cara very comfortable and a fordable</li>
            <li> Amazing. I am never going back to disposable. They are comfy and crazy absorbent, I have a heavy flow and did not have a leak didn&#x27;t even come close, with disposables I did all the time. Anyways if I could give these more than 5 stars I would</li>
            <li> I love the pads and will happy leave a great review! I was nervous about using reusables as I have never used them before but I love them! They are soft, comfortable and they don&#x27;t have any synthetic or sticky feel like my old disposables. I don&#x27;t feel itchy or gross down there like I used to. They also wash really well (I just use a little Charlie&#x27;s soap) and dry nice and soft. I don&#x27;t notice any smell at all on them, in fact they do just smell clean. I have a very heavy period and these have held up so far, although I do use a microfiber cloth to boost them at night. I think an even bigger pad with a wider back would be useful at night as I have to get up and change these once or twice. But overall they are awesome, and I will recommend them to my girlfriends!</li>
            <li> I love reusable sanitary products,  However, for a slim girl, these are a little long and wide; i find that the center part &#x27;bunches up&#x27; along the midline.  However, they are soft and wash well.</li>
            <li> Have never used these before.  Best. Things.  Ever!&lt;br /&gt;They do move a little bit but I&#x27;ll get the hang of it. They work great though,  I&#x27;ll never go back to disposable pads again.</li>
            <li> I was nervous about reusable pads, but these were a pleasant surprise. Really absorbent and easy to clean. The only downside is that having only one snap causes them to slide around, which can lead to accidents. Perhaps having two snaps or even velcro so the wearer can adjust the width would be more helpful.</li>
            <li> Picture doesn&#x27;t show how nice this product really is.Very soft inside. .good working snaps</li>
