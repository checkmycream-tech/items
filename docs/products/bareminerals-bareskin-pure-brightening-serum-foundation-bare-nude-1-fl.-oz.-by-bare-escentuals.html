            <li>I love it!!</li>
            <li>it kind of just sat on my skin, i would blend and blend, I bought the brush that goes with it</li>
            <li>Love Love Love this product!</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I now like using the brush more than using my fingers.  </li>
            <li>Love it , although you do need to buy the applicator brush specifically for this.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite makeup.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth with the special brush!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an &#x27;ok&#x27; foundation if you do not have blemished skin and are not looking for full coverage.</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of the mineral powder foundations.</li>
            <li>BUT OTHER THAN THAT, IT WORKS VERY GOOD.</li>
            <li>Super light coverage.</li>
            <li>Might be great for dry skin.</li>
            <li>Very lightweight with full coverage.</li>
            <li>It is very light (not heavy on the skin) but offers great coverage of blemishes in the skin, dark spots etc.</li>
            <li>recommend going to a store and trying the color first before purchase.</li>
            <li>I love the golden shade, it neutralizes red spots and looks very natural.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping too.</li>
            <li>Used it twice but appears very &amp;#34;yellow&amp;#34; on my complexion</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t last all night without a powder touch up, but it was a hot night</li>
            <li>natural looking.</li>
            <li>Goes on nice and thin.</li>
            <li>Good coverage without looking fake.</li>
            <li>The skin tone matching is good, but unfortunately it slides right off any oily areas, so not suitable for oily or combination skin.</li>

            <li> Im a bareMinerals fan, but I wasn&#x27;t crazy about this..it kind of just sat on my skin, i would blend and blend, I bought the brush that goes with it and it just moved around on my face.....I could see it streaking around on my face and just wouldn&#x27;t settle in, weird...</li>
            <li> I have used this product for quite awhile. it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Goes on nice and thin.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  You need a brush to apply but it goes on evenly.  I now like using the brush more than using my fingers.  Good coverage without looking fake.</li>
            <li> I love it!! Great on the skin!!! Goes on smooth with the special brush!!</li>
            <li> My blemish free secret. Very lightweight with full coverage. Love Love Love this product!</li>
            <li> Love it , although you do need to buy the applicator brush specifically for this.</li>
            <li> Very thin. Super light coverage. The color is too yellow for me and I am a med biege. I am a huge fan of the mineral powder foundations. I think I will be ordering Lorac as a base liquid foundation again.</li>
            <li> I like everithing about this Faundation.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Fast shipping too.</li>
            <li> Will buy again .....natural looking.</li>
            <li> Do not like color!!  Used it twice but appears very &amp;#34;yellow&amp;#34; on my complexion</li>
            <li> This is my favorite makeup. It is very light (not heavy on the skin) but offers great coverage of blemishes in the skin, dark spots etc.</li>
            <li> Too dark for me...recommend going to a store and trying the color first before purchase.</li>
            <li> THIS IS REALLY GREAT STUFF. I JUST ORDERED A COLOR THAT WAS TOO DARK WITH TOO MUCH YELLOW UNDERTONE.  BUT OTHER THAN THAT, IT WORKS VERY GOOD.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an &#x27;ok&#x27; foundation if you do not have blemished skin and are not looking for full coverage. The skin tone matching is good, but unfortunately it slides right off any oily areas, so not suitable for oily or combination skin. Might be great for dry skin.</li>
            <li> This is like a CC but it leaves my skin feeling softer and smoother. It didn&#x27;t last all night without a powder touch up, but it was a hot night and so I think any foundation would have needed some help.. I love the golden shade, it neutralizes red spots and looks very natural.</li>
