            <li>it works perfectly and heats up so quickly</li>
            <li>Great touch up curling iron between events or before your dinner date.  :-)</li>
            <li>I TOOK IT TO EUROPE AND WAS GREAT BECAUSE MOST APATERS DO NOT WORK FOR CURLING IRONS.  </li>

            <li>It is an awesome little iron- heats up well and curls great!</li>
            <li>It will be great not to have to worry if my plug will fit.</li>
            <li>It also did not come with a protective cover for the barrel which I would have liked.</li>
            <li>I was able to leave the house looking good.</li>
            <li>Nice and convenient.</li>
            <li>travel bag would have been nice, but it wasn&#x27;t advertised</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have when there is no electric.</li>
            <li>It is so handy to take on vacation or</li>
            <li>- I  loved my 1997 model better.  </li>
            <li>It says great size for travel, but isn&#x27;t the kind that comes apart to fit inside anything.</li>
            <li>It is nice not to have to deal with the cord.</li>
            <li>Amazon kindly offered me a refund which I&#x27;m grateful for</li>
            <li>Thank you so much - was thrilled to find here on Amazon!!</li>
            <li>I am very happy with my new purchase.</li>
            <li>Great for a quick fix -- at work, camping, traveling, and at home.  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to bump the on switch and lose all of your butane.</li>
            <li>very easy to store.</li>
            <li>Nice to have a quick curl when you don&#x27;t have power.. like camping!!</li>
            <li>Sure it takes longer and maybe isn&#x27;t as user friendly, but at the end of the day, my hair looked great at the music festivals and for the price its almost a no brainer.</li>
            <li>I bought this on the reviews that it works great on fine hair however it doesnt curl my fine hair at all.</li>
            <li>This curling iron gets hot quick and the no cord is awesome.</li>
            <li>Works pretty good - Still miss and liked my Braun better</li>
            <li>I would change it for a better one</li>
            <li>delivery time couldn&#x27;t have been better.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love not having to plug this iron into an outlet.  </li>
            <li>Love this cordless curling iron.....great for travel</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s better than having nothing.</li>
            <li>Perfect for international travel.  </li>
            <li>No problem taking it on flights to most countries, but the cartridge and curling iron must be separated.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>When they were sold in stores it came with a cover which made it more convenient for carrying in a purse.</li>
            <li>and/or making sure it stayed off,</li>
            <li>Love both products.</li>
            <li>I kept my hand a safe distance from the iron at all times, but perhaps this is a trick I have yet to find out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>having to replace them more often.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Works great and heats up fast.</li>
            <li>Heats up fast and curls great.</li>
            <li>Love my Conair curler.</li>
            <li>I brought this because I like to be able to pull it out and curl my hair on the go without needing to find an outlet.</li>
            <li>I love having this cordless curling iron incase of emergency power outages.</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>My first advice if purchasing this cordless curling iron is when turning the iron off, check and re-check to make sure you have successfully turned it off.</li>
            <li>I have had better Conair cordless curling irons, but this one does the job.</li>
            <li>I have owned many of these over the years.</li>
            <li>I love these things.</li>
            <li>Holds curls better - probably because heat is hotter.</li>
            <li>I am going to order more of them while I can still find them.  </li>
            <li>Glad I got a replacement - don&#x27;t want to deal with a cord.</li>
            <li>Would be even better with a cover.</li>
            <li>I love the flexibility it affords me.</li>
            <li>Heats up fast and curls great.  </li>
            <li>I love love love this thing,  No</li>
            <li>more cords.&lt;br /&gt;It is advertised as a traveling curling iron, but I love it for all the time.</li>
            <li>love the cordless factor for traveling and just convenience in the bathroom - not having to take up another plug and no hassle with the cord.  </li>
            <li>Was so glad to find it on line.  </li>
            <li>Love the convenience.  </li>
            <li>I just used the cover from my old one &amp; it fit perfectly.</li>
            <li>I love my Conair cordless curling iron.</li>
            <li>love  it,love it.  </li>
            <li>I love the size.  </li>
            <li>It is light weight and easy to pack, heats up quickly, and works just great.</li>
            <li>It was actually my first time using a curling iron since I am a straight iron curling connoisseur, but it turned out great!</li>
            <li>I LOVED IT VERY MUCH.  </li>
            <li>All of this makes it a pretty good buy in my opinion.</li>
            <li>The first one I had for about 30 years and loved it.</li>
            <li>nice product and heat up quick....</li>
            <li>up quickly, and not having a cord is amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always liked this type of butane curling iron for the quick heat and ease of not having a cord.</li>
            <li>Works great but it would be nice if it came with a barrel cover like the flat iron.</li>
            <li>It works great, no continuously clicking to get a spark like I had to do with my old Braun either.  </li>
            <li>Good unit and fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for something easy to take along - camping, on trips, etc.  </li>
            <li>Lightweight &amp; easy to use.</li>
            <li>but it is not as easy to hold as</li>
            <li>Heats up very quickly.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-butane cartridges, but it&#x27;s SO EASY to use</li>
            <li>Curls my hair very quickly.</li>
            <li>but you can easily forget to disengage it and lose your cartridge as I did.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>This replaces my beloved Braun cordless curling iron, because the replacement cartridges are no longer available for a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So easy to use</li>
            <li>and it heated up easily.</li>
            <li>so it is not as easy to use as I hoped.  </li>
            <li>Easy to store in drawer, too.  </li>
            <li>And it is easily stored when finished.</li>
            <li>The Braun had a much better grip and wish they were still making it because it was far superior to the Conair.</li>
            <li>It works very good, gets plenty hot,and the butane lasts a long time</li>
            <li>However, I do miss the wonderful cover that slipped right over the controls of the Braun in such a way</li>
            <li>I have had one of these before and liked it pretty well.</li>
            <li>It packs nicely and the butane cartridges are pretty convenient.</li>
            <li>Just beautiful curls that last.</li>
            <li>This iron is super for what it is just don&#x27;t expect a complete replacement for your plug in iron but a pretty great alternative that fits in your purse!</li>
            <li>A sock works just fine.</li>
            <li>My fine hair slides out.</li>
            <li>It is light weight and easy to pack.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and it won&#x27;t hold the lightest amount of hair.  </li>
            <li>It came when the company said it would and it does a fine job curling my hair.  </li>
            <li>Works ok for a quick fix, but will need to look for something else for work.  </li>
            <li>This one gets VERY hot, so watch out!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re expecting to get fabulous curls or any curl for that matter, think again.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think it is available</li>
            <li>I got it to light once</li>
            <li>I had one of these years ago while my hair was cut short and in layers, it worked great for me then.  </li>
            <li>And it will sound like there is a fire burning inside the iron...</li>
            <li>It worked great, gave me enough curly/body that I needed.  </li>
            <li>A fantastic curling iron for traveling.  </li>
            <li>Once I figured that out, it was smooth sailing.  </li>
            <li>and it is hassle free.</li>
            <li>I bought this primarily for travel but like it</li>
            <li>Worked great on my last trip</li>
            <li>You can get the ThermaCell refills here on Amazon as cheap as I have ever seen.  </li>
            <li>(butane cartridges no longer available).  </li>
            <li>It is light and compact.  </li>
            <li>and I wanted to pack light and not have to worry about plug adapters.</li>
            <li>I was able to find the butane refills at Walmart in the camping section at a more than reasonable price ($5.00).</li>
            <li>I liked my old Braun better, but can&#x27;t find them anymore.  </li>
            <li>she loves the small size, easy use, light weight, and great results!</li>
            <li>I love it and it gets really hot, However it uses up the thermal cell batteries very quickly.</li>
            <li>It is a very useful part of the curling iron.  </li>
            <li>It heats quickly and curls easily and effortlessly.  </li>
            <li>The clamp isn&#x27;t super strong</li>
            <li>Bought this to take to music festivals to keep my hair looking fresh while camping!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Super excited to use this thing</li>
            <li>Now I would give you a five star, but I don&#x27;t know why this was not included in the original package.</li>
            <li>I originally bought for travel use, but all I use now.</li>
            <li>and I love it so much!</li>
            <li>I use it for touch up spots, not for curling all my hair (which is fine and curly), so I haven&#x27;t found that it uses up cartridges too quickly.</li>
            <li>Also should be great for dry camping.</li>
            <li>I really liked this curler for traveling and did get a few good uses out of it</li>
            <li>I live in the wilderness and have limited solar-powered electricity so my need for this kind of curliing iron is great.  </li>
            <li>It heats right up!</li>
            <li>I use this daily, It is not too hot and does a great job.</li>
            <li>Very well satisfied.</li>
            <li>Flash forward to glamping, when I need to do a shoot while camping and I can&#x27;t be looking &amp;#34;beat&amp;#34; as my boyfriend calls it (jokingly but it&#x27;s true).</li>
            <li>Ideal for everyday on the go and traveling.</li>
            <li>I wish it were in a case so that I did not have to leave it on a table to cool off.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s even better, heats up fast.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not bad.....</li>
            <li>This curling iron works real well and gets very hot, very fast !!!  </li>
            <li>It is great when I travel to foreign countries because I never have to worry about the voltage of the power</li>
            <li>the unit did not heat adequately at all to curl my hair.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for short hair and travel abroad when power outlets will burn up your regular curling iron</li>
            <li>It heats up really quickly.</li>
            <li>It heated up quickly and worked as described.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and does curl.</li>
            <li>Heats quickly.  </li>
            <li>This product is super convenient.  </li>
            <li>I figured out quickly how to use the product.  </li>
            <li>Luckily I&#x27;d ordered the four pack refills.  </li>
            <li>Cost more and no carrying case that comes with it as the older model has.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly too.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and is hotter than my electric curling iron.  </li>
            <li>I have such straight hair, and it does a great job.</li>
            <li>Came in handy due to a power outage that lasted more than twenty hours.</li>
            <li>Item is great you are not tied down in front of mirror curling yout hair.</li>
            <li>At first I liked this thing because it heated up very quickly and made lasting curls.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to anyone who travels, no adapter necessary, it is just great.</li>
            <li>Works very well, glad I bought it even though I haven&#x27;t used it very much‚Ä¶ But it is always there for emergencies while traveling!</li>
            <li>It heats up fast and easy.</li>
            <li>It heats up fast and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyways you can see in my customer photo that this curling iron really delivers!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small and I love love love not fighting with a cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great little curler.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I would still recommend this for anyone who wants to be free of a cord, as well as for traveling by car, bus, or train.</li>
            <li>The iron is to smooth to really grab your locks.  </li>
            <li>I was impressed that we were notified that the Pro Cordless was going to be a day or two behind the ThermaCells.  </li>
            <li>I could not get a clear answer and thought better of taking it.  </li>
            <li>After not being able to find cartridges for my old Braun</li>
            <li>kind of like how you forget to unplug your regular curling iron</li>
            <li>but I also bought a 4-pack - stick the Thermacell inside the curling iron, kind of like a battery, and snap the bottom back on.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-great price and worth it&lt;</li>
            <li>I am at a loss without a hair curler, and a portable one that doesn&#x27;t have a cord to get tangled up when I am trying to reach the back of my own head.  </li>
            <li>I got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>It will be well worth the time saved to purchase refills as needed.</li>
            <li>and if I may be able to get it replaced or fixed.</li>
            <li>Easy to operate, heats quickly, curls nicely, fits in my little cosmetic bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gets super hot.</li>
            <li>It heats of hot and quickly.  </li>
            <li>The heat seems about right.</li>
            <li>This particular model does not come with the cover which is important to me.</li>
            <li>It came packaged well and looks very easy to use, once I actually start using it</li>
            <li>For my nearly shoulder length hair, it would be ideal if it were another half inch in diameter and had the detachable brush attachment.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and gets pretty hot.</li>
            <li>In fact, when I asked in certain stores if they had these for sale...they never heard of them!</li>
            <li>The curling iron heats up quickly and curls very well.</li>
            <li>Very hot and heats up fast.</li>
            <li>It heats fast and very hot.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-heats up fast and super hot</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>Great for on the go and hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li>My hair is hard to curl, but it works great.  </li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t get as hot as the one I had before</li>
            <li>The package arrived and was exactly as described and just what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Small enough for a suit case which is perfect when I go on vacation.</li>
            <li>Luckily my husband is clever.</li>
            <li>The cordeless curling iron is exactly what I need</li>
            <li>So glad, I found this alternative to a regular curling for my travels abroad.  </li>
            <li>However, I find that the slightly smaller one with the case where I unscrew the cartridge before storing everything away is the one I go to most now so that never happens.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still on my first cartridge</li>
            <li>At first I had some issues when placing the fuel container into the curling iron.</li>
            <li>So you can see how hot it will heat up.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the first one I have found that gets as hot as the ones from years ago.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I had hoped it would be.</li>
            <li>The iron gets hot and creates medium size curls.</li>
            <li>Using it for the first time made me feel I&#x27;d been living under a rock.</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Almost instantly hot.  </li>
            <li>2 years the thing would not get hot (had full new cartridge).</li>
            <li>It very quickly gets hot when you turn it on and works as well as a regular corded curling iron.  </li>
            <li>I really wish they made one that is 1inch or 1.5 inch because it really take a while to get curls all over with this size barrel if you have a lot of hair!</li>
            <li>It heats up very quickly and for me, the curls last all day.</li>
            <li>I thought removing the cartridge would be bothersome, but it only takes about 10 or 15  seconds and is so easy.</li>
            <li>(no cover) VERSUS &amp;#34;Conair Travel Smart cordless (with cover)&amp;#34;.   </li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s too large for bangs.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and quickly cools down for quick storage.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and safely and makes short work of a simple curling job.</li>
            <li>I bought this to take on vacation, what a nice little curling iron it is.</li>
            <li>It does not heat up enough to curl my fine, straight hair.</li>
            <li>I wanted so much for this to work, but it just didn&#x27;t happen.  </li>
            <li>The unit works very well.</li>
            <li>and she seems to really like them.</li>
            <li>but this is what she wants.</li>
            <li>It worked just fine: heated quickly and hot enough to straighten my short wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t look like it comes off at all, but that&#x27;s the only way you&#x27;re going to fit the cartridge in there.  </li>
            <li>it runs out of fuel or what ever u call it fast  </li>
            <li>This curling iron heats quickly, is ready within a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li>And refills are available in several package sizes from Amazon.</li>
            <li>and it is ready to go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I even use it at home to put a couple kinks into my stick straight hair.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t complain.  </li>
            <li>It heats up fast.</li>
            <li>This really did not work well on my hair type.</li>
            <li>Worked really well.  </li>
            <li>Very impressed, because I have super thick long Asian hair.</li>
            <li>This has no case although I just slip the hot rod into an old eyeglass case and that keeps it out of harms way.  </li>
            <li>The price is right and it gets HOT quick watch your fingers or little ones too...</li>
            <li>It heated up very fast and was definitely hot enough to curl my hair.</li>
            <li>Love this curler but because it&#x27;s black</li>
            <li>iron is sturdy enough and heats up fairly quickly and holds the heat well.</li>
            <li>Mainly for my daughter for her pageants.</li>
            <li>That was the main selling point, that it came with a carrying case.  </li>
            <li>Wished I had bought the older model.</li>
            <li>I initially bought this for travel but find that I&#x27;m using it for quick touch ups when you&#x27;re in a hurry.  </li>
            <li>I moved away and now have access to electricity, so it is not as high of a priority in my life.</li>
            <li>I love this cordless curling iron and it&#x27;s little sister.  </li>
            <li>I bought this little cute curling iron for my forays into the world of car camping.</li>
            <li>This little thing is magical.</li>
            <li>Works great, the same as the one I bought years ago, the only thing missing was a cover.</li>
            <li>Wish the barrel was a lil bigger still  worth the price.</li>
            <li>A few words of warning though, be sure to remove the butane if you will be carrying it around in a bag or purse.</li>
            <li>I guess it would be useful while traveling if you don&#x27;t want to worry about international plugs or even touch ups on the plane.</li>
            <li>Normally my curls fall out within a couple of hours</li>
            <li>I love it and use it often - especially when dry camping.</li>
            <li>Iron works well, heats up quickly and a canister of gas lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>I did loose an entire cartridge by not making sure I&#x27;d pressed the off button</li>
            <li>Heats fast, tight grip, light weight.  </li>
            <li>It works well and makes nice little curls that last for me.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live with out a cordless curling iron - never without it when traveling.  </li>
            <li>I like the new one</li>
            <li>, so I lost an almost brand new cartridge.  </li>
            <li>So you are basically buying a new curling iron every 6 weeks as the refill cartridges are 4 for $13.</li>
            <li>Since this iron doesn&#x27;t get as hot as a traditional plug in version the curls tend to fall looser than normal.  </li>
            <li>I have a very busy schedule</li>
            <li>It heats up and cools down really fast, and doesn&#x27;t go thru the ThermaCELL too quickly.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s hot enough to use as a hair straightener.</li>
            <li>I would love to pack this in my carry-on, but not sure if the ThermaCell cartridge would make it through security.  </li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>It lights instantly and is hot immediately.</li>
            <li>This seems to get plenty hot enough.  </li>
            <li>like the way it heats up quickly, and it otherwise performs exactly as expected.</li>
            <li>Gets very hot, so be careful.  </li>
            <li>Looked at stores over a period of time for another one when my old one gave out.</li>
            <li>No longer here near San Francisco.  </li>
            <li>I had one of these in the early 90s and it was worn out.</li>
            <li>I think this and the smaller pink model with the smaller barrel are indispensible and probably my favorite beauty tool.</li>
            <li>- I measure it at 1/2 inch - which is completely unusable for me (I already have a 1/2 inch one</li>
            <li>I must not have turned it off completely because all the butane was gone.</li>
            <li>I have to do my hair and make-up in the car frequently.  </li>
            <li>Was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I like it so much that I&#x27;m now using it as my regular curling iron.</li>
            <li>and so you have to let it cool down before putting it away.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-good cool down time</li>
            <li>It also came with a plastic cover so you wouldn&#x27;t have to wait for it to cool down to throw it in a bag/purse.</li>
            <li>No cord, no mess, no fuss.  </li>
            <li>Heats up very fast and ready to start within a few seconds.</li>
            <li>Also, I can use up my older refills as it takes the same size.  </li>
            <li>This go around with long hair not so much.</li>
            <li>Heats up fast, fuel lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>There is a little red light to see that it is on.</li>
            <li>I put new cartridge in to see if it may be faulty but same thing happens .</li>
            <li>the curling iron took so much time to use that simply coiling the cord around a regular curling iron was a lot faster.</li>
            <li>and I can towel dry my hair, add product, let it air dry on the way to work, and when I get to work, do a quick curl in the parking lot in about 5-10 minutes.</li>
            <li>I did like the small size of the original ones for travel.</li>
            <li>I was certain I had turned mine off, yet when I went to use it again the thermacell was empty.</li>
            <li>I barely used it, maybe once a month, and have plenty of butane.</li>
            <li>The butane cartridge lasted for a four week trip and still was not empty.</li>
            <li>but the curler doesn&#x27;t get hot anymore nor does the glow exist looking down inside barrel.</li>
            <li>Clamp is not tight enough to hold hair.</li>
            <li>It was hard to get it to ignite and it never was real hot.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough and the amount of time it takes to get even a resemblance of a curl is not worth the time, effort, or butane</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll learn, because I don&#x27;t like to waste cartridge life or create a hazard from the hot curling</li>
            <li>Who wants to bring down a plane.  </li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t need to keep in on your bangs for very long if you want a soft curl.</li>
            <li>I was very skeptical that it would work, but it gets pretty hot and makes really decent spiral curls in a short time.</li>
            <li>I bought this curling iron specifically to take camping so that if I was at a campground where I could not have electricity then this would be ideal to give my bangs some curl at least for awhile, until the muggy weather takes back the curl.  </li>

            <li> Great curling iron, heats up quickly and makes nice curls without being attached to an electric cord !  </li>
            <li> Make sure U take out the cartrige before storing the iron!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS CURLING IRON!</li>
            <li> This is a most amazing styler!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Works great and so compact and easy to packüëç</li>
            <li> It is an awesome little iron- heats up well and curls great!</li>
            <li> It will be great not to have to worry if my plug will fit.</li>
            <li> It also did not come with a protective cover for the barrel which I would have liked.</li>
            <li> I was able to leave the house looking good.</li>
            <li> Nice and convenient.</li>
            <li> travel bag would have been nice, but it wasn&#x27;t advertised</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have when there is no electric.</li>
            <li> It is so handy to take on vacation or</li>
            <li> - I  loved my 1997 model better.  </li>
            <li> It says great size for travel, but isn&#x27;t the kind that comes apart to fit inside anything.</li>
            <li> It is nice not to have to deal with the cord.</li>
            <li> Amazon kindly offered me a refund which I&#x27;m grateful for</li>
            <li> Thank you so much - was thrilled to find here on Amazon!!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my new purchase.</li>
            <li> Great for a quick fix -- at work, camping, traveling, and at home.  </li>
            <li> It is very easy to bump the on switch and lose all of your butane.</li>
            <li> very easy to store.</li>
            <li> Nice to have a quick curl when you don&#x27;t have power.. like camping!!</li>
            <li> Sure it takes longer and maybe isn&#x27;t as user friendly, but at the end of the day, my hair looked great at the music festivals and for the price its almost a no brainer.</li>
            <li> I bought this on the reviews that it works great on fine hair however it doesnt curl my fine hair at all.</li>
            <li> This curling iron gets hot quick and the no cord is awesome.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good - Still miss and liked my Braun better</li>
            <li> I would change it for a better one</li>
            <li> delivery time couldn&#x27;t have been better.</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love not having to plug this iron into an outlet.  </li>
            <li> Love this cordless curling iron.....great for travel</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s better than having nothing.</li>
            <li> Perfect for international travel.  </li>
            <li> No problem taking it on flights to most countries, but the cartridge and curling iron must be separated.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> When they were sold in stores it came with a cover which made it more convenient for carrying in a purse.</li>
            <li> and/or making sure it stayed off,</li>
            <li> Love both products.</li>
            <li> I kept my hand a safe distance from the iron at all times, but perhaps this is a trick I have yet to find out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> having to replace them more often.  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Works great and heats up fast.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast and curls great.</li>
            <li> Love my Conair curler.</li>
            <li> I brought this because I like to be able to pull it out and curl my hair on the go without needing to find an outlet.</li>
            <li> I love having this cordless curling iron incase of emergency power outages.</li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> My first advice if purchasing this cordless curling iron is when turning the iron off, check and re-check to make sure you have successfully turned it off.</li>
            <li> I have had better Conair cordless curling irons, but this one does the job.</li>
            <li> I have owned many of these over the years.</li>
            <li> I love these things.</li>
            <li> Holds curls better - probably because heat is hotter.</li>
            <li> I am going to order more of them while I can still find them.  </li>
            <li> Glad I got a replacement - don&#x27;t want to deal with a cord.</li>
            <li> Would be even better with a cover.</li>
            <li> I love the flexibility it affords me.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast and curls great.  </li>
            <li> I love love love this thing,  No</li>
            <li> more cords.&lt;br /&gt;It is advertised as a traveling curling iron, but I love it for all the time.</li>
            <li> love the cordless factor for traveling and just convenience in the bathroom - not having to take up another plug and no hassle with the cord.  </li>
            <li> Was so glad to find it on line.  </li>
            <li> Love the convenience.  </li>
            <li> I just used the cover from my old one &amp; it fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> I love my Conair cordless curling iron.</li>
            <li> love  it,love it.  </li>
            <li> I love the size.  </li>
            <li> It is light weight and easy to pack, heats up quickly, and works just great.</li>
            <li> It was actually my first time using a curling iron since I am a straight iron curling connoisseur, but it turned out great!</li>
            <li> I LOVED IT VERY MUCH.  </li>
            <li> All of this makes it a pretty good buy in my opinion.</li>
            <li> The first one I had for about 30 years and loved it.</li>
            <li> nice product and heat up quick....</li>
            <li> up quickly, and not having a cord is amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked this type of butane curling iron for the quick heat and ease of not having a cord.</li>
            <li> Works great but it would be nice if it came with a barrel cover like the flat iron.</li>
            <li> It works great, no continuously clicking to get a spark like I had to do with my old Braun either.  </li>
            <li> Good unit and fast delivery.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for something easy to take along - camping, on trips, etc.  </li>
            <li> Lightweight &amp; easy to use.</li>
            <li> but it is not as easy to hold as</li>
            <li> Heats up very quickly.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-butane cartridges, but it&#x27;s SO EASY to use</li>
            <li> Curls my hair very quickly.</li>
            <li> but you can easily forget to disengage it and lose your cartridge as I did.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> This replaces my beloved Braun cordless curling iron, because the replacement cartridges are no longer available for a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So easy to use</li>
            <li> and it heated up easily.</li>
            <li> so it is not as easy to use as I hoped.  </li>
            <li> Easy to store in drawer, too.  </li>
            <li> And it is easily stored when finished.</li>
            <li> The Braun had a much better grip and wish they were still making it because it was far superior to the Conair.</li>
            <li> It works very good, gets plenty hot,and the butane lasts a long time</li>
            <li> However, I do miss the wonderful cover that slipped right over the controls of the Braun in such a way</li>
            <li> I have had one of these before and liked it pretty well.</li>
            <li> It packs nicely and the butane cartridges are pretty convenient.</li>
            <li> Just beautiful curls that last.</li>
            <li> This iron is super for what it is just don&#x27;t expect a complete replacement for your plug in iron but a pretty great alternative that fits in your purse!</li>
            <li> A sock works just fine.</li>
            <li> My fine hair slides out.</li>
            <li> It is light weight and easy to pack.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and it won&#x27;t hold the lightest amount of hair.  </li>
            <li> It came when the company said it would and it does a fine job curling my hair.  </li>
            <li> Works ok for a quick fix, but will need to look for something else for work.  </li>
            <li> This one gets VERY hot, so watch out!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re expecting to get fabulous curls or any curl for that matter, think again.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think it is available</li>
            <li> I got it to light once</li>
            <li> I had one of these years ago while my hair was cut short and in layers, it worked great for me then.  </li>
            <li> And it will sound like there is a fire burning inside the iron...</li>
            <li> It worked great, gave me enough curly/body that I needed.  </li>
            <li> A fantastic curling iron for traveling.  </li>
            <li> Once I figured that out, it was smooth sailing.  </li>
            <li> and it is hassle free.</li>
            <li> I bought this primarily for travel but like it</li>
            <li> Worked great on my last trip</li>
            <li> You can get the ThermaCell refills here on Amazon as cheap as I have ever seen.  </li>
            <li> (butane cartridges no longer available).  </li>
            <li> It is light and compact.  </li>
            <li> and I wanted to pack light and not have to worry about plug adapters.</li>
            <li> I was able to find the butane refills at Walmart in the camping section at a more than reasonable price ($5.00).</li>
            <li> I liked my old Braun better, but can&#x27;t find them anymore.  </li>
            <li> she loves the small size, easy use, light weight, and great results!</li>
            <li> I love it and it gets really hot, However it uses up the thermal cell batteries very quickly.</li>
            <li> It is a very useful part of the curling iron.  </li>
            <li> It heats quickly and curls easily and effortlessly.  </li>
            <li> The clamp isn&#x27;t super strong</li>
            <li> Bought this to take to music festivals to keep my hair looking fresh while camping!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Super excited to use this thing</li>
            <li> Now I would give you a five star, but I don&#x27;t know why this was not included in the original package.</li>
            <li> I originally bought for travel use, but all I use now.</li>
            <li> and I love it so much!</li>
            <li> I use it for touch up spots, not for curling all my hair (which is fine and curly), so I haven&#x27;t found that it uses up cartridges too quickly.</li>
            <li> Also should be great for dry camping.</li>
            <li> I really liked this curler for traveling and did get a few good uses out of it</li>
            <li> I live in the wilderness and have limited solar-powered electricity so my need for this kind of curliing iron is great.  </li>
            <li> It heats right up!</li>
            <li> I use this daily, It is not too hot and does a great job.</li>
            <li> Very well satisfied.</li>
            <li> Flash forward to glamping, when I need to do a shoot while camping and I can&#x27;t be looking &amp;#34;beat&amp;#34; as my boyfriend calls it (jokingly but it&#x27;s true).</li>
            <li> Ideal for everyday on the go and traveling.</li>
            <li> I wish it were in a case so that I did not have to leave it on a table to cool off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even better, heats up fast.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not bad.....</li>
            <li> This curling iron works real well and gets very hot, very fast !!!  </li>
            <li> It is great when I travel to foreign countries because I never have to worry about the voltage of the power</li>
            <li> the unit did not heat adequately at all to curl my hair.  </li>
            <li> Perfect for short hair and travel abroad when power outlets will burn up your regular curling iron</li>
            <li> It heats up really quickly.</li>
            <li> It heated up quickly and worked as described.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and does curl.</li>
            <li> Heats quickly.  </li>
            <li> This product is super convenient.  </li>
            <li> I figured out quickly how to use the product.  </li>
            <li> Luckily I&#x27;d ordered the four pack refills.  </li>
            <li> Cost more and no carrying case that comes with it as the older model has.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly too.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and is hotter than my electric curling iron.  </li>
            <li> I have such straight hair, and it does a great job.</li>
            <li> Came in handy due to a power outage that lasted more than twenty hours.</li>
            <li> Item is great you are not tied down in front of mirror curling yout hair.</li>
            <li> At first I liked this thing because it heated up very quickly and made lasting curls.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend to anyone who travels, no adapter necessary, it is just great.</li>
            <li> Works very well, glad I bought it even though I haven&#x27;t used it very much‚Ä¶ But it is always there for emergencies while traveling!</li>
            <li> It heats up fast and easy.</li>
            <li> It heats up fast and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyways you can see in my customer photo that this curling iron really delivers!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and I love love love not fighting with a cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great little curler.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I would still recommend this for anyone who wants to be free of a cord, as well as for traveling by car, bus, or train.</li>
            <li> The iron is to smooth to really grab your locks.  </li>
            <li> I was impressed that we were notified that the Pro Cordless was going to be a day or two behind the ThermaCells.  </li>
            <li> I could not get a clear answer and thought better of taking it.  </li>
            <li> After not being able to find cartridges for my old Braun</li>
            <li> kind of like how you forget to unplug your regular curling iron</li>
            <li> but I also bought a 4-pack - stick the Thermacell inside the curling iron, kind of like a battery, and snap the bottom back on.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-great price and worth it&lt;</li>
            <li> I am at a loss without a hair curler, and a portable one that doesn&#x27;t have a cord to get tangled up when I am trying to reach the back of my own head.  </li>
            <li> I got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> It will be well worth the time saved to purchase refills as needed.</li>
            <li> and if I may be able to get it replaced or fixed.</li>
            <li> Easy to operate, heats quickly, curls nicely, fits in my little cosmetic bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gets super hot.</li>
            <li> It heats of hot and quickly.  </li>
            <li> The heat seems about right.</li>
            <li> This particular model does not come with the cover which is important to me.</li>
            <li> It came packaged well and looks very easy to use, once I actually start using it</li>
            <li> For my nearly shoulder length hair, it would be ideal if it were another half inch in diameter and had the detachable brush attachment.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and gets pretty hot.</li>
            <li> In fact, when I asked in certain stores if they had these for sale...they never heard of them!</li>
            <li> The curling iron heats up quickly and curls very well.</li>
            <li> Very hot and heats up fast.</li>
            <li> It heats fast and very hot.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-heats up fast and super hot</li>
            <li> Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> Great for on the go and hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> My hair is hard to curl, but it works great.  </li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t get as hot as the one I had before</li>
            <li> The package arrived and was exactly as described and just what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Small enough for a suit case which is perfect when I go on vacation.</li>
            <li> Luckily my husband is clever.</li>
            <li> The cordeless curling iron is exactly what I need</li>
            <li> So glad, I found this alternative to a regular curling for my travels abroad.  </li>
            <li> However, I find that the slightly smaller one with the case where I unscrew the cartridge before storing everything away is the one I go to most now so that never happens.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still on my first cartridge</li>
            <li> At first I had some issues when placing the fuel container into the curling iron.</li>
            <li> So you can see how hot it will heat up.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the first one I have found that gets as hot as the ones from years ago.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I had hoped it would be.</li>
            <li> The iron gets hot and creates medium size curls.</li>
            <li> Using it for the first time made me feel I&#x27;d been living under a rock.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Almost instantly hot.  </li>
            <li> 2 years the thing would not get hot (had full new cartridge).</li>
            <li> It very quickly gets hot when you turn it on and works as well as a regular corded curling iron.  </li>
            <li> I really wish they made one that is 1inch or 1.5 inch because it really take a while to get curls all over with this size barrel if you have a lot of hair!</li>
            <li> It heats up very quickly and for me, the curls last all day.</li>
            <li> I thought removing the cartridge would be bothersome, but it only takes about 10 or 15  seconds and is so easy.</li>
            <li> (no cover) VERSUS &amp;#34;Conair Travel Smart cordless (with cover)&amp;#34;.   </li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s too large for bangs.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and quickly cools down for quick storage.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and safely and makes short work of a simple curling job.</li>
            <li> I bought this to take on vacation, what a nice little curling iron it is.</li>
            <li> It does not heat up enough to curl my fine, straight hair.</li>
            <li> I wanted so much for this to work, but it just didn&#x27;t happen.  </li>
            <li> The unit works very well.</li>
            <li> and she seems to really like them.</li>
            <li> but this is what she wants.</li>
            <li> It worked just fine: heated quickly and hot enough to straighten my short wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look like it comes off at all, but that&#x27;s the only way you&#x27;re going to fit the cartridge in there.  </li>
            <li> it runs out of fuel or what ever u call it fast  </li>
            <li> This curling iron heats quickly, is ready within a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li> And refills are available in several package sizes from Amazon.</li>
            <li> and it is ready to go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I even use it at home to put a couple kinks into my stick straight hair.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t complain.  </li>
            <li> It heats up fast.</li>
            <li> This really did not work well on my hair type.</li>
            <li> Worked really well.  </li>
            <li> Very impressed, because I have super thick long Asian hair.</li>
            <li> This has no case although I just slip the hot rod into an old eyeglass case and that keeps it out of harms way.  </li>
            <li> The price is right and it gets HOT quick watch your fingers or little ones too...</li>
            <li> It heated up very fast and was definitely hot enough to curl my hair.</li>
            <li> Love this curler but because it&#x27;s black</li>
            <li> iron is sturdy enough and heats up fairly quickly and holds the heat well.</li>
            <li> Mainly for my daughter for her pageants.</li>
            <li> That was the main selling point, that it came with a carrying case.  </li>
            <li> Wished I had bought the older model.</li>
            <li> I initially bought this for travel but find that I&#x27;m using it for quick touch ups when you&#x27;re in a hurry.  </li>
            <li> I moved away and now have access to electricity, so it is not as high of a priority in my life.</li>
            <li> I love this cordless curling iron and it&#x27;s little sister.  </li>
            <li> I bought this little cute curling iron for my forays into the world of car camping.</li>
            <li> This little thing is magical.</li>
            <li> Works great, the same as the one I bought years ago, the only thing missing was a cover.</li>
            <li> Wish the barrel was a lil bigger still  worth the price.</li>
            <li> A few words of warning though, be sure to remove the butane if you will be carrying it around in a bag or purse.</li>
            <li> I guess it would be useful while traveling if you don&#x27;t want to worry about international plugs or even touch ups on the plane.</li>
            <li> Normally my curls fall out within a couple of hours</li>
            <li> I love it and use it often - especially when dry camping.</li>
            <li> Iron works well, heats up quickly and a canister of gas lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> I did loose an entire cartridge by not making sure I&#x27;d pressed the off button</li>
            <li> Heats fast, tight grip, light weight.  </li>
            <li> It works well and makes nice little curls that last for me.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live with out a cordless curling iron - never without it when traveling.  </li>
            <li> I like the new one</li>
            <li> , so I lost an almost brand new cartridge.  </li>
            <li> So you are basically buying a new curling iron every 6 weeks as the refill cartridges are 4 for $13.</li>
            <li> Since this iron doesn&#x27;t get as hot as a traditional plug in version the curls tend to fall looser than normal.  </li>
            <li> I have a very busy schedule</li>
            <li> It heats up and cools down really fast, and doesn&#x27;t go thru the ThermaCELL too quickly.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hot enough to use as a hair straightener.</li>
            <li> I would love to pack this in my carry-on, but not sure if the ThermaCell cartridge would make it through security.  </li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> It lights instantly and is hot immediately.</li>
            <li> This seems to get plenty hot enough.  </li>
            <li> like the way it heats up quickly, and it otherwise performs exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> Gets very hot, so be careful.  </li>
            <li> Looked at stores over a period of time for another one when my old one gave out.</li>
            <li> No longer here near San Francisco.  </li>
            <li> I had one of these in the early 90s and it was worn out.</li>
            <li> I think this and the smaller pink model with the smaller barrel are indispensible and probably my favorite beauty tool.</li>
            <li> - I measure it at 1/2 inch - which is completely unusable for me (I already have a 1/2 inch one</li>
            <li> I must not have turned it off completely because all the butane was gone.</li>
            <li> I have to do my hair and make-up in the car frequently.  </li>
            <li> Was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I like it so much that I&#x27;m now using it as my regular curling iron.</li>
            <li> and so you have to let it cool down before putting it away.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-good cool down time</li>
            <li> It also came with a plastic cover so you wouldn&#x27;t have to wait for it to cool down to throw it in a bag/purse.</li>
            <li> No cord, no mess, no fuss.  </li>
            <li> Heats up very fast and ready to start within a few seconds.</li>
            <li> Also, I can use up my older refills as it takes the same size.  </li>
            <li> This go around with long hair not so much.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast, fuel lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> There is a little red light to see that it is on.</li>
            <li> I put new cartridge in to see if it may be faulty but same thing happens .</li>
            <li> the curling iron took so much time to use that simply coiling the cord around a regular curling iron was a lot faster.</li>
            <li> and I can towel dry my hair, add product, let it air dry on the way to work, and when I get to work, do a quick curl in the parking lot in about 5-10 minutes.</li>
            <li> I did like the small size of the original ones for travel.</li>
            <li> I was certain I had turned mine off, yet when I went to use it again the thermacell was empty.</li>
            <li> I barely used it, maybe once a month, and have plenty of butane.</li>
            <li> The butane cartridge lasted for a four week trip and still was not empty.</li>
            <li> but the curler doesn&#x27;t get hot anymore nor does the glow exist looking down inside barrel.</li>
            <li> Clamp is not tight enough to hold hair.</li>
            <li> It was hard to get it to ignite and it never was real hot.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough and the amount of time it takes to get even a resemblance of a curl is not worth the time, effort, or butane</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll learn, because I don&#x27;t like to waste cartridge life or create a hazard from the hot curling</li>
            <li> Who wants to bring down a plane.  </li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t need to keep in on your bangs for very long if you want a soft curl.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical that it would work, but it gets pretty hot and makes really decent spiral curls in a short time.</li>
            <li> I bought this curling iron specifically to take camping so that if I was at a campground where I could not have electricity then this would be ideal to give my bangs some curl at least for awhile, until the muggy weather takes back the curl.  </li>
            <li> the old one&lt;br /&gt;was, other than that it works great.&lt;br /&gt;Yes</li>
            <li> and I also got the flat iron which works well enough too.</li>
            <li> but the part that holds your hair isn&#x27;t very tight and doesn&#x27;t hold the hair very well</li>
            <li> I had a hard time getting it to work at first....</li>
            <li> Long lasting curls!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> hair usually goes flat, but this iron works really well.&lt;br /&gt;Heats</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this product I live in an area with limited power thought this would be a great option for me</li>
            <li> Were that to happen, I bought an extra as of this one and the pink model with the smaller barrel as back-ups &amp;#34;just in case&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> My wife uses it for traveling but be careful about bringing extra butane as airlines usually only allow one canister.</li>
            <li> I used it daily for 2 weeks &amp; the cartridge was only 1/3 empty.</li>
            <li> Wow, I can&#x27;t believe how well this little unit works.  </li>
            <li> Had one years ago, the barrel was too small for my use, this one works perfectly, highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Smaller than what I expected</li>
            <li> so when I arrive work in few mins early I did my hair in the car.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> I bought one a long time ago and it just quit working</li>
            <li> Been buy on Amazon for a long time</li>
            <li> but after several tries and wearing on fingers my husband</li>
            <li> Using this for my month long trip in Scandninavia.  </li>
            <li> Curled my long hair just like a corded one.</li>
            <li> I searched and searched a long time for a 1 inch thermacell curling iron without any luck.  </li>
            <li> It takes nearly twice as long for me to curl my long hair with such a small barrel, but considering the situation (camping without electricity outlets)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for one of these cordless irons for a long time since my Braun one went caput years ago.</li>
            <li> Got this for backstage during daughter&#x27;s dance performances when I have limited time to change her hairstyles between costume changes.  </li>
            <li> but I have not had a single problem with this one.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet because I have been going all natural for the past year.</li>
            <li> The barrel is a little small and your hair tends to slip out of the clip around the barrel but, heats up fast and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Previous Conair curlers had such a feature.</li>
            <li> I am using this on a trip to Europe so that I don&#x27;t have to worry about my curling iron or flat iron having a melt down on my trip.  </li>
            <li> just what I expected and my mom has wanted</li>
            <li> Works as expected.  </li>
            <li> Not really...</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much to really say except that it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> The 2nd one I got was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Curls held all day, too with minimal spray.</li>
            <li> Not quite what I expected.</li>
            <li> Either it&#x27;s a design flaw, or just a clever and evil way for Conair to get more money out of you.</li>
            <li> However, this iron is not exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really travel with my curling iron much, but I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> Yes I would recommend this product to other people.</li>
            <li> I know there are other brands</li>
            <li> This product fails in its first use.</li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t open up far enough to grab hair and is a bit awkward.</li>
            <li> However , the butane cartridge lasts only a few uses !</li>
            <li> I am updating the review as I am disappointed that the same thing that happened to the first one I had has occurred with the one I got back in august I have had the opportunity to have used the product but maybe a dozen times</li>
            <li> but if you have long or thick hair it will take a really long time to get the job done.  </li>
            <li> Way smaller then expected, and not for thick wavy hair.</li>
            <li> Not worth the time or expense.</li>
            <li> the heating area is too small to be useful -- wanted to return it -- unable to because of the &amp;#</li>
            <li> My only complaint is I would have preferred a thicker barrel</li>
            <li> Press the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; button so that it is pushed in, and push the &#x27;start&#x27; button down which is the ignition.</li>
            <li> I always have trouble with other curling irons</li>
            <li> I have previously blown up my hair curler in a London hotel and was not going to risk doing it to another hair curler.  </li>
            <li> Previous reviewers who said the cartridge dispersed didn&#x27;t know how to use it.</li>
            <li> This result is typical for me even with a plug in version of a curling iron because of the weight of my hair.  </li>
            <li> I miss the cover that my previous cordless curling iron had.  </li>
            <li> so it was probably on longer than for a typical user.</li>
            <li> keep out of reach of those curious small hands.</li>
            <li> I have long and extremely thick hair.  </li>
            <li> Thought maybe I had stored it carelessly, but then it happened a SECOND time, while stored totally flat on a shelf.</li>
            <li> That being said, if you need a curling iron to knock a little frizz off then this might do the trick.  </li>
            <li> (Note: there is a little cap to be removed before inserting.</li>
            <li> this item was a waste of my money.  </li>
            <li> The power cell ran out of butane after just a few uses.</li>
            <li> Takes a few seconds to heat up.  </li>
            <li> Wait a few minutes</li>
            <li> If I ever succeed in getting the missing part, my review may change.</li>
            <li> Holds the hair firmly.</li>
            <li> The electric ones just don&#x27;t do the trick  on my long thick hair, like the cordless curling irons do!  </li>
            <li> It gives you small tight curls</li>
            <li> Lightweight, small, compact and works well for curling in all weather senarios.  </li>
            <li> What a waste of money, and it&#x27;s too late to return.</li>
            <li> No more worring about the correct adaptor.  </li>
            <li> No more hunting for the outlet.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> No more dangling cords getting tangled up with the blow dryer cord.  </li>
            <li> Use it everyday in the office, in my car and at home!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a flaw, it&#x27;s just a small step away from the safest products it could be.</li>
            <li> small and compact.</li>
            <li> I have had two Conair Cordless Thermacell curling irons in the past, and this one works well, but</li>
            <li> Almost too small for my hair.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what is up with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had one I purchased at local store that had something go wrong after approx.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like how the tips of my hair were hard to curl sine</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a place to plug in ur iron to do touch ups.</li>
            <li> but my hair is hard to curl</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find the cartridges in stores</li>
            <li> 10 years ago I wished I could have a curling iron to do my hair in the car since I was always running late for school.</li>
            <li> I rather use this than a regular curling wand, because I&#x27;m afraid I might burn myself.</li>
            <li> I am always late, always.  </li>
            <li> No more tangled cords for me!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the only bad thing about this curling iron.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical thinking the barrel was too small for the curls I wanted</li>
            <li> I have been in the hospital and my room had no outlets except behind the bed.</li>
            <li> Would recommend it for someone who has thin hair.</li>
            <li> so I decided to replace my curling iron where the cord gets so twisted.</li>
            <li> So this one fills the bill and was not prohibitively expensive.  </li>
            <li> My bad to not have noticed this, but 3/4 inch is very small</li>
            <li> I had to knock off a star because the instruction booklet stinks.  </li>
            <li> very sorry I bought it.</li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> bad</li>
            <li> However, too bad it doesn&#x27;t include a cover for the barrel like some of them.</li>
            <li> The bad part is that I cant return it</li>
            <li> and I both gave up :(</li>
            <li> And it hasn&#x27;t disappointed me yet.</li>
            <li> :(.</li>
            <li> VERY unhappy with this, Amazon.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that I hate it per se</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It turned out to be worthless!</li>
            <li> But the worst part was that I could not find replacements cartridges anywhere in any store.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Bought this to take to music festivals to keep my hair looking fresh while camping! Perfect for traveling!</li>
            <li> Works great for travelling in our RV.</li>
            <li> Smaller than what I expected</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re expecting to get fabulous curls or any curl for that matter, think again.  I wanted so much for this to work, but it just didn&#x27;t happen.  It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough and the amount of time it takes to get even a resemblance of a curl is not worth the time, effort, or butane you will spend trying to make it happen.  Not worth the time or expense.</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t get as hot as the one I had before...[Braun]  I couldn&#x27;t get batteries so I had to change....This looks as&lt;br /&gt;good but it just doesn&#x27;t heat as well........I would change it for a better one but I don&#x27;t think it is available</li>
            <li> The package arrived and was exactly as described and just what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;The delivery time couldn&#x27;t have been better.</li>
            <li> I have a very busy schedule so when I arrive work in few mins early I did my hair in the car.&lt;br /&gt;Very nice product and heat up quick....&lt;br /&gt;I love it.</li>
            <li> the unit did not heat adequately at all to curl my hair.  this item was a waste of my money.  very sorry I bought it.</li>
            <li> Long lasting curls!!&lt;br /&gt;My hair usually goes flat, but this iron works really well.&lt;br /&gt;Heats up quickly, and not having a cord is amazing. I use mine every day!</li>
            <li> just what I expected and my mom has wanted</li>
            <li> The Conair came 2 days after the thermaCells came. I was impressed that we were notified that the Pro Cordless was going to be a day or two behind the ThermaCells.  If we had not  been notified we would have been wondering where the rest of the order was at.  The unit works very well. Very well satisfied.</li>
            <li> I love it. Yes I would recommend this product to other people. Small enough for a suit case which is perfect when I go on vacation.</li>
            <li> SHE LOVED IT.  THERE you go,. and did they.</li>
            <li> The clip on the barrel did not hold my hair. It turned out to be worthless!</li>
            <li> I have had one of these before and liked it pretty well. I  cannot get this one to turn on at all. I think it is a manufacturer defect. It also did not come with a protective cover for the barrel which I would have liked.</li>
            <li> I would have given this a 5 star rating if it came with a cover for the barrel. I bought one a long time ago and it just quit working but it came with a cover for the barrel. This one didn&#x27;t and so you have to let it cool down before putting it away. That&#x27;s the only bad thing about this curling iron. Otherwise good. It gives you small tight curls so you don&#x27;t need to keep in on your bangs for very long if you want a soft curl. Buy a bigger barrel curling iron if a softer fuller curl is what you want.</li>
            <li> As advertised, No problems, bought it for the wife to go to Alaska. Stayed in a cabin in the boonies for a week, she was happy being able to manage her hair,,,, happy wife&#x3D; Happy life</li>
            <li> We brought this camping and it did the trick!</li>
            <li> Came in handy due to a power outage that lasted more than twenty hours. I was able to leave the house looking good.</li>
            <li> Works great. Used it camping!</li>
            <li> Will never understand why this curling iron is not sold in TX.  Have used one for years -- in CA!  Great for a quick fix -- at work, camping, traveling, and at home.  Thank you so much - was thrilled to find here on Amazon!!</li>
            <li> I have had these before and loved them.  Great for travel!</li>
            <li> It works very good, gets plenty hot,and the butane lasts a long time</li>
            <li> Perfect for short hair and travel abroad when power outlets will burn up your regular curling iron</li>
            <li> great to use when there is no electricity available--camping! also took to the UK with me so I didn&#x27;t need an adapter.</li>
            <li> My wife has had these before and she seems to really like them. I know there are other brands but this is what she wants.</li>
            <li> It worked just fine: heated quickly and hot enough to straighten my short wavy hair.  I had to knock off a star because the instruction booklet stinks.  While it says to remove the cap from the Thermacell cartridge (there is 1 included), it does not tell you that you also need to remove the bottom end cap of the iron.  It doesn&#x27;t look like it comes off at all, but that&#x27;s the only way you&#x27;re going to fit the cartridge in there.  Luckily my husband is clever.</li>
            <li> Worked out beautifully on our Ecuadorian trip!  Didn&#x27;t have to worry whether I would have electricity or not.  You have to be kidding!??</li>
            <li> it runs out of fuel or what ever u call it fast  but i like it</li>
            <li> This is what I have been looking for when I&#x27;m traveling to different places with no outlets. Great touch up curling iron between events or before your dinner date.  :-)</li>
            <li> I love not having to plug this iron into an outlet.  Great when traveling overseas.  You don&#x27;t have to worry about the electrical volts.</li>
            <li> Had one years ago. Looked at stores over a period of time for another one when my old one gave out. Been buy on Amazon for a long time so I decided to replace my curling iron where the cord gets so twisted. Came across this! Don&#x27;t never want to be with out one of these again. Great for traveling too! No more tangled cords for me!</li>
            <li> I bought this for a trip to Europe as my cousin said you can now carry on a cartridge and that she checked a back up one.  Well I bought it and then Googled air restrictions.  I could not get a clear answer and thought better of taking it.  Who wants to bring down a plane.  But the worst part was that I could not find replacements cartridges anywhere in any store.  I used to use one of these and every drug store carried supplies.  No longer here near San Francisco.  So I will give it to my cousin.  Too bad.</li>
            <li> I like the freedom from the cord. This curling iron heats quickly, is ready within a couple of minutes. I had one of these in the early 90s and it was worn out.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.  Nice and convenient.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this product I live in an area with limited power thought this would be a great option for me the ignitor on handle does NOT work I got it to light once but after several tries and wearing on fingers my husband and I both gave up :(</li>
            <li> This product fails in its first use. Don&#x27;t buy</li>
            <li> Easy to operate, heats quickly, curls nicely, fits in my little cosmetic bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A travel bag would have been nice, but it wasn&#x27;t advertised so I didn&#x27;t expect it.  A sock works just fine.</li>
            <li> Great for on the go and hard to find in stores. In fact, when I asked in certain stores if they had these for sale...they never heard of them!</li>
            <li> Love this curler but because it&#x27;s black you can&#x27;t tell when you run out of fluid</li>
            <li> Using this for my month long trip in Scandninavia.  Lightweight, small, compact and works well for curling in all weather senarios.  Happy with purchase for curls.</li>
            <li> I bought this to take on my trip to Europe and tried it out this weekend. It heats up really quickly. It will be great not to have to worry if my plug will fit. Also should be great for dry camping.</li>
            <li> Love this cordless curling iron.....great for travel</li>
            <li> This product heats up and  will curl but if you have long or thick hair it will take a really long time to get the job done.  That being said, if you need a curling iron to knock a little frizz off then this might do the trick.  I had one of these years ago while my hair was cut short and in layers, it worked great for me then.  This go around with long hair not so much. When you are stuck without electricity it&#x27;s better than having nothing.</li>
            <li> Great product! Wish the barrel was a lil bigger still  worth the price.</li>
            <li> My wife has used a curling iron like this for years. We bought one rep[placements in 7 years. This will make a great spare.</li>
            <li> I love this cordless curling iron and it&#x27;s little sister.  I have used butane curling irons for years and have been so concerned that one would break and couldn&#x27;t find a replacement if the company decided to stop making them.  Were that to happen, I bought an extra as of this one and the pink model with the smaller barrel as back-ups &amp;#34;just in case&amp;#34;.  I have arthritis in my hands and use both regularly and it is helpful not to have to wrestle with a cord.  I think this and the smaller pink model with the smaller barrel are indispensible and probably my favorite beauty tool.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my girl friend for an Ireland Trip.  Worked great!  No issues in the airports and she was very happy with how it worked.</li>
            <li> It is good in a pinch.  Wish I could get bigger barrel in these cordless.  I don&#x27;t think they make them anymore.</li>
            <li> you should still offer it with the brush sleeve!!</li>
            <li> Iron works well, heats up quickly and a canister of gas lasts a long time.  My wife uses it for traveling but be careful about bringing extra butane as airlines usually only allow one canister.</li>
            <li> This curling iron works great!  I was looking for something easy to take along - camping, on trips, etc.  It heats right up!</li>
            <li> Not really... The power cell ran out of butane after just a few uses. And the last one I bought had a cover for the barrel and this one doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Works great!  Curled my long hair just like a corded one.</li>
            <li> Perfect for international travel.  No problem taking it on flights to most countries, but the cartridge and curling iron must be separated.</li>
            <li> Love it.  It heats quickly and curls easily and effortlessly.  This will be great for travel&lt;br /&gt;and you don&#x27;t need an outlet.  Can even be used in the car.</li>
            <li> At first I liked this thing because it heated up very quickly and made lasting curls. However, this lasted one year, and now it won&#x27;t heat up at all. I barely used it, maybe once a month, and have plenty of butane. What a waste of money, and it&#x27;s too late to return. Don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live with out a cordless curling iron - never without it when traveling.  And great for touchups.  Takes a few seconds to heat up.  And refills are available in several package sizes from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Wish I could find a larger cordless curler.</li>
            <li> This worked perfectly on a recent trip to Portugal. It heated up quickly and worked as described. This is a great travel curling iron.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent cordless option for travel.  It is light weight and easy to pack, heats up quickly, and works just great.</li>
            <li> I bought this upon the recommendation of a lady of a trip overseas.  I have previously blown up my hair curler in a London hotel and was not going to risk doing it to another hair curler.  Since this can go on the plane and will not require plugging in overseas, I will not be worrying about being without a hair curler.</li>
            <li> Way smaller then expected, and not for thick wavy hair.</li>
            <li> Lightweight &amp; easy to use. Previous reviewers who said the cartridge dispersed didn&#x27;t know how to use it. Heated instantly. I used it daily for 2 weeks &amp; the cartridge was only 1/3 empty.</li>
            <li> Works very well, glad I bought it even though I haven&#x27;t used it very much‚Ä¶ But it is always there for emergencies while traveling!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Mom when she travels - she loves the small size, easy use, light weight, and great results! Nice gift!</li>
            <li> I like the new one but it is not as easy to hold as the old one&lt;br /&gt;was, other than that it works great.&lt;br /&gt;Yes I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and does curl. But it doesn&#x27;t open up far enough to grab hair and is a bit awkward. My fine hair slides out. On the good side&lt;br /&gt;its great for camping and travel.</li>
            <li> It arrived in good condition and performs well.</li>
            <li> For my fiance. Works great!</li>
            <li> Heats quickly.  It&#x27;s a great option for travel.</li>
            <li> The cordeless curling iron is exactly what I need and it&#x27;s hot enough to use as a hair straightener. Good job.</li>
            <li> Broke after only being used a couple times. Seller is playing games acting like my order can&#x27;t be found. Save yourself the hassle....use another seller</li>
            <li> This product is super convenient.  I am using this on a trip to Europe so that I don&#x27;t have to worry about my curling iron or flat iron having a melt down on my trip.  There are no directions but after pushing a couple of buttons I figured out quickly how to use the product.  I have long and extremely thick hair.  Since this iron doesn&#x27;t get as hot as a traditional plug in version the curls tend to fall looser than normal.  This result is typical for me even with a plug in version of a curling iron because of the weight of my hair.  This iron is super for what it is just don&#x27;t expect a complete replacement for your plug in iron but a pretty great alternative that fits in your purse!</li>
            <li> So glad, I found this alternative to a regular curling for my travels abroad.  It worked great and I could not be happier.  Highly recommend to anyone who travels, no adapter necessary, it is just great.</li>
            <li> Looks just like the last one.  My wife is happy.</li>
            <li> Works great, the same as the one I bought years ago, the only thing missing was a cover. When they were sold in stores it came with a cover which made it more convenient for carrying in a purse. There&#x27;s not much to really say except that it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. It heats up very quickly and for me, the curls last all day. A few words of warning though, be sure to remove the butane if you will be carrying it around in a bag or purse. It is very easy to bump the on switch and lose all of your butane. I was able to find the butane refills at Walmart in the camping section at a more than reasonable price ($5.00). All of this makes it a pretty good buy in my opinion. Ladies, If you&#x27;re looking for an on the go, last minute styling tool, this may just be it!</li>
            <li> If you traveled this would be a great product but I just wanted a cordless curling iron to eliminate the cords laying on the bathroom sink.  the curling iron took so much time to use that simply coiling the cord around a regular curling iron was a lot faster.</li>
            <li> After not being able to find cartridges for my old Braun I was overjoyed to find this!  It works great, no continuously clicking to get a spark like I had to do with my old Braun either.  I did loose an entire cartridge by not making sure I&#x27;d pressed the off button and/or making sure it stayed off, kind of like how you forget to unplug your regular curling iron, so I lost an almost brand new cartridge.  Luckily I&#x27;d ordered the four pack refills.  However, I find that the slightly smaller one with the case where I unscrew the cartridge before storing everything away is the one I go to most now so that never happens.  This has no case although I just slip the hot rod into an old eyeglass case and that keeps it out of harms way.  Love both products.</li>
            <li> For once, a product that exceeds expectations!  Got this for backstage during daughter&#x27;s dance performances when I have limited time to change her hairstyles between costume changes.  It heats up and cools down really fast, and doesn&#x27;t go thru the ThermaCELL too quickly.</li>
            <li> I bought this curling iron specifically to take camping so that if I was at a campground where I could not have electricity then this would be ideal to give my bangs some curl at least for awhile, until the muggy weather takes back the curl.  It very quickly gets hot when you turn it on and works as well as a regular corded curling iron.  I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Loved this!  Just got back from Europe  No more worring about the correct adaptor.  No more hunting for the outlet.&lt;br /&gt;This is great for travel.  Curling Iron worked well.  I packed this in my checked lugage along with the ThermaCell cartridge with no problem. I would love to pack this in my carry-on, but not sure if the ThermaCell cartridge would make it through security.  Does anyone know?</li>
            <li> This curling worked great! It heated up very fast and was definitely hot enough to curl my hair. I can&#x27;t imagine traveling without it now!</li>
            <li> 10 years ago I wished I could have a curling iron to do my hair in the car since I was always running late for school. Flash forward to glamping, when I need to do a shoot while camping and I can&#x27;t be looking &amp;#34;beat&amp;#34; as my boyfriend calls it (jokingly but it&#x27;s true). I guess it would be useful while traveling if you don&#x27;t want to worry about international plugs or even touch ups on the plane. (I think I read that 1 butane container is allowed per person on carry on).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways you can see in my customer photo that this curling iron really delivers!! It was actually my first time using a curling iron since I am a straight iron curling connoisseur, but it turned out great! I don&#x27;t like how the tips of my hair were hard to curl sine I kept my hand a safe distance from the iron at all times, but perhaps this is a trick I have yet to find out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically you just pop off the bottom, take the lid off the Thermacell - each curling iron comes with one Thermacell but I also bought a 4-pack - stick the Thermacell inside the curling iron, kind of like a battery, and snap the bottom back on. Press the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; button so that it is pushed in, and push the &#x27;start&#x27; button down which is the ignition. You will hear a click - click. And it will sound like there is a fire burning inside the iron... and I think there is. There is a little red light to see that it is on. Wait a few minutes and it is ready to go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Super excited to use this thing and I also got the flat iron which works well enough too.</li>
            <li> Wife says it works well so she&#x27;s happy.</li>
            <li> I bought this little cute curling iron for my forays into the world of car camping. And it hasn&#x27;t disappointed me yet. I even use it at home to put a couple kinks into my stick straight hair. It packs nicely and the butane cartridges are pretty convenient. I&#x27;m still on my first cartridge but I use it infrequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The iron is sturdy enough and heats up fairly quickly and holds the heat well. It&#x27;s small and I love love love not fighting with a cord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now if only I could find a butane powered hair dryer -sigh-</li>
            <li> Great for travel!  No fussing with cords.  Heats up very quickly. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> It worked great, gave me enough curly/body that I needed.  Don&#x27;t expect to get the heat as your home curling iron, but I figured that.</li>
            <li> I live in the wilderness and have limited solar-powered electricity so my need for this kind of curliing iron is great.  Also good on the road during trips.</li>
            <li> I love it and it gets really hot, However it uses up the thermal cell batteries very quickly. ..having to replace them more often.  :(.</li>
            <li> the heating area is too small to be useful -- wanted to return it -- unable to because of the &amp;#34;hazardous butane.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;What a bummer.  VERY unhappy with this, Amazon.  Phooey!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> A fantastic curling iron for traveling.  At first I had some issues when placing the fuel container into the curling iron. (Note: there is a little cap to be removed before inserting. Replace the cap after use.)  Once I figured that out, it was smooth sailing.  It is an awesome little iron- heats up well and curls great!</li>
            <li> I LOVED IT VERY MUCH.  I TOOK IT TO EUROPE AND WAS GREAT BECAUSE MOST APATERS DO NOT WORK FOR CURLING IRONS.  HOW CAN I BUY REFILLS FOR THE BUTANE</li>
            <li> Great curling iron, heats up quickly and makes nice curls without being attached to an electric cord !  I use it every day.</li>
            <li> Great for when you don&#x27;t have power.</li>
            <li> I got this for me &amp; my daughter.... Mainly for my daughter for her pageants. It&#x27;s hard to find a place to plug in ur iron to do touch ups. I had a hard time getting it to work at first.... I finally got it to ignite. Make sure U take out the cartrige before storing the iron!</li>
            <li> I am living off the grid but still needed a curling iron. Very hot and heats up fast. Buy it!</li>
            <li> The curling iron heats up quickly and curls very well. It is light weight and easy to pack. The butane cartridge lasted for a four week trip and still was not empty. The cartrdge must be put in your quart bag of liquids. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great quality. Heats up quickly and quickly cools down for quick storage. Ideal for everyday on the go and traveling.</li>
            <li> This produce DID NOT WORK when it arrived.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS CURLING IRON! I was skeptical thinking the barrel was too small for the curls I wanted and how well it would heat up. Very impressed, because I have super thick long Asian hair. The one thing that I LOVED about this is that I used it as a curling wand, and it curled my hair perfectly. I rather use this than a regular curling wand, because I&#x27;m afraid I might burn myself. This travel iron is perfect to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-heats up fast and super hot&lt;br /&gt;-good cool down time&lt;br /&gt;-good travel size&lt;br /&gt;-easy to use, turn on, turn off, store away&lt;br /&gt;-I was able to use it as a CURLING WAND!!! :) So you can see how hot it will heat up.&lt;br /&gt;-great price and worth it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-butane cartridges, but it&#x27;s SO EASY to use, you just have to spend $ for refills.&lt;br /&gt;-too bad it didn&#x27;t come with a travel pouch.</li>
            <li> I am at a loss without a hair curler, and a portable one that doesn&#x27;t have a cord to get tangled up when I am trying to reach the back of my own head.  So this one fills the bill and was not prohibitively expensive.  I liked my old Braun better, but can&#x27;t find them anymore.  This one gets VERY hot, so watch out!</li>
            <li> I was very happy with the curling iron, however it arrived without a cover for the end.  This is the part that goes over the heating end to protect from burning anyone, or being turned on when it is not in use.  It is a very useful part of the curling iron.  I called Conair and they shipped the shield for the end immediately.  Now I would give you a five star, but I don&#x27;t know why this was not included in the original package.</li>
            <li> Works great and heats up fast.</li>
            <li> Works great but it would be nice if it came with a barrel cover like the flat iron. Heats up fast and curls great.</li>
            <li> This is my 5th curling iron. I originally bought for travel use, but all I use now. no cords to tangle.</li>
            <li> This cordless Conair Curling Iron is awesome!  It runs on Conair Thermacell refill cartridges.  No more dangling cords getting tangled up with the blow dryer cord.  Perfect for traveling, too.  I purchased the Baggellini curling iron cover for traveling and storage.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Use it everyday in the office, in my car and at home!</li>
            <li> It works great.  But beware if you fly.  I had a bit of a challenge as I made it known it was in my bag.  I got to take it but It took a while to get the clearance.  I went to Europe and it was just the perfect hair appliance.</li>
            <li> I have used these for probably 20 years.  This is the first one I have found that gets as hot as the ones from years ago.  My hair is hard to curl, but it works great.  No cord, no mess, no fuss.  Just beautiful curls that last.</li>
            <li> Love my Conair curler.</li>
            <li> Great product. Why can&#x27;t I buy it anywhere else? Good for you!</li>
            <li> Despite the fact that the description states it comes with a carrying case, IT DID NOT!  That was the main selling point, that it came with a carrying case.  Trying to decide if I will return it or not.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I use this daily, It is not too hot and does a great job.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd Conair butane curling iron. The first one I had for about 30 years and loved it. I got my money&#x27;s worth. The 2nd one I got was a waste of money. It was hard to get it to ignite and it never was real hot. This one is great. It heats up fast and easy. It gets super hot. Curls my hair very quickly.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet because I have been going all natural for the past year. I brought this because I like to be able to pull it out and curl my hair on the go without needing to find an outlet. It came packaged well and looks very easy to use, once I actually start using it I will give an update.</li>
            <li> Cost more and no carrying case that comes with it as the older model has. Heats up but you can easily forget to disengage it and lose your cartridge as I did. If it had a case with it and a place to put your cartridge - you&#x27;d have no worries. I carry it in my purse as-is and it&#x27;s getting banged up without a case too.  Wished I had bought the older model.</li>
            <li> Great to travel with.&lt;br /&gt;Put in your purse.&lt;br /&gt;No cord which tangles and no plugin.&lt;br /&gt;A constant hair saver to use anywhere!</li>
            <li> Great product and service!</li>
            <li> wife happy....which makes me happy</li>
            <li> Exactly what I had hoped it would be. Great for camping!!!</li>
            <li> The device arrived without the essential heat shield, so it cannot be used for its intended purpose which is travel.  If I ever succeed in getting the missing part, my review may change.</li>
            <li> This it great.  It heats of hot and quickly.  I use it for touch ups when I am not at home.  The bathroom at my work does not have a plug so I can use this if I need a touch up afterwork for going out to dinner or something.  My only complaint is I would have preferred a thicker barrel but otherwise it works great in a pinch.</li>
            <li> I searched and searched a long time for a 1 inch thermacell curling iron without any luck.  Finally, I decided to just go for the 3/4 inch and I really like it.  I got it for camping at music festivals and it has definitely served it purpose.  It heats up quickly and gets pretty hot. It takes nearly twice as long for me to curl my long hair with such a small barrel, but considering the situation (camping without electricity outlets) I really can&#x27;t complain.  Sure it takes longer and maybe isn&#x27;t as user friendly, but at the end of the day, my hair looked great at the music festivals and for the price its almost a no brainer.</li>
            <li> Item is great you are not tied down in front of mirror curling yout hair. Heats up very fast and ready to start within a few seconds. Have used this curling iron for years and love it!!!!</li>
            <li> This curling iron works real well and gets very hot, very fast !!!  Great for travelling, etc.  However, too bad it doesn&#x27;t include a cover for the barrel like some of them.</li>
            <li> Look forward to using it on a camping trip possibly. I moved away and now have access to electricity, so it is not as high of a priority in my life. Haven&#x27;t even used it yet but hope to one day.</li>
            <li> I have been in the hospital and my room had no outlets except behind the bed. I could not use my regular curling iron. This fits my needs.</li>
            <li> I love having this cordless curling iron incase of emergency power outages.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that I hate it per se - it&#x27;s just not what it was described as.  There is no way that barrel is 3/4 inch - I measure it at 1/2 inch - which is completely unusable for me (I already have a 1/2 inch one and I need one larger).</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  Loved it.</li>
            <li> I love this it works perfectly and heats up so quickly and it is hassle free. I don&#x27;t go anywhere with out it! You can store it almost anywhere and you always look flawless. I always have trouble with other curling irons but I have not had a single problem with this one. It is so convienent and I love it so much!üòçüòçüòçüëåüëåüëåüëå</li>
            <li> This item works great!  It&#x27;s nice to have when there is no electric.</li>
            <li> This product was inquired about, and then was found not to be as represented and returned. Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> This is a Christmas gift and it appears to be like the one I owned before.  It heats up quickly but I hope this one lasts longer.</li>
            <li> My first advice if purchasing this cordless curling iron is when turning the iron off, check and re-check to make sure you have successfully turned it off. I was certain I had turned mine off, yet when I went to use it again the thermacell was empty. I must not have turned it off completely because all the butane was gone. The iron gets hot and creates medium size curls. I wish it were in a case so that I did not have to leave it on a table to cool off. I have had better Conair cordless curling irons, but this one does the job.</li>
            <li> The box says that it comes with a cover and it didn&#x27;t.  I&#x27;ll probably return it because I was going to use it for travel.</li>
            <li> This curling iron gets hot quick and the no cord is awesome. However , the butane cartridge lasts only a few uses ! Maybe 8. So you are basically buying a new curling iron every 6 weeks as the refill cartridges are 4 for $13. Rip off.</li>
            <li> This is a most amazing styler! Using it for the first time made me feel I&#x27;d been living under a rock. The best part is, for sure, no cord. Took a time or two to get used to it, but now I think it may be the best styler I&#x27;ve ever had. Ladies with longer hair may want a larger barrel but this is great for my medium length hair. I thought removing the cartridge would be bothersome, but it only takes about 10 or 15  seconds and is so easy. Definitely recommended!</li>
            <li> Nice to have a quick curl when you don&#x27;t have power.. like camping!!</li>
            <li> Clamp is not tight enough to hold hair. I have fine hair and it won&#x27;t hold the lightest amount of hair.  I would not purchase this product again. It won&#x27;t even do bangs.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not bad.....would  be perfect for travel but the part that holds your hair isn&#x27;t very tight and doesn&#x27;t hold the hair very well</li>
            <li> My bad to not have noticed this, but 3/4 inch is very small</li>
            <li> Not what I thought.---perhaps my fault as I cannot fault the description.  I was expecting a type of battery operated curling iron for travel not butane.  I may have kept it for a back-up to use at my home, but I could not get it to operate anyway.  I returned the item to the seller.</li>
            <li> This replaces my beloved Braun cordless curling iron, because the replacement cartridges are no longer available for a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the way it heats up quickly, and it otherwise performs exactly as expected. However, I do miss the wonderful cover that slipped right over the controls of the Braun in such a way that in deactivated the cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the Conair, the iron will remain on unless I remember to push the switch to deactivate the cartridge. It&#x27;s not a flaw, it&#x27;s just a small step away from the safest products it could be. I&#x27;ll learn, because I don&#x27;t like to waste cartridge life or create a hazard from the hot curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would still recommend this for anyone who wants to be free of a cord, as well as for traveling by car, bus, or train. I don&#x27;t think airline regulations would permit the cartridges, but I haven&#x27;t checked this out (yet).</li>
            <li> Very handy to have in the desk drawer at work. Works well as a straightener, too. It heats up fast. I use it for touch up spots, not for curling all my hair (which is fine and curly), so I haven&#x27;t found that it uses up cartridges too quickly. This was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Great little curler.  Purchased to use at our off the grid cabin and it works wonderfully.  Almost instantly hot.  Had one years ago, the barrel was too small for my use, this one works perfectly, highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Wow!  What a great curling iron.  Heats fast, tight grip, light weight.  I bought this primarily for travel but like it so well I will probably use it daily.</li>
            <li> Great item for at work</li>
            <li> The curling iron should have a removable guard for the barrel. Previous Conair curlers had such a feature.</li>
            <li> I bought this to take on vacation, what a nice little curling iron it is. So easy to use and it heated up easily.</li>
            <li> I have owned many of these over the years. It heats fast and very hot. No cords to tangle and plug in. very easy to store. small and compact. Great for travel. The butane cartridges last 6 months for me. I love these things.</li>
            <li> I miss the cover that my previous cordless curling iron had.  When placed on the curling iron it automatically turned the iron off if I had neglected to do so.</li>
            <li> Along with the cartridges, this was a gift for my daughter-in-law.  She couldn&#x27;t wait to use it and, when she did, she said it looked as good as her stylist could do.</li>
            <li> It lights instantly and is hot immediately. Holds the hair firmly. I have had two Conair Cordless Thermacell curling irons in the past, and this one works well, but I did like the small size of the original ones for travel.</li>
            <li> I did not realize when I purchased this curling iron that the butane cartridge has to be inserted and removed each time you use it so it is not as easy to use as I hoped.  And I doubt you can bring the butane cartridge in carry-on luggage as it has flammable liquid - so it is not &amp;#34;easy for travel&amp;#34; as advertised.</li>
            <li> It is so handy to take on vacation or any over night stay. It heats up fast and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I like it!  - I  loved my 1997 model better.  They are just making them cheaper and didn&#x27;t have the brush attachment. Holds curls better - probably because heat is hotter.</li>
            <li> This really did not work well on my hair type.</li>
            <li> No security cover. Can&#x27;t take through security in carry-on which was why I bought it.</li>
            <li> Worked great on my last trip</li>
            <li> Once I started using these cordless curling irons, I never looked back. The electric ones just don&#x27;t do the trick  on my long thick hair, like the cordless curling irons do!  I was beginning to panic when I couldn&#x27;t find these in the stores anymore. I am going to order more of them while I can still find them.  Once I can&#x27;t get the cordless curling irons, or the butane refill cartridges anymore....I might as well cut my hair short.  I hope I don&#x27;t have to do that for a longggggg time, though!</li>
            <li> So easy to travel with and carry in make-up bag-works perfect!  Can take cartrigages out for flights and approved for flying!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she loves it.  We are full-time RV&#x27;ers so it gives us another option rather than firing off the generator.  It heats up quickly and safely and makes short work of a simple curling job.</li>
            <li> I am quite happy with this curling iron, it heats up rapidly and I can tell when it is on.  It came when the company said it would and it does a fine job curling my hair.  It is great when I travel to foreign countries because I never have to worry about the voltage of the power and I don&#x27;t need a converter.</li>
            <li> The best!  I am always late, always.  I have to do my hair and make-up in the car frequently.  This is just the ticket for those times and for in-between touch-ups.  Gets very hot, so be careful.  You can get the ThermaCell refills here on Amazon as cheap as I have ever seen.  I only wish they made this in a wider barrel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for one of these cordless irons for a long time since my Braun one went caput years ago. It&#x27;s even better, heats up fast. Works great to carry in my purse to use as needed away from home.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good - Still miss and liked my Braun better (butane cartridges no longer available).  Glad I got a replacement - don&#x27;t want to deal with a cord.</li>
            <li> Would be even better with a cover.</li>
            <li> I love the flexibility it affords me. Heats up quickly too.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast and curls great.  Perfect for my on the go lifestyle.  The clamp isn&#x27;t super strong so I clamp it further up and pull to the ends.</li>
            <li> Wow, I can&#x27;t believe how well this little unit works.  Normally my curls fall out within a couple of hours but they stayed in for two days with this iron.  It&#x27;s so convenient.  We had a 2-1/2 hour drive to a wedding so I curled my hair in the car while my husband drove.  Talk about a time-saver!  It did seem to use up about a quarter of the fuel but my hair is hard to curl so it was probably on longer than for a typical user. It will be well worth the time saved to purchase refills as needed.</li>
            <li> Good unit and fast delivery.  I will keep buying it.</li>
            <li> Was so happy to find this on Amazon.  I love it and use it often - especially when dry camping.</li>
            <li> I travel for my work, and this is the BEST tool to style my hair on the road.&lt;br /&gt;Had one of these many years ago, and liked it then.  Recommend for road warriors or those travelling for pleasure.</li>
            <li> My only problem was I ended up with 2 instead of one....and it could not be returned</li>
            <li> This product is excellent for people on the go.  The only thing I would change is the size of the barrel, to 1 &amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Seems to be built well and I like the brand, but it doesn&#x27;t heat up enough.  Works ok for a quick fix, but will need to look for something else for work.  Was hoping to use this after working out, but really only works for short term or touch ups.</li>
            <li> This little thing is magical. I was very skeptical that it would work, but it gets pretty hot and makes really decent spiral curls in a short time. My work commute is an hour and I can towel dry my hair, add product, let it air dry on the way to work, and when I get to work, do a quick curl in the parking lot in about 5-10 minutes. Curls held all day, too with minimal spray. Was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I love love love this thing,  No more cords.&lt;br /&gt;It is advertised as a traveling curling iron, but I love it for all the time.</li>
            <li> Convenient when traveling</li>
            <li> I had a Braun cordless for years and years that I loved.  It blew out of the car in a snowstorm while traveling and wouldn&#x27;t work again.  This Conair is similar, except I would prefer a 1&amp;#34; one like the Braun.  Almost too small for my hair.  Heats up well and curls.  Also, I can use up my older refills as it takes the same size.  It did not come with a cover as even described on the packaging.  Not sure what is up with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the cordless factor for traveling and just convenience in the bathroom - not having to take up another plug and no hassle with the cord.  Easy to store in drawer, too.  Just wish Braun would bring back their model and the 1&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I had it stored in an overnight bag and when I went to use it, the ON button was depressed and all of the butane had evaporated. Thought maybe I had stored it carelessly, but then it happened a SECOND time, while stored totally flat on a shelf. Either it&#x27;s a design flaw, or just a clever and evil way for Conair to get more money out of you. I recommend removing the butane after each use.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast, fuel lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I bought this on the reviews that it works great on fine hair however it doesnt curl my fine hair at all. It does not heat up enough to curl my fine, straight hair. The bad part is that I cant return it so I am stuck with something that doesnt do the job.&lt;br /&gt;I am dissappointed.</li>
            <li> Was so glad to find it on line.  I needed it for a trip to Europe. Happy traveling for me</li>
            <li> I initially bought this for travel but find that I&#x27;m using it for quick touch ups when you&#x27;re in a hurry.  It heats up quickly and is hotter than my electric curling iron.  Love the convenience.  This is my second Conair cordless &amp; I think they have improved the heating element.  The only downside is, it does not come with a cover for the heating element.  I just used the cover from my old one &amp; it fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> This product meets all my expectations for a curling iron.  It is light and compact.  And it is easily stored when finished.</li>
            <li> I love my Conair cordless curling iron. When I go away, it is packed with me. I have such straight hair, and it does a great job.</li>
            <li> Love it! Works great and so compact and easy to packüëç</li>
            <li> it is powered by propane, a contain flame  is what heats the rod ...what are they kidding.  The description  does not disclose this.  Do add to it is cannot be returned.</li>
            <li> I used the curling iron when we camping.  Worked really well.  Would recommend it for someone who has thin hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this for an overseas trip and I wanted to pack light and not have to worry about plug adapters. I like it so much that I&#x27;m now using it as my regular curling iron. It is a great bargain. It&#x27;s hard to find the cartridges in stores so I have just been getting them on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked this type of butane curling iron for the quick heat and ease of not having a cord. However, this iron is not exactly what I expected. It says great size for travel, but isn&#x27;t the kind that comes apart to fit inside anything. It&#x27;s the same size as any iron. The box it comes in says it comes with a heat shield, but it doesn&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t really travel with my curling iron much, but I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> The barrel is a little small and your hair tends to slip out of the clip around the barrel but, heats up fast and gets the job done. Great for being somewhere without electricity.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this several months. It works well and makes nice little curls that last for me. Travels well. I really wish they made one that is 1inch or 1.5 inch because it really take a while to get curls all over with this size barrel if you have a lot of hair! It&#x27;s not for creating body. It&#x27;s for curls that are a bit tighter than what you need to just create body.</li>
            <li> love  it,love it.  does not burn hair</li>
            <li> I like this product it is portable and needs no electricity. I had one I purchased at local store that had something go wrong after approx. 2 years the thing would not get hot (had full new cartridge). The price is right and it gets HOT quick watch your fingers or little ones too... keep out of reach of those curious small hands. I am very happy with my new purchase. update when I purchased this product in august of 2014 I submitted the above review. I am updating the review as I am disappointed that the same thing that happened to the first one I had has occurred with the one I got back in august I have had the opportunity to have used the product but maybe a dozen times and it will not ignite I guess I can hear the butane releasing and can see the spark but the curler doesn&#x27;t get hot anymore nor does the glow exist looking down inside barrel. I put new cartridge in to see if it may be faulty but same thing happens . I really liked this curler for traveling and did get a few good uses out of it I am going to see if there is warrenty info and if I may be able to get it replaced or fixed.</li>
            <li> Not quite what I expected. Should have bought the Braun.</li>
            <li> It is nice not to have to deal with the cord.</li>
            <li> bought it for my daughter who is in theater and not always around an outlet. she loves it</li>
            <li> Works well except my hair slips. The iron is to smooth to really grab your locks.  The Braun had a much better grip and wish they were still making it because it was far superior to the Conair.</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time, and as advertised. No issues.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned Conair cordless (thermacell) curling irons for over 20 years and they&#x27;ve always worked great! It also came with a plastic cover so you wouldn&#x27;t have to wait for it to cool down to throw it in a bag/purse. I wanted to replace it and purchased this newer version. This particular model does not come with the cover which is important to me. Just check the versions &amp;#34;Conair You Pro Cordless&amp;#34; (no cover) VERSUS &amp;#34;Conair Travel Smart cordless (with cover)&amp;#34;.   Amazon kindly offered me a refund which I&#x27;m grateful for since I&#x27;ve already re-ordered the one with the cover. I find it essential.</li>
            <li> The heat seems about right. For my nearly shoulder length hair, it would be ideal if it were another half inch in diameter and had the detachable brush attachment.</li>
            <li> This seems to get plenty hot enough.  I love the size.  Everything else I looked at was 1&amp;#34; or larger and that&#x27;s too large for bangs.</li>
            <li> This cordless curling iron is great when you don&#x27;t want to use your electric one.  It&#x27;s for quickie touch-ups. I would recommend this product if that&#x27;s all your looking for.</li>
            <li> Service very good and the product is ok....doesn&#x27;t seem to hold a curl in my hair but am keeping it for emergencies.</li>
