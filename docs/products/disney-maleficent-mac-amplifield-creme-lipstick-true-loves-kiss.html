    <ol>
            <li>This is the perfect shade for my skin tone, my hair color, everything.</li>
            <li>AWESOME lipstick.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s amplified with amazing color payoff and the color is to die for!!!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li>Everything was perfect.</li>
            <li>Beautiful!!!</li>
            <li>Great quality and timely delivery.</li>
            <li>Always a great option when items sell out on the website.</li>
            <li>Goes great with my complexion.</li>
            <li>It stays on well throughout the day and looks spectacular with the Longwear Lipglass, although it doesn&#x27;t need to be worn with that!</li>
            <li>THIS is gorgeous.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The lipstick is rich, velvety, and has a wonderful smell of Vanillin that appears on the ingredient declaration, giving it almost a &amp;#34;chocolate&amp;#34; odor that is quite noticeable even when applied to your lips (a bonus for sure).  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this lipstick!</li>
            <li>this color is just as amazing as I thought it would be.....</li>
            <li>The quality of this product is amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame that in my country we don&#x27;t have that kind of services.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li>Got to me fairly quickly and is an amazing MAC product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many reds and this one is by far the best compliment for my skin color.</li>
            <li>Really well pigmented and the color is really beautiful.</li>
            <li>And they are all lovely, but not on me.</li>
            <li>I have never been able to find a shade that works on me.</li>
            <li>If you are unsure, be sure.</li>
            <li>Product sold out on MAC&#x27;s website but was able to order it here.</li>
            <li>My skin tone changes the way pigment looks on me (explanation follows), soooooo this shade of red is simply perfect!</li>
            <li>Lipstick lovely.</li>
            <li>Awesome shade of red!</li>
            <li>Very sweet of the seller to include it..:)</li>
            <li>It is a beautiful red color and looks fantastic on!</li>
            <li>Beautiful shade of red.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and does not bleed.</li>
            <li>£18 customs charge less good!</li>
            <li>If you want to try them, come to my house, I have a drawer full.</li>
            <li>The color is bright and true if a little touch to the orange side, but it is very true to the movie color.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m impressed and will definitely enjoy using it to round out my special effects make-up pallet for Halloween or other costume/</li>
            <li>but it does look nice and stays for long.</li>
            <li>OK ... I cannot wear red lipstick and I have tried them all.</li>
            <li>exactly as described fast shipping</li>
            <li>Came in a cute little pouch with a complimentary &amp;#34;Zoom Lash&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I figured if I am going to do it, to go all the way and use the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I finally decided to go for it and order this to keep in my special effects make-up reserve for putting together a Maleficent complete costume for Halloween.  </li>
            <li>skin tone is a light cinnamon with a little tan and pink-undertoned foundation makes me look like I have rosacea all over my face.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s perhaps a little more than a half a stick of a Revlon type product), but as I intend to only use it for costuming, I could deal with</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Only disappointed because it does not look so similar to Angelina Jolie&#x27;s in the movie, in order to do so you have to buy the lipstick which is kind of an investment</li>
            <li> I debated ordering this for a long time as I don&#x27;t wear a lot of make up, but I do a lot of costume work.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have a single problem.</li>
            <li> And came faster than I expected.</li>
            <li> knew that the price would be high for a rather small amount, which this actual lip stick not a typically full stick of make-up like some lipsticks I have had in the past</li>
            <li> A little bit does go a LONG way with it.  </li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves this product and actually tries to wear it everyday.</li>
            <li> Again, nothing wrong with any of the others, just me.</li>
            <li> Quite expensive, but I can&#x27;t find these colors anywhere else.</li>

            <li> My wife&#x27;s favority Christmas gift.</li>
            <li> OK ... I cannot wear red lipstick and I have tried them all. ALL. OF. THEM. If you want to try them, come to my house, I have a drawer full. And they are all lovely, but not on me. I have never been able to find a shade that works on me. Until this one. This is the perfect shade for my skin tone, my hair color, everything. It just WORKS on me. Again, nothing wrong with any of the others, just me. BUT, this. THIS is gorgeous. It is quality from the packaging to the shade to the cream to the slide (trust me on the this, you WANT to experience how it just g-l-i-d-e-s on) to the way is stays. From the moment I walked into the office, folks were asking what I did different. It was THAT noticeable. AWESOME lipstick. If you are unsure, be sure. This is the lipstick you want to splurge on. THIS. IS. THE. ONE.</li>
            <li> Product sold out on MAC&#x27;s website but was able to order it here. Great quality and timely delivery. Always a great option when items sell out on the website.</li>
            <li> this color is just as amazing as I thought it would be.....I find myself reaching for this lipstick over and over and over......it&#x27;s amplified with amazing color payoff and the color is to die for!!!!!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves this product and actually tries to wear it everyday. I bought it for mothers day and she was ecstatic to recieve it</li>
            <li> Beautiful shade of red. It&#x27;s almost a burnt red. Goes great with my complexion. I&#x27;ve tried many reds and this one is by far the best compliment for my skin color. Goes on smooth and does not bleed.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this shade of red for EVER!!! My skin tone changes the way pigment looks on me (explanation follows), soooooo this shade of red is simply perfect! It complements me just perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;My skin tone is a light cinnamon with a little tan and pink-undertoned foundation makes me look like I have rosacea all over my face. No olive undertones.</li>
            <li> Authentic...AMAZING COLOUR payoff! Came in a cute little pouch with a complimentary &amp;#34;Zoom Lash&amp;#34; MAC Mini mascara.. Very sweet of the seller to include it..:)</li>
            <li> The title of the review says it all.  I debated ordering this for a long time as I don&#x27;t wear a lot of make up, but I do a lot of costume work.  I finally decided to go for it and order this to keep in my special effects make-up reserve for putting together a Maleficent complete costume for Halloween.

The color is concentrated and it does last a very long time when applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m impressed and will definitely enjoy using it to round out my special effects make-up pallet for Halloween or other costume/cos-play events.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy with this purchase! Not only did I get it at a discounted but I got it before the estimated delivery date!</li>
            <li> The quality of this product is amazing. Really well pigmented and the color is really beautiful. Only disappointed because it does not look so similar to Angelina Jolie&#x27;s in the movie, in order to do so you have to buy the lipstick which is kind of an investment but it does look nice and stays for long.</li>
            <li> Definitely not the color that is seen in the picture</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lipstick! It is a beautiful red color and looks fantastic on! It stays on well throughout the day and looks spectacular with the Longwear Lipglass, although it doesn&#x27;t need to be worn with that!
