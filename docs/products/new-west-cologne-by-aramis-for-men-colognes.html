            <li>My favorite cologne!</li>
            <li>My son loves this scent and I was happy to discover it was still available.  </li>
            <li>and he was thrilled.</li>
            <li>but my husband liked it.</li>
            <li>I asked others if they liked mu cologne, they asked me if I was wearing any.</li>
            <li>Perhaps the best classic men&#x27;s cologne from the 80&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Simply my favorite.</li>
            <li>Why would Aramis stop making a product so many people wanted to purchase?  </li>
            <li>I discovered this over 16 years ago, it was given to me as a gift in a sample set and fell in love with it from day one.</li>
            <li>scent is refreshing</li>
            <li>Really good old fashioned perfum!!</li>
            <li>It is a light, not overpowering spray.  </li>
            <li>The bottle has something to do with the scent, the way food presentation is important.  </li>
            <li>Not like the original and what company changes its bottle and logo?  </li>
            <li>When I saw amazon was selling it, I was excited and ordered two bottles.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will buy mine straight from Aramis or from a reputable department store from now on.</li>
            <li>I used New West Perfume for many years.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the \\&quot;new\\&quot; New West (in the clear bottle with silver cap) in a very reputable department store about a year ago.</li>
            <li>My husband really loves this scent!</li>
            <li>I really hope people give it a try!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, I am seeing this kind of review of other fragrances on occasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i have used new west since it came out many years ago in the blue bottle.  </li>
            <li>It made me think that the online store was selling a fake with very good package/bottle copying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>this is the real thing...</li>
            <li>I obtained it from every source that was available; for years I could only get it from one store in Washington, DC.  </li>
            <li>one is the real thing (not the original royal blue bottle though).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>That was when it was packaged and sold in the familiar blue bottle.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to purchase the original blue bottle version of Aramis New West</li>
            <li>Highly recomended..</li>
            <li>I have been using New West for decades...</li>
            <li>I searched and found Aramis New West Skinscent Spray which was $45.00.  </li>
            <li>I have been using New West since it came out in the 80&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I have been a steady user of New West for nearly 15years.</li>
            <li>I, at times, have poured it from the new bottle to the old bottle.  </li>
            <li>The item arrived quickly, the fragrance is as expected.</li>
            <li>The only thing I would mention is that the cologne bottle pictured is different from what I recieved, luckily I already knew that the bottle had changed some time back, but this could confuse some folks.</li>
            <li>this appears to have the same scent but it may not last as long as the original.</li>
            <li>after that I could only find it in the Macy&#x27;s Men&#x27;s Store in San Francisco or New York.</li>
            <li>When Aramis (Estée Lauder) came out with the new &amp;#34;Gentlemen&#x27;s Collection&amp;#34;, New West&#x27;s and other Scents distribution changed.</li>
            <li>Recently, I ordered a bottle of New West through Amazon - and it was very very weak in its fragrance, seemingly more alcohol content than fragrance.</li>
            <li>It was the same fragrance that I had been using for nearly 20 years in the blue bottle.</li>

            <li> I was concerned that it wouldn&#x27;t be the same as the original blue bottle, but alas, I cannot tell the difference.</li>
            <li> sometimes I spend years without finding them... or at least not at a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> you long for this scent...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s the same formula as the old blue bottle...seems a little sweeter ( could be me though), but hence the 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Smells just like I remember it when it was in the little blue bottle.</li>
            <li> but it is getting harder and harder to acquire</li>
            <li> and i find it actively engages when you sweat.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get, you can&#x27;t get it at regular department stores</li>
            <li> A little suspect.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Every time the little bottle is close to the end, I start looking for a replacement... its not easy...</li>
            <li> I know it is hard to smell a scent on yourself.</li>
            <li> It became very hard to find in the stores and I was told it had been discontinued.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it was just terrible smelling</li>
            <li> it did not say &amp;#34;for men&amp;#34; i was very unhappy</li>
            <li> Too bad!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in the Amazon order.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed and feel like I paid for two bottles of nothing but tap water.</li>

            <li> Smells great, like a skinscent should.</li>
            <li> what can you say about a fragrance.  you either like it or  not.  i have used new west since it came out many years ago in the blue bottle.  this appears to have the same scent but it may not last as long as the original.</li>
            <li> Started looking for this again a couple of years ago before &amp;#34;discovering&amp;#34; Amazon and happy to find it! Simply my favorite.

            <li> Really good old fashioned perfum!! from the 80&#x27;s. Highly recomended.. at a really available price!! English style, buy it. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to purchase the original blue bottle version of Aramis New West but it is getting harder and harder to acquire so I had to settle for the &amp;#34;New&amp;#34;  version.</li>
            <li> I purchased the \\&quot;new\\&quot; New West (in the clear bottle with silver cap) in a very reputable department store about a year ago.

            <li> GREAT BUY LOVLY  SCENT</li>

            <li> Seemed like a good buy.  The bottle is different but I knew that going in.  It smells just like what i was used to so Im happy.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Smells just like I remember it when it was in the little blue bottle. Will definitely be buying again.</li>
            <li> Not like the original and what company changes its bottle and logo?  A little suspect.</li>
            <li> My son loves this scent and I was happy to discover it was still available.  I gave it to him for Hanukkah and he was thrilled.</li>
            <li> My favorite cologne! I was concerned that it wouldn&#x27;t be the same as the original blue bottle, but alas, I cannot tell the difference. Will purchase again and again!</li>
            <li> I have been using New West for decades...&lt;br /&gt;Every time the little bottle is close to the end, I start looking for a replacement... its not easy... sometimes I spend years without finding them... or at least not at a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;This one is the real thing (not the original royal blue bottle though).&lt;br /&gt;I you long for this scent... this is the real thing...</li>
            <li> Amazing get compliments all the time! I spay on guest room pillows and everyone loves it!</li>
            <li> I used New West Perfume for many years.  Last year I bought a bottle at about $45/50 dollars through Amazon.  This year the same bottle cost $185.00,so I searched and found Aramis New West Skinscent Spray which was $45.00.  Unfortunately, it was just terrible smelling and so I threw it in the trash.  Why would Aramis stop making a product so many people wanted to purchase?  This was my scent.  Too bad! Now my friends will know I am on the job because I smell like cleaning fluid. I will look for another scent, and I will NOT purchase anything with the Aramis name on it.</li>
            <li> it did not say &amp;#34;for men&amp;#34; i was very unhappy but my husband liked it.</li>
            <li> I have never noticed any difference in the Scent from the beginning.  I, at times, have poured it from the new bottle to the old bottle.  The bottle has something to do with the scent, the way food presentation is important.  I have been using New West since it came out in the 80&#x27;s.  I obtained it from every source that was available; for years I could only get it from one store in Washington, DC.  I was sent there by Aramis.  When Aramis (Estée Lauder) came out with the new &amp;#34;Gentlemen&#x27;s Collection&amp;#34;, New West&#x27;s and other Scents distribution changed. This change allowed the continued distribution; for this, I am grateful.</li>
            <li> I discovered this over 16 years ago, it was given to me as a gift in a sample set and fell in love with it from day one. after that I could only find it in the Macy&#x27;s Men&#x27;s Store in San Francisco or New York. Then they pulled it from inventory and no one else had it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This scent is refreshing and i find it actively engages when you sweat.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with order.</li>
            <li> I have been a steady user of New West for nearly 15years. That was when it was packaged and sold in the familiar blue bottle. It became very hard to find in the stores and I was told it had been discontinued. When I saw amazon was selling it, I was excited and ordered two bottles.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did by buying this product. It has vertually no scent whatsoever, even after you just sprayed it on. I know it is hard to smell a scent on yourself. I asked others if they liked mu cologne, they asked me if I was wearing any. They could not smell anything. I am very disappointed and feel like I paid for two bottles of nothing but tap water. I feel like I have been ripped off. Let me know if you have had the same experience.</li>
