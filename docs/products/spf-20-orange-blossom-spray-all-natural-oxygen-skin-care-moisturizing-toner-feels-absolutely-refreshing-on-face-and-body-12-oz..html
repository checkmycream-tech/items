            <li>After a week or so, I received the spray mist and am even more impressed by the combination of the spray and lotion.</li>
            <li>Good product but cheep botoll</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this stuff and it makes my face feel great.  </li>
            <li>H2o2 was with the lotion, which I found amazing by itself.</li>
            <li>It adds just enough moisture, and the scent is absolutely wonderful.</li>
            <li>I spray it into my hand to be sure to get it where I want it.  </li>
            <li>I love the orange blossom mist.</li>
            <li>I poured it into an extra squirt bottle to use it that way, but I wasn&#x27;t really impressed.</li>
            <li>The two work together to perk up my skin and moisturize even better.</li>
            <li>My skin is kind of reddish and ruddy and it seems to have helped make it less so.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin very supple and smells nice.  </li>
            <li>I like how light this sprays on and the smell is not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Yes, I sound like a commercial, but it&#x27;s THAT good.</li>
            <li>I had to add about 50 drops of sweet orange oil to it to even get close to an orange smell.</li>
            <li>I loved the sprayer in the bottle and i sprayed my entire body after every shower making my body feel fresh and renewed.</li>
            <li>H2o2 very moisturizing and softening leaving my skin smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>This lovely product works and smells fabulous at the same time.  </li>
            <li>Scent is nice but not enough that I would buy again.</li>
            <li>The actual product is pretty nice though.</li>
            <li>This is an ok spray, however I still need someone to spray my back, therefore a lot of hype I feel about the sprayer.  </li>
            <li>I love this product, would definitely buy it again.  </li>
            <li>My first experience with Utopian</li>
            <li>A nice scent, but didn&#x27;t hydrate or make my skin feel anything other than damp.</li>
            <li>I also use this after getting too much sun...</li>
            <li>Its hard to believe how much you get for the $$$- great deal overall!</li>
            <li>Great for those hard to reach places on back.</li>
            <li>Finally a product that does exactly what it says it will do!  </li>
            <li>I felt very refreshed and clean, for those hot summer days when you don&#x27;t want heavy lotion.</li>
            <li>Not only does the spray apparatus not work well as the other reviewers have stated but the product, which had a nice fragrance when I first got it, began to smell rancid after only a month.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps they got a new bottle</li>
            <li>and I got an old bottle?</li>
            <li>Secondly, the spray on the bottle really does not work and one will have to use a different bottle if wanting to keep the product.</li>

            <li> Good product but cheep botoll</li>
            <li> A very pleasant smell. I don&#x27;t use this after every showere, usually every other day. Great smell, shake it up, spray on your body, work it in. I also use the aveeno daily moisturizer. This is a great prodcut.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I&#x27;ve started experience a bit of dryness and I thought this might give my skin a boost. It did not disappoint! It adds just enough moisture, and the scent is absolutely wonderful. I will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to everyone I know!  I keep this in the cooler when i go to the beach...it is wonderful to hydrate your skin.  I also use this after getting too much sun...it keeps the skin healthy and moist!!!  This is also wonderful for your face before bed time...my skin wakes up very happy! :D</li>
            <li> I spray it into my hand to be sure to get it where I want it.  Use it 2x daily.  It leaves my skin very supple and smells nice.  Its hard to believe how much you get for the $$$- great deal overall!</li>
            <li> Finally a product that does exactly what it says it will do!  This product delivers what it promises.  Definitely a must in your daily routine. I love it!!!</li>
            <li> I found Utopian H2o2 very moisturizing and softening leaving my skin smooth and silky. I love the orange blossom mist. I loved the sprayer in the bottle and i sprayed my entire body after every shower making my body feel fresh and renewed.</li>
            <li> This is an ok spray, however I still need someone to spray my back, therefore a lot of hype I feel about the sprayer.  The actual product is pretty nice though.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this. The spray handle quit working the third day. It comes out in clumps. It hadn&#x27;t any orange smell. I had to add about 50 drops of sweet orange oil to it to even get close to an orange smell. I was shocked at how small the bottle really is. Now im going to have to go purchase a 12 oz spray bottle with a nozzle. this is my last order for this junk.</li>
            <li> I cannot contact the seller to ask questions, but this is what I have found. I received this product today and although advertised to have a SPF20, the ingredient list has no sun protector in it (i.e. there is no zinc oxide listed on the bottle). Secondly, the spray on the bottle really does not work and one will have to use a different bottle if wanting to keep the product. I like the other ingredients and so I am very disappointed that the bottle does not work and there appears to be no sun protection in this product. This is an expensive product for the bottle not to work and for a person to have to buy a new bottle. I am going to call Amazon, however I am so disappointed as I like the ingredient list, even though it does not list zinc oxide at all as someone in these reviews suggested. Perhaps they got a new bottle and I got an old bottle? The orange smell is faint and you can smell hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). That doesn&#x27;t bother me. The substance dripping out of the spray bottle and getting everywhere did bother me. Please be careful as this will get on your clothing if your spray bottle is not working either (which I note a serious issue here from other reviewers and I have to agree with them after my experience).</li>
            <li> Not only does the spray apparatus not work well as the other reviewers have stated but the product, which had a nice fragrance when I first got it, began to smell rancid after only a month.  I prefer the Soulful Oasis hydrating toner and will buy that from now on.</li>
            <li> My bottle was broken when it arrived - the trigger had snapped off during shipment. I poured it into an extra squirt bottle to use it that way, but I wasn&#x27;t really impressed. A nice scent, but didn&#x27;t hydrate or make my skin feel anything other than damp.</li>
            <li> Mist gives a boost during the day. Wonderful on your feet at night...not sticky..just moist. Great for those hard to reach places on back.</li>
            <li> I love this product, would definitely buy it again.  I felt very refreshed and clean, for those hot summer days when you don&#x27;t want heavy lotion.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this stuff and it makes my face feel great.  My skin is kind of reddish and ruddy and it seems to have helped make it less so.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> My first experience with Utopian H2o2 was with the lotion, which I found amazing by itself. After a week or so, I received the spray mist and am even more impressed by the combination of the spray and lotion. After I shower I use the spray and let it almost dry and then apply the lotion. The two work together to perk up my skin and moisturize even better. NEVER greasy on the face. After work I use the spray on my face, neck, and arms and look and feel energized. Yes, I sound like a commercial, but it&#x27;s THAT good.</li>
            <li> This lovely product works and smells fabulous at the same time.  I like walking into the mist in the air!</li>
            <li> The sprayer leaks and drips all over the bottle it is entirely unusable! A total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I like how light this sprays on and the smell is not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Does not come as pictured.  Does not spray, it dribbles product all over the bottle.  Scent is nice but not enough that I would buy again.</li>
