            <li>For me it is one of the best dark spot erasers I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>I noticed significant lightening of the darkened areas.  </li>
            <li>So far better than any I have tried.  </li>
            <li>Most older women&#x27;s forearms look very discolored.  </li>
            <li>yeah right.</li>
            <li>Since the dark spots are also underneath the top layers of skin, they take time to move up to the top.  </li>
            <li>First off.</li>
            <li>So far I have been using this product twice a day for 1 full month</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve veen using these Bremenn eraser for a couple weeks now, morning and night, and I haven&#x27;t seen that much difference.</li>
            <li>and it really helped spots lighten or go away</li>
            <li>Absolutely works 100%.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much,</li>
            <li>and it has done absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen much difference.</li>
            <li>It really has gotten ligther.  </li>
            <li>There is a very noticeable difference.  </li>
            <li>but you don&#x27;t get much</li>
            <li>Okay, this is only a week old trial, but based on that</li>
            <li>It works better than other products that I have tried.</li>
            <li>It seems that the general darkening immediately above my top lip is also lightening.</li>
            <li>The dark spot about 1/4 inch above my lip (which I&#x27;ve been covering with liquid cover for more than a year) is pretty much gone.</li>
            <li>I have used it on my hands 2x a day, very lightly as directed (at this rate, it&#x27;s going to last me a long time.)  </li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve not noticed much change in the color of the areas to which I applied it.</li>
            <li>Sun spot over my top lip were completely gone, and a few freckles on my cheek are lighter in color.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product on a sunspot for more than a month now and it hasn&#x27;t even disapeared a little!</li>
            <li>My hand look old!  </li>
            <li>I find getting rid of dark spots is a never ending project and requires an assault from many different treatments...continuously.</li>
            <li>So in hopes of getting my face clear again.</li>
            <li>Though the brown spots haven&#x27;t completely disappeared, they are noticeably lighter.  </li>
            <li>I have not found any difference in my skin condition so far after using it twice a day for almost a month.</li>
            <li>84 years old affect</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t completely go away so far</li>
            <li>The light tan spots are almost gone, and the blotchy red ones are WAY less noticeable.  </li>
            <li>I have used it previously, &amp; it actually does diminish the dark spots significantly.  </li>
            <li>I have benn applying for 5 weeks  a dark spot i have on my right cheeck,.</li>
            <li>When you apply it and rub it in, it doesn&#x27;t dry or mix or whatever , it just stays on the skin , and is very greasy.</li>
            <li>I bought this at Costco on a whim as my general assumption is that none of these creams work.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel I&#x27;ve used this product long enough to really rate it.</li>
            <li>I remain surprised that something actually worked!</li>
            <li>It has done absolutely nothing to the dark pigment on my skin.  </li>
            <li>This product arrived fast but I have dark spots from pregnacy</li>
            <li>and I have even spoken to my Dermatologist who&#x27;s given me an old home remedy and so far so good and so much less expensive!  </li>

            <li> and I have even spoken to my Dermatologist who&#x27;s given me an old home remedy and so far so good and so much less expensive!  </li>
            <li> The only problem is that it is such a small tube and runs out fast because I use it on my arms and face.</li>
            <li> However , the price is little bit high compare with others.</li>

            <li> Some less expensive, some more.  </li>
            <li> The product definitely lightened my dark spots on my hands, but it also was very harsh and after ten third use left very red burn spots that lasted for days.</li>
            <li> It took a very long time using this daily for me to see my dark spots looking lighter.  </li>
            <li> My face has cleared up with this dynamic Dark spot Eraser.</li>
            <li> It is starting to fade my dark spots.</li>
            <li> The problem with dark spots is that with a topical cream like Bremenn is that the improvement is so gradual that you may not notice any change for months.  </li>
            <li> After one month of daily use, sometimes 2XD, just a slight lighten.</li>
            <li> I have being using this product for about 3 weeks only once a day (label recommends twice a day) and I am seeing results that I have not seen with other dark spot removers.  </li>
            <li> THE TUBE IS VERY LIMITED IN ITS CONTENT.  </li>
            <li> There are other products out there that do the same thing and costs a lot less.</li>
            <li> it is empty or I can tell there is no improvement</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S Castor Oil mixed with a few other ingredients.</li>
            <li> I am quite disappointed at the results, expected much better results as advertised. .</li>
            <li> Hassn&#x27;t lightene the dark spots on my face as much as I expected or hoped yet.  </li>

            <li> dark spots of mine have been faded.</li>
            <li> I do not get why, no matter what you pay, no one can help you with dark spots on your face,</li>
            <li> I have a dark spot on my cheek and used this product as recommended, twice a day, for about 2 month now.</li>
            <li> No noticeable fading of dark spots</li>
            <li> My mother gave the dark spot eraser that she bought at Costco.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over 8 weeks and have not noticed any difference in the dark spots on my face.</li>
            <li> I am still using this and one spot I have been concentrating on may b slightly less dark.  </li>
            <li> I am a mixed, white/black woman having serious problems with pigmentation on my cheeks, forehead, and lips.  </li>
            <li> I usually use the Alpha Hydrox brand which it removed all my acne dark scars but did not remove the other unwanted spots.  </li>
            <li> Finally a dark spot remover that works!</li>
            <li> I think they have faded a little bit.</li>
            <li> Prime membership no shipping cost and did not have to waste gas to get it</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have tried quite a few.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for the last 30 days and am seeing a faint reduction of my dark spot on my face.</li>
            <li> Usually takes a few tubes to start noticing some improvement.  </li>
            <li> Have used it for 3 weeks twice a day as directed with very little results.  </li>
            <li> this cream gave me a bad reaction, redness and itching and now this spot is inflamed and very noticeable.</li>
            <li> I am so sorry I waited so long to buy it.</li>
            <li> My spots may have faded some; it&#x27;s honestly hard to say if they have</li>
            <li> Hardly can tell any diference yet.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t expect to ever get rid of them, but at least they are lighter.</li>
            <li> Progress is slow, but a change seems to be happening.  </li>
            <li> I had a very bad acne break out , and it left dark spots.</li>
            <li> Very slow to lighten.</li>
            <li> After approximately 4 weeks, my skin tone was even and the pigmentation had diminished.  </li>
            <li> Second off it made my break out very badly.</li>
            <li> Iwas unable to use it at all.</li>
            <li> Sorry, but it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> unfortunately I saw no difference</li>
            <li> I was wrong!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very expensive.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> No change at all, VERY DISAPPOINTED – save your money and try something else.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m very disappointed .</li>

Why can&#x27;t anyone do what they say they are going to do?</li>
            <li> Saw no lightening at all.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone.  Could the fact I&#x27;m 84 years old affect it&#x27;s performance?</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel I&#x27;ve used this product long enough to really rate it. So far, I&#x27;ve not noticed much change in the color of the areas to which I applied it.</li>

            <li> It took a very long time using this daily for me to see my dark spots looking lighter.  I will continue to use and finish the product and review again after that.</li>
            <li> My face has cleared up with this dynamic Dark spot Eraser. I am so sorry I waited so long to buy it. So I am going to continue using it. Thank you so much,</li>
            <li> So far I have been using this product twice a day for 1 full month and it has done absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t work on me the spots don&#x27;t go away</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen much difference.</li>
            <li> Been using for a year. Very slow to lighten.</li>
            <li> This does seem to lighten the spots. They don&#x27;t completely go away so far but I will keep using it.</li>
            <li> It is starting to fade my dark spots. I will have to use it longer before I do get final results.</li>
            <li> It has done absolutely nothing to the dark pigment on my skin.  Just another product and I have even spoken to my Dermatologist who&#x27;s given me an old home remedy and so far so good and so much less expensive!  IT&#x27;S Castor Oil mixed with a few other ingredients.</li>
            <li> does not work...Don&#x27;t waist your money.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Costco on a whim as my general assumption is that none of these creams work. I was wrong! The dark spot about 1/4 inch above my lip (which I&#x27;ve been covering with liquid cover for more than a year) is pretty much gone. It seems that the general darkening immediately above my top lip is also lightening. I remain surprised that something actually worked!</li>
            <li> I have noticed liver/sun spots have become lighter.  The only problem is that it is such a small tube and runs out fast because I use it on my arms and face.</li>
            <li> My mother gave the dark spot eraser that she bought at Costco. I have benn applying for 5 weeks  a dark spot i have on my right cheeck,. It really has gotten ligther.  I am vety happy with the product!,, Try it it may not work on all spots but it might be that it works on you spot!!</li>
            <li> Hassn&#x27;t lightene the dark spots on my face as much as I expected or hoped yet.  Hardly can tell any diference yet.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over 8 weeks and have not noticed any difference in the dark spots on my face.</li>
            <li> I used this product faithfully and according to directions and didn&#x27;t notice any difference at all.  What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product on a sunspot for more than a month now and it hasn&#x27;t even disapeared a little!</li>
            <li> Okay, this is only a week old trial, but based on that I&#x27;m impressed!  I bought mine also at costco ($39).  I have used it on my hands 2x a day, very lightly as directed (at this rate, it&#x27;s going to last me a long time.)  I am a runner, and I neglected my hands with the sunscreen, so they are covered in patchy red/tan spots.  My hand look old!  I started on Monday evening and this is friday.  There is a very noticeable difference.  The light tan spots are almost gone, and the blotchy red ones are WAY less noticeable.  Now, I haven&#x27;t gone out in the sun since its winter and I wear gloves.  The test will be on vacation, but I&#x27;m hopeful  I have 2 spots on my nose and one on my cheek that I just started using.  It remains to be seen if it will work.</li>
            <li> So far better than any I have tried.  Progress is slow, but a change seems to be happening.  Will be patient and stick with it to see the outcome.</li>
            <li> My mother bought me this product as a gift. I am a mixed, white/black woman having serious problems with pigmentation on my cheeks, forehead, and lips.  After using this product for 3 weeks I noticed significant lightening of the darkened areas.  After approximately 4 weeks, my skin tone was even and the pigmentation had diminished.  I would recommend this product to women with my type of complexion. I am very, very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> I think it works rather well but you don&#x27;t get much and it&#x27;s very expensive. There are other products out there that do the same thing and costs a lot less.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find it at Amazon.  For me it is one of the best dark spot erasers I&#x27;ve tried.  I have tried quite a few.</li>
            <li> The problem with dark spots is that with a topical cream like Bremenn is that the improvement is so gradual that you may not notice any change for months.  Usually takes a few tubes to start noticing some improvement.  Since the dark spots are also underneath the top layers of skin, they take time to move up to the top.  I find getting rid of dark spots is a never ending project and requires an assault from many different treatments...continuously.</li>
            <li> Sorry, but it didn&#x27;t work for me. I used it twice a day and everything was the same.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for the last 30 days and am seeing a faint reduction of my dark spot on my face. I will continue to use the product until the tube is empty and hopefully by that time the spot will be completely gone.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about 3 weeks and,I have not seen any difference yet.</li>
            <li> After three weeks there was no noticeable lightening of the area. I didn&#x27;t expect that the darkness would disappear but there was NO improvement.</li>
            <li> This product arrived fast but I have dark spots from pregnacy unfortunately I saw no difference</li>
            <li> this cream gave me a bad reaction, redness and itching and now this spot is inflamed and very noticeable.</li>
            <li> I had a very bad acne break out , and it left dark spots. So in hopes of getting my face clear again. I bought this product . First off. When you apply it and rub it in, it doesn&#x27;t dry or mix or whatever , it just stays on the skin , and is very greasy. Second off it made my break out very badly. So I&#x27;m very disappointed .</li>
