            <li>Great Mascara, big tube with a triangular top.</li>
            <li>It applies easily.</li>
            <li>have used some high brand mascaras before but this mascara has been one with good product consistency.</li>
            <li>The application is nice and the color is crisp.</li>
            <li>I washed my whole face thrice with water and results were amazing</li>
            <li>It does not clump but blends smoothly on the lashes and makes them stand out.</li>
            <li>I have used hair styling tools from this brand before and was pleasantly surprised by the good quality of make up product I found with them.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, and well worth the extra money to have mascara that does not clump and looks beautiful.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very pleased with it so far.  </li>
            <li>It allows the lashes to become more separated and defined for a more natural look.</li>
            <li>importantly though, this mascara really defines and makes my eyelashes look much more think than the Cover Girl mascara I was using before.</li>
            <li>The reviews are right!</li>
            <li>I absolutely just love this mascara.</li>
            <li>So not bad there.</li>
            <li>I am always looking for a good quality mascara that will help my long lashes to stand up, spread out and look amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The finish is good and long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite.</li>
            <li>The other nice thing is this is waterproof!</li>
            <li>As far as how long it lasts, it did a good 6 hours before I needed to touch up, and I also had to touch up my favorite mascara as well.</li>
            <li>Received free for review, i really like this mascara, makes my lashes like i have some, makes them long, no clumping and no pieces all under my eyes, really reliable you can count on it to work, great product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall it&#x27;s not bad, but it wasn&#x27;t good enough to change me over from my current favorite brand.</li>
            <li>I am absolutely amazed with the results, it glided smoothly without any lump.</li>
            <li>However, I have to say that I do love it so far.</li>
            <li>Was surely worth what you pay for it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read a ton of positive reviews for this product, and they were all 100% right.  </li>
            <li>This product is one of the first that does not clump on my eyes.  </li>
            <li>but this is the first time I have tried there beauty product.</li>
            <li>Two coat was more than enough to give me longer and fuller lashes.</li>
            <li>This was the first time I veered off my drugstore brand.</li>
            <li>It took about 3 coats to equal up to what one coat of my favorite looks like.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried this product</li>
            <li>I had to apply several coats of mascara to be able to see that they mascara was even on my eyes.  </li>
            <li>, that are very full and long, so</li>
            <li>This variety of mascara is the waterproof version and let me say it does really well</li>
            <li>I really like how this mascara separates your lashes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, the Xtava mascara does define the lashes very well.</li>
            <li>When I pulled the wand out of the bottle, it was very flexible and quite a bit of the liquid came out on the wand.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really feel like this mascara &amp;#34;volumized&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>My lashes did not clump together a whole lot.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Xtava is a brand I trust, I do have many other products by them</li>
            <li>I wore this Xtava mascara on one eye, and my favorite mascara on the other to see how well they would match up against each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did not have any eye irritation and usually I am sensitive to eye makeup, I am very pleased overall with the rich color and long lasting waterproof mascara!</li>
            <li>So you know that you are really getting a brand new, unused and untested product.</li>
            <li>I used only one coating of mascara and normally I use two for full coverage,</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>What did clump together, I was able to pull apart before they dried.  </li>
            <li>my lashes persay, but it did make the length of them show up a little more vividly than if I did not have on any mascara at all.  </li>
            <li>It has proven to be very long-lasting and certainly waterproof, as I didn&#x27;t experience any running when I got caught in a sudden rainstorm.</li>
            <li>The mascara stays on all day and you dont have to touch up especially if you curl your eye lashes first.</li>
            <li>I really have high respect for company who does extra things like this.</li>
            <li>The color is a true black, dark and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>you want for complete coverage</li>
            <li>I do not suggest pumping the mascara bottle to avoid drying out the mascara early on.</li>
            <li>I also liked that it made my eyelashes look longer but not too overly dramatic that my eyelashes looked</li>
            <li>This is a high quality mascara that will last all day with no need to reapply.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t gone swimming, but it last all day with normal wear &#x27;n tear.</li>
            <li>Only 1 coat is needed for a dark, full looking set of eyelashes.</li>
            <li>Lately I have been using fiber lashes mascara and going back to a regular mascara made me realize how cleaner and smoother the application is and looks more natural.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this mascara one day so far</li>
            <li>Overall, I think it&#x27;s a decent product, but not sure if I would order again since I have some other mascaras that have more of a plumping/volumizing feature than this one - if that&#x27;s the specific feature you&#x27;re going for.  </li>
            <li>So no more worries about smudging or wearing off quickly.</li>

            <li> The mascara stays on all day and you dont have to touch up especially if you curl your eye lashes first.</li>
            <li> I really have high respect for company who does extra things like this.</li>
            <li> The color is a true black, dark and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> you want for complete coverage</li>
            <li> I do not suggest pumping the mascara bottle to avoid drying out the mascara early on.</li>
            <li> I also liked that it made my eyelashes look longer but not too overly dramatic that my eyelashes looked</li>
            <li> This is a high quality mascara that will last all day with no need to reapply.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t gone swimming, but it last all day with normal wear &#x27;n tear.</li>
            <li> Only 1 coat is needed for a dark, full looking set of eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Lately I have been using fiber lashes mascara and going back to a regular mascara made me realize how cleaner and smoother the application is and looks more natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this mascara one day so far</li>
            <li> Overall, I think it&#x27;s a decent product, but not sure if I would order again since I have some other mascaras that have more of a plumping/volumizing feature than this one - if that&#x27;s the specific feature you&#x27;re going for.  </li>
            <li> So no more worries about smudging or wearing off quickly.</li>
            <li> I wanted to test this product completely so after half an hour</li>
            <li> but I would always get clumps and smudges to try to fix when applying my old mascara and haven&#x27;t had those issues with this one, and the black color matches my lashes</li>
            <li> Cons- not much volume.</li>
            <li> Took less than a minute to dry.</li>
            <li> I am attaching pics of one eye with Xtava mascara and Lakme kajal and other eye without any makeup.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t burn or make my eyes water like other mascara.</li>
            <li> It does separate your lashes as you apply but as the day goes on, if you touch your eyes for what ever reason, the lashes smash together and stick to each other.</li>
            <li> My other mascara isn&#x27;t waterproof, so I couldn&#x27;t compare.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth the $15 price tag.</li>
            <li> when I wear black mascara I tend to look like I have falsies on.  </li>
            <li> This mascara is waterproof, so now I can go swimming without looking like I have two black eyes when I get out of the water!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it lengthens my eyelashes and made it a little thicker without making it look un-natural.</li>
            <li> I was not familiar with this brand of mascara or with the brush that came along with it and had never used them before, I was anxious to give them a try.</li>
            <li> Makes my lashes look dark and thick.</li>
            <li> I put on 2 coats and I had no clumpiness and my lashes even appeared longer than usual.</li>
            <li> No matter what other brand I purchased in the past, no matter how expensive, I was still ending the day with my mascara leaving dark smudges under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> start at the very base, and wiggle the brush back and forth a few times to build up volume, then slowly move the wand up and backwards, to create a curl.</li>
            <li> using this mascara I found that it lasted all day without irritating me, and doesn&#x27;t flake, smudge, or wash off in my pool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It goes on beautifully, no clumping, NO flaking AND NO smudging.</li>
            <li> So very disappointing.</li>
            <li> : ( Very disappointed in this mascara because of the &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; claim.</li>

            <li> I am always looking for a good quality mascara that will help my long lashes to stand up, spread out and look amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Xtava is a brand I trust, I do have many other products by them and I know the quality they put out is outstanding, this mascara held up to my test and worked perfectly for what I was looking for in a mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only did the mascara lift and separate my eye lashes but I also noticed how no clumps or spider lashes produced from this product. I used only one coating of mascara and normally I use two for full coverage, but with this mascara it was not needed. The color is a true black, dark and easy to apply. I did not have any eye irritation and usually I am sensitive to eye makeup, I am very pleased overall with the rich color and long lasting waterproof mascara! Sample provided for evaluation and review.</li>
            <li> Does not smudge or get clumpy! I love it !</li>
            <li> Wow…. I&#x27;ve read a ton of positive reviews for this product, and they were all 100% right.  This product is one of the first that does not clump on my eyes.  It is easy to use, and well worth the extra money to have mascara that does not clump and looks beautiful.</li>
            <li> This is one of the absolute best products I have used. I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks now. It goes on beautifully, no clumping, NO flaking AND NO smudging. No matter what other brand I purchased in the past, no matter how expensive, I was still ending the day with my mascara leaving dark smudges under my eyes. this mascara stays on perfectly and looks fresh all day. I am so happy I took a chance buying this, truly worth it! The reviews are right!</li>
            <li> I was not familiar with this brand of mascara or with the brush that came along with it and had never used them before, I was anxious to give them a try.When I took the mascara out of the box and applied it,it went on very smoothly and the plastic bristled brush that bends anyway you want for complete coverage was surprisingly nice.It allows the lashes to become more separated and defined for a more natural look.This variety of mascara is the waterproof version and let me say it does really well,I put it to the test by splashing my face with water and the mascara didn&#x27;t budge.This is a high quality mascara that will last all day with no need to reapply.&lt;br /&gt;I got this product for purpose of review,all views and claims are 100 percent my own.</li>
            <li> Best mascara ever!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this xtava volumizing mascara. Lately I have been using fiber lashes mascara and going back to a regular mascara made me realize how cleaner and smoother the application is and looks more natural. This mascara came in a really nice packaging. Xtava did great adding a seal on the box to prevent people from using it and then returning. that mascara itself is also wrapped in a plastic wrap. So you know that you are really getting a brand new, unused and untested product. I really have high respect for company who does extra things like this. It means that they put a lot of thoughts into their product and the safety of the people buying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mascara is definitely a good mascara. it lengthens my eyelashes and made it a little thicker without making it look un-natural. I love it and I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*i got this product free for the purpose of testing and giving my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Great Mascara, big tube with a triangular top. The ONLY downside I have to this mascara is that it is not in fact smudge proof, nor waterproof. I have blonde eyelashes, that are very full and long, so when I wear black mascara I tend to look like I have falsies on.  I want a mascara that is going to stay put, and make them look even fuller. This mascara is perfect with that, it&#x27;s a smaller wand making it easier to apply. Only 1 coat is needed for a dark, full looking set of eyelashes. I do love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sample provided</li>
            <li> I have Xtava styling products and I love them but this is the first time I have tried there beauty product.I am absolutely amazed with the results, it glided smoothly without any lump.Took less than a minute to dry.Two coat was more than enough to give me longer and fuller lashes.I am attaching pics of one eye with Xtava mascara and Lakme kajal and other eye without any makeup.I wanted to test this product completely so after half an hour I washed my whole face thrice with water and results were amazing no running mascara not even hint of smudge.This is my new favorite.A must have product for ever women.I got this product for free as promotional sample in exchange of my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Received free for review, i really like this mascara, makes my lashes like i have some, makes them long, no clumping and no pieces all under my eyes, really reliable you can count on it to work, great product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this formula it does not make eyelashes clumpy. The wand is easy to use and appropriate length for my hands. I do not suggest pumping the mascara bottle to avoid drying out the mascara early on. A couple of coats and you are good to go. The mascara stays on all day and you dont have to touch up especially if you curl your eye lashes first. To wipe it off I use some lotion and baby wipes or makeup wipes.&lt;br /&gt;Sample provides without any obligations.</li>
            <li> I received this mascara as a sample for evaluation and review. My eyes seem to get irritated by most mascaras, but I haven&#x27;t had any problems with this brand. I also liked that it made my eyelashes look longer but not too overly dramatic that my eyelashes looked fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I just wanted to mention that this mascara is definitely waterproof and one application will last all day. It&#x27;s my daily mascara and I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I found the mascara to be flaky....I discontinued using it because I always had flakes around my eyes on my face.  Didn&#x27;t like that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this mascara one day so far but I loved it! Goes and smooth and NO flakes throughout the day! Seriously. I&#x27;ve never been able to find a mascara that didn&#x27;t flake after 10 or more hours. Also, it washes off easily! What a dream! :)</li>
            <li> A tad pricey, as I&#x27;m going to be checking out Pacifica soon to compare. However, I have to say that I do love it so far.</li>
            <li> Was surely worth what you pay for it. Will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> (eye on left has 1 coat of the mascara) this mascara is pretty good. haven&#x27;t gone swimming, but it last all day with normal wear &#x27;n tear. doesn&#x27;t burn or make my eyes water like other mascara.</li>
            <li> This mascara did not get clumpy or flaky at all, even through the four applications it took to achieve the desired volumizing effect. It has proven to be very long-lasting and certainly waterproof, as I didn&#x27;t experience any running when I got caught in a sudden rainstorm. I was given the chance to try this out for a one-time promotional discount, and I jumped at the chance! Even if I had paid full price for this product, I would have been absolutely thrilled! The brush, while having short bristles, still kept clumps out of the application process. It lasted well over 12 hours until I had to remove it using coconut oil, my go-to makeup remover.</li>
            <li> Love it! No clumps.  Removing is a breeze.  Will order again.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> So very disappointing. This mascara is not waterproof! A day at the pool and then a weekend of camping was proof enough.: ( Very disappointed in this mascara because of the &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; claim. The tube feels good in your hands, however, that&#x27;s not what I bought it for. It does not &amp;#34;volumize&amp;#34;, as claimed in it&#x27;s name.. It does separate your lashes as you apply but as the day goes on, if you touch your eyes for what ever reason, the lashes smash together and stick to each other. This was the first time I veered off my drugstore brand. I&#x27;m going back to Maybelline!</li>
            <li> It is durable, only one pass you have defined your super-long eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I absolutely just love this mascara. It goes on smoothly, is very easy to apply and defines my lashes without any clumps. I put on 2 coats and I had no clumpiness and my lashes even appeared longer than usual. I really like how this mascara separates your lashes. It glides on nicely and you get an even coat every time. The other nice thing is this is waterproof! So no more worries about smudging or wearing off quickly.This is a very good product, and I plan on using this in the future. **I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

            <li> I have one brand of mascara that seems to work wonderfully for me, and it gives me all the results that I want. I wore this Xtava mascara on one eye, and my favorite mascara on the other to see how well they would match up against each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the Xtava mascara does define the lashes very well. My problem was how many passes and coats I had to apply to get a good color coverage. It took about 3 coats to equal up to what one coat of my favorite looks like. As far as how long it lasts, it did a good 6 hours before I needed to touch up, and I also had to touch up my favorite mascara as well. So not bad there. This mascara didn&#x27;t have any flaking either, so that&#x27;s good. And as far as it holding up against water, it did that great as well. My other mascara isn&#x27;t waterproof, so I couldn&#x27;t compare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s not bad, but it wasn&#x27;t good enough to change me over from my current favorite brand. HOWEVER, if I need a waterproof mascara, I will reach for this one, or recommend it to my family/friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li> I have used hair styling tools from this brand before and was pleasantly surprised by the good quality of make up product I found with them. This is a rather good mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used some high brand mascaras before but this mascara has been one with good product consistency. It does not clump but blends smoothly on the lashes and makes them stand out. The application is nice and the color is crisp. The finish is good and long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sample received at discount or no cost for honest opinion.</li>
            <li> This mascara is okay. Pros- it&#x27;s all day wear. It applies easily. Keeps lashes separated. Cons- not much volume. You have to work/take time to make it look nice.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again. Definitely not worth the $15 price tag.</li>
            <li> Best I&#x27;ve ever tried!</li>
            <li> Received item for free for product review and honest opinion. Love it. Like the color. Makes my lashes look dark and thick. Last all day. Doesn&#x27;t wear off</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried this product and I&#x27;m very pleased with it so far.  This mascara is waterproof, so now I can go swimming without looking like I have two black eyes when I get out of the water!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More importantly though, this mascara really defines and makes my eyelashes look much more think than the Cover Girl mascara I was using before. Not only that, but I would always get clumps and smudges to try to fix when applying my old mascara and haven&#x27;t had those issues with this one, and the black color matches my lashes perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I start at the very base, and wiggle the brush back and forth a few times to build up volume, then slowly move the wand up and backwards, to create a curl. After that I brush my lashes from the top as well so the mascara looks thicker, and then use the tip of the brush pointed vertically to dab some on the the lashes at the outer corners of my eyes and I&#x27;m done. I&#x27;ve been using Jojoba Oil to remove my makeup, so I tried it to remove this mascara and it worked as well as it did for my former mascara so I&#x27;m pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When using this mascara I found that it lasted all day without irritating me, and doesn&#x27;t flake, smudge, or wash off in my pool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Retail sample was provided at no cost for evaluation and review purposes.</li>
            <li> *Disclosure: I received this product free in exchange for my honest opinion.  All opinions expressed are my own.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bottle of XTAVA Define Lashes Volumizing Waterproof Mascara came packaged in a box that has a shiny sticker on both ends, showing that it had not been tampered with before it arrived to me.  I really liked that.  I cut one of the stickers in order to open the box to get to the mascara.  When I pulled the wand out of the bottle, it was very flexible and quite a bit of the liquid came out on the wand.  I had to put the wand back in the bottle to try to get the liquid off of it before applying to my lashes.  I had to do this several times throughout application.  I didn&#x27;t really feel like this mascara &amp;#34;volumized&amp;#34; my lashes persay, but it did make the length of them show up a little more vividly than if I did not have on any mascara at all.  My lashes did not clump together a whole lot.  What did clump together, I was able to pull apart before they dried.  I had to apply several coats of mascara to be able to see that they mascara was even on my eyes.  As the day went on, I hit my lashes several times and the mascara did not come off.  I really liked that about this product.  Overall, I think it&#x27;s a decent product, but not sure if I would order again since I have some other mascaras that have more of a plumping/volumizing feature than this one - if that&#x27;s the specific feature you&#x27;re going for.  If you want a product that makes your lashes look more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;, then this is the one.</li>
