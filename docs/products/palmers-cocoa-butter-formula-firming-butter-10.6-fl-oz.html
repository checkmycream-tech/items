            <li>Great product.</li>

            <li>This lotion also smells awesome, like suntan lotion but better.</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant, but also gives me a headache.</li>
            <li>Smells good, but it doesn&#x27;t do a good job of keeping my skin moisturized...</li>
            <li>I tried Palmer&#x27;s Firming Butter, and I loved it.  </li>
            <li>This is not a miracle lotion, but it smells good.</li>
            <li>but I think works good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m delighted since I&#x27;ve found this one.</li>
            <li>This seems like good stuff.</li>
            <li>Skin feels tighter and smells so good</li>
            <li>Smells good.  </li>
            <li>All pregnant women should put this lotion in their hospital bag for immediate use after birth!!!</li>
            <li>It smells great, goes on well and seems to make my skin more supple.</li>
            <li>This is a very good product and it works very well and smells great.</li>
            <li>Smells phenomenal!</li>
            <li>but my skin looks smoother and feels even better!</li>
            <li>skin much more smoother!</li>
            <li>I love multipurpose items!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>i love this lotion!</li>

            <li>Again, I love it!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>This smells amazing and makes my skin feel so healthy!</li>
            <li>the cream is light with is great ,but i haven&#x27;t seen a difference in my skins</li>
            <li>amazing</li>
            <li>I will say, however, that it smells amazing.</li>
            <li>It rubs into the skin nicely.</li>
            <li>This is nice because if I choose to wear a perfume, the lotion doesn&#x27;t interfere with my choice of scent.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Nice smell goes on well.</li>
            <li>It does have a nice smell</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really good lotion though, and I do use it, I just use the gel oil a lot more.</li>
            <li>Hope it would be effective.</li>
            <li>Nice feel</li>
            <li>but It makes it feel nice and moisturizer</li>
            <li>So far, it has been the best for my face.</li>
            <li>lotion smells so good, just a light scent of cocoa and</li>
            <li>and I feel works better plus smells so nice</li>
            <li>It easily absorbs in my skin!</li>
            <li>From what I&#x27;ve experienced so far, it&#x27;s a good lotion, but not a holy grail product.</li>
            <li>Good products worthy of trust</li>
            <li>I do too,  Great pure chocolate smell.  </li>
            <li>Also, make sure you stay well hydrated and take all your vitamins.    </li>
            <li>It seems to absorb better into the skin too.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just ordered 4 more bottles</li>
            <li>trying product still.it is ok  </li>
            <li>This is great lotion, although I do have to say that since I have tried them both I really do prefer the Palmer&#x27;s Formula Moisturizing Gel Oil (cocoa butter.)</li>
            <li>I love the way my skin feels and smells after applying it, but I love the way my skin feels/smells after applying the gel oil even more.</li>
            <li>My fiance wanted some creak for stretch marks, and this smelled much better than it worked.</li>
            <li>more important,,they didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;update....I ordered more before I ran out.</li>
            <li>I love all the Palmer products.  </li>
            <li>After 2 weeks of using this I saw a visible and quite satisfying difference.</li>
            <li>I love the way it smells.</li>
            <li>but I love how it goes on.</li>
            <li>Looks more slippery.</li>
            <li>I have seen more results in this product, and have tried everything.</li>
            <li>but much more relaxed:</li>
            <li>It smells quite like some sweet which makes me both happy and tortured as I do want some sweet~~~</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>IT LOVE IT,</li>
            <li>Good for a laugh but not something I want to wear out.</li>
            <li>I love this firming lotion.  </li>
            <li>I absolutly love this product.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Also, many are commenting about the chocolate scent.</li>
            <li>Also, many are commenting about the difficulty on finding Palmer&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li>I thought it would smell more like suntan lotion.  </li>
            <li>Love palmers products</li>
            <li>I love this product, I&#x27;ve been using it for a year now</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE the chocolate smell.</li>
            <li>I read reviews all over the internet for all of the top firming lotions and decided this was the one to try.</li>
            <li>I can deal with it no problem if it works. :)</li>
            <li>I love the texture also.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>(atleast for me) because for alil bit more then a month i stopped using it (thinking it would eventually be restocked at babiesrus) and</li>
            <li>Oh my goodness, I love this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t lay on top of my skin.  </li>
            <li>I love this and will order more.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know about the firming part, but it does make me feel better to use it.</li>
            <li>I truly love this product.</li>
            <li>update when/if I start seeing results :)</li>
            <li>I smell like chocolate.  :-)</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t run out :)  </li>
            <li>but my thighs still need more work.</li>
            <li>I will probably keep using it for about a month or so and see if i get better results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure i will though.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend thought it worked pretty good</li>
            <li>In about 2 months, keeping in mind that I put this on three time a day, It firmed up my bottom significantly!  </li>
            <li>In about 2 months, keeping in mind that I put this on three time a day, It firmed up my bottom significantly!</li>
            <li>They have a great scent and leave the skin feeling soft and supple.</li>
            <li>It has a very vanilla cookie kinda smell (like a bakery) which I do not like, otherwise good texture.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other body firming creams and this seems to be the best for the price you&#x27;ll pay.</li>
            <li>The pump makes it easy to use.</li>
            <li>It absorbs very quickly, and is not feel greasy at all</li>
            <li>Just too strongly scented.</li>
            <li>and I see a difference after use,  but the cocoa smell is to strong for me.</li>
            <li>The lotion is fine but the pump broke after 1 pump.</li>
            <li>The lotion goes on smoothly and absorbs easily; it leaves your skin feeling silky.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure this has worked better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about the scent at first, but now I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love the thickness of this and the fact that it absorbs quickly and is not sticky after you put it on.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied and will highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Im a huge fan of palmers cocoa butter lotions,oils,butters and creams</li>
            <li>Nothing great, but I enjoy the smell (don&#x27;t worry, it doesn&#x27;t last, just when you rub it in).</li>
            <li>I love the smile.</li>
            <li>Smooth Silky Skin, Like a Babies Booty</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light moisturizer, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>It goes on nice, blends very well</li>
            <li>That was what we were buying, cheap.  </li>
            <li>Does not make skin firmer or smooth.</li>
            <li>but so far so good.</li>
            <li>I had tried the Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter lotion, but the Firming Butter was far more effective on my stretch marks.  </li>
            <li>I does have a strong, sweet smell</li>
            <li>very useful and works well.</li>
            <li>Palmer&#x27;s has amazing products and they all live up to their expectations!</li>
            <li>SUPER strong smell.</li>
            <li>ORIGINAL REVIEW:  </li>
            <li>I noticed a significant change in my abdomen and backside...</li>
            <li>The original reason I tried Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Formula and now the Firming Butter?   </li>
            <li>Wonderful lotion, and sometimes hard to find.</li>
            <li>I feel my skin has benefited  greatly over the years from it&#x27;s use, as it  looks much younger than my real age!  </li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve been using it, putting it on has become my favorite part of the day because I feel like I&#x27;m really pampering myself.  </li>
            <li>So I ordered one bottle from this buyer to make sure it was real thing.</li>
            <li>moisture and smell sweet</li>
            <li>I just recieved the product and so far it feels nice, but keep in mind that it&#x27;s a cocoa/shea butter formula.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t gotten to see its full effect yet</li>
            <li>It absorbs fast and really helps my dry skin feel great!  </li>
            <li>so I won&#x27;t run out as quickly.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t seen any real firming been using about a month, but, its palmers, the smell is great even if it only prevents dryness</li>
            <li>A person who has lived the good life and traveled the world, needs to count on a product that aids her skin to look as fresh as if she were 15 years younger.  </li>
            <li>I was amazed to see how quickly it worked to help tighten the skin on my belly and reduce the appearance of the stretch marks.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to be pregnant to use these products.</li>
            <li>I was happy to see that it didn&#x27;t have any parabens and compared to other brands I was considering buying the ingredients are far better.  </li>
            <li>I also love the smell of cocoa because it makes me fell I live in Amazon Jungle.</li>
            <li>Only thing I didn&#x27;t love was the smell, smelled like burned chocolate donuts?!?</li>
            <li>/&gt;this is so worth the inexpensive price....</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m not crazy about that.</li>
            <li>It is a fresh way to end your shower, I like that it is not oily.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth trying</li>
            <li>Regardless, I&#x27;d say the product itself is worth the hassle</li>
            <li>I love how soft it makes my skin</li>
            <li>To be honest that&#x27;s enough for me.</li>
            <li>plus side is that my husband loves the smell .. said I smelled like a fresh baked cookie right out of the oven</li>
            <li>I use this product about 6 times a week, always right after a shower.  </li>
            <li>Side note fish at the pond apparently like because last time I went swimming kept getting nipped lol.</li>
            <li>Many years spent in the sun in Hawaii as an airline stewardess  was the reason for the original use of cocoa butter.  </li>
            <li>and I feel my newer red stretch marks are getting better.</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>I enjoy the scent because it is an \\&quot;earthy\\&quot;, natural one;</li>
            <li>use after exfoliating and my skin has gotten SO soft and smooth, beyond my expectations.</li>
            <li>after losing 120# with only diet and exercise I wanted to make sure my skin didn&#x27;t overly sag...</li>
            <li>Works great and is thick and retains moisture and that is what reducing wrinkles and firming is all about.  </li>
            <li>Really works for me!</li>
            <li>However, when i first started using it</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>I have been using it daily and most of my stretch marks are gone.  </li>
            <li>Manufacturer should check pump first.</li>
            <li>It left me smooth but rubbed in pretty quick.</li>
            <li>I notice my skin is so soft and touchable.&lt;br /&gt;Im, excited for the results....</li>
            <li>I ordered this to help with my stretch marks that developed after significant weight loss.  </li>
            <li>However, if you want to use it to make skin super soft - this will do the trick for that.</li>
            <li>The gel oil seems to absorb more quickly and feels as though it leaves my skin much softer and much less greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>Only thing is the strong cocoa smell.  </li>
            <li>Only downside is the strong scent of cocoa.</li>
            <li>I have seen no dramatic results as it is just a lotion.</li>
            <li>non drying and assists in fading certain scars...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always bought this brand because its a brand a really trust.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do much firming</li>
            <li>Leaves skin smooth its only been a week</li>
            <li>I really like this firming lotion.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t gone through the whole bottle yet -</li>
            <li>I even applied before intense cardio workouts.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t notice any real tightening</li>
            <li>plus I really don&#x27;t like the scent.</li>
            <li>Really Really like this stuff.</li>
            <li>I have use Jergens and Nivea and while I do really like the smell of Nivea</li>
            <li>I use it twice a day and really put it on generously.</li>
            <li>Arrived fast and as advertised.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s to soon to tell much.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t really expect that it would, but a girl can dream.</li>
            <li>and i really do believe it works.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It came well packed and the pump unlocked very radially.  </li>
            <li>This pump unlocks very radially.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always bought this brand because its a brand a really trust.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend using this product when you&#x27;re dealing with stretch marks after childbirth!</li>
            <li>so thanks Amazon for carrying it.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing</li>
            <li>and it really does leave my skin feeling smoother and firmer.</li>
            <li>I am using it for last 10 days sometimes once sometimes twice a day ,good one working as expected</li>
            <li>the smell is really not to my liking but others might like it more then the other cocoa butter creams because its very light scented (i like the heavier cocoa butter scented ones).</li>
            <li>It seems to penetrate my skin better and keep it hydrated longer than other lotions-- without making my skin greasy.</li>
            <li>Saw significant difference in skin texture/smoothness/tightness within a short period...</li>
            <li>I am pretty picky with scents and have allergy issues, so I stir clear of chemically, floral, type smells.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without this!</li>
            <li>Got the job done at a decent price.</li>
            <li>Great moisturizer at the least - only problem is that the pump doesn&#x27;t always work on some of the bottles -</li>
            <li>Helps tremendously with the extra skin I have from losing 62 lbs.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It does not leave my skin slick-feeling, only SUPER soft!  </li>
            <li>why i can&#x27;t buy this at a normal retail store though.</li>
            <li>Manufacturer said they would send me a new one which I never received</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m about 4 weeks in, and I believe this lotion kind of works, but the results are definitely subtle.  </li>
            <li>I personally prefer lotions to have very light fresh scents and find the smell of this lotion slightly bothersome, but not bothersome enough to stop using.  </li>
            <li>I will have to wait and see if it does anything for my very old stretch marks.</li>
            <li>This lotion makes my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>Although it smelled wonderful, it made my skin super dry :(</li>
            <li>It got hot outside</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not sure they are safe to use while I&#x27;m breastfeeding.</li>
            <li>I did definitely notice a difference, and would recommend this product to anyone who is patient and willing to wait nearly two months to see noticeable results.  </li>
            <li>I was getting eaten alive by mosquitos and no-see-ums in the early evening but noticed that once I took a shower they would leave me alone while everyone else was getting bit!</li>
            <li>but I did notice a slight difference on the problem area on the back of my legs:)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m assuming I need to give it a little more time to see a big difference.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t actually see any \\&quot;firming\\&quot; results, but I really don&#x27;t care because it makes my skin feel so soft and silky to the touch.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin buttery soft and supple, and gives it a medium-strong cocoa scent.  </li>
            <li>But those who are sensitive to smells need to take note of this.  </li>
            <li>The smell is fantastic, and I think it may be working to firm my skin.  </li>
            <li>That coupled with stretch marks, my tummy was beginning to be the least favorite of my body parts.</li>
            <li>Product came on time, so far it helps tighten my skin.  </li>
            <li>does not firm as well as Nivea does.</li>
            <li>My skin feels amazingly soft...</li>
            <li>So far, I have found it at Walgreen&#x27;s, Target, and Walmart.</li>
            <li>I lost weight and with this lotion my skin is smooth and firm.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this on old scars and stretch mark prone areas.</li>
            <li>This smells similar to chocolate and wasn&#x27;t bothersome or overly intense at all.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t bother my skin, which can be sensitive too.</li>
            <li>they used to have it at the babiesrus near me and before that it had been at walmart...or target</li>
            <li>Then after shower, I put this on - and my skin is so soft.  </li>
            <li>small bottle - kind of smells strange.</li>
            <li>slow but better working.</li>
            <li>I bought this after the birth of my second child to help try and return my belly to normal.  </li>
            <li>Whether or not this lotion actually works at firm up skin is kind of irrelevant to me as it simply makes me feel better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m convinced Palmers products helped keep stretch marks at bay while I was pregnant with twins - now I&#x27;m hoping it will help firm up my skin since they&#x27;ve been delivered.  </li>
            <li>The Nivea isn&#x27;t as thick and doesn&#x27;t smell as strong.  </li>
            <li>One major flaw in the lotion is the pump mechanism.  </li>
            <li>Use a body brush made with natural bristles and brush your entire body before bathing 2.</li>
            <li>Left skin soft but didn&#x27;t work like it was supposed too.</li>
            <li>Not only does it help with sagging skin and wrinkles, but my face is soft and does not break out.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t comment a lot on the firming ability, as I&#x27;ve only used it three or four times so far.</li>
            <li>It let&#x27;s my  skin not only breathe, but  firm quickly.  </li>
            <li>I saw in other reviews that the pump had issues, but assumed it was not being used properly or the lotion was in too short a supply to be sucked into the tube -- until mine stopped working the first week.  </li>
            <li>My stomach does seem more firm, but I&#x27;m not sure if that is the lotion or just time.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Great product.</li>

            <li> This lotion also smells awesome, like suntan lotion but better.</li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant, but also gives me a headache.</li>
            <li> Smells good, but it doesn&#x27;t do a good job of keeping my skin moisturized...</li>
            <li> I tried Palmer&#x27;s Firming Butter, and I loved it.  </li>
            <li> This is not a miracle lotion, but it smells good.</li>
            <li> but I think works good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m delighted since I&#x27;ve found this one.</li>

            <li> Skin feels tighter and smells so good</li>
            <li> Smells good.  </li>
            <li> All pregnant women should put this lotion in their hospital bag for immediate use after birth!!!</li>

            <li> This is a very good product and it works very well and smells great.</li>
            <li> Smells phenomenal!</li>
            <li> but my skin looks smoother and feels even better!</li>
            <li> skin much more smoother!</li>
            <li> I love multipurpose items!</li>

            <li> Again, I love it!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> This smells amazing and makes my skin feel so healthy!</li>
            <li> the cream is light with is great ,but i haven&#x27;t seen a difference in my skins</li>
            <li> amazing</li>
            <li> I will say, however, that it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> It rubs into the skin nicely.</li>
            <li> This is nice because if I choose to wear a perfume, the lotion doesn&#x27;t interfere with my choice of scent.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Nice smell goes on well.</li>
            <li> It does have a nice smell</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good lotion though, and I do use it, I just use the gel oil a lot more.</li>
            <li> Hope it would be effective.</li>
            <li> Nice feel</li>
            <li> but It makes it feel nice and moisturizer</li>
            <li> So far, it has been the best for my face.</li>
            <li> lotion smells so good, just a light scent of cocoa and</li>
            <li> and I feel works better plus smells so nice</li>
            <li> It easily absorbs in my skin!</li>
            <li> From what I&#x27;ve experienced so far, it&#x27;s a good lotion, but not a holy grail product.</li>
            <li> Good products worthy of trust</li>
            <li> I do too,  Great pure chocolate smell.  </li>
            <li> Also, make sure you stay well hydrated and take all your vitamins.    </li>
            <li> It seems to absorb better into the skin too.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just ordered 4 more bottles</li>
            <li> trying product still.it is ok  </li>
            <li> This is great lotion, although I do have to say that since I have tried them both I really do prefer the Palmer&#x27;s Formula Moisturizing Gel Oil (cocoa butter.)</li>
            <li> I love the way my skin feels and smells after applying it, but I love the way my skin feels/smells after applying the gel oil even more.</li>
            <li> My fiance wanted some creak for stretch marks, and this smelled much better than it worked.</li>
            <li> more important,,they didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;update....I ordered more before I ran out.</li>
            <li> I love all the Palmer products.  </li>
            <li> After 2 weeks of using this I saw a visible and quite satisfying difference.</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells.</li>
            <li> but I love how it goes on.</li>
            <li> Looks more slippery.</li>
            <li> I have seen more results in this product, and have tried everything.</li>
            <li> but much more relaxed:</li>
            <li> It smells quite like some sweet which makes me both happy and tortured as I do want some sweet~~~</li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> IT LOVE IT,</li>
            <li> Good for a laugh but not something I want to wear out.</li>
            <li> I love this firming lotion.  </li>
            <li> I absolutly love this product.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Also, many are commenting about the chocolate scent.</li>
            <li> Also, many are commenting about the difficulty on finding Palmer&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> I thought it would smell more like suntan lotion.  </li>
            <li> Love palmers products</li>
            <li> I love this product, I&#x27;ve been using it for a year now</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> and I LOVE the chocolate smell.</li>
            <li> I read reviews all over the internet for all of the top firming lotions and decided this was the one to try.</li>
            <li> I can deal with it no problem if it works. :)</li>
            <li> I love the texture also.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.</li>
            <li> (atleast for me) because for alil bit more then a month i stopped using it (thinking it would eventually be restocked at babiesrus) and</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness, I love this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t lay on top of my skin.  </li>
            <li> I love this and will order more.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about the firming part, but it does make me feel better to use it.</li>
            <li> I truly love this product.</li>
            <li> update when/if I start seeing results :)</li>
            <li> I smell like chocolate.  :-)</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t run out :)  </li>
            <li> but my thighs still need more work.</li>
            <li> I will probably keep using it for about a month or so and see if i get better results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure i will though.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend thought it worked pretty good</li>
            <li> In about 2 months, keeping in mind that I put this on three time a day, It firmed up my bottom significantly!  </li>
            <li> In about 2 months, keeping in mind that I put this on three time a day, It firmed up my bottom significantly!</li>
            <li> They have a great scent and leave the skin feeling soft and supple.</li>
            <li> It has a very vanilla cookie kinda smell (like a bakery) which I do not like, otherwise good texture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other body firming creams and this seems to be the best for the price you&#x27;ll pay.</li>
            <li> The pump makes it easy to use.</li>
            <li> It absorbs very quickly, and is not feel greasy at all</li>
            <li> Just too strongly scented.</li>
            <li> and I see a difference after use,  but the cocoa smell is to strong for me.</li>
            <li> The lotion is fine but the pump broke after 1 pump.</li>
            <li> The lotion goes on smoothly and absorbs easily; it leaves your skin feeling silky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure this has worked better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about the scent at first, but now I love it.  </li>
            <li> I love the thickness of this and the fact that it absorbs quickly and is not sticky after you put it on.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied and will highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Im a huge fan of palmers cocoa butter lotions,oils,butters and creams</li>
            <li> Nothing great, but I enjoy the smell (don&#x27;t worry, it doesn&#x27;t last, just when you rub it in).</li>
            <li> I love the smile.</li>
            <li> Smooth Silky Skin, Like a Babies Booty</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light moisturizer, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It goes on nice, blends very well</li>
            <li> That was what we were buying, cheap.  </li>
            <li> Does not make skin firmer or smooth.</li>
            <li> but so far so good.</li>
            <li> I had tried the Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter lotion, but the Firming Butter was far more effective on my stretch marks.  </li>
            <li> I does have a strong, sweet smell</li>
            <li> very useful and works well.</li>
            <li> Palmer&#x27;s has amazing products and they all live up to their expectations!</li>
            <li> SUPER strong smell.</li>
            <li> ORIGINAL REVIEW:  </li>
            <li> I noticed a significant change in my abdomen and backside...</li>
            <li> The original reason I tried Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Formula and now the Firming Butter?   </li>
            <li> Wonderful lotion, and sometimes hard to find.</li>
            <li> I feel my skin has benefited  greatly over the years from it&#x27;s use, as it  looks much younger than my real age!  </li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using it, putting it on has become my favorite part of the day because I feel like I&#x27;m really pampering myself.  </li>
            <li> So I ordered one bottle from this buyer to make sure it was real thing.</li>
            <li> moisture and smell sweet</li>
            <li> I just recieved the product and so far it feels nice, but keep in mind that it&#x27;s a cocoa/shea butter formula.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t gotten to see its full effect yet</li>
            <li> It absorbs fast and really helps my dry skin feel great!  </li>
            <li> so I won&#x27;t run out as quickly.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any real firming been using about a month, but, its palmers, the smell is great even if it only prevents dryness</li>
            <li> A person who has lived the good life and traveled the world, needs to count on a product that aids her skin to look as fresh as if she were 15 years younger.  </li>
            <li> I was amazed to see how quickly it worked to help tighten the skin on my belly and reduce the appearance of the stretch marks.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to be pregnant to use these products.</li>
            <li> I was happy to see that it didn&#x27;t have any parabens and compared to other brands I was considering buying the ingredients are far better.  </li>
            <li> I also love the smell of cocoa because it makes me fell I live in Amazon Jungle.</li>
            <li> Only thing I didn&#x27;t love was the smell, smelled like burned chocolate donuts?!?</li>
            <li> /&gt;this is so worth the inexpensive price....</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m not crazy about that.</li>
            <li> It is a fresh way to end your shower, I like that it is not oily.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth trying</li>
            <li> Regardless, I&#x27;d say the product itself is worth the hassle</li>
            <li> I love how soft it makes my skin</li>
            <li> To be honest that&#x27;s enough for me.</li>
            <li> plus side is that my husband loves the smell .. said I smelled like a fresh baked cookie right out of the oven</li>
            <li> I use this product about 6 times a week, always right after a shower.  </li>
            <li> Side note fish at the pond apparently like because last time I went swimming kept getting nipped lol.</li>
            <li> Many years spent in the sun in Hawaii as an airline stewardess  was the reason for the original use of cocoa butter.  </li>
            <li> and I feel my newer red stretch marks are getting better.</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> I enjoy the scent because it is an \\&quot;earthy\\&quot;, natural one;</li>
            <li> use after exfoliating and my skin has gotten SO soft and smooth, beyond my expectations.</li>
            <li> after losing 120# with only diet and exercise I wanted to make sure my skin didn&#x27;t overly sag...</li>
            <li> Works great and is thick and retains moisture and that is what reducing wrinkles and firming is all about.  </li>
            <li> Really works for me!</li>
            <li> However, when i first started using it</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> I have been using it daily and most of my stretch marks are gone.  </li>
            <li> Manufacturer should check pump first.</li>
            <li> It left me smooth but rubbed in pretty quick.</li>
            <li> I notice my skin is so soft and touchable.&lt;br /&gt;Im, excited for the results....</li>
            <li> I ordered this to help with my stretch marks that developed after significant weight loss.  </li>
            <li> However, if you want to use it to make skin super soft - this will do the trick for that.</li>
            <li> The gel oil seems to absorb more quickly and feels as though it leaves my skin much softer and much less greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> Only thing is the strong cocoa smell.  </li>
            <li> Only downside is the strong scent of cocoa.</li>
            <li> I have seen no dramatic results as it is just a lotion.</li>
            <li> non drying and assists in fading certain scars...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always bought this brand because its a brand a really trust.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much firming</li>
            <li> Leaves skin smooth its only been a week</li>
            <li> I really like this firming lotion.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t gone through the whole bottle yet -</li>
            <li> I even applied before intense cardio workouts.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t notice any real tightening</li>
            <li> plus I really don&#x27;t like the scent.</li>
            <li> Really Really like this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have use Jergens and Nivea and while I do really like the smell of Nivea</li>
            <li> I use it twice a day and really put it on generously.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast and as advertised.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s to soon to tell much.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t really expect that it would, but a girl can dream.</li>
            <li> and i really do believe it works.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It came well packed and the pump unlocked very radially.  </li>
            <li> This pump unlocks very radially.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always bought this brand because its a brand a really trust.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend using this product when you&#x27;re dealing with stretch marks after childbirth!</li>
            <li> so thanks Amazon for carrying it.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing</li>
            <li> and it really does leave my skin feeling smoother and firmer.</li>
            <li> I am using it for last 10 days sometimes once sometimes twice a day ,good one working as expected</li>
            <li> the smell is really not to my liking but others might like it more then the other cocoa butter creams because its very light scented (i like the heavier cocoa butter scented ones).</li>
            <li> It seems to penetrate my skin better and keep it hydrated longer than other lotions-- without making my skin greasy.</li>
            <li> Saw significant difference in skin texture/smoothness/tightness within a short period...</li>
            <li> I am pretty picky with scents and have allergy issues, so I stir clear of chemically, floral, type smells.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this!</li>
            <li> Got the job done at a decent price.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer at the least - only problem is that the pump doesn&#x27;t always work on some of the bottles -</li>
            <li> Helps tremendously with the extra skin I have from losing 62 lbs.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It does not leave my skin slick-feeling, only SUPER soft!  </li>
            <li> why i can&#x27;t buy this at a normal retail store though.</li>
            <li> Manufacturer said they would send me a new one which I never received</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about 4 weeks in, and I believe this lotion kind of works, but the results are definitely subtle.  </li>
            <li> I personally prefer lotions to have very light fresh scents and find the smell of this lotion slightly bothersome, but not bothersome enough to stop using.  </li>
            <li> I will have to wait and see if it does anything for my very old stretch marks.</li>
            <li> This lotion makes my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> Although it smelled wonderful, it made my skin super dry :(</li>
            <li> It got hot outside</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure they are safe to use while I&#x27;m breastfeeding.</li>
            <li> I did definitely notice a difference, and would recommend this product to anyone who is patient and willing to wait nearly two months to see noticeable results.  </li>
            <li> I was getting eaten alive by mosquitos and no-see-ums in the early evening but noticed that once I took a shower they would leave me alone while everyone else was getting bit!</li>
            <li> but I did notice a slight difference on the problem area on the back of my legs:)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m assuming I need to give it a little more time to see a big difference.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t actually see any \\&quot;firming\\&quot; results, but I really don&#x27;t care because it makes my skin feel so soft and silky to the touch.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin buttery soft and supple, and gives it a medium-strong cocoa scent.  </li>
            <li> But those who are sensitive to smells need to take note of this.  </li>
            <li> The smell is fantastic, and I think it may be working to firm my skin.  </li>
            <li> That coupled with stretch marks, my tummy was beginning to be the least favorite of my body parts.</li>
            <li> Product came on time, so far it helps tighten my skin.  </li>
            <li> does not firm as well as Nivea does.</li>
            <li> My skin feels amazingly soft...</li>
            <li> So far, I have found it at Walgreen&#x27;s, Target, and Walmart.</li>
            <li> I lost weight and with this lotion my skin is smooth and firm.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this on old scars and stretch mark prone areas.</li>
            <li> This smells similar to chocolate and wasn&#x27;t bothersome or overly intense at all.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t bother my skin, which can be sensitive too.</li>
            <li> they used to have it at the babiesrus near me and before that it had been at walmart...or target</li>
            <li> Then after shower, I put this on - and my skin is so soft.  </li>
            <li> small bottle - kind of smells strange.</li>
            <li> slow but better working.</li>
            <li> I bought this after the birth of my second child to help try and return my belly to normal.  </li>
            <li> Whether or not this lotion actually works at firm up skin is kind of irrelevant to me as it simply makes me feel better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m convinced Palmers products helped keep stretch marks at bay while I was pregnant with twins - now I&#x27;m hoping it will help firm up my skin since they&#x27;ve been delivered.  </li>
            <li> The Nivea isn&#x27;t as thick and doesn&#x27;t smell as strong.  </li>
            <li> One major flaw in the lotion is the pump mechanism.  </li>
            <li> Use a body brush made with natural bristles and brush your entire body before bathing 2.</li>
            <li> Left skin soft but didn&#x27;t work like it was supposed too.</li>
            <li> Not only does it help with sagging skin and wrinkles, but my face is soft and does not break out.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t comment a lot on the firming ability, as I&#x27;ve only used it three or four times so far.</li>
            <li> It let&#x27;s my  skin not only breathe, but  firm quickly.  </li>
            <li> I saw in other reviews that the pump had issues, but assumed it was not being used properly or the lotion was in too short a supply to be sucked into the tube -- until mine stopped working the first week.  </li>
            <li> My stomach does seem more firm, but I&#x27;m not sure if that is the lotion or just time.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know how long it will last for me, but I do recommend this lotion for that after-shower application</li>
            <li> For a heck of a long time, I was looking for a proper body lotion for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty thick and stays on well.</li>
            <li> As a new mother I&#x27;m eager to firm my belly which is as flat as before</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super confused</li>
            <li> After a few minutes, I can barely smell it, only a slight hint of what I consider a natural, skin smell.  </li>
            <li> the smell doesn&#x27;t stay long.  </li>
            <li> I will be using this cream for a long time.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s minor though.</li>
            <li> I definitely notice results though, unlike some other lotions.</li>
            <li> It works on dry skin.</li>
            <li> I still have a way to go and with it being winter and dry</li>
            <li> but I think it actually has starting helping my flab under my arms firm up already.</li>
            <li> Product is great, but the pump doesn&#x27;t work, which is annoying, messy, and time consuming.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife during her pregnancy and now that our baby&#x27;s born i can tell she does not have a single stretch mark in her tummy, this lotion worked miracles on her.</li>
            <li> This can solve the problem of loose skin around my waist.</li>
            <li> They both do about the same thing, which isn&#x27;t much, but at least I&#x27;m paying less now!</li>
            <li> I am not really noticing firming yet, but I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> Not sure how well it is actually firming</li>
            <li> a i put it on as other firming creams and lotions do</li>
            <li> I am not sure if the lotion is the culprit, but I haven&#x27;t changed or added anything to my daily routine (except this lotion).</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t see any firming vs. other lotions.</li>
            <li> I tried other more pricier products with a weird texture and didn&#x27;t absorb easily if at all...and nasty masked fragrances....</li>
            <li> It certainly hasn&#x27;t made me any flabbier, nor has it made what stretch marks I do have appear any worse!</li>
            <li> But I have noticed a little improvement, although that is expected to happen overtime after having a baby.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this product to work, but sadly, I can&#x27;t continue using with results like this.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the pump.</li>
            <li> You can shake it and slam it down on the counter, but nothing pumps out.</li>
            <li> I hope it works , it moisturizes, but not sure if It firms as it says , I tried it on my face it made it dry</li>
            <li> When you get about half way down, it stops pumping like it should.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult for me to use it 3 times a day with my busy schedule, so I never really saw any results.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a difference with respect to some wrinkles and slightly sagging skin.</li>
            <li> Not at all greasy, and not one that you have to sit there trying to soak in half the day.</li>
            <li> The remaining ones are much less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> so its like im asking for a miracle cream i just thought it would feel tight as soon</li>
            <li> I usually like to use my fragranced lotion but now can use it more sparingly when using this lotion as a base.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a little over a week now.</li>
            <li> I suppose it helps to firm my skin a little bit, so I will buy the product again.</li>
            <li> I fully support this company hands down!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick and after using it a couple of weeks, I bought a second one</li>
            <li> However, I am concerned with the parabens in it, so I&#x27;m taking a break from it for a few weeks to see if my mid-cycle breast tenderness goes away.  </li>
            <li> and it does firm my skin</li>
            <li> , i know others says it doesn&#x27;t but after a month, i did notice it firm</li>
            <li> Just to name a few.</li>
            <li> Quite a few reviewers praised the smell, which is one of the reasons I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> I am also using it on my baby belly, thighs and butt to firm everything up after losing 40 lbs.</li>
            <li> I will update in a few weeks to tell you guys how it is working.</li>
            <li> It does seem to firm things up.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to everyone whether they are looking to avoid stretch marks during pregnancy, help heal newer stretch marks, firm loosened skin after having baby, or just moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few months to help tighten up my Stomache after having my daughter.</li>
            <li> Too much trouble to return.</li>
            <li> I used the meat becomes very tight waist.</li>
            <li> Not sure what the issue is, but it doesn&#x27;t appear fixable.  </li>
            <li> ; however, after about 3-4 days of applying it to my bust, my skin became itchy and I got small pimples all over the exposed area.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is making my skin firmer</li>
            <li> Somewhat expensive relative to the oz.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this product works well on firming or not, I just bought it.</li>
            <li> Now that it&#x27;s cold again i am using it just to have the extra nutrients.</li>
            <li> It works it&#x27;s just slow</li>
            <li> I assume this is because the lotion is so thick??</li>
            <li> and I see small results!</li>
            <li> firmness.i mean im</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on Nerium or any of those expensive creams.</li>
            <li> I was using the firming cream from Nerium, and since I didn&#x27;t see any noticeable improvement with that expensive product after using four or five tubes of it, I thought I would try something less expensive.</li>
            <li> The bottle was broken when we got it.</li>
            <li> But alas it did not after using for 3 months...</li>
            <li> Disnt work at all used it for two moths and no results, the stretch marks got worse.</li>
            <li> Noticeable results, but nothing dramatic.</li>
            <li> and I may be crazy</li>
            <li> Smell isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> Sometimes on some bottles I have to twist and get frustrated  with h the bottle.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Slightly annoying.  </li>
            <li> Smelled very bad</li>
            <li> VERY ANNOYING</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My wife loves the product!</li>
            <li> UPDATE: I used this lotion daily for about 7 weeks until I ran out.  I did definitely notice a difference, and would recommend this product to anyone who is patient and willing to wait nearly two months to see noticeable results.  I recommend a three-step process for those who want results faster: 1. Use a body brush made with natural bristles and brush your entire body before bathing 2. Take a shower with a moisturizing body wash 3. Use this lotion immediately after showering.  Also, make sure you stay well hydrated and take all your vitamins.    I&#x27;ve since switched to the Nivea firming lotion, which I personally prefer over this one.  The Nivea isn&#x27;t as thick and doesn&#x27;t smell as strong.  It seems to absorb better into the skin too.  I still like this cocoa butter, but between the two, I think I&#x27;ll continue with the Nivea.  ORIGINAL REVIEW:  I&#x27;m about 4 weeks in, and I believe this lotion kind of works, but the results are definitely subtle.  I use this product about 6 times a week, always right after a shower.  It makes my skin buttery soft and supple, and gives it a medium-strong cocoa scent.  I personally prefer lotions to have very light fresh scents and find the smell of this lotion slightly bothersome, but not bothersome enough to stop using.  But those who are sensitive to smells need to take note of this.  One major flaw in the lotion is the pump mechanism.  I saw in other reviews that the pump had issues, but assumed it was not being used properly or the lotion was in too short a supply to be sucked into the tube -- until mine stopped working the first week.  Not sure what the issue is, but it doesn&#x27;t appear fixable.  I can still use the lotion, but I have to remove the pump nozzle and bang the lotion out on my palm.  Slightly annoying.  I will continue to use this product until I run out, then I will update this post to report results.  From what I&#x27;ve experienced so far, it&#x27;s a good lotion, but not a holy grail product.</li>
            <li> The lotion is fine but the pump broke after 1 pump. VERY ANNOYING</li>
            <li> This smells amazing and makes my skin feel so healthy! I would recommend this product to anyone :)</li>
            <li> Smells phenomenal! Not sure how well it is actually firming but my skin looks smoother and feels even better!</li>
            <li> great lotion, will be my go to product from now on</li>
            <li> You can definitely smell the cocoa butter. My boyfriend loves it on me. It rubs into the skin nicely. I accidentally bought this firming butter instead of the stretch mark one because it was cheaper. I have only been using it for about a week and I feel my newer red stretch marks are getting better. I will have to wait and see if it does anything for my very old stretch marks.</li>
            <li> It works it&#x27;s just slow</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always bought this brand because its a brand a really trust. It really works! Around the time that I ordered this I&#x27;ve lost a lot of weight. This helped solve that problem! In about 2 months, keeping in mind that I put this on three time a day, It firmed up my bottom significantly!  I also use it for my face, arms and belly.</li>
            <li> Got the job done at a decent price.</li>
            <li> This lotion is the ONE!  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now.  I can&#x27;t actually see any \\&quot;firming\\&quot; results, but I really don&#x27;t care because it makes my skin feel so soft and silky to the touch.  I enjoy the scent because it is an \\&quot;earthy\\&quot;, natural one; not perfume-like or fruity/flowery.  After a few minutes, I can barely smell it, only a slight hint of what I consider a natural, skin smell.  This is nice because if I choose to wear a perfume, the lotion doesn&#x27;t interfere with my choice of scent.&lt;br /&gt;This lotion also is non-greasy.  It does not leave my skin slick-feeling, only SUPER soft!  Since I&#x27;ve been using it, putting it on has become my favorite part of the day because I feel like I&#x27;m really pampering myself.  I&#x27;ve just ordered 4 more bottles so I won&#x27;t run out as quickly.  Hope it is as great an experience for someone else too!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any real firming been using about a month, but, its palmers, the smell is great even if it only prevents dryness</li>
            <li> slow but better working.I am using it for last 10 days sometimes once sometimes twice a day ,good one working as expected and moreover best for this price range</li>
            <li> It got this because i heard it would help with stretch marks after pregnancy. It&#x27;s pretty thick and stays on well. It got hot outside and i didn&#x27;t want to have it on my skin and got preoccupied with baby activities. Now that it&#x27;s cold again i am using it just to have the extra nutrients.</li>
            <li> Nice smell goes on well. Didn&#x27;t do much firming</li>
            <li> trying product still.it is ok  so fair.like  this product line.</li>
            <li> I can never find this in stores. Probably because it works! So I ordered one bottle from this buyer to make sure it was real thing. It totally is! I am going to order several in next shipment. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It does have a nice smell and I like the texture; however, after about 3-4 days of applying it to my bust, my skin became itchy and I got small pimples all over the exposed area. I really wanted this product to work, but sadly, I can&#x27;t continue using with results like this.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife during her pregnancy and now that our baby&#x27;s born i can tell she does not have a single stretch mark in her tummy, this lotion worked miracles on her.</li>
            <li> Great price, good stuff</li>
            <li> skin much more smoother! stretch marks not gone but skin is tighter</li>
            <li> use after exfoliating and my skin has gotten SO soft and smooth, beyond my expectations. Only thing I didn&#x27;t love was the smell, smelled like burned chocolate donuts?!?</li>
            <li> Smells good, but it doesn&#x27;t do a good job of keeping my skin moisturized... so if you&#x27;re looking for just firming, I would go ahead &amp; try this out. But if you want a lotion as well, this isn&#x27;t the product for you.</li>
            <li> Noticeable results, but nothing dramatic. This isn&#x27;t a miracle cream but nothing is! I definitely notice results though, unlike some other lotions. Plus, it smells great!</li>
            <li> Started using it with a waist trainer and plastic wrap works amazing! Leaves skin smooth its only been a week and I see small results!</li>
            <li> very useful and works well. smells great too</li>
            <li> This is great lotion, although I do have to say that since I have tried them both I really do prefer the Palmer&#x27;s Formula Moisturizing Gel Oil (cocoa butter.) The gel oil seems to absorb more quickly and feels as though it leaves my skin much softer and much less greasy feeling. Not that this leaves my skin greasy, it doesn&#x27;t, but it seems like it takes longer to absorb than the gel oil does. It&#x27;s really good lotion though, and I do use it, I just use the gel oil a lot more. This lotion also smells awesome, like suntan lotion but better. I don&#x27;t know if it has made my skin any firmer and I can&#x27;t tell if it has reduced the appearance of my stretch marks, but since those are not the reasons I purchased it to begin with that&#x27;s not a problem for me. It certainly hasn&#x27;t made me any flabbier, nor has it made what stretch marks I do have appear any worse! I love the way my skin feels and smells after applying it, but I love the way my skin feels/smells after applying the gel oil even more. Must be a personal preference type thing.</li>
            <li> Got on time. But have to wait until I see the results.</li>
            <li> I love the smile. My dogs often lick wherever I rubbed it in unless I tell them no. Great, and I hope to see results soon.</li>
            <li> The bottle was broken when we got it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and it has made a difference with my stretch marks,but what I found even better was that the no-see-ums seem to hate it! I was getting eaten alive by mosquitos and no-see-ums in the early evening but noticed that once I took a shower they would leave me alone while everyone else was getting bit! the only thing I could think of was that I put this lotion on, so I tried it before my shower and low and behold NO BUG BITES!!!! I love multipurpose items!</li>
            <li> Im a huge fan of palmers cocoa butter lotions,oils,butters and creams so when i saw this one that added FIRMING i was sold !!! the cream is light with is great ,but i haven&#x27;t seen a difference in my skins firmness.i mean im only 22 and i only weight 125 so its like im asking for a miracle cream i just thought it would feel tight as soon a i put it on as other firming creams and lotions do but this one doesn&#x27;t. the smell is really not to my liking but others might like it more then the other cocoa butter creams because its very light scented (i like the heavier cocoa butter scented ones). another not soo great thing ..it doesn&#x27;t moisturize as well as palmer&#x27;s products are known to do. i don&#x27;t recommend buying this product go with the regular palmer&#x27;s cocoa butter cream &amp; the oil they are amazing !!!</li>
            <li> This caused me to break out in a red itchy rash everywhere I used it. I used 2x a day for several days and didn&#x27;t notice anything but the rash.</li>
            <li> I really like this firming lotion.  The smell is fantastic, and I think it may be working to firm my skin.  However, I am concerned with the parabens in it, so I&#x27;m taking a break from it for a few weeks to see if my mid-cycle breast tenderness goes away.  I am not sure if the lotion is the culprit, but I haven&#x27;t changed or added anything to my daily routine (except this lotion).</li>
            <li> My fiance wanted some creak for stretch marks, and this smelled much better than it worked. It is product #3, so well see what the next has in line. If a moisturizing candy scented lotion is what your looking for look no further!</li>
            <li> Great price for the size!</li>
            <li> I hope it works , it moisturizes, but not sure if It firms as it says , I tried it on my face it made it dry</li>
            <li> I just started using this product ....two days now....it has a wonderful scent...the pump works perfectly. this cream absorbs in the skin quickly,,,,which is perfect. I notice my skin is so soft and touchable.&lt;br /&gt;Im, excited for the results....for I would keep buying this cream.&lt;br /&gt;this is so worth the inexpensive price....I tried other more pricier products with a weird texture and didn&#x27;t absorb easily if at all...and nasty masked fragrances....more important,,they didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update....I ordered more before I ran out. I noticed a significant change in my abdomen and backside...after losing 120# with only diet and exercise I wanted to make sure my skin didn&#x27;t overly sag...and it has helped a great deal...thank you Palmers and Amazon!!</li>
            <li> Smell isn&#x27;t bad. It smells like chocolate. But I&#x27;m not crazy about that. It&#x27;s difficult for me to use it 3 times a day with my busy schedule, so I never really saw any results.</li>
            <li> I love all the Palmer products.  They are great for moisture and skin hydration.  They have a great scent and leave the skin feeling soft and supple.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had 2 c sections and they have created a permanent kangaroo pouch. That coupled with stretch marks, my tummy was beginning to be the least favorite of my body parts. After 2 weeks of using this I saw a visible and quite satisfying difference.</li>
            <li> Tom&#x27;s wife here- the cocoa smell was so overpowering. I used this once and never again. Just too strongly scented.</li>
            <li> Although it smelled wonderful, it made my skin super dry :(</li>
            <li> Left skin soft but didn&#x27;t work like it was supposed too.</li>
            <li> Great product. Just what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells. Not sure if it is making my skin firmer but I love how it goes on.</li>
            <li> This stuff works especially if your waist training!!!!!! No joke I&#x27;ve noticed a difference I should&#x27;ve took before and after pictures:/</li>
            <li> This can solve the problem of loose skin around my waist. I used the meat becomes very tight waist. Looks more slippery. I will continue to use</li>
            <li> Somewhat expensive relative to the oz. received - bottle was smaller than I thought it would be. But the lotion itself smells great, feels great, and I don&#x27;t experience any of that after-oily residue on my hands or skin after applying. I haven&#x27;t gone through the whole bottle yet - so I don&#x27;t know how long it will last for me, but I do recommend this lotion for that after-shower application</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on Nerium or any of those expensive creams. I have seen more results in this product, and have tried everything. Very satisfied and will highly recommend.</li>
            <li> As a new mother I&#x27;m eager to firm my belly which is as flat as before but much more relaxed:( I want to use those firming cream which I used before my maternity but I&#x27;m not sure they are safe to use while I&#x27;m breastfeeding. As this product series seems to be provided for maternity I choose it. It smells quite like some sweet which makes me both happy and tortured as I do want some sweet~~~ Hope it would be effective.</li>
            <li> Used daily and did nothing but make the dog want to kick me because I smelled like chocolate</li>
            <li> LOVE IT LOVE IT, amazing and it does firm my skin, i know others says it doesn&#x27;t but after a month, i did notice it firm I use it every morning every night, so maybe this might be why</li>
            <li> SUPER strong smell. Can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s working or not but I am using it. I just smell like tootsie rolls all the time lol.</li>
            <li> Works great and is thick and retains moisture and that is what reducing wrinkles and firming is all about.  Only thing is the strong cocoa smell.  I don&#x27;t mind it but I was some place and someone said, I smell cookies...I told them it was me and my cocoa butter.  Good for a laugh but not something I want to wear out.</li>
            <li> Nice feel and I see a difference after use,  but the cocoa smell is to strong for me.</li>
            <li> Really works for me! One key thing.. Don&#x27;t just slap it on! Take the time to massage it into the area you&#x27;re working on (my thighs for example!) after a shower!</li>
            <li> Product came on time, so far it helps tighten my skin.  One thing I forgot is - it&#x27;s Cocoa butter, so it has a smell of chocolate/cocoa.&lt;br /&gt;So, I cannot use it during the day/in the morning, because when people hug me they&#x27;ll say &amp;#34;you smell like chocolate&amp;#34;.  They won&#x27;t smell it if you stand 5 feet away.  I can only use this at night and have to get another brand for morning/daily use</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the smell and I can&#x27;t see any firming vs. other lotions.</li>
            <li> It has a very vanilla cookie kinda smell (like a bakery) which I do not like, otherwise good texture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m convinced Palmers products helped keep stretch marks at bay while I was pregnant with twins - now I&#x27;m hoping it will help firm up my skin since they&#x27;ve been delivered.  Great moisturizer at the least - only problem is that the pump doesn&#x27;t always work on some of the bottles - I end up having to squeeze it out.</li>
            <li> Have only been using this for a week but so far so good. The lotion goes on smoothly and absorbs easily; it leaves your skin feeling silky. I would give this product 5 stars but I do not like the scent.</li>
            <li> I love this firming lotion.  Helps tremendously with the extra skin I have from losing 62 lbs.  Only problem if you stop using the firmness goes away.  Helps with stretch marks too and with itchy skin.  Side note fish at the pond apparently like because last time I went swimming kept getting nipped lol.</li>
            <li> it smells like chocolate</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Helps with cellulite!</li>
            <li> I absolutly love this product. Works amazing! Smells great. Keeps me moisturized for hours. I am not really noticing firming yet, but I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> I have been using this once a day for 2 weeks now and notice a big difference.  I was happy to see that it didn&#x27;t have any parabens and compared to other brands I was considering buying the ingredients are far better.  I wish it was unscented though.  It&#x27;s not overpowering but smells like chocolate.</li>
            <li> does not firm as well as Nivea does. However, if you want to use it to make skin super soft - this will do the trick for that. My skin feels amazingly soft... but since I did buy it for firming I give 3 stars. I can not see any chance of this firming anything. I guess that is why it is cheaper than the Nivea - I should have known. Never try to cut cost when you find something that works. I will continue on with Nivea for firming (tummy, thighs, buttocks, and breasts) during the remainder of my weight loss journey but use this for softness (hands, arms, shoulders, legs)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using on my face and I absolutely love it. I have noticed a difference with respect to some wrinkles and slightly sagging skin. So far, it has been the best for my face. Not only does it help with sagging skin and wrinkles, but my face is soft and does not break out. I recommend this product even if it&#x27;s just to try it. Also, many are commenting about the chocolate scent. It&#x27;s Cocoa Butter. Also, many are commenting about the difficulty on finding Palmer&#x27;s products. So far, I have found it at Walgreen&#x27;s, Target, and Walmart. Just to name a few. I hope this review helps someone decide to try Palmer&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Smooth Silky Skin, Like a Babies Booty</li>
            <li> I bought this after the birth of my second child to help try and return my belly to normal.  My stomach does seem more firm, but I&#x27;m not sure if that is the lotion or just time.  Quite a few reviewers praised the smell, which is one of the reasons I decided to give it a try.  Personally I&#x27;m not too fond of the smell.  I guess it is the shea butter.  I thought it would smell more like suntan lotion.  It isn&#x27;t offensive, just not my preference.  I think I should have searched it out at a drug store to smell before buying.</li>
            <li> I have used Palmer&#x27;s cocoa butter formula  on my skin for years....now I have purchased  Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Formula Firming Butter in the 10.6 fl oz size,  and it is  excellent as well.  It let&#x27;s my  skin not only breathe, but  firm quickly.  A person who has lived the good life and traveled the world, needs to count on a product that aids her skin to look as fresh as if she were 15 years younger.  Many years spent in the sun in Hawaii as an airline stewardess  was the reason for the original use of cocoa butter.  I feel my skin has benefited  greatly over the years from it&#x27;s use, as it  looks much younger than my real age!  The original reason I tried Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Formula and now the Firming Butter?   Because my mother&#x27;s maiden name is Palmer!  How could I resist.  I tried Palmer&#x27;s Firming Butter, and I loved it.  I am never without it.   As I now reside in sunny Mexico, I will never be without Palmer,s.   I will always use  both Palmer&#x27;s products and recommend them to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> small bottle - kind of smells strange.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this since my last pregnancy and it has helped a ton on my face and neck! I also noticed a lot on my arms and some on my stomach, I recommend this to everyone after pregnancy or needing help with extra skin while loosing weight.</li>
            <li> It is a fresh way to end your shower, I like that it is not oily. I use it daily.</li>
            <li> Pump didn&#x27;t work. Manufacturer said they would send me a new one which I never received</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Fades stretch marks and tightens skin. I willys continue to order and use this product regularly.</li>
            <li> The product is so wonderful.I also love the smell of cocoa because it makes me fell I live in Amazon Jungle.</li>
            <li> One bottle didn&#x27;t even last me 3 weeks . I used twice daily one to two pumps per section ie 1 pump per leg..  I am 5&#x27;6&amp;#34; 124 lbs so I&#x27;m not a very big person either.&lt;br /&gt;I did not notice any firming of my skin and I still have my stretch marks .. no fading either. I even applied before intense cardio workouts.&lt;br /&gt;It also broke my chest out in a red itchy rash. I stopped using it on my chest and the rash went away. ..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plus side is that my husband loves the smell .. said I smelled like a fresh baked cookie right out of the oven LOL</li>
            <li> Love palmers products</li>
            <li> This is not a miracle lotion, but it smells good. I suppose it helps to firm my skin a little bit, so I will buy the product again. I was using the firming cream from Nerium, and since I didn&#x27;t see any noticeable improvement with that expensive product after using four or five tubes of it, I thought I would try something less expensive. They both do about the same thing, which isn&#x27;t much, but at least I&#x27;m paying less now!</li>
            <li> I love this product, I&#x27;ve been using it for a year now and I love it. I lost weight and with this lotion my skin is smooth and firm.</li>
            <li> moisture and smell sweet</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this on old scars and stretch mark prone areas. It seems to penetrate my skin better and keep it hydrated longer than other lotions-- without making my skin greasy.</li>
            <li> The product states: \\&quot;It&#x27;s shea Butter, Collagen, Elastin and Vitamin E.\\&quot; but Collagen and Elastin are not listed as ingredients. You&#x27;ve been warned.</li>
            <li> Immediate results. I was so impressed!  I usually like to use my fragranced lotion but now can use it more sparingly when using this lotion as a base.</li>
            <li> Smelled very bad but I think works good</li>
            <li> All pregnant women should put this lotion in their hospital bag for immediate use after birth!!! I was amazed to see how quickly it worked to help tighten the skin on my belly and reduce the appearance of the stretch marks. I wish I took before/after pictures to post.</li>
            <li> It softens the skin but I don&#x27;t notice any real tightening plus I really don&#x27;t like the scent. I could&#x27;ve had a V8</li>
            <li> This lotion makes my skin very soft. But it doesn&#x27;t have a tightening effect like it claims. The smell is pleasant, but also gives me a headache.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure this has worked better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used and I LOVE the chocolate smell. I&#x27;d take a bath in it if I could.</li>
            <li> I fully support this company hands down! I have used Palmer&#x27;s skin care products since the 1990&#x27;s..non drying and assists in fading certain scars...it just takes time.</li>
            <li> For a heck of a long time, I was looking for a proper body lotion for me. I&#x27;m delighted since I&#x27;ve found this one. It smoothes the skin perfectly and it gives a feeling of a tension so that it helps to get rid of cellulite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> Moisturizers instantly!</li>
            <li> Really Really like this stuff. I read reviews all over the internet for all of the top firming lotions and decided this was the one to try. I have use Jergens and Nivea and while I do really like the smell of Nivea it does not absorb into the skin as well as the Palmers does. I love the thickness of this and the fact that it absorbs quickly and is not sticky after you put it on. I have been using it for 3 days and I may be crazy but I think it actually has starting helping my flab under my arms firm up already. I use it twice a day and really put it on generously. The pump makes it easy to use. I am also using it on my baby belly, thighs and butt to firm everything up after losing 40 lbs. I will update in a few weeks to tell you guys how it is working. I am not the biggest fan of the smell but it by no means annoys me. I can deal with it no problem if it works. :)</li>
            <li> Arrived fast and as advertised.</li>
            <li> This seems like good stuff. I won&#x27;t comment a lot on the firming ability, as I&#x27;ve only used it three or four times so far. It seems like there might be a bit of difference but it&#x27;s to soon to tell much. I will say, however, that it smells amazing. I am pretty picky with scents and have allergy issues, so I stir clear of chemically, floral, type smells. This smells similar to chocolate and wasn&#x27;t bothersome or overly intense at all. It didn&#x27;t bother my skin, which can be sensitive too. I love the texture also. It&#x27;s a light moisturizer, in my opinion. It left me smooth but rubbed in pretty quick. Not at all greasy, and not one that you have to sit there trying to soak in half the day. Definitely worth trying and I will be buying it again.</li>
            <li> Nothing great, but I enjoy the smell (don&#x27;t worry, it doesn&#x27;t last, just when you rub it in). I don&#x27;t think its firming a thing though.... didn&#x27;t really expect that it would, but a girl can dream.</li>
            <li> Geat product!  I saw a difference within a week of use. Only downside is the strong scent of cocoa.</li>
            <li> Great product. Saw significant difference in skin texture/smoothness/tightness within a short period...</li>
            <li> I so wanted this to work... But alas it did not after using for 3 months...</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. It smells great, goes on well and seems to make my skin more supple. It does seem to firm things up. My only complaint is the pump. When you get about half way down, it stops pumping like it should. You can shake it and slam it down on the counter, but nothing pumps out. I assume this is because the lotion is so thick?? It becomes a squeeze bottle. Regardless, I&#x27;d say the product itself is worth the hassle and I will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> Good products worthy of trust</li>
            <li> i love this lotion! I&#x27;m super confused why i can&#x27;t buy this at a normal retail store though. they used to have it at the babiesrus near me and before that it had been at walmart...or target i can&#x27;t remember.  I love how soft it makes my skin and i really do believe it works.  You can&#x27;t just use it and expect maximum results. However, when i first started using it i didn&#x27;t workout with it but i did notice my belly skin felt tighter. i know it works (atleast for me) because for alil bit more then a month i stopped using it (thinking it would eventually be restocked at babiesrus) and my belly skin felt looser. I&#x27;m so glad it&#x27;s on here!!!!</li>
            <li> It easily absorbs in my skin! I use it everyday makes my skin silky, smooth and firm</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness, I love this.&lt;br /&gt;It came well packed and the pump unlocked very radially.  Sometimes on some bottles I have to twist and get frustrated  with h the bottle.  This pump unlocks very radially.&lt;br /&gt;This lotion smells so good, just a light scent of cocoa and the smell doesn&#x27;t stay long.  It goes on nice, blends very well and it doesn&#x27;t lay on top of my skin.  It absorbs very quickly, and is not feel greasy at all and you don&#x27;t need a lot.  I don&#x27;t know if it firms up my skin but It makes it feel nice and moisturizer and my skin feels great afterwards.  I love this and will order more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always bought this brand because its a brand a really trust. It really works! Around the time that I ordered this I&#x27;ve lost a lot of weight. This helped solve that problem! In about 2 months, keeping in mind that I put this on three time a day, It firmed up my bottom significantly!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff!  I do too,  Great pure chocolate smell.  It works on dry skin. We had used the over the counter stuff that was&lt;br /&gt;cheap. That was what we were buying, cheap.  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Wife&#x27;s belly looks great.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about the firming part, but it does make me feel better to use it. I&#x27;m about five weeks postpartum and I&#x27;ve dropped about fifty pounds already. I still have a way to go and with it being winter and dry where I am, having lotion is a must. Whether or not this lotion actually works at firm up skin is kind of irrelevant to me as it simply makes me feel better. To be honest that&#x27;s enough for me.</li>
            <li> for stretch marks and scars this is way cheaper than mederma and I feel works better plus smells so nice</li>
            <li> Dispenser does not work.  Cannot comment on effectiveness of lotion yet.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and seems to be working good!</li>
            <li> Palmer&#x27;s has amazing products and they all live up to their expectations! I recommend this to everyone whether they are looking to avoid stretch marks during pregnancy, help heal newer stretch marks, firm loosened skin after having baby, or just moisturizing. I can&#x27;t imagine what my skin would look like without this miracle!</li>
            <li> This is WONDERFUL lotion! It absorbs fast and really helps my dry skin feel great!  It is the best lotion ever!</li>
            <li> The firming butter works great! I love it! I highly recommend using this product when you&#x27;re dealing with stretch marks after childbirth! Again, I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this product works well on firming or not, I just bought it. After3 days of use however, I&#x27;d like to say that it smells and feels wonderful. I truly love this product.</li>
            <li> Wonderful lotion, and sometimes hard to find.</li>
            <li> Product is great, but the pump doesn&#x27;t work, which is annoying, messy, and time consuming.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few months to help tighten up my Stomache after having my daughter. I have seen no dramatic results as it is just a lotion. But I have noticed a little improvement, although that is expected to happen overtime after having a baby. Will definitely continue to use and hope it works. The smell is nice and it&#x27;s a great moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I just recieved the product and so far it feels nice, but keep in mind that it&#x27;s a cocoa/shea butter formula. You WILL smell like a hershey kiss after you put it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will update when/if I start seeing results :)</li>
            <li> I ordered this to help with my stretch marks that developed after significant weight loss.  I have been using it daily and most of my stretch marks are gone.  The remaining ones are much less noticeable.  I had tried the Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter lotion, but the Firming Butter was far more effective on my stretch marks.  I will continue to buy this product.  I cannot find it in any stores (I found Palmer&#x27;s lotion, cream, oil, balm, etc.) so thanks Amazon for carrying it.</li>
            <li> I use this every night and I have definitely noticed an improvement. I does have a strong, sweet smell so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for day use.</li>
            <li> Smells awesome!!!! Very moisturizing</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Skin feels tighter and smells so good my child says &amp;#34;mama you smell like chocolate!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> If you have skin problems, this will make it go away!</li>
            <li> Lotion is great but Pump doesn&#x27;t work. Disappointed. Too much trouble to return. Using it without pump. Manufacturer should check pump first.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend thought it worked pretty good</li>
            <li> This is some of the best lotion I&#x27;ve used.  It moisturizes great which I need since I have Plaque Psoriasis.  I wasn&#x27;t sure about the scent at first, but now I love it.  I smell like chocolate.  :-)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick and after using it a couple of weeks, I bought a second one so I don&#x27;t run out :)  The smell is not overpowering, but you can definitely smell it shortly after putting it on.  I won&#x27;t travel without mine!  I also sometimes, use a sugar scrub on my belly (on the path to losing weight) during my shower.  Then after shower, I put this on - and my skin is so soft.  I notice a difference. I will be using this cream for a long time. I&#x27;m considering also getting the stretchmark cream, based on my results with this cream.</li>
            <li> Disnt work at all used it for two moths and no results, the stretch marks got worse. Stoped using this product</li>
            <li> smells great and it really does leave my skin feeling smoother and firmer.</li>
            <li> Have used this before! And will continue to purchase it! Great product</li>
            <li> Been using religiously for a month and not seeing any change.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a little over a week now. I do see a difference it&#x27;s minor though. I&#x27;m assuming I need to give it a little more time to see a big difference. I use it on my stomach and thighs. My stomach looks great but my thighs still need more work. I will probably keep using it for about a month or so and see if i get better results. I&#x27;m sure i will though.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this! I&#x27;ve tried other body firming creams and this seems to be the best for the price you&#x27;ll pay.</li>
            <li> been using for a couple weeks... cant tell if its working yet???</li>
            <li> This is a very good product and it works very well and smells great. You don&#x27;t have to be pregnant to use these products.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t gotten to see its full effect yet but I did notice a slight difference on the problem area on the back of my legs:)</li>
            <li> Smells good.  Does not make skin firmer or smooth.</li>
