            <li>I wanted this smaller powder brush because of it&#x27;s size - perfect for travel!</li>
            <li>but I like these even better.  </li>
            <li>i love this brush!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use this for my blush, powder, and buffing, definitely gives an airbrush finish and leaves my make-up looking flawless.</li>
            <li>Many makeup brushes have caused me to break out.</li>
            <li>love love love</li>
            <li>I clean it once a week and it stays nice.</li>
            <li>(I believe I placed the order on a Sunday) and when I opened up the box I was so excited to start using the brush!  </li>
            <li>I washed mine first in baby shampoo and warm water.  </li>
            <li>Overall, happy with the service and more so happy with this super soft and super cute brush.</li>
            <li>Beautiful and so soft, really recommend</li>
            <li>Applies well and even spread, soft, and cute!  </li>
            <li>Not for animal cruelty, technically the hair on this brush is only from a teddy bear, lol!  </li>
            <li>This is a great little brush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i had a cheap face brush prior and it didn&#x27;t make my makeup look this smooth!</li>
            <li>Came right on time.</li>
            <li>The whole process of placing my order and receiving the brush took no time at all!  </li>
            <li>(I always make that mistake, I never learn!), but I splurged on this brush initially because it was so cute and man the quality is</li>
            <li>Super soft brush!</li>
            <li>I highly reccomend this product to women who like to pamper themselves.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it is so soft and puts the powder on very evenly..</li>
            <li>rather expensive, but if you would like a nice brush this is worth the investment.   </li>
            <li>These fibers pick up powder like a magnet and distribute it smoothly and softly across your skin with absolutely NO prickly or scratchy feeling.</li>
            <li>it has are SUPER SOFT, I recommend anyone who is just starting make up like me, or is a professional to have this brush.</li>
            <li>Have only used for 2 weeks but love the soft feel and the way it distributes both loose and cake power.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Very soft and applies my powder foundation evenly and without any irritation.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s so amazingly soft!</li>
            <li>This is by far the softest makeup brush I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>Even my MAC brushes are not as soft as this one is.  </li>
            <li>It is as soft as the descrition says.  </li>
            <li>Teddy Bear Hair is unbelievably soft and it doesn&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It distributes my powder foundation so well and minimizes powder lost, so that my foundation will last me so much longer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so so soft and blends the bronzer without messing up my blush.</li>
            <li>This brush is a soft and efficient luxury, to use on my skin.</li>
            <li>it was run down but STILL somehow super soft.  </li>
            <li>even if price is higher than other brushes, quality is what I look for!</li>
            <li>Which, by the way, costs HALF as much as the &#x27;pro&#x27; brushes!    </li>

            <li> My only complaint is that I need to use more of the powder than I do with similar products, and I&#x27;m honestly not sure if that&#x27;s because of the powder or the brush...</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been disappointed in other high-end synthetic powder brushes I&#x27;ve tried due to the uncomfortable &#x27;scratchy-ness&#x27; of the bristle fibers, but not Too Faced.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been obsessed ever since.</li>

            <li> This is by far the softest makeup brush I&#x27;ve ever owned. I bought it to use with Too Faced&#x27;s Primed and Poreless powder, and the brush applies this product evenly and well. My only complaint is that I need to use more of the powder than I do with similar products, and I&#x27;m honestly not sure if that&#x27;s because of the powder or the brush...I think both. I need to try this brush with another powder product and see what happens.</li>
            <li> The whole process of placing my order and receiving the brush took no time at all!  Before I realized, the brush was sent out the same day (I believe I placed the order on a Sunday) and when I opened up the box I was so excited to start using the brush!  I washed mine first in baby shampoo and warm water.  I have used the brush to apply translucent powder.  Even my MAC brushes are not as soft as this one is.  I have seen someone use this for blush/bronzer but I haven not tried that.  Overall, happy with the service and more so happy with this super soft and super cute brush.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Not for animal cruelty, technically the hair on this brush is only from a teddy bear, lol!  But no really, I first felt this brush at a Sephora and being the display brush it was run down but STILL somehow super soft.  I&#x27;ve been obsessed ever since. Bought one for me and my best friend!  Softest brush, even when dirty, even when it&#x27;s aged (Not that I would know) :)  Applies well and even spread, soft, and cute!  great buy! rather expensive, but if you would like a nice brush this is worth the investment.   Put that CVS Powder brush in the trash ladies!</li>
            <li> i love it .. just dont love the price tag!</li>
            <li> The Too Faced powder pouf brush is hands-down the best powder brush I have ever owned. It is made of what they call &#x27;Teddy Bear Hair&#x27; - synthetic fibers that are softer than any pro brush I&#x27;ve tried! These fibers pick up powder like a magnet and distribute it smoothly and softly across your skin with absolutely NO prickly or scratchy feeling. I&#x27;ve been disappointed in other high-end synthetic powder brushes I&#x27;ve tried due to the uncomfortable &#x27;scratchy-ness&#x27; of the bristle fibers, but not Too Faced. Which, by the way, costs HALF as much as the &#x27;pro&#x27; brushes!    As no two people are alike, I suggest making a visit to your local Ulta or pro beauty supply store to do a hands-on comparison before you purchase online. I&#x27;m so thankful I did, as I was considering a Smashbox brush until I discovered Too Faced. You can find all the pertinent product details on the Too Faced site: [...]     Cheers!</li>
            <li> I love all the Two-Faced Teddy Bear brushes. This one is no exception. I wanted this smaller powder brush because of it&#x27;s size - perfect for travel!</li>
            <li> Love this brush!  It is as soft as the descrition says.  I was a Sephora Pro Brush user but I like these even better.  I&#x27;m definitely switching!</li>
            <li> Super soft brush! Love it! Came right on time. Great buy</li>
            <li> I have other brushes by Too Faced Cosmetics (same style) and I needed bigger face brush... Did not think twice about brand or product.. will buy again... even if price is higher than other brushes, quality is what I look for! Great product!!</li>
            <li> This brush is divine and lives up to all the great reviews.  Teddy Bear Hair is unbelievably soft and it doesn&#x27;t shed. I&#x27;ve had this brush for about a year now and it looks great, washes well, and applies makeup so beautifully.  I use it for applying powder, bronzer and blush.</li>
            <li> i love this brush!&lt;br /&gt;it is so soft and puts the powder on very evenly..&lt;br /&gt;i had a cheap face brush prior and it didn&#x27;t make my makeup look this smooth!</li>
            <li> Have only used for 2 weeks but love the soft feel and the way it distributes both loose and cake power.</li>
            <li> This is the best brush I&#x27;ve ever had!! I usually get drug-store kinds because I never thought that price would make a difference in quality (I always make that mistake, I never learn!), but I splurged on this brush initially because it was so cute and man the quality is so good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It distributes my powder foundation so well and minimizes powder lost, so that my foundation will last me so much longer. It applies it evenly on my face soooo well!!! And it feels SO AMAZING when you sweep it on your face, it&#x27;s so amazingly soft!</li>
            <li> This is a great little brush. ive used it for mineral powder and blush and it gives a great finish</li>
            <li> I use this for my blush and sometimes powder.. works best if just doing my cheeks. Does need to be washed often for it to work best.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush a month ago and I absolutely love it! I use it for Estée Lauder Aerin bronzer and it works perfectly. It&#x27;s so so soft and blends the bronzer without messing up my blush.</li>
            <li> This brush is a soft and efficient luxury, to use on my skin. I highly reccomend this product to women who like to pamper themselves.</li>
            <li> Beautiful and so soft, really recommend</li>
            <li> I use this for my blush, powder, and buffing, definitely gives an airbrush finish and leaves my make-up looking flawless. The teddy bear hairs it has are SUPER SOFT, I recommend anyone who is just starting make up like me, or is a professional to have this brush.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin. Many makeup brushes have caused me to break out. This one has not. Works great. I clean it once a week and it stays nice. Very soft and applies my powder foundation evenly and without any irritation.</li>
            <li> I love this brush! It&#x27;s so soft!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> soft and adorable!!! love love love</li>
