            <li>There is a really good variety in brush shape, texture, and firmness, which gives tons of application options.</li>
            <li>A good buy for budget brushes</li>
            <li>I bought these about... 1 year ago and they are still in good condition .</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t good quality.</li>
            <li>Loved.</li>
            <li>Good value.</li>
            <li>Good brushes for the price.  </li>
            <li>Price is good, but poor-cheap quality.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re cheap and work very effectively!</li>
            <li>They clean off well after each color of shadow so they are perfect for multi colored eye looks!</li>
            <li>But if you think you want something good for real good price, then this is probably not the best choice since the quality isn&#x27;t good enough.</li>
            <li>Luckily, they still seem to work perfectly!</li>
            <li>I saw so many great reviews on this product and they were mostly good</li>
            <li>they work great and save a lot of space since it&#x27;s two on one :).</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t that good honestly.</li>
            <li>Love this set for blending my eyeshadows!</li>
            <li>Love them and I would buy them again!</li>
            <li>Love these eyeshadow applicators!</li>

            <li>great quaillity brushes for cheap</li>
            <li>I knew these wouldn&#x27;t be great when I ordered them, as they were ridiculously cheap.</li>
            <li>They have a nice design</li>
            <li>They are nice and compact.</li>
            <li>Product was nice for what I paid for it.</li>
            <li>For someone who doesn&#x27;t know much about makeup, I thought these brushes were awesome!</li>
            <li>I got some great ideas on how to use these different brushes to best accentuate my face by going to a mall makeup store and paying close attention while having my makeup done.</li>
            <li>These are nice applicators.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and are awesome for building up product.</li>
            <li>All in all they are great, picks up product great and blends out very well.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping was awesome!</li>
            <li>These brushes will be handy when I travel</li>
            <li>Kind of.</li>
            <li>the brushes are really nice</li>
            <li>These are really nice</li>
            <li>but I would have liked to use them without having to treat them.</li>
            <li>The eyelash brush is wonderful for separating your lashes after applying mascara even if your mascara is getting older.</li>
            <li>Great low cost amazing application !!</li>
            <li>I received this about a week after I purchased them and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!</li>
            <li>spooly is the best i&#x27;ve tried so far</li>
            <li>Love Love Love them!</li>
            <li>they were soft good consistency and didn&#x27;t shed at all... if you are in need for a great quality brushes you should buy these</li>
            <li>These are really good quality for such a good price!</li>
            <li>Great for travelling and gets the job done, The blending brush blends pretty well.</li>
            <li>but this was a huge surprise!</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re softer than most brushes and I love that</li>
            <li>The white bristled brush is excellent for getting into your eye crease and corner to add depth.</li>
            <li>Definitely what im looking for :D</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say, if you just want to try things out, then it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>My favorite brush is the eye brow applicator.</li>
            <li>The product is okay for an infant but not for a toddler.</li>
            <li>I can finally get the perfect eye shadow look.</li>
            <li>Very well made and wash out great also.</li>
            <li>The angled brush is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I find these brushes to be very impressive, given that you technically get 10 brushes for just $6.</li>
            <li>Love these brushes.</li>
            <li>She is now able to do it herself with these.</li>
            <li>I like it :)</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect them to be  as nice as they were being that I paid a cheap amount</li>
            <li>, I love them, I would defiantly buy more items from this buyer.</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t sure about the quality</li>
            <li>Love them&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li>I love the double-sides.</li>
            <li>Look better pictured than in person.</li>
            <li>Love them though</li>
            <li>but they are more travel size.</li>
            <li>Wonderful, especially considering the price.</li>
            <li>Nice set for cheap.</li>
            <li>These would be ok as a 1st set of make-up brushes.</li>
            <li>I use these more than I use my name brand ones from Sephora or Tech.</li>
            <li>I love them they got here on time.</li>
            <li>Hopefully over time it goes back, but the rest of the brushes are great!</li>
            <li>They are ok.</li>
            <li>But with time and more practice you may need to order a better set.</li>
            <li>I love these brushes.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THESE</li>
            <li>That is, IF the brushes were better quality.  </li>
            <li>Love love love  the spoolie</li>
            <li>but they get the job done, so i guess their okay.</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d consider myself a beginner at the whole makeup thing (I only got into it for cosplay) and these have been a huge help to me, greatly relieving some of the stress I&#x27;ve felt trying to perfect eyeshadow looks.</li>
            <li>Super pleased!</li>
            <li>These are pretty good quality for the price.</li>
            <li>They are of good quality and looks exactly like the picture posted on amazon.</li>
            <li>Pretty good brushes...</li>
            <li>They are pretty good for apply makeup</li>
            <li>They work just fine for my smokey eyes :)</li>
            <li>Cheap portable brushes for touching up make up.</li>
            <li>Love that its double sided and its applys so beautiful.</li>
            <li>Appear more cheap when received in the mail.</li>
            <li>they ware ok for a cheap price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super glad I bought them :)</li>
            <li>great assortment, great price, and a cool little case to carry them.</li>
            <li>This is extremely the best eye brushes iI&#x27;ve ever gotten.</li>
            <li>Love the double ended brushes great for eyes shadow i even use 1 of the brushes for my lip stick and blending it</li>
            <li>cleans easy.  </li>
            <li>Pretty nice set for the money.</li>
            <li>Each brush has a nice feel to it and the wide range of styles is good for most applications.</li>
            <li>These are pretty nice.  </li>
            <li>so you can&#x27;t get a fine line.</li>
            <li>but the rest of the brushes are fine.</li>
            <li>I got my brushes very fast!!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much when I ordered these brushes but was quite surprised how incredible these brushes were..</li>
            <li>Cheap</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and no fall out as of now</li>
            <li>Brushes are cheaply made</li>
            <li>Chance you take buying cheap brushes.</li>
            <li>Great selection of smaller brushes</li>
            <li>They were really cheap</li>
            <li>cheap-</li>
            <li>You get what you pay for, there is an initial fallout with some of the bristles but all in all they&#x27;re great to work with</li>
            <li>the quality is king of cheap on some</li>
            <li>So, overall, for their price and purpose they are a good start, but I would recommend using these until you can purchase something better.</li>
            <li>Perfect - exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>Very worth the price - the brushes are so versatile, and for an amateur like me, the quality is perfect.</li>
            <li>I find that nothing else works as well to keep my brushes deep-cleaned,in perfect shape, &amp; makes them last in like brand new condition for years).</li>
            <li>but so worth the buy!</li>
            <li>For the price, it&#x27;s pretty ok.</li>
            <li>but I was too excited not to try them out immediately so that didn&#x27;t happen.</li>
            <li>great little things love it</li>
            <li>The bigger ones work perfectly and are extremely soft.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting too much, because you just never know sometimes when you find a good price whether the products are going to be &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; or reasonable.  </li>
            <li>These are awesome such great quality for such a low price !</li>
            <li>They get the job don&#x27;t really well, I&#x27;ve washed them a few times and I&#x27;m proud to say there have been no shedding of any kind</li>
            <li>These are cool tools you never have to worry about loosing them</li>
            <li>and it is so cool how they are on both sides</li>
            <li>I love them so much.</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li>But for the money you pay, it is not a bad set.</li>
            <li>Not a bad set of brushes.</li>
            <li>Not to upset due to great quality.</li>
            <li>Delivered quickly and looks as described.</li>
            <li>The quality really seems good this far.</li>
            <li>I received the brushes quick.</li>
            <li>I mostly just needed a couple brushes with fine, firm bristles and the rest are nice bonuses.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>because natural animal hair is much coarser and more porous than the synthetic bristles most ppl are used to in their brushes.</li>
            <li>However, I felt that I should give fair warning that these brushes are very cheap and small.  </li>
            <li>sisters (who are fans of makeup) are very jealous if my brushes and I&#x27;m pretty sure they stole a couple</li>
            <li>but the brushes were very soft and j was able to use them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other than that, these are a great buy for anyone on a tight budget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are so compact and great for everyday use for travel.</li>
            <li>Useful</li>
            <li>but wow I love them and you can take them on the go.</li>
            <li>I really love these brushes but they weren&#x27;t that soft on my eyes</li>
            <li>Was ok the brushes not that soft...</li>
            <li>that often but using these versatile brushes make putting makeup on so fun that I&#x27;ve been wearing it EVERYDAY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.  </li>
            <li>Well worth it for the price.</li>
            <li>Simple and effective.</li>
            <li>Worth the money?</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re pretty good quality and quite soft and easy to tap any extra powder off each time.</li>
            <li>They are ok the bristles come out but other than that they are ok.</li>
            <li>use the other brushes to spot conceal or apply liquid lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re technically getting 10 brushes for ~$6, its an awesome deal.</li>
            <li>and this set is proof positive that you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li>they are soft and apply great with my mineral powders, I of course conditioned them with baby shampoo first and let them air dry.</li>
            <li>The larger brown bristled brush is great for initial coverage and blending.</li>
            <li>Love these brushes..they are soft and apply very well..GREAT for the price.</li>
            <li>But they were even more cheaply made than I expected.</li>
            <li>The other brushes are fine, but I would recommend buying elf brushes which are softer and much better than these brushes.</li>
            <li>Maybe there is some kind of solution that can be use to clean them and make them a little softer?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not using these professionally - just for myself - and they work fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had makeup brushes before, just the little foam things that come in eyeshadow packs, and let me tell you, these make it a lot easier to make your makeup look good.</li>
            <li>Was surprised of the quality, due to the price, I assumed they wouldn&#x27;t be ok for daily use but would be great for my Travel makeup kit.</li>
            <li>Received exactly what the picture depicts.</li>
            <li>They look exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>They pretty cheep.</li>
            <li>It was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>The quality isn&#x27;t top of the line, but definitely exceeded my expectations for the price.</li>
            <li>Ok brushes but they are a lot smaller and flimsier than they look, you get what you pay for I gues.</li>
            <li>Exactly as depicted.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had these brushes for more than a couple of days yet and have only used one of them.</li>
            <li>so expect that when you first receive them.</li>
            <li>Ok if you&#x27;re just starting out and want to experiment, but not a pro kit.</li>
            <li>What is do love about it is that it is double ended, multipurpose use with each peice.</li>
            <li>seller was terrific and prompt as well :)</li>
            <li>Not what I was looking for exactly</li>
            <li>I really like these brushes!  </li>
            <li>comes with more brushes that i would actually use.</li>
            <li>i really love the way they blend &amp;apply, just dnt know how to organize them because they are double headed.</li>
            <li>actually like this brush better than the Anastasia brand because the bristles and spool are gentler and easier to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The one I used worked very well and the others will do the same I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li>I would suggest something like an Eco Tools or Real Techniques set for a similar price and much better quality.</li>
            <li>If you are serious into make up then I would buy a higher quality set but these are perfect for daily abuse.</li>
            <li>Small but good for its price</li>
            <li>They are all super soft, hold product very well and seem pretty sturdy.</li>
            <li>But given the number of positive reviews, I expected to receive something much better than I did.  </li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a great value, however I received the eyebrow brush (the one I really purchased the set for) slightly damaged from shipping.</li>
            <li>For the price it&#x27;s about reasonable quality.</li>
            <li>I really like these brushes.</li>
            <li>and they apply makeup very well.</li>
            <li>That being said, I did not have high expectations and you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t apply very well for eyeshadows.</li>
            <li>They really do wonders</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve moved on to better brushes but they are a good place to start for someone who only needs basic everyday makeup brushes</li>
            <li>The brushes are really versatile and I like the variety.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t shed much.</li>
            <li>The service was fast.</li>
            <li>A couple bristles fell out of the concealer brushes upon first use but that&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li>I gave this product 2 stars because I don&#x27;t really like the brushes.</li>
            <li>Different brushes for a cheap price.</li>
            <li>so I guess you can&#x27;t expect much</li>
            <li>Im sure i will be buying more sets for myself and a few family members, especially my mother, &amp;#34;Diane&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Makes my brows much easier to do.</li>
            <li>pick up product very well, and each tool does its job the way it&#x27;s supposed</li>
            <li>dnt really like keeping my brushes layed out on the counter..</li>
            <li>Fast delivery</li>
            <li>I love double sided brushes and these are soft and don&#x27;t take up too much room in my purse.</li>
            <li>The mascara looking wand was broken upon arrival, but the other four brushes were in good order and are a nice quality.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>im actually using these as clean up brushes for nail art.</li>
            <li>I have purchased cheap make up brushes before and in the past they&#x27;ve needed to be replaced pretty quickly</li>
            <li>I needed a few more smaller detail eye brushes and wanted some  more that had natural bristles.</li>
            <li>Virgin Olive Oil &amp; Grapeseed Oil in a small squeeze bottle and fill remaining space in bottle with distilled Rose Water to condition-deepwash all my brushes once a week...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a pro in make up, but I love this set, the difference in applying makeup is very noticeable, the little sponge that comes with make doesn&#x27;t compare.</li>
            <li>but these are decent brushes for the cost.</li>
            <li>I used the same brushes and techniques for a couple weeks to gain experience and then was confident enough to move on and use the rest of the brushes as well.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend ordering from this seller.</li>
            <li>The smaller brushes, however, are pretty stiff and it kind of hurts to apply eyeshadow with them.</li>
            <li>Some of the brushes are kind of hard</li>
            <li>They are about three times longer then the common kind that come with your eye shadow and so far no loose bristles or any other kind of problems.</li>
            <li>These are seriously amazing -- there isn&#x27;t a day in the week when I don&#x27;t need to reach for at least ONE of these brushes, and they perform like a dream.  </li>
            <li>But that is expected when purchasing a cheap item.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve known some ppl to use just their regular shampoo/conditioner combined products to wash their makeup brushes, but I think this just builds up on makeup brushes just as it does on one&#x27;s hair and eventually causes either the brushes to wear out faster and/or causes them to not perform as useful tools as well because of the build up of chemicals from the shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed these same ppl have to replace their daily brushes a lot more frequently than I do</li>
            <li>and now im having to buy a new brush set.</li>
            <li>The other brushes aren&#x27;t that soft and the angled brush is too think to give precise lines when doing my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used them once to try it out when I first got it.</li>
            <li>With this set...the most fallout is from the c-shape brush,the flat shader brush &amp; the larger white blending brush...</li>
            <li>I use them everyday and cleaning them is exceptionally easy.</li>
            <li>Love this set of applicator brushes, especially the fact that they are double-sided so they take up less room.</li>
            <li>Plus the white ones stained very quickly (I guess that is expected).</li>
            <li>The spoolie end is great,  but the angled brow side is kinda weak,  not as sturdy as i expected.</li>
            <li>I have never used professional make up brushes</li>
            <li>The bristles could be softer as they are intended on being used on a sensitive area after all (eyelid).</li>
            <li>So far they have been holding up well</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve never tried natural bristles vs synthetic...</li>
            <li>No hair loss, the bristles are soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>As far as I&#x27;m concerned it has all the brushes I need to get the desired look that I always like to have when applying eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>So beware of that if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>the angled end of the eyebrow brush is quite soft, so i don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li>This is a very practical set for traveling, the only caveat being that it doesn&#x27;t have a blush/powder brush.</li>
            <li>These brushes works very well but they are super small.</li>
            <li>Soft and small for precise blending of eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>True, it wasn&#x27;t expensive, in fact, it was quite cheap.  </li>
            <li>when you first purchase natural hair brushes, there IS just a little more than usual fallout before the brushes are washed/conditioned than there is from synthetic brushes.</li>
            <li>These brushes aren&#x27;t crazy soft, dense, and good quality; but they get the job done and they&#x27;re decent especially for the price.</li>
            <li>The brushes shed really easily and some are really hard.</li>
            <li>Nice but white brush arrive broken</li>
            <li>A few of the brushes are nicely made, a few of them look like qualities are not as well.</li>
            <li>Very soft but sturdy to pick up product, would definitely recommend this to any makeup lovers and beginners.</li>
            <li>The hairs in the brushes are sloppy, looks and feel very cheap in quality.</li>
            <li>At least it was cheap.</li>
            <li>I use these professionally and have only for about a month.</li>
            <li>Multiple strands fall out with each use, so I&#x27;m expecting them to completely fall apart any day now.</li>
            <li>I mean they are cheap</li>
            <li>These will work fine and were much less costly than other sets.</li>
            <li>All of the brushes are double ended making them very versatile with endless uses.</li>
            <li>I have more expensive natural hair brushes that don&#x27;t perform this well, so at this low price point...</li>
            <li>Small but useful.</li>
            <li>This is normal and is to be expected because of the difference from synthetic bristles and how the brushes are made..</li>

            <li> Good brushes however, be prepared for the rapping of the brushes to come off.</li>

            <li> I bought these about... 1 year ago and they are still in good condition .</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t good quality.</li>
            <li> Loved.</li>
            <li> Good value.</li>
            <li> Good brushes for the price.  </li>
            <li> Price is good, but poor-cheap quality.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re cheap and work very effectively!</li>
            <li> They clean off well after each color of shadow so they are perfect for multi colored eye looks!</li>
            <li> But if you think you want something good for real good price, then this is probably not the best choice since the quality isn&#x27;t good enough.</li>
            <li> Luckily, they still seem to work perfectly!</li>
            <li> I saw so many great reviews on this product and they were mostly good</li>
            <li> they work great and save a lot of space since it&#x27;s two on one :).</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t that good honestly.</li>
            <li> Love this set for blending my eyeshadows!</li>
            <li> Love them and I would buy them again!</li>
            <li> Love these eyeshadow applicators!</li>

            <li> great quaillity brushes for cheap</li>
            <li> I knew these wouldn&#x27;t be great when I ordered them, as they were ridiculously cheap.</li>
            <li> They have a nice design</li>
            <li> They are nice and compact.</li>
            <li> Product was nice for what I paid for it.</li>
            <li> For someone who doesn&#x27;t know much about makeup, I thought these brushes were awesome!</li>
            <li> I got some great ideas on how to use these different brushes to best accentuate my face by going to a mall makeup store and paying close attention while having my makeup done.</li>
            <li> These are nice applicators.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and are awesome for building up product.</li>
            <li> All in all they are great, picks up product great and blends out very well.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping was awesome!</li>
            <li> These brushes will be handy when I travel</li>
            <li> Kind of.</li>
            <li> the brushes are really nice</li>
            <li> These are really nice</li>
            <li> but I would have liked to use them without having to treat them.</li>
            <li> The eyelash brush is wonderful for separating your lashes after applying mascara even if your mascara is getting older.</li>
            <li> Great low cost amazing application !!</li>
            <li> I received this about a week after I purchased them and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!</li>
            <li> spooly is the best i&#x27;ve tried so far</li>
            <li> Love Love Love them!</li>
            <li> they were soft good consistency and didn&#x27;t shed at all... if you are in need for a great quality brushes you should buy these</li>
            <li> These are really good quality for such a good price!</li>
            <li> Great for travelling and gets the job done, The blending brush blends pretty well.</li>
            <li> but this was a huge surprise!</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re softer than most brushes and I love that</li>
            <li> The white bristled brush is excellent for getting into your eye crease and corner to add depth.</li>
            <li> Definitely what im looking for :D</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say, if you just want to try things out, then it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> My favorite brush is the eye brow applicator.</li>
            <li> The product is okay for an infant but not for a toddler.</li>
            <li> I can finally get the perfect eye shadow look.</li>
            <li> Very well made and wash out great also.</li>
            <li> The angled brush is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I find these brushes to be very impressive, given that you technically get 10 brushes for just $6.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes.</li>
            <li> She is now able to do it herself with these.</li>
            <li> I like it :)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect them to be  as nice as they were being that I paid a cheap amount</li>
            <li> , I love them, I would defiantly buy more items from this buyer.</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t sure about the quality</li>
            <li> Love them&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li> I love the double-sides.</li>
            <li> Look better pictured than in person.</li>
            <li> Love them though</li>
            <li> but they are more travel size.</li>
            <li> Wonderful, especially considering the price.</li>
            <li> Nice set for cheap.</li>
            <li> These would be ok as a 1st set of make-up brushes.</li>
            <li> I use these more than I use my name brand ones from Sephora or Tech.</li>
            <li> I love them they got here on time.</li>
            <li> Hopefully over time it goes back, but the rest of the brushes are great!</li>
            <li> They are ok.</li>
            <li> But with time and more practice you may need to order a better set.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THESE</li>
            <li> That is, IF the brushes were better quality.  </li>
            <li> Love love love  the spoolie</li>
            <li> but they get the job done, so i guess their okay.</li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d consider myself a beginner at the whole makeup thing (I only got into it for cosplay) and these have been a huge help to me, greatly relieving some of the stress I&#x27;ve felt trying to perfect eyeshadow looks.</li>
            <li> Super pleased!</li>
            <li> These are pretty good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> They are of good quality and looks exactly like the picture posted on amazon.</li>
            <li> Pretty good brushes...</li>
            <li> They are pretty good for apply makeup</li>
            <li> They work just fine for my smokey eyes :)</li>
            <li> Cheap portable brushes for touching up make up.</li>
            <li> Love that its double sided and its applys so beautiful.</li>
            <li> Appear more cheap when received in the mail.</li>
            <li> they ware ok for a cheap price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super glad I bought them :)</li>
            <li> great assortment, great price, and a cool little case to carry them.</li>
            <li> This is extremely the best eye brushes iI&#x27;ve ever gotten.</li>
            <li> Love the double ended brushes great for eyes shadow i even use 1 of the brushes for my lip stick and blending it</li>
            <li> cleans easy.  </li>
            <li> Pretty nice set for the money.</li>
            <li> Each brush has a nice feel to it and the wide range of styles is good for most applications.</li>
            <li> These are pretty nice.  </li>
            <li> so you can&#x27;t get a fine line.</li>
            <li> but the rest of the brushes are fine.</li>
            <li> I got my brushes very fast!!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much when I ordered these brushes but was quite surprised how incredible these brushes were..</li>
            <li> Cheap</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and no fall out as of now</li>
            <li> Brushes are cheaply made</li>
            <li> Chance you take buying cheap brushes.</li>
            <li> Great selection of smaller brushes</li>
            <li> They were really cheap</li>
            <li> cheap-</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for, there is an initial fallout with some of the bristles but all in all they&#x27;re great to work with</li>
            <li> the quality is king of cheap on some</li>
            <li> So, overall, for their price and purpose they are a good start, but I would recommend using these until you can purchase something better.</li>
            <li> Perfect - exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Very worth the price - the brushes are so versatile, and for an amateur like me, the quality is perfect.</li>
            <li> I find that nothing else works as well to keep my brushes deep-cleaned,in perfect shape, &amp; makes them last in like brand new condition for years).</li>
            <li> but so worth the buy!</li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s pretty ok.</li>
            <li> but I was too excited not to try them out immediately so that didn&#x27;t happen.</li>
            <li> great little things love it</li>
            <li> The bigger ones work perfectly and are extremely soft.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting too much, because you just never know sometimes when you find a good price whether the products are going to be &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; or reasonable.  </li>
            <li> These are awesome such great quality for such a low price !</li>
            <li> They get the job don&#x27;t really well, I&#x27;ve washed them a few times and I&#x27;m proud to say there have been no shedding of any kind</li>
            <li> These are cool tools you never have to worry about loosing them</li>
            <li> and it is so cool how they are on both sides</li>
            <li> I love them so much.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> But for the money you pay, it is not a bad set.</li>
            <li> Not a bad set of brushes.</li>
            <li> Not to upset due to great quality.</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly and looks as described.</li>
            <li> The quality really seems good this far.</li>
            <li> I received the brushes quick.</li>
            <li> I mostly just needed a couple brushes with fine, firm bristles and the rest are nice bonuses.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> because natural animal hair is much coarser and more porous than the synthetic bristles most ppl are used to in their brushes.</li>
            <li> However, I felt that I should give fair warning that these brushes are very cheap and small.  </li>
            <li> sisters (who are fans of makeup) are very jealous if my brushes and I&#x27;m pretty sure they stole a couple</li>
            <li> but the brushes were very soft and j was able to use them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other than that, these are a great buy for anyone on a tight budget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are so compact and great for everyday use for travel.</li>
            <li> Useful</li>
            <li> but wow I love them and you can take them on the go.</li>
            <li> I really love these brushes but they weren&#x27;t that soft on my eyes</li>
            <li> Was ok the brushes not that soft...</li>
            <li> that often but using these versatile brushes make putting makeup on so fun that I&#x27;ve been wearing it EVERYDAY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price.  </li>
            <li> Well worth it for the price.</li>
            <li> Simple and effective.</li>
            <li> Worth the money?</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re pretty good quality and quite soft and easy to tap any extra powder off each time.</li>
            <li> They are ok the bristles come out but other than that they are ok.</li>
            <li> use the other brushes to spot conceal or apply liquid lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re technically getting 10 brushes for ~$6, its an awesome deal.</li>
            <li> and this set is proof positive that you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> they are soft and apply great with my mineral powders, I of course conditioned them with baby shampoo first and let them air dry.</li>
            <li> The larger brown bristled brush is great for initial coverage and blending.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes..they are soft and apply very well..GREAT for the price.</li>
            <li> But they were even more cheaply made than I expected.</li>
            <li> The other brushes are fine, but I would recommend buying elf brushes which are softer and much better than these brushes.</li>
            <li> Maybe there is some kind of solution that can be use to clean them and make them a little softer?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not using these professionally - just for myself - and they work fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had makeup brushes before, just the little foam things that come in eyeshadow packs, and let me tell you, these make it a lot easier to make your makeup look good.</li>
            <li> Was surprised of the quality, due to the price, I assumed they wouldn&#x27;t be ok for daily use but would be great for my Travel makeup kit.</li>
            <li> Received exactly what the picture depicts.</li>
            <li> They look exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> They pretty cheep.</li>
            <li> It was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> The quality isn&#x27;t top of the line, but definitely exceeded my expectations for the price.</li>
            <li> Ok brushes but they are a lot smaller and flimsier than they look, you get what you pay for I gues.</li>
            <li> Exactly as depicted.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had these brushes for more than a couple of days yet and have only used one of them.</li>
            <li> so expect that when you first receive them.</li>
            <li> Ok if you&#x27;re just starting out and want to experiment, but not a pro kit.</li>
            <li> What is do love about it is that it is double ended, multipurpose use with each peice.</li>
            <li> seller was terrific and prompt as well :)</li>
            <li> Not what I was looking for exactly</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes!  </li>
            <li> comes with more brushes that i would actually use.</li>
            <li> i really love the way they blend &amp;apply, just dnt know how to organize them because they are double headed.</li>
            <li> actually like this brush better than the Anastasia brand because the bristles and spool are gentler and easier to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The one I used worked very well and the others will do the same I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li> I would suggest something like an Eco Tools or Real Techniques set for a similar price and much better quality.</li>
            <li> If you are serious into make up then I would buy a higher quality set but these are perfect for daily abuse.</li>
            <li> Small but good for its price</li>
            <li> They are all super soft, hold product very well and seem pretty sturdy.</li>
            <li> But given the number of positive reviews, I expected to receive something much better than I did.  </li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a great value, however I received the eyebrow brush (the one I really purchased the set for) slightly damaged from shipping.</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s about reasonable quality.</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes.</li>
            <li> and they apply makeup very well.</li>
            <li> That being said, I did not have high expectations and you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t apply very well for eyeshadows.</li>
            <li> They really do wonders</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve moved on to better brushes but they are a good place to start for someone who only needs basic everyday makeup brushes</li>
            <li> The brushes are really versatile and I like the variety.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t shed much.</li>
            <li> The service was fast.</li>
            <li> A couple bristles fell out of the concealer brushes upon first use but that&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li> I gave this product 2 stars because I don&#x27;t really like the brushes.</li>
            <li> Different brushes for a cheap price.</li>
            <li> so I guess you can&#x27;t expect much</li>
            <li> Im sure i will be buying more sets for myself and a few family members, especially my mother, &amp;#34;Diane&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Makes my brows much easier to do.</li>
            <li> pick up product very well, and each tool does its job the way it&#x27;s supposed</li>
            <li> dnt really like keeping my brushes layed out on the counter..</li>
            <li> Fast delivery</li>
            <li> I love double sided brushes and these are soft and don&#x27;t take up too much room in my purse.</li>
            <li> The mascara looking wand was broken upon arrival, but the other four brushes were in good order and are a nice quality.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> im actually using these as clean up brushes for nail art.</li>
            <li> I have purchased cheap make up brushes before and in the past they&#x27;ve needed to be replaced pretty quickly</li>
            <li> I needed a few more smaller detail eye brushes and wanted some  more that had natural bristles.</li>
            <li> Virgin Olive Oil &amp; Grapeseed Oil in a small squeeze bottle and fill remaining space in bottle with distilled Rose Water to condition-deepwash all my brushes once a week...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a pro in make up, but I love this set, the difference in applying makeup is very noticeable, the little sponge that comes with make doesn&#x27;t compare.</li>
            <li> but these are decent brushes for the cost.</li>
            <li> I used the same brushes and techniques for a couple weeks to gain experience and then was confident enough to move on and use the rest of the brushes as well.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend ordering from this seller.</li>
            <li> The smaller brushes, however, are pretty stiff and it kind of hurts to apply eyeshadow with them.</li>
            <li> Some of the brushes are kind of hard</li>
            <li> They are about three times longer then the common kind that come with your eye shadow and so far no loose bristles or any other kind of problems.</li>
            <li> These are seriously amazing -- there isn&#x27;t a day in the week when I don&#x27;t need to reach for at least ONE of these brushes, and they perform like a dream.  </li>
            <li> But that is expected when purchasing a cheap item.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve known some ppl to use just their regular shampoo/conditioner combined products to wash their makeup brushes, but I think this just builds up on makeup brushes just as it does on one&#x27;s hair and eventually causes either the brushes to wear out faster and/or causes them to not perform as useful tools as well because of the build up of chemicals from the shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed these same ppl have to replace their daily brushes a lot more frequently than I do</li>
            <li> and now im having to buy a new brush set.</li>
            <li> The other brushes aren&#x27;t that soft and the angled brush is too think to give precise lines when doing my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used them once to try it out when I first got it.</li>
            <li> With this set...the most fallout is from the c-shape brush,the flat shader brush &amp; the larger white blending brush...</li>
            <li> I use them everyday and cleaning them is exceptionally easy.</li>
            <li> Love this set of applicator brushes, especially the fact that they are double-sided so they take up less room.</li>
            <li> Plus the white ones stained very quickly (I guess that is expected).</li>
            <li> The spoolie end is great,  but the angled brow side is kinda weak,  not as sturdy as i expected.</li>
            <li> I have never used professional make up brushes</li>
            <li> The bristles could be softer as they are intended on being used on a sensitive area after all (eyelid).</li>
            <li> So far they have been holding up well</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never tried natural bristles vs synthetic...</li>
            <li> No hair loss, the bristles are soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> As far as I&#x27;m concerned it has all the brushes I need to get the desired look that I always like to have when applying eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> So beware of that if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> the angled end of the eyebrow brush is quite soft, so i don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> This is a very practical set for traveling, the only caveat being that it doesn&#x27;t have a blush/powder brush.</li>
            <li> These brushes works very well but they are super small.</li>
            <li> Soft and small for precise blending of eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> True, it wasn&#x27;t expensive, in fact, it was quite cheap.  </li>
            <li> when you first purchase natural hair brushes, there IS just a little more than usual fallout before the brushes are washed/conditioned than there is from synthetic brushes.</li>
            <li> These brushes aren&#x27;t crazy soft, dense, and good quality; but they get the job done and they&#x27;re decent especially for the price.</li>
            <li> The brushes shed really easily and some are really hard.</li>
            <li> Nice but white brush arrive broken</li>
            <li> A few of the brushes are nicely made, a few of them look like qualities are not as well.</li>
            <li> Very soft but sturdy to pick up product, would definitely recommend this to any makeup lovers and beginners.</li>
            <li> The hairs in the brushes are sloppy, looks and feel very cheap in quality.</li>
            <li> At least it was cheap.</li>
            <li> I use these professionally and have only for about a month.</li>
            <li> Multiple strands fall out with each use, so I&#x27;m expecting them to completely fall apart any day now.</li>
            <li> I mean they are cheap</li>
            <li> These will work fine and were much less costly than other sets.</li>
            <li> All of the brushes are double ended making them very versatile with endless uses.</li>
            <li> I have more expensive natural hair brushes that don&#x27;t perform this well, so at this low price point...</li>
            <li> Small but useful.</li>
            <li> This is normal and is to be expected because of the difference from synthetic bristles and how the brushes are made..</li>
            <li> Most of the brushes were very tough and hurt my eyes especially the white ones.</li>
            <li> The small ones are very useful to line the eyes with a dark eyeshadow though.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with their functioning due to low price.</li>
            <li> but when I try to use them for loose mineral eye shadow it really clings to a lot of powder and makes a mess.</li>
            <li> It had been smushed and caused a separation in the bristles so it doesn&#x27;t lay flat anymore.</li>
            <li> comb my brows with the spool and then use the angled flat side to fill in my brows using Anastasia dip brow and powder.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I have only had a few brush hairs shed onto my face so far.</li>
            <li> They do fall off for a bit, and they&#x27;re not very soft.</li>
            <li> only problem I had with this was, one of the brushes (when I was testing for any loose hairs on the brush) had some hairs coming out of them.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I first bought these, but was also really in need of a solid set of everyday detail brushes (that wouldn&#x27;t set me back $80).  </li>
            <li> One of the brushes did come off the stick, but besides being annoying it doesn&#x27;t really matter because you can easily glue it back on.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected</li>
            <li> They are not soft and irritate my eyelid when applying shadows and blending.</li>
            <li> I could have purchased the same item at my local beauty supply store for less.</li>
            <li> and when I dry them (after cleaning them)</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use all of these as a couple are far too small to be of use.  </li>
            <li> and I have to brush the loose bristles off my face.</li>
            <li> Once I took the loose ones out, they worked fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The two brushes that are black, bleed blue.</li>
            <li> I expected crappy quality but this takes the cake</li>
            <li> Got my brushes a week before expected delivery date &amp; immediately tested them out.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Only con is that the angle brush is a little thicker than I anticipated but it still gets the job done!</li>
            <li> The brushes are not very soft or fluffy, and the eyeliner brush isn&#x27;t tapered at the end</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve read from other reviews that you need to wash them before use--</li>
            <li> they are extremely durable.</li>
            <li> and my opinion still stands other than one thing.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t know I wanted/needed the other brushes until they arrived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I was tired of dealing with the mess that the general eye shadow applicators create and the longer handle makes such a difference.  </li>
            <li> I ordered these late night on the 13th and received them on the 16th.</li>
            <li> Totally not worth what I paid for them.</li>
            <li> Even though they were inexpensive, they&#x27;re not worth it.</li>
            <li> i paid $45 for three brushes that are extremely comparible to these!</li>
            <li> The brissles are stiff and don&#x27;t really move making it very hard to apply makeup that looks natural, I am actually completely unable to use them at this point.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that if I&#x27;m too aggressive with the brushes they leave little hairs everywhere, which is quite annoying but more my fault than the brushes.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me being critical, but I didn&#x27;t like that the bristles we&#x27;re hard and harsh on my eyelid.</li>
            <li> It decrease the amount of handels of your typical eye shadow tool.</li>
            <li> the one black ended tip is so stick that it hurts to apply makeup with.</li>
            <li> There are a large and small blending brush, two small smudger brushes,  very small  and small applicator brushes, a pencil brush, a sponge smudger, a spoolie and an angled brush.  </li>
            <li> This collection is somewhat of a disappointment given the positive reviews I read before purchasing the set.  </li>

            <li> the price, I was expecting them to be a little</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been using them everyday for a few weeks</li>
            <li> these are my everyday makeup brushes now</li>
            <li> you have GOT to try this little set of brushes!</li>
            <li> The eyebrown brush was not what i expected it was to fluffy and made it extremely difficult to shape my brows with.</li>

            <li> Cheap...waste of money.</li>
            <li> These are pretty good quality for the price. I&#x27;m not using these professionally - just for myself - and they work fine. One of the brushes did come off the stick, but besides being annoying it doesn&#x27;t really matter because you can easily glue it back on.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t that good honestly. For the price it&#x27;s about reasonable quality.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected but I they&#x27;re softer than most brushes and I love that</li>
            <li> Love them!!! Don&#x27;t complain about quality these were $6!!!! Work great and haven&#x27;t had any issues</li>
            <li> Perfect - exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Instant delivery. Received exactly what the picture depicts. I would recomend to others.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow brushes are awesome! They are of good quality and looks exactly like the picture posted on amazon. The day I ordered these brushes I received them within 3 days and that was awesome. I highly recommend ordering from this seller.</li>
            <li> All that you need in just this set</li>
            <li> Very good - will buy again- amazing quality - nice variety also.</li>
            <li> Good for my use.  Cheap portable brushes for touching up make up.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed and great items</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes. They do the job. They have a nice design and I like the fact that they are double-sided and come in different sizes.</li>
            <li> Perfect for traveling.  Love this set for blending my eyeshadows!</li>
            <li> Love them and I would buy them again!</li>
            <li> I expected crappy quality but this takes the cake</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly and looks as described. Useful</li>
            <li> Love these eyeshadow applicators! They&#x27;re inexpensive yet work so well! I&#x27;m really satisfied!</li>
            <li> Awesome brushes! Grabs and applys excellently!!</li>
            <li> Nice but white brush arrive broken</li>
            <li> Love Love Love them! Love that its double sided and its applys so beautiful. Very soft but sturdy to pick up product, would definitely recommend this to any makeup lovers and beginners. Came within a week and in good condition! Cheap but so worth the buy!</li>
            <li> They work wonderfully :) if you want to buy them you should!</li>
            <li> Great quality and I have nothing bad to say about them. I have never used professional make up brushes so I do not have anything to compare these to however they work excellent for me.</li>
            <li> They get the job don&#x27;t really well, I&#x27;ve washed them a few times and I&#x27;m proud to say there have been no shedding of any kind and they apply makeup very well.</li>
            <li> I use these professionally and have only for about a month. The quality really seems good this far. May even get a second set.</li>
            <li> This is a great set of brushes for the beginning make-up aficionado. The bristles could be softer as they are intended on being used on a sensitive area after all (eyelid). My personal favorites are the larger brown bristled brush, white bristled brush, and eyelash brush. The larger brown bristled brush is great for initial coverage and blending. The white bristled brush is excellent for getting into your eye crease and corner to add depth. The eyelash brush is wonderful for separating your lashes after applying mascara even if your mascara is getting older. That being said, I did not have high expectations and you get what you pay for! If you are serious into make up then I would buy a higher quality set but these are perfect for daily abuse. I have used this set for 2 months now and they are holding up well.</li>
            <li> Great. These are so compact and great for everyday use for travel. I ordered these late night on the 13th and received them on the 16th. Easy to clean and no fall out as of now (today is the 24th and I&#x27;ve used them daily). I definitely will repurchase these when need be. They look exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> Definitely what im looking for :D</li>
            <li> Great brushes for the price!</li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s pretty ok. The only thing I like is the spooly and the eyeliner/lip brushes. I think the bristles are not good. They do fall off for a bit, and they&#x27;re not very soft. They don&#x27;t apply very well for eyeshadows. I&#x27;d say, if you just want to try things out, then it&#x27;s okay. But if you think you want something good for real good price, then this is probably not the best choice since the quality isn&#x27;t good enough.</li>
            <li> The applicators are awesome. 10 applicators for this price and quality is a still. My favorite brush is the eye brow applicator.</li>
            <li> These brushes are my best friends in makeup. There is such a variety and they transfer pigment so well for something so wonderfully cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read from other reviews that you need to wash them before use-- and I had totally planned on doing that-- but I was too excited not to try them out immediately so that didn&#x27;t happen. Luckily, they still seem to work perfectly! No shedding or anything!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d consider myself a beginner at the whole makeup thing (I only got into it for cosplay) and these have been a huge help to me, greatly relieving some of the stress I&#x27;ve felt trying to perfect eyeshadow looks. They&#x27;re great!</li>
            <li> They pretty cheep. The work really good. And they also came in two days. I will buy again thank you!</li>
            <li> The product is okay for an infant but not for a toddler. My son is about one 2 next month and only weighs 22 pounds and we had to hold the float up in order for him not to tip over on the side. If he&#x27;s just 2yr, this product definitely not made for ages 3~5yrs</li>
            <li> I received this about a week after I purchased them and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased! All of the brushes are double ended making them very versatile with endless uses. They are all super soft, hold product very well and seem pretty sturdy. So far they have been holding up well and I&#x27;ve been using them everyday for a few weeks, I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time. It was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> This is extremely the best eye brushes iI&#x27;ve ever gotten. They really do wonders I can finally get the perfect eye shadow look. There hand length but wow I love them and you can take them on the go. (:</li>
            <li> Pretty good brushes...</li>
            <li> Just as picture. Good buy!</li>
            <li> Great working brushes good quality and price</li>
            <li> Very well made and wash out great also.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price. I&#x27;ve moved on to better brushes but they are a good place to start for someone who only needs basic everyday makeup brushes</li>
            <li> Love these brushes..they are soft and apply very well..GREAT for the price.</li>
            <li> The brushes are really versatile and I like the variety. They don&#x27;t shed much. It&#x27;s a really great set for beginners. I would say the brushes are medium stiffness, but I prefer that in brushes, especially if they angled brushes. No complaints here.</li>
            <li> I ordered theses awhile ago and now im having to buy a new brush set. Some of the brushes are kind of hard and when I dry them (after cleaning them) the bristles shed. Sometimes they even shed while I apply my makeup and I have to brush the loose bristles off my face. So, overall, for their price and purpose they are a good start, but I would recommend using these until you can purchase something better.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these brushes! These are actuly my go to, daily brushes over my Sigmas. They are nice and compact. I like that they&#x27;re like a &amp;#34;two in one&amp;#34;. The quality isn&#x27;t top of the line, but definitely exceeded my expectations for the price. I&#x27;d recommend these for sure!</li>
            <li> Brushes are cheaply made</li>
            <li> Good brush set for every day make up.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much when I ordered these brushes but was quite surprised how incredible these brushes were.. they were soft good consistency and didn&#x27;t shed at all... if you are in need for a great quality brushes you should buy these</li>
            <li> Ok brushes but they are a lot smaller and flimsier than they look, you get what you pay for I gues.</li>
            <li> These are really good quality for such a good price! The angled brush is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Thank you , its graet</li>
            <li> I really love these brushes but they weren&#x27;t that soft on my eyes</li>
            <li> I find these brushes to be very impressive, given that you technically get 10 brushes for just $6. The smaller brushes, however, are pretty stiff and it kind of hurts to apply eyeshadow with them. The small ones are very useful to line the eyes with a dark eyeshadow though. The bigger ones work perfectly and are extremely soft. Overall I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> Pretty nice set for the money. I bought these for my wife since she&#x27;s just starting out with &amp;#34;pro&amp;#34; makeup. Each brush has a nice feel to it and the wide range of styles is good for most applications.</li>
            <li> im actually using these as clean up brushes for nail art. they are extremely durable. im very very pleased and very impressed.  great buy.</li>
            <li> Love the double ended brushes great for eyes shadow i even use 1 of the brushes for my lip stick and blending it</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used them yet but it&#x27;s all the brushes you need in one package !</li>
            <li> The service was fast. I received the brushes quick. When I received them I washed them immediately the same way that I was all of my brushes. The two brushes that are black, bleed blue. After a couple of rinses and uses, the color stops bleeding. I only use two that are my favorites but these are decent brushes for the cost.</li>
            <li> Brushes aren&#x27;t soft :(</li>
            <li> Small but useful. Great for travelling and gets the job done, The blending brush blends pretty well. Great product for the price</li>
            <li> great for the price. I got 5 sets of 5 brushes when I actually thought I was just getting 5 brushes lol.....  good deal !</li>
            <li> I have given only a one star for the fact I only use one of these brushes and that&#x27;s the eyebrow comb. They are not soft and irritate my eyelid when applying shadows and blending. Chance you take buying cheap brushes.</li>
            <li> sturdy applicators!  cleans easy.  spooly is the best i&#x27;ve tried so far</li>
            <li> Love these brushes. They&#x27;re sturdy brushes. Exactly as depicted.</li>
            <li> The eyebrown brush was not what i expected it was to fluffy and made it extremely difficult to shape my brows with.</li>
            <li> I needed some brushes just for eyeshadows. Product was nice for what I paid for it. I like that they are double sided</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had makeup brushes before, just the little foam things that come in eyeshadow packs, and let me tell you, these make it a lot easier to make your makeup look good. They&#x27;re pretty good quality and quite soft and easy to tap any extra powder off each time. I&#x27;ve found that if I&#x27;m too aggressive with the brushes they leave little hairs everywhere, which is quite annoying but more my fault than the brushes. There&#x27;s a good variety of sizes and shapes, too.</li>
            <li> Great product. A couple bristles fell out of the concealer brushes upon first use but that&#x27;s normal. Definitely recommend for the price.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had these brushes for more than a couple of days yet and have only used one of them. The one I used worked very well and the others will do the same I&#x27;m sure. Product cane on time and undamaged. Seems to be a great del for the price.</li>
            <li> These brushes are well made and works wonders!</li>
            <li> The only one I like is the eyebrow brush. The other brushes aren&#x27;t that soft and the angled brush is too think to give precise lines when doing my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I gave this product 2 stars because I don&#x27;t really like the brushes. I&#x27;ve only used them once to try it out when I first got it. So may be I will try them again. But from my experience it didn&#x27;t blend my eye shadows in too well.</li>
            <li> Very good price, the set arrived quick, and it&#x27;s very good set I&#x27;m not a pro in make up, but I love this set, the difference in applying makeup is very noticeable, the little sponge that comes with make doesn&#x27;t compare.</li>
            <li> These are cool tools you never have to worry about loosing them and it is so cool how they are on both sides can&#x27;t go wrong with the price</li>
            <li> This was a good purchase.  My daughter has to apply make up before she makes dance presentations and I was tired of dealing with the mess that the general eye shadow applicators create and the longer handle makes such a difference.  She is now able to do it herself with these.</li>
            <li> Different brushes for a cheap price. I like it :)</li>
            <li> Great selection of smaller brushes</li>
            <li> Good brushes however, be prepared for the rapping of the brushes to come off. I do makeup and uses brushes daily. They are good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great! You can use each and everyone for a different part of your face, especially your eyes. Really good quality for the price !</li>
            <li> LOVE these brushes! They&#x27;re cheap and work very effectively!</li>
            <li> For someone who doesn&#x27;t know much about makeup, I thought these brushes were awesome!</li>
            <li> I got this set to do my wedding makeup and was very pleased with the results! There is a really good variety in brush shape, texture, and firmness, which gives tons of application options. I got some great ideas on how to use these different brushes to best accentuate my face by going to a mall makeup store and paying close attention while having my makeup done. I used the same brushes and techniques for a couple weeks to gain experience and then was confident enough to move on and use the rest of the brushes as well.</li>
            <li> I purchased this set of brushes from \\&quot;Maya Beauty\\&quot; and they were delivered in just over a week in excellent condition. I needed a few more smaller detail eye brushes and wanted some  more that had natural bristles. These are a great mix of pony,goat &amp; boar hairs and pick up/blend products beautifully! If you&#x27;ve never tried natural bristles vs synthetic...you have GOT to try this little set of brushes! I have more expensive natural hair brushes that don&#x27;t perform this well, so at this low price point...it&#x27;s a win-win!! Be forewarned though....when you first purchase natural hair brushes, there IS just a little more than usual fallout before the brushes are washed/conditioned than there is from synthetic brushes. This is normal and is to be expected because of the difference from synthetic bristles and how the brushes are made.. so don&#x27;t let it upset and deter you. And you WILL have to wash/condition these brushes before use (which of course, you SHOULD be doing anyway!!) because natural animal hair is much coarser and more porous than the synthetic bristles most ppl are used to in their brushes. With this set...the most fallout is from the c-shape brush,the flat shader brush &amp; the larger white blending brush...so expect that when you first receive them. The shedding stops AFTER they are washed/conditioned and you&#x27;ll notice a world of difference in the application/blending of your products. (Besides using the ELF Daily Brush Cleaner...I use a mix of 5-7tblsp. each of Lavender Baby shampoo &amp; Anti-bacterial liquid Soap  with 1/4 tsp. Virgin Olive Oil &amp; Grapeseed Oil in a small squeeze bottle and fill remaining space in bottle with distilled Rose Water to condition-deepwash all my brushes once a week...I find that nothing else works as well to keep my brushes deep-cleaned,in perfect shape, &amp; makes them last in like brand new condition for years). Using just virgin olive oil OR grapeseed oil mixed with Baby shampoo &amp; Anti-bacterial liquid soap will work just as well...youdon&#x27;t have to use both at the same time. I&#x27;ve known some ppl to use just their regular shampoo/conditioner combined products to wash their makeup brushes, but I think this just builds up on makeup brushes just as it does on one&#x27;s hair and eventually causes either the brushes to wear out faster and/or causes them to not perform as useful tools as well because of the build up of chemicals from the shampoo/conditioner. I&#x27;ve noticed these same ppl have to replace their daily brushes a lot more frequently than I do and I wonder if the way they care for them is the reason why.</li>
            <li> I got my brushes very fast!! I didn&#x27;t expect them to be  as nice as they were being that I paid a cheap amount, I love them, I would defiantly buy more items from this buyer.</li>
            <li> Amazing for the price. She&#x27;s 6 bucks you can spend on some makeup brushes. Everything you need in a starter at home bathroom set.</li>
            <li> These are great for blending. Soft and small for precise blending of eyeshadow. I was pleasantly surprised with their functioning due to low price. A good buy for budget brushes</li>
            <li> The buyer removed my negative comment, because they issued me a refund.  However, I felt that I should give fair warning that these brushes are very cheap and small.  They also did not work well with the make up I use.  I do not recommend these brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these since I bought them in April 2014. They were really cheap and I wasn&#x27;t sure about the quality but this was a huge surprise! Absolutely perfect. I use them everyday and cleaning them is exceptionally easy. I definitely recommend this set!</li>
            <li> Amazing brushes!!! Great low cost amazing application !! Super pleased!</li>
            <li> Love them&lt;br /&gt;Wish they came with a case</li>
            <li> The bag came ripped and one of the brushes was out and broken already. The brushes are not very soft or fluffy, and the eyeliner brush isn&#x27;t tapered at the end so you can&#x27;t get a fine line. Ok if you&#x27;re just starting out and want to experiment, but not a pro kit. Go figure, for $5.</li>
            <li> great assortment, great price, and a cool little case to carry them.</li>
            <li> Was ok the brushes not that soft... But the seller service is great.</li>
            <li> Love this set of applicator brushes, especially the fact that they are double-sided so they take up less room. This is perfect and the set meets all my makeup needs.</li>
            <li> Was surprised of the quality, due to the price, I assumed they wouldn&#x27;t be ok for daily use but would be great for my Travel makeup kit. No hair loss, the bristles are soft to the touch. I love them so much. I&#x27;m going to order another set, since I said forget the travel kit these are my everyday makeup brushes now</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for</li>
            <li> These brushes are so convenient.  I love the double-sides. I use the eyebrow brush daily. The quality is outstanding and the price is too!</li>
            <li> I bought these about... 1 year ago and they are still in good condition . I dont where alot of make up though... so maybe that has alot to do with it .</li>
            <li> As far as I&#x27;m concerned it has all the brushes I need to get the desired look that I always like to have when applying eyeshadow. It also have what I need to do my eyebrows and eyelashes. It can tend to shed. But that is expected when purchasing a cheap item. Some of the bristles can be a little scratchy. So beware of that if you have sensitive skin. Maybe there is some kind of solution that can be use to clean them and make them a little softer? If there is please let me know. What is do love about it is that it is double ended, multipurpose use with each peice. It decrease the amount of handels of your typical eye shadow tool.</li>
            <li> These are nice applicators. They are about three times longer then the common kind that come with your eye shadow and so far no loose bristles or any other kind of problems.</li>
            <li> I literally came on amazon to repurchase these brushes because I lost 2 because I would literally take them everywhere because they are SO AMAZING and I use them everyday!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, I was expecting them to be a little cheap- I won&#x27;t lie. BUT they&#x27;re surprisingly great quality!! And the fact that they&#x27;re DOUBLE SIDED OMG!!! I swear I don&#x27;t even wear makeup that often but using these versatile brushes make putting makeup on so fun that I&#x27;ve been wearing it EVERYDAY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sisters (who are fans of makeup) are very jealous if my brushes and I&#x27;m pretty sure they stole a couple so that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m here buying another set!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller was terrific and prompt as well :)</li>
            <li> Best makeup brush value ever. Had a couple straggly bristles on the fuller brushes, but no shedding whatsoever. They load well and apply beautifully.</li>
            <li> Great item for a great price.</li>
            <li> Look better pictured than in person. Appear more cheap when received in the mail. Work well though! Not what I was looking for exactly but I like it.</li>
            <li> Some fell apart . Others work great.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t good quality. I mean they are cheap so I guess you can&#x27;t expect much</li>
            <li> Loved. Definitely worth the price.  Would repurchase and recommend.</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes!  Easy to clean and are awesome for building up product. Brow brush however,  is something else. The spoolie end is great,  but the angled brow side is kinda weak,  not as sturdy as i expected.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for, there is an initial fallout with some of the bristles but all in all they&#x27;re great to work with</li>
            <li> the angled end of the eyebrow brush is quite soft, so i don&#x27;t use it. but the rest of the brushes are fine. the quality is king of cheap on some but I just bought them to save space on traveling. Love them though</li>
            <li> These brushes works very well but they are super small. I thought it would be a regular size brush but they are more travel size. All in all they are great, picks up product great and blends out very well.</li>
            <li> The mascara looking wand was broken upon arrival, but the other four brushes were in good order and are a nice quality.&lt;br /&gt;I especially like the white tipped brush and the eye liner brush. Well worth it for the price.</li>
            <li> they ware ok for a cheap price.</li>
            <li> they work great and save a lot of space since it&#x27;s two on one :).</li>
            <li> This is a very practical set for traveling, the only caveat being that it doesn&#x27;t have a blush/powder brush. But you have great shadow brushes, one for eyeliner, one for shaping eye color as well as combing the brows! And one thing&#x27;s for sure: This set is a great value!</li>
            <li> Wonderful, especially considering the price.</li>
            <li> Got my brushes a week before expected delivery date &amp; immediately tested them out. They are very good quality for the price ! I&#x27;m super glad I bought them :)</li>
            <li> great quaillity brushes for cheap</li>
            <li> comes with more brushes that i would actually use. great little things love it</li>
            <li> Nice set for cheap. Good value.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too fussy about my eye makeup but these were just what I needed. Simple and effective.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping was awesome! i paid $45 for three brushes that are extremely comparible to these! they are soft and apply great with my mineral powders, I of course conditioned them with baby shampoo first and let them air dry. There was only three or so stray hairs that fell off between the 4 brushes so they held up well thru the washing. They clean off well after each color of shadow so they are perfect for multi colored eye looks! Im sure i will be buying more sets for myself and a few family members, especially my mother, &amp;#34;Diane&amp;#34;. lol</li>
            <li> I was very happy with this purchase. I mostly just needed a couple brushes with fine, firm bristles and the rest are nice bonuses. For the money, and Amazon Prime shipping, a great buy.</li>
            <li> Good brushes for the price.  Great for on the go or touch ups.</li>
            <li> Totally not worth what I paid for them. I could have purchased the same item at my local beauty supply store for less.</li>
            <li> These will work fine and were much less costly than other sets. Nothing fancy but gets the job done.</li>
            <li> This thing is perfect for what I need. Makes my brows much easier to do.</li>
            <li> These brushes are the best!!! I used 3of them today. They were shipped out on time and they arrived on timed also. These brushes will be handy when I travel so I don&#x27;t have to pack my entire brush collections. I recommend these brushes and remember to wash these once you get them. They aren&#x27;t dirty or anything but with all the germs and things it&#x27;s best to cleanse them before using.</li>
            <li> A few of the brushes are nicely made, a few of them look like qualities are not as well. But for the money you pay, it is not a bad set.</li>
            <li> They are ok the bristles come out but other than that they are ok.</li>
            <li> The applicators are great. They hold perfect quality. I was very happy but I bought these on prime and relieved the product 5 days later. It was received on q Friday but promised on a Wednesday. Not to upset due to great quality. Just wanted them sooner</li>
            <li> Not great, but they do what they&#x27;re supposed to. Kind of. The brushes shed really easily and some are really hard. The quality varies brush to brush and on each head. I would suggest something like an Eco Tools or Real Techniques set for a similar price and much better quality.</li>
            <li> Not a bad set of brushes. These would be ok as a 1st set of make-up brushes.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great for beginners.&lt;br /&gt;They pick up product very well, and each tool does its job the way it&#x27;s supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I had with this was, one of the brushes (when I was testing for any loose hairs on the brush) had some hairs coming out of them. Once I took the loose ones out, they worked fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, these are a great buy for anyone on a tight budget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Update): I&#x27;ve had these brushes for awhile now and my opinion still stands other than one thing. One of the brushes bristles feel rough and uncomfortable on the eyelid. The other brushes are fine, but I would recommend buying elf brushes which are softer and much better than these brushes.</li>
            <li> I saw so many great reviews on this product and they were mostly good so I decided to buy it. Most of the brushes were very tough and hurt my eyes especially the white ones. Plus the white ones stained very quickly (I guess that is expected). The eyebrow spolie was alright. The lip brushes were awful. I was truly disappointed in these products.</li>
            <li> These are awesome such great quality for such a low price ! I&#x27;ll be ordering more !</li>
            <li> These are pretty nice.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting too much, because you just never know sometimes when you find a good price whether the products are going to be &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; or reasonable.  I like these!  Each brush does what it is supposed to do and I have only had a few brush hairs shed onto my face so far.</li>
            <li> Loveee these! For the price, they are beautiful! I use these more than I use my name brand ones from Sephora or Tech. I love them!</li>
            <li> Very good for the price</li>
            <li> I love them they got here on time. Nd the brushes are really nice</li>
            <li> i really love the way they blend &amp;apply, just dnt know how to organize them because they are double headed. dnt really like keeping my brushes layed out on the counter.. but exceptions have been made for these babies!</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a great value, however I received the eyebrow brush (the one I really purchased the set for) slightly damaged from shipping. It had been smushed and caused a separation in the bristles so it doesn&#x27;t lay flat anymore. After multiple washes and cleanings it&#x27;s still smushed and separated. Hopefully over time it goes back, but the rest of the brushes are great! And seriously, what a value!</li>
            <li> Very worth the price - the brushes are so versatile, and for an amateur like me, the quality is perfect.</li>
            <li> They are ok. It does the job have not used all of them yet.</li>
            <li> I only wanted the spooly brush for my brows,&lt;br /&gt;but didn&#x27;t know I wanted/needed the other brushes until they arrived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I comb my brows with the spool and then use the angled flat side to fill in my brows using Anastasia dip brow and powder.&lt;br /&gt;I actually like this brush better than the Anastasia brand because the bristles and spool are gentler and easier to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the other brushes to spot conceal or apply liquid lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re technically getting 10 brushes for ~$6, its an awesome deal.</li>
            <li> I knew these wouldn&#x27;t be great when I ordered them, as they were ridiculously cheap. But they were even more cheaply made than I expected. Multiple strands fall out with each use, so I&#x27;m expecting them to completely fall apart any day now. Even though they were inexpensive, they&#x27;re not worth it.</li>
            <li> Beautiful and good quality product, recommended.</li>
            <li> I love this brush set! Great quality for the price! I&#x27;m very satisfied! Only con is that the angle brush is a little thicker than I anticipated but it still gets the job done!</li>
            <li> Very nice brush set ! Glad I bought them !</li>
            <li> hair fall out already</li>
            <li> Might not be the highest quality brushes, but they so the job for the price!</li>
            <li> I like these brushes.  They work just fine for my smokey eyes :)</li>
            <li> These are really nice but when I try to use them for loose mineral eye shadow it really clings to a lot of powder and makes a mess. Might work great for compact eye shadow.</li>
            <li> I can wholeheartedly recommend these brushes. For the price they are awesome. I think these are good for someone whose practicing getting their makeup applied  flawlessly. But with time and more practice you may need to order a better set.</li>
            <li> Thank you! Great item! Fast delivery</li>
            <li> Price is good, but poor-cheap quality.  the mascara wand was bent. the white tipped brush has stray brush hairs sticking out at both ends. the one black ended tip is so stick that it hurts to apply makeup with. Went to return it, but guess its not eligible for return. Giving the makeup brushes to the girls to put in their paint kit. darn!</li>
            <li> I have purchased cheap make up brushes before and in the past they&#x27;ve needed to be replaced pretty quickly but the brushes were very soft and j was able to use them. This is not the case with this set of brushes. The brissles are stiff and don&#x27;t really move making it very hard to apply makeup that looks natural, I am actually completely unable to use them at this point. I may try soaking them to soften up the brissles but I would have liked to use them without having to treat them.</li>
            <li> Small but good for its price</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. everything you need here.</li>
            <li> They are pretty good for apply makeup but a couple are very similar</li>
            <li> I WISH I BOUGHT 2 :( I LOVE THESE</li>
            <li> This set has nine brushes and a spoolie.  There are a large and small blending brush, two small smudger brushes,  very small  and small applicator brushes, a pencil brush, a sponge smudger, a spoolie and an angled brush.  This collection is somewhat of a disappointment given the positive reviews I read before purchasing the set.  I won&#x27;t use all of these as a couple are far too small to be of use.  I do like that there is one on each end, which makes this set perfect for travel.  That is, IF the brushes were better quality.  I purchased this set for a gift and I&#x27;m almost to embarrassed to give it to her.  True, it wasn&#x27;t expensive, in fact, it was quite cheap.  But given the number of positive reviews, I expected to receive something much better than I did.  I&#x27;m debating whether to send it back.  Five bucks is five bucks and this set is proof positive that you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I first bought these, but was also really in need of a solid set of everyday detail brushes (that wouldn&#x27;t set me back $80).  These are seriously amazing -- there isn&#x27;t a day in the week when I don&#x27;t need to reach for at least ONE of these brushes, and they perform like a dream.  Surprisingly great quality and build.  I&#x27;m debating getting another set, just for the heck of it!</li>
            <li> Not what I expected. The hairs in the brushes are sloppy, looks and feel very cheap in quality. At least it was cheap.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me being critical, but I didn&#x27;t like that the bristles we&#x27;re hard and harsh on my eyelid. I am giving it 4 stars instead of 3 because each side have different brush sizes, which I like.</li>
            <li> I use these a lot, very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> These brushes aren&#x27;t crazy soft, dense, and good quality; but they get the job done and they&#x27;re decent especially for the price. I would compare them to the brushes from the elf (eyes, lips, and face) brand.</li>
            <li> The packaging isn&#x27;t great if you are giving it as a gift, but the products are superb!</li>
            <li> Love love love  the spoolie</li>
            <li> Worth the money? Hard to say.&lt;br /&gt;Just keep in mind the measurements. they are a lot smaller than they look. but they get the job done, so i guess their okay.</li>
            <li> All the brushes are nice and good quality and this whole set is perfect for travelling.</li>
            <li> I love double sided brushes and these are soft and don&#x27;t take up too much room in my purse.</li>
            <li> I use these brushes for everything! Love them. I literally have nothing bad to say about these brushes</li>
