    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>it&#x27;s great!!!</li>
            <li>Excellent.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s a good listener.</li>
            <li>Good quality.</li>
            <li>Even better!</li>
            <li>Nice compact size that cut nails well.  </li>
            <li>love these Slant Edge Clipper, good for the price, and useful!</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>Are able to get close to fingernails</li>
            <li>Edge could be better but they work......</li>
            <li>They are the best at getting hand nails and general clean up around your nails.</li>
            <li>I use this clipper to cut off hangnails and trim my cuticles, but it really doesn&#x27;t do a good job.</li>
            <li>Unique item not seen in most stores.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still better than nothing I suppose and probably worth the price I paid</li>
            <li>Found these for cheap on Amazon, in a two pack.</li>
            <li>For many years you could find top quality slant edge fingernail clippers in most any drugstore or department store that sold the standard curved edge fingernail clippers.  </li>
            <li>These allow you to be much more exact when trimming your nails and the area around.</li>
            <li>To be perfectly honest I can only say they are better than nothing</li>
            <li>but I would pay3x as much for the La Crosse one that works a lot better.</li>
            <li>Both types were almost the exact same size and would fit very easily on a keychain.  </li>
            <li>I guess you win this round, Nicky&#x27;s Gift Co.</li>
            <li>but I certainly would not buy them again.</li>
            <li>works good for those hard to get angled cuts.</li>
            <li>Very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li>I expected these to have a better edge on them.</li>
            <li>They would last for many years without becoming dull or worn out.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>Works excellent on those difficult spots to get to with an ordinary straight clipper.</li>
            <li>I have an old pair of these slant edge clippers that is &amp;#34;la crosse&amp;#34; brand</li>
            <li>The problem is that the blades are dull and do not make a clean cut.  </li>
            <li>This is at least the second time I have ordered 2 or 3 of these special slant edge fingernail clippers</li>

            <li> The problem is that the blades are dull and do not make a clean cut.  </li>
            <li> This is at least the second time I have ordered 2 or 3 of these special slant edge fingernail clippers</li>
            <li> the blade part is thicker and not as sharp so as a result it does not work nearly as well as getting the cuticles which is what i used the other one for.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the money to send back.</li>
            <li> the only thing is the shipping time is a little long.</li>
            <li> Cutting edges are sharp and strong.</li>
            <li> We watched Buffy and did each other&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> and I have been looking all over drug-stores and other places for a replacement pair but cannot find them.  </li>
            <li> Tips are not that sharp, have areas on tips that snag (raised edges).  </li>
            <li> I figured out online that these are hard to find so ordered this one hoping it would be the same.  </li>
            <li> Typically the well-known brands for both style clippers were:  Lacrosse, Trim and Revlon.  </li>
            <li> Durable and heavy.  </li>
            <li> Of course with enough pressure they will cut thin fingernails.</li>
            <li> Therefore when I learned that Amazon carried them I ordered them on at least one other occasion</li>
            <li> I hate using the larger, flat clippers.</li>
            <li> instructions were confusing.</li>
            <li> Now you cannot find the slant edge fingernail clippers anywhere, at least not in all of Metro Atlanta.</li>
            <li> I had trouble cutting some of the things I wanted to cut with them.</li>
            <li> I hate using any other type of cuticle trimmer, so</li>
            <li> Difficult to use.</li>
            <li> and I have been disappointed in the quality of the product both times.  </li>

            <li> Love,love this product. Works excellent on those difficult spots to get to with an ordinary straight clipper. Highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> instructions were confusing. could not assemble. Built summoning circle for Bill Nye. Got lesser known Phil Nye. We watched Buffy and did each other&#x27;s hair. He&#x27;s a good listener.</li>
            <li> love these Slant Edge Clipper, good for the price, and useful!</li>
            <li> Durable and heavy.  Work well.</li>
            <li> This is at least the second time I have ordered 2 or 3 of these special slant edge fingernail clippers and I have been disappointed in the quality of the product both times.

To be perfectly honest I can only say they are better than nothing but I certainly would not buy them again.</li>
            <li> works good for those hard to get angled cuts.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great!!! i can now deal with my nail! the only thing is the shipping time is a little long.</li>
            <li> They do not cut all the way through. Very dissatisfied. Not worth the money to send back.</li>
            <li> I love it. Good quality.</li>
            <li> I have an old pair of these slant edge clippers that is &amp;#34;la crosse&amp;#34; brand and I have been looking all over drug-stores and other places for a replacement pair but cannot find them.  I figured out online that these are hard to find so ordered this one hoping it would be the same.  It is technical the same design but the blade part is thicker and not as sharp so as a result it does not work nearly as well as getting the cuticles which is what i used the other one for.  It&#x27;s still better than nothing I suppose and probably worth the price I paid but I would pay3x as much for the La Crosse one that works a lot better.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted. Excellent.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t find these in any store around me. I was so grateful to find these again. I love them. They are the best at getting hand nails and general clean up around your nails.</li>
            <li> It does the job, but the blades could be a lot sharper. I hate using any other type of cuticle trimmer, so I guess you win this round, Nicky&#x27;s Gift Co.</li>
            <li> I expected these to have a better edge on them. I had trouble cutting some of the things I wanted to cut with them. Of course with enough pressure they will cut thin fingernails. I found them wanting. They were supposed to be side cutters as well and they were not&lt;br /&gt;They were just a slant. Difficult to use.</li>
            <li> Tips are not that sharp, have areas on tips that snag (raised edges).  Are able to get close to fingernails</li>
            <li> I use this clipper to cut off hangnails and trim my cuticles, but it really doesn&#x27;t do a good job. it doesn&#x27;t get close enough to the skin.</li>
            <li> Edge could be better but they work......</li>
            <li> I hate using the larger, flat clippers. These allow you to be much more exact when trimming your nails and the area around. Found these for cheap on Amazon, in a two pack. Even better!</li>
            <li> Nice compact size that cut nails well.  Cutting edges are sharp and strong. Shipping was prompt and we&#x27;ll packaged. Unique item not seen in most stores.</li>
