            <li>So, I am rating it 4 stars because it is a well made perfume, even though it is too sweet for my taste.</li>

            <li> Small inexpensive way to try perfumes.  This was ok but I didn&#x27;t love it.  Not too strong, just not what i was looking for</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000NVFWB8 Bora Bora By Liz Claiborne for Women, 0.17 Ounce]] So far, I&#x27;m loving this fragrance. It&#x27;s a really nice scent and stays on quite well without being overpowering. It has a sweet, tropical scent but not excessively so. I don&#x27;t use it everyday because it&#x27;s small but I carry it around in my handbag for during the day touch-ups, and it usually lasts all night with just a few dabs. It&#x27;s not my absolute fav fragrance, but I do enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipment</li>
            <li> I tried this fragrance after seeing favourable reviews elsewhere.  I found it to be summery, tropical but not too sweet.  Not in my top five fragrances but I do like it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful stuff!&lt;br /&gt;Love the light, fruity scent of this cute little bottle and I&#x27;m asking for a full sized bottle for Xmas. ;)</li>
            <li> Has a sweet floral scent with little ambiguity. Pretty direct and to the point. The scent would probably best suit a mature women. The scent does last a long time, and a little goes a long way. So, I am rating it 4 stars because it is a well made perfume, even though it is too sweet for my taste.</li>
            <li> Yikes!  This is less than a sample!  Great fragrance though.  Bought for my sister as she does not like flashy things, but wanted to give her one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> Lesson learned. This is one of those things that smells great on certain people but I will never buy fragrance without trying it out first ever again.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite scents. The price is unbeatable for the size bottle. Bora bora has a long lasting scent not overpowering; a very attractive scent!</li>
            <li> very classic scent, love it</li>
            <li> I was so happy to get this perfume.  Liz Claiborne had stopped making this fragrance.  I was so happy to find it on Amazon.  I bought two.  Very nice, light and refreshing scent.</li>
            <li> This is a nice smelling perfume that is a great gift. The bottle is tiny, but it is perfect for the purse or to give as a gift.</li>
            <li> I love Liz scents and I have enjoyed Bora Bora for over 10yrs. I am 29 and I have loved it from the beginning. When I was dating I would get lots of \\&quot; you smell so sweet\\&quot; n when I met my husband he would jus cuddle me and inhale my sweet Bora Bora. Now for Xmas Bday anniversary mothers day he can never go wrong</li>
            <li> Ordered it as an add-on for $4 and I must say- it does smell really good!  Great spring/summer smell.  It&#x27;s a light fragrance- but still potent enough.  Doesn&#x27;t last all day (from what I can tell), so I apply just a dab on my wrists and under my neck when I want to refresh the smell. This is a .17 oz bottle; there&#x27;s no sprayer..so must be careful that this doesn&#x27;t open up in your purse. The top is pretty secure- haven&#x27;t had any problems with it so far.  Great to carry around in the purse, and way better than a sampler because even though .17 oz doesn&#x27;t seem like a lot- there is plenty of perfume in this bottle to last a good while when used sparingly.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s favorite</li>
            <li> Make the transformation become a real woman a constant head turner.Borra Borra.The fragrance that brings you into the light.</li>
            <li> Scent was delicate, but the bottle was hard to open with a top that did not screw on.  The top had to be pushed up to open and it was tricky to not spill.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume and was so glad to get a sample.  liz claiborne needs to put this back on the market!</li>
