            <li>It works beautifully.</li>
            <li>Kinerase makes great products.</li>
            <li>So, if you&#x27;re happy with another cleanser, I wouldn&#x27;t urge you to change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Kinerase is a great product line.</li>
            <li>Amazon has a great price for it.  </li>
            <li>Very popular at dermatalogist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li>Feels good on my skin and protects against the sun damage.</li>
            <li>I have used kinerase for years and have always loved the cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I will not be buying it again, as I didn&#x27;t think it did anything spectacular.  </li>
            <li>and I really liked it because it cleaned</li>
            <li>I think this is one of the best cleansers I&#x27;ve tried to-date for my sensitive,  dehydrated skin.  </li>
            <li>A wonderful product for sensitive skin and retaining moisture.  </li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t post reviews, however this face wash has done so much good for my skin that I can&#x27;t help it!</li>
            <li>This cleanser, i find is okay.</li>
            <li>My husband and I love this cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I love this product- as well as the line and recommend it to all.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for years and love it.</li>
            <li>For the price that I pay they could do so so much better.</li>
            <li>Great, gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li>Love this...</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>A top notch cleanser.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>This is the best stuff, your face is so soft and clean after using it.</li>
            <li>Very gentle, no fragrance so perfect for sensitive or acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li>Glad it&#x27;s available on amazon .  </li>
            <li>cleanser clears off make up and mascara easily and does not irritate my skin or cause any additional redness.  </li>
            <li>like and mix easily with water.</li>
            <li>I also like that it lathers up nicely, that you don&#x27;t have to use more than a pump or so, and it doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent.</li>
            <li>I try new face washes from time to time and the winners serve their purpose (Josie Maran&#x27;s Argan Oil Cleanser for getting ALL of the makeup off; DDF&#x27;s Glycolic Cleanser for a minty, tingly clean with the excellent effects of a gentle peel while still falling into the safe-during-pregnancy category according to my dermatologist, etc.), but this cleanser is one that I ALWAYS have on hand.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and the skin care specialist treating my face said this product would be good for my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is also very effective in removing makeup but does not dry out your skin at all.  </li>
            <li>I like it very much, but I can use Aquaphor --another very gentle cleanser--and get good results for less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A huge huge challenge.</li>
            <li>It was gentle, smooth out of the bottle and worked up a nice lather no matter the type of water you have in your home.</li>
            <li>It used to be smooth and lotion</li>
            <li>and it is fabulous.</li>
            <li>I have used Kinerase Gentle Daily Cleaner for years, and it&#x27;s always wonderful.</li>
            <li>The version at Walgreen&#x27;s now is no where near as good.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t come close to giving my skin that clean feeling the original formula</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to clean as well as the Neutrogena Naturals cleanser, which is alot cheaper.  </li>
            <li>Can even be used to clean off eye makeup.</li>
            <li>Although I cannot afford most of Kinerase products, I really like them.</li>
            <li>Love this product, gently wash away impurity.</li>
            <li>I love this line, though the price is a bit high..</li>
            <li>The consistency is clumpy (someone mentioned &amp;#34;semen&amp;#34; like, and that&#x27;s accurate - and funny.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very much worth the price tag.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>This is actually an awesome product that I&#x27;ve used before but this particular one came lumpy and thick...</li>
            <li>I used to buy it at Sephora, but since they&#x27;ve stopped carrying it Amazon has been my go-to (and probably even at a better price - score!).&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s gentle enough not to irritate my skin, especially when trying to go easy on it after a good exfoliation, etc., but still strong enough to give my skin a thorough cleaning.</li>
            <li>This product is very gentle and does not cause my face to breakout or become flushed or irritated.  </li>
            <li>the cleanser makes your face feel soft and silky + smooth.</li>
            <li>I still can&#x27;t tolerate much on my skin!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li>Before using this cream I was breaking out but can&#x27;t be 100% sure if its this line that helped or my constant exfoliations...</li>
            <li>Many doctors who specialize in facial rejuvination, surgery, sell this product.</li>
            <li>Next time I&#x27;ll order the one with the pump for more convenience.</li>
            <li>I miss this product so much!</li>
            <li>My favorite cleanser and the only one I ever use.</li>
            <li>Thankfully, kinerase has not changed its cleansing formula, this product is smooth, light and  doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily or dry after using.</li>
            <li>They are $$$$ but really worth it because they keep your skin young looking and fresh.</li>
            <li>I recommend the cleanser because it is so gentle and consistently keep my skin clean and soft, I just don&#x27;t recommend you buy it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Amazon has great deals on products, but sometimes you wait until the last minute and drive down the street to pick-up a product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle on the skin and leaves my skin very soft but after trying this I still prefer Origins Pure Cream.</li>
            <li>We enjoy the clean, not dry feeling this provides without multiple products.</li>
            <li>Really??</li>
            <li>It really cleans my face.&lt;br /&gt;Jeanne Alsup</li>
            <li>Gentle and does not irritate eyes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m grateful the product remains available via Amazon, although the amount per container dropped from 6.5 oz to 5.0 oz while the price remains the same.</li>
            <li>Gentle on older skin.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product for someone looking for a gentle skin cleanser that also removes makeup well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve started on the path of finding a new cleanser to replace this one and have moved on to Perricone MD&#x27;s gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li>I would give it 5 stars except it is priced too high.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I really recommend this product to anyone with skin like mine, or anyone who wants a quality product in general!</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, if you already use other Kinerase products and want the continuity/synergy of the products, yes, feel free to use this.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and rosacea.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry out your face and has a mild foaming action, unlike some that leave your face feeling greasy after washing.  </li>
            <li>We both have sensitive skin and have&lt;br /&gt;been</li>
            <li>My skin feels cleansed,  soft and refreshed after each use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sensitive, acne prone and at 38</li>
            <li>Some anti-aging properties, and my sensitive skin doesn&#x27;t react.</li>
            <li>like it&#x27;s old or defective.</li>
            <li>Contacted company directly two weeks ago and not a peep.  </li>
            <li>I have used Kinerase Gentle Daily Cleanser for years.  </li>
            <li>Buy this stuff directly from kinerase.</li>
            <li>I have dry skin, and live at high altitute, but you can&#x27;t tell when i use this.</li>
            <li>This was the first time I bought the cleanser anywhere other than Kinerase directly</li>
            <li>I usually love Kinerase products, but when I received this, I was surprised when it was clumpy and thick!</li>
            <li>Often times, I have to go back to the container again to have enough soap for my forehead (and no, I don&#x27;t have an exceptionally large forehead).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Kinerase&#x27;s Gentle Daily Cleanser for, I believe, the last 6-7 years</li>
            <li>It should be smooth and appropriately thick.</li>
            <li>Product now oozes out so you use too much and the crimp at end of tube is defective \cracked so open to air on two tubes so far!!!  </li>
            <li>The cleanser comes out in globby chunks like it was stored at a high temperature or that it is just old - this package is unlike any other cleanser package i have ever used.</li>
            <li>The gentle daily cleanser cleans well and doesn&#x27;t dry your skin.  </li>
            <li>It works well enough to take off my makeup (mascara too), and my skin feels soft and not dry-</li>
            <li>I am 4 days past the return time in reporting this, so am pretty bummed!</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive, dry skin, and eczema to boot.</li>

            <li> It may even calm down my skin a little.  </li>

            <li> , didn&#x27;t dry my skin and above all didn&#x27;t sting my eyes.</li>
            <li> Not a fun combination--which means trying to find a product that won&#x27;t irritate my skin or dry it out further is a challenge, especially since I&#x27;m diligent about washing my face.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and the skin care specialist treating my face said this product would be good for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;This cleanser clears off make up and mascara easily and does not irritate my skin or cause any additional redness.  It may even calm down my skin a little.  I would give it 5 stars except it is priced too high.</li>
            <li> I tried this product because i use the other Kinerase products and like them alot. I use the Kinerase C-8 lotion, and the Kinerase daily moisturizing lotion, which I have been using for about 2 or 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;  This cleanser, i find is okay. It doesn&#x27;t seem to clean as well as the Neutrogena Naturals cleanser, which is alot cheaper.  I will not be buying it again, as I didn&#x27;t think it did anything spectacular.  I will still continue to use all the other Kinerase products though.</li>
            <li> I had the same experience as a few reviewers.  My husband and I love this cleanser.  We both have sensitive skin and have&lt;br /&gt;been breaking out a little lately.  The gentle daily cleanser cleans well and doesn&#x27;t dry your skin.  I have been using it for years.  This last shipment the formula appears to have changed.  The cleanser is lumpy, doesn&#x27;t lather as well and stings my eyes.</li>
            <li> I love this line, though the price is a bit high..it&#x27;s worth it. I have dry skin, and live at high altitute, but you can&#x27;t tell when i use this. the cleanser makes your face feel soft and silky + smooth. I love this product- as well as the line and recommend it to all.</li>
            <li> My husband and I have very different skin types.  We enjoy the clean, not dry feeling this provides without multiple products.</li>
            <li> Although I cannot afford most of Kinerase products, I really like them. This cleanser is one I can afford and is the best cleanser I have used.</li>
            <li> I tried a daily wash by Kinerase about 2 years ago and I really liked it because it cleaned, didn&#x27;t dry my skin and above all didn&#x27;t sting my eyes. This product is different, it stings my eyes and therefore makes washing my face uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I think this is one of the best cleansers I&#x27;ve tried to-date for my sensitive,  dehydrated skin.  It is also very effective in removing makeup but does not dry out your skin at all.  My skin feels cleansed,  soft and refreshed after each use.  I would definitely purchase this again!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and love it. I&#x27;m sensitive, acne prone and at 38 I still can&#x27;t tolerate much on my skin! Over the years this product disappeared from sephora, Nordstrom and any where else except for on line. A huge huge challenge. The new packaging of this product is awful for on line purchase because the container opens and explodes during shipment! Really?? For the price that I pay they could do so so much better. I wrote the company and never heard anything back. Too bad for them</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle on the skin and leaves my skin very soft but after trying this I still prefer Origins Pure Cream. Now, as for Kinerase Ultimate Night Moisturizer ? I never received compliments on my facial skin until I started using it !</li>
            <li> Works great-gets rid of dirt,oil and make-up in one-easy step. Very gentle, no fragrance so perfect for sensitive or acne-prone skin. Very popular at dermatalogist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> Kinerase makes great products. And this one is no different. However, it is pricey. So, if you&#x27;re happy with another cleanser, I wouldn&#x27;t urge you to change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have super-sensitive skin that breaks out constantly, and it&#x27;s a never-ending battle to keep things in check (both the eczema and the zits). Kinerase products help oodles with the skin tone, texture, blotchiness, redness. Some anti-aging properties, and my sensitive skin doesn&#x27;t react. Which is why I bought this. I like it very much, but I can use Aquaphor --another very gentle cleanser--and get good results for less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if you already use other Kinerase products and want the continuity/synergy of the products, yes, feel free to use this. It&#x27;s good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mir</li>
            <li> Great, gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li> Love this... Been using this for the past 10 yrs 😊</li>
            <li> Love this product, gently wash away impurity.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for years and the last two orders appear to have a changed formula. It used to be smooth and lotion like and mix easily with water. Now it is thick and &amp;#34;glue like&amp;#34; and will not mix with water in your hand. It globs together and is a mess.&lt;br /&gt;I emailed the company but didn&#x27;t get an answer.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff, your face is so soft and clean after using it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and it is fabulous. I have very sensitive skin and rosacea. This product is very gentle and does not cause my face to breakout or become flushed or irritated.  I would highly recommend this product for someone looking for a gentle skin cleanser that also removes makeup well.</li>
            <li> This is actually an awesome product that I&#x27;ve used before but this particular one came lumpy and thick...like it&#x27;s old or defective. It should be smooth and appropriately thick. I am 4 days past the return time in reporting this, so am pretty bummed! Defective from this seller!!! Check your order immediately in case you need to return.</li>
            <li> I have used Kinerase Gentle Daily Cleaner for years, and it&#x27;s always wonderful. It really cleans my face.&lt;br /&gt;Jeanne Alsup</li>
            <li> This is my favorite facial cleanser.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out your face and has a mild foaming action, unlike some that leave your face feeling greasy after washing.  I can recommend this with confidence.</li>
            <li> Feels good on my skin and protects against the sun damage. Before using this cream I was breaking out but can&#x27;t be 100% sure if its this line that helped or my constant exfoliations... I like the creams and the face wash....</li>
            <li> In my opinion, this face wash is one of the best products I&#x27;ve found. I normally don&#x27;t post reviews, however this face wash has done so much good for my skin that I can&#x27;t help it! It&#x27;s very much worth the price tag. I have extremely sensitive, dry skin, and eczema to boot. Not a fun combination--which means trying to find a product that won&#x27;t irritate my skin or dry it out further is a challenge, especially since I&#x27;m diligent about washing my face. It works well enough to take off my makeup (mascara too), and my skin feels soft and not dry- and that&#x27;s after washing my face in the morning and at night. I really recommend this product to anyone with skin like mine, or anyone who wants a quality product in general!</li>
            <li> Kinerase is a great product line. Many doctors who specialize in facial rejuvination, surgery, sell this product. It works beautifully.</li>
            <li> Thankfully, kinerase has not changed its cleansing formula, this product is smooth, light and  doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily or dry after using.</li>
            <li> I was recommended to use this cleanser by a friend. I was using a prescription glycolic cleanser prior to this cleanser. I decided to give it try. Cleanser in non-irritating and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. I&#x27;ve had several friends and coworkers notice the change in my skin. I definitely recommend it. I&#x27;ve ordered my 1st tube from Amazon and I&#x27;m pleased with this purchase. 1st one was a gift. Next time I&#x27;ll order the one with the pump for more convenience.</li>
            <li> Have been using these products for over ten years.  They are $$$$ but really worth it because they keep your skin young looking and fresh.</li>
            <li> Excellent cleanser  Well worth the money.  I have used for several years and will continue to buy it.  Amazon has a great price for it.  Have never seen it any cheaper.</li>
            <li> I usually love Kinerase products, but when I received this, I was surprised when it was clumpy and thick! Almost has a &amp;#34;semen&amp;#34; feel to it. Will be returning this product.</li>
            <li> Wish I had tried earlier!  This cleanser comes out in globs and not same item purchased in stores!  Have no idea if I am truly using a kinerase product.  Hesitant to ever order on line again as this is not the same product!!</li>
            <li> Once I received the product, it was already used. Sadly, I did not open up the product until last week for I order my beauty products two to three months before I need them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will NEVER purchase from this person again!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Kinerase&#x27;s Gentle Daily Cleanser for, I believe, the last 6-7 years and it was perfect for my skin. It was gentle, smooth out of the bottle and worked up a nice lather no matter the type of water you have in your home. Then in an instant, last year, that all changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea why Kinerase changed their formula, but no matter whom I&#x27;ve purchased this from, I get the same result as some of the other reviews on Amazon. The consistency is clumpy (someone mentioned &amp;#34;semen&amp;#34; like, and that&#x27;s accurate - and funny. I was worried I was being pranked) and difficult to work into a lather. The worst part of dealing with the consistency is attempting to contain the soap in your hand without losing half of what you squeezed into your palm. Often times, I have to go back to the container again to have enough soap for my forehead (and no, I don&#x27;t have an exceptionally large forehead). It doesn&#x27;t come close to giving my skin that clean feeling the original formula offered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;ve started on the path of finding a new cleanser to replace this one and have moved on to Perricone MD&#x27;s gentle cleanser. It&#x27;s telling, and unfortunate, that after being dropped by Sephora, Ulta has now dropped Kinerase products as well. Amazon has great deals on products, but sometimes you wait until the last minute and drive down the street to pick-up a product. Unfortunately, that&#x27;s no longer possible with Kinerase.</li>
            <li> Gentle and does not irritate eyes. A wonderful product for sensitive skin and retaining moisture.  I have used for years.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for years.  Company recently changed from a pump to a tube. Product now oozes out so you use too much and the crimp at end of tube is defective \cracked so open to air on two tubes so far!!!  Why would I buy again?  When product arrived it was not damaged from shipping/ delivery.  Contacted company directly two weeks ago and not a peep.  Guess I will change brands--- Valeant doesn&#x27;t care about their customers</li>
            <li> A top notch cleanser. Can even be used to clean off eye makeup.</li>
            <li> I have used Kinerase Gentle Daily Cleanser for years.  It thoroughly removes make-up without causing dryness. Nordstrom&#x27;s cosmetics department previously stocked the cleanser in- store then it went to on-line ordering &amp; is now no longer carried by Nordstrom&#x27;s.  I&#x27;m grateful the product remains available via Amazon, although the amount per container dropped from 6.5 oz to 5.0 oz while the price remains the same.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I used to buy it at Sephora, but since they&#x27;ve stopped carrying it Amazon has been my go-to (and probably even at a better price - score!).&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s gentle enough not to irritate my skin, especially when trying to go easy on it after a good exfoliation, etc., but still strong enough to give my skin a thorough cleaning. I also like that it lathers up nicely, that you don&#x27;t have to use more than a pump or so, and it doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent. I try new face washes from time to time and the winners serve their purpose (Josie Maran&#x27;s Argan Oil Cleanser for getting ALL of the makeup off; DDF&#x27;s Glycolic Cleanser for a minty, tingly clean with the excellent effects of a gentle peel while still falling into the safe-during-pregnancy category according to my dermatologist, etc.), but this cleanser is one that I ALWAYS have on hand. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately product burns eyes when washing face, however with store bought product never had this issue and I used it for years.</li>
            <li> been using this  for years.  However it is pricey, looking for a substitute that is cheaper.  Gentle on older skin.</li>
            <li> I miss this product so much! The version at Walgreen&#x27;s now is no where near as good.</li>
            <li> I have used kinerase for years and have always loved the cleanser.  This was the first time I bought the cleanser anywhere other than Kinerase directly and I will say it will be the last time.  The cleanser comes out in globby chunks like it was stored at a high temperature or that it is just old - this package is unlike any other cleanser package i have ever used. I recommend the cleanser because it is so gentle and consistently keep my skin clean and soft, I just don&#x27;t recommend you buy it on Amazon.  Lesson learned.  Buy this stuff directly from kinerase.</li>
            <li> This is the best face wash I have ever used. Glad it&#x27;s available on amazon .  Encourage any one who is looking for this type of product to try</li>
            <li> My favorite cleanser and the only one I ever use.</li>
