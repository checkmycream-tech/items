            <li>The results are great.</li>
            <li>i am happy to say i love them!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still a good starter product though.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t work like i thought it would on my eyelids - good luck to others wanting results&lt;br</li>
            <li>I cannot judge nor rate fairly.....</li>
            <li>Thought this was a good product.  </li>
            <li>They do a good job eliminating my &amp;#34;hooded&amp;#34; lids.  </li>
            <li>I like this product and a good seller.</li>
            <li>so it is good quality.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the product and service.</li>
            <li>but now that i do, i love this tape!</li>
            <li>I wore the tape on my mono eyelid for a week day/night, and couldn&#x27;t believe the magic it did!</li>
            <li>Tried many times, but to no avail!</li>
            <li>I would suggest leaving your eyes as they are because hooded eyes are sexy!</li>
            <li>most of them were good</li>
            <li>I have a drooping or hooded eye, and the tape worked nicely.</li>
            <li>Exceptional, phenomenal, etc.  </li>
            <li>Very fast delivery, item is wonderful, works fantastic on my eyes and stays on till I remove it, and not visible at all.</li>
            <li>:)) I am a super happy girl.</li>
            <li>, the first try is perfect and it fits perfectly and doesn&#x27;t remove easily plus it will make your eyes younger....</li>
            <li>I figured for $3.00 I would try them, should have known it was too good to be true.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>and i love it.</li>
            <li>but it does not matter, i love having the tape on</li>
            <li>will def buy more.</li>
            <li>I was expecting the strips to be sticky on both sides to \\&quot;lift\\&quot; the eye lid by sticking the bottom part of the lid to the top part of the lid creating a crease.  </li>
            <li>They were way more helpful than these reviews.  </li>
            <li>BUT I DID HAVE MANY LAUGHS</li>
            <li>love them.  </li>
            <li>makes my eyes look so much better.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping for more eyelid, but the tape is too visible and I don&#x27;t know how anyone can hide it with makeup.</li>
            <li>I most deff an pleased.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, does what it says</li>
            <li>I am SO pleased - there are no words to describe how well this product works.  </li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t find the exact product though, and stumbled across this amazing product!</li>
            <li>they are better then surgery .i</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried every brand of eye tape, and these are my favorite.</li>
            <li>really wish i could have experienced this product.</li>
            <li>They were visible, and anyone looking at me close up would be able to see that something was stuck to my eye.</li>
            <li>I love these....</li>
            <li>Also, you will still be able to see the tape when you close your eyes, but if you are just blinking, no one will notice.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>applying the tape, make sure it is close to your lash line because it will help fold your eyelid skin</li>
            <li>I know for sure that I applied it correctly.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the appropriate price</li>
            <li>This product is basically very easy to apply and extremely comfortable.</li>
            <li>For the money, they&#x27;re pretty good...</li>
            <li>One positive thing I did receive the product a head of time which was good.</li>
            <li>but it would have been great if the tape was solid because then it should blend in with the makeup better, instead of seaming like you have an eye wart or something...</li>
            <li>They stay in place, but come off easily.  </li>
            <li>This product works well and was easy to use.  </li>
            <li>so it does not blend in easily.</li>
            <li>i received it very quick.</li>
            <li>Easy to attach and remove.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend watching the videos on You Tube.  </li>
            <li>But, if the makeup is light, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>This tape is like having a eyelid lift for free.</li>
            <li>I bought this out of curiousity and the fact it was cheap.  </li>
            <li>wish they make the product with smooth tape, and blended color with skin (transparent) after we wear them</li>
            <li>Should&#x27;ve known cheap price&#x3D; cheap</li>
            <li>I got two free skincare samples in the package.</li>
            <li>Good for the price but would pay up next time for the better quality ones from Japan.</li>
            <li>and when I saw these, I was all kinds of excited.</li>
            <li>Both my mom and I love it really much!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s totally worth it!</li>
            <li>The tape is good maybe for at home however its noticeable when wearing it out in public</li>
            <li>and when I did, with some shiny eyeshadow (dark colour) on top was quite good for me.</li>
            <li>you want a one-sided eyelid tape that is bound to work when used correctly, then this is a worthy investment.&lt;br</li>
            <li>because they are pre-cut and quick and easy to apply and open up my eyes as with age, my eyelids have become more puffy and hooded.</li>
            <li>The tape is easily applicable, however like others say, it&#x27;s very noticeable when you close your eyes or blink.</li>
            <li>I thought it was double sided since its been in business for so long that it would have to be the best.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product and so simple.</li>
            <li>Better to go au natural and forgo the tape.</li>
            <li>and found that I like the thin tape the best.</li>
            <li>so I ordered different kind and</li>
            <li>I got it today , and put it on right away.</li>
            <li>i know im putting them on right since i read all the instructions from their website and all the videos in youtube.</li>
            <li>They are inexpensive enough to experiment with a little to find where you like them best.</li>
            <li>tape itself is better than other brands I have tried because first, it is easy to remove from the card.  </li>
            <li>My eyelids now stay through the whole day!</li>
            <li>And people really cant notice, even after i tell them i have it on!</li>
            <li>and i love that my makeup finally looks even!</li>
            <li>at first i didn&#x27;t know how to put on the tape</li>
            <li>Once I realized how to apply them they worked pretty well.</li>
            <li>So by positioning this semi-stiff tape properly on your eye lid, you can decrease the amount of &#x27;droopy&#x27; lid and shove more of your lid into the crease area.  </li>
            <li>My eyelids are much more noticeable with the double eyelid tape...</li>
            <li>I made a better one at home with scotch tape that was double sided.</li>
            <li>I beleive the initial idea was that it helps on better make up -</li>
            <li>However I do love them more then the ones that were more expensive.</li>
            <li>I will most likely purchase more in the future!</li>
            <li>I really like this product!</li>
            <li>It is really convenient to use!</li>
            <li>But thanks to the tape, my eyelids are now even and double-eyelided without wearing any tape!</li>
            <li>Love them and will definitely continue to use them.</li>
            <li>I could not tell exactly what they were.  </li>
            <li>OK, I don&#x27;t know Chinese, so I have no clue as to how I&#x27;m supposed to use this thing.</li>
            <li>, it last all day and you really cant tell i have it on, even when i do not wear makeup, i love having the tape on to have my eyes look even.</li>
            <li>It helped me turn my mono eyelid to a double but only temporary, good thing it comes with alot of tape.</li>
            <li>many asian women use this product, but i swear it should be marketed to older women.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple to use and the instructions on the package made it easy for me to understand how the tapes should be applied correctly.  </li>
            <li>I will certainly purchase this again and recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li>My eyes look so much more open and young!</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re an older woman with drooping eyelids, this product will change your life!  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s truly an instant eyelift and a huge boost in self-esteem.  </li>
            <li>However, it is also very noticeable compared to the wonder eyelid tape.  </li>
            <li>Delivery was fast and the service was friendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I was really amaze</li>
            <li>I will recommend this for every one who wants to make their eyes shine</li>
            <li>I remember this product costing much cheaper than this listed price, too.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>This eyelid tape really does the trick for me.</li>
            <li>It will make it a much cleaner and simpler experience than if you tried to apply your makeup afterward.</li>
            <li>One of the sides is straight, which does not help follow the eye ball shape.</li>
            <li>plus it doesn&#x27;t stick very well.</li>
            <li>The tape works really well</li>
            <li>What kind of a double eyelid tape isn&#x27;t double sided...?</li>
            <li>I read the good reviews and had hope, but I should&#x27;ve read the negative reviews.</li>
            <li>The other reviews on this product are useless because all they say is once you figure out (on your own) how to use the product the results are great.    </li>
            <li>learned to put it on first day cant live without them.</li>
            <li>I wanted to get something that would help me to raise and hold the lower lid to a more even level with the other eye.</li>
            <li>At first I was self conscious about   wearing the tape because I thought it showed.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s way lots better than this korean product, hardly noticeable and just the right size.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend purchasing this.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Using this tape I can create just about any eyelid-shape I want - so for stage and possibly photographs these could be useful.</li>
            <li>I wish it had come with some kind of instructions for placement, however, I think it is different for each individual depending upon the shape of their eye and how deep set they are.  </li>
            <li>but this brand kind of sucks.</li>
            <li>amazing results for a small amount of money and effort!</li>
            <li>It fixed my uneven eyelids and even made them look better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very sensitive about it</li>
            <li>On a positive note, if you wear it just bare with no makeup, the clear tape does blend in.</li>
            <li>Even when I put on my makeup you can still clearly see it!</li>
            <li>This was the first time purchasing double eyelid tape ever.</li>
            <li>I am 55 years old and have drooping eyelids.</li>
            <li>and it is not noticeable but for the first time in a long time, I can wear eyeshadow and it SHOWS on my lids.</li>
            <li>These may work very well to create a double lid for ppl with monolid(s)</li>
            <li>I think I got an old batch.</li>
            <li>natural look, with immediate eye lifting effects.  </li>
            <li>well after a week of use , i began to realize the tape is really conspicuous and even my male co worker asked me whats going on with my eyelids!</li>
            <li>This tape widens my eyes considerably, and I can&#x27;t feel them while they are on.  </li>
            <li>I have old age sagging eyelids and was looking for some way to lift them up without surgery</li>
            <li>My right eye is a monolid and left double lid.</li>
            <li>When I first received this item there were no instructions in English, only Korean</li>
            <li>TRUE, since it was an account that has been closed, the money bounced back to them.&lt;br /&gt;After asking them to refund me again, they said they couldn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;LIES.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are relatively easy to put on; involved only a little trial &amp; error.</li>
            <li>D.U.P Double Sided eyelid tape works very well  to open my hooded eyes.</li>
            <li>It looks like clear medical tape cut crescent-shape about 10mm.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m asian in my early 30s</li>
            <li>irritates eyes, it is VERY visible and does not much to improve sagging skin</li>
            <li>I ordered these first and then ordered some that were $21.00 just in case they didn&#x27;t do what I expected them to do at this very low price.</li>
            <li>now my left eye looks normal and with the tape on both eyes, they look much bigger!</li>
            <li>Even worse, the eye shadow gets stuck in the textured surface of the tapes to make them even more noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was still able to use the tape, but it seemed a little less sticky.</li>
            <li>so when i tried this, i was pleasantly surprised when i saw that the tape actually did the trick and my monolid eye was now double</li>
            <li>Pay an extra $8 and get a stretch fiber-based double eyelid product, which looks incredibly natural and works well with makeup (Mezaik or Mezical Fiber).</li>
            <li>Only one of my eyes has a severe droopy lid which makes it very apparent.</li>
            <li>It was easy to apply, and it made my lid feel less heavy with it taped up.</li>
            <li>For me, I knew pretty quickly if they we&#x27;re where I wanted them because, if not, they become rather uncomfortable within a short time.  </li>
            <li>The tape is stiff (but not uncomfortable)</li>
            <li>And while they work the same way, these were very noticeable both over and under eyeshadow when I blinked or looked down.</li>
            <li>in fact if u get it wrong the first time don&#x27;t worry cuz they are sticky enough to try a couple of times and get it right....</li>
            <li>These are very, very noticeable and I&#x27;m not sure how anyone could wear these out in public without embarrassment.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Also, you will still be able to see the tape when you close your eyes, but if you are just blinking, no one will notice.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> applying the tape, make sure it is close to your lash line because it will help fold your eyelid skin</li>
            <li> I know for sure that I applied it correctly.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the appropriate price</li>
            <li> This product is basically very easy to apply and extremely comfortable.</li>
            <li> For the money, they&#x27;re pretty good...</li>
            <li> One positive thing I did receive the product a head of time which was good.</li>
            <li> but it would have been great if the tape was solid because then it should blend in with the makeup better, instead of seaming like you have an eye wart or something...</li>
            <li> They stay in place, but come off easily.  </li>
            <li> This product works well and was easy to use.  </li>
            <li> so it does not blend in easily.</li>
            <li> i received it very quick.</li>
            <li> Easy to attach and remove.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend watching the videos on You Tube.  </li>
            <li> But, if the makeup is light, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> This tape is like having a eyelid lift for free.</li>
            <li> I bought this out of curiousity and the fact it was cheap.  </li>
            <li> wish they make the product with smooth tape, and blended color with skin (transparent) after we wear them</li>
            <li> Should&#x27;ve known cheap price&#x3D; cheap</li>
            <li> I got two free skincare samples in the package.</li>
            <li> Good for the price but would pay up next time for the better quality ones from Japan.</li>
            <li> and when I saw these, I was all kinds of excited.</li>
            <li> Both my mom and I love it really much!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s totally worth it!</li>
            <li> The tape is good maybe for at home however its noticeable when wearing it out in public</li>
            <li> and when I did, with some shiny eyeshadow (dark colour) on top was quite good for me.</li>
            <li> you want a one-sided eyelid tape that is bound to work when used correctly, then this is a worthy investment.&lt;br</li>
            <li> because they are pre-cut and quick and easy to apply and open up my eyes as with age, my eyelids have become more puffy and hooded.</li>
            <li> The tape is easily applicable, however like others say, it&#x27;s very noticeable when you close your eyes or blink.</li>
            <li> I thought it was double sided since its been in business for so long that it would have to be the best.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product and so simple.</li>
            <li> Better to go au natural and forgo the tape.</li>
            <li> and found that I like the thin tape the best.</li>
            <li> so I ordered different kind and</li>
            <li> I got it today , and put it on right away.</li>
            <li> i know im putting them on right since i read all the instructions from their website and all the videos in youtube.</li>
            <li> They are inexpensive enough to experiment with a little to find where you like them best.</li>
            <li> tape itself is better than other brands I have tried because first, it is easy to remove from the card.  </li>
            <li> My eyelids now stay through the whole day!</li>
            <li> And people really cant notice, even after i tell them i have it on!</li>
            <li> and i love that my makeup finally looks even!</li>
            <li> at first i didn&#x27;t know how to put on the tape</li>
            <li> Once I realized how to apply them they worked pretty well.</li>
            <li> So by positioning this semi-stiff tape properly on your eye lid, you can decrease the amount of &#x27;droopy&#x27; lid and shove more of your lid into the crease area.  </li>
            <li> My eyelids are much more noticeable with the double eyelid tape...</li>
            <li> I made a better one at home with scotch tape that was double sided.</li>
            <li> I beleive the initial idea was that it helps on better make up -</li>
            <li> However I do love them more then the ones that were more expensive.</li>
            <li> I will most likely purchase more in the future!</li>
            <li> I really like this product!</li>
            <li> It is really convenient to use!</li>
            <li> But thanks to the tape, my eyelids are now even and double-eyelided without wearing any tape!</li>
            <li> Love them and will definitely continue to use them.</li>
            <li> I could not tell exactly what they were.  </li>
            <li> OK, I don&#x27;t know Chinese, so I have no clue as to how I&#x27;m supposed to use this thing.</li>
            <li> , it last all day and you really cant tell i have it on, even when i do not wear makeup, i love having the tape on to have my eyes look even.</li>
            <li> It helped me turn my mono eyelid to a double but only temporary, good thing it comes with alot of tape.</li>
            <li> many asian women use this product, but i swear it should be marketed to older women.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple to use and the instructions on the package made it easy for me to understand how the tapes should be applied correctly.  </li>
            <li> I will certainly purchase this again and recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> My eyes look so much more open and young!</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re an older woman with drooping eyelids, this product will change your life!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s truly an instant eyelift and a huge boost in self-esteem.  </li>
            <li> However, it is also very noticeable compared to the wonder eyelid tape.  </li>
            <li> Delivery was fast and the service was friendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I was really amaze</li>
            <li> I will recommend this for every one who wants to make their eyes shine</li>
            <li> I remember this product costing much cheaper than this listed price, too.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> This eyelid tape really does the trick for me.</li>
            <li> It will make it a much cleaner and simpler experience than if you tried to apply your makeup afterward.</li>
            <li> One of the sides is straight, which does not help follow the eye ball shape.</li>
            <li> plus it doesn&#x27;t stick very well.</li>
            <li> The tape works really well</li>
            <li> What kind of a double eyelid tape isn&#x27;t double sided...?</li>
            <li> I read the good reviews and had hope, but I should&#x27;ve read the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> The other reviews on this product are useless because all they say is once you figure out (on your own) how to use the product the results are great.    </li>
            <li> learned to put it on first day cant live without them.</li>
            <li> I wanted to get something that would help me to raise and hold the lower lid to a more even level with the other eye.</li>
            <li> At first I was self conscious about   wearing the tape because I thought it showed.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s way lots better than this korean product, hardly noticeable and just the right size.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend purchasing this.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Using this tape I can create just about any eyelid-shape I want - so for stage and possibly photographs these could be useful.</li>
            <li> I wish it had come with some kind of instructions for placement, however, I think it is different for each individual depending upon the shape of their eye and how deep set they are.  </li>
            <li> but this brand kind of sucks.</li>
            <li> amazing results for a small amount of money and effort!</li>
            <li> It fixed my uneven eyelids and even made them look better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sensitive about it</li>
            <li> On a positive note, if you wear it just bare with no makeup, the clear tape does blend in.</li>
            <li> Even when I put on my makeup you can still clearly see it!</li>
            <li> This was the first time purchasing double eyelid tape ever.</li>
            <li> I am 55 years old and have drooping eyelids.</li>
            <li> and it is not noticeable but for the first time in a long time, I can wear eyeshadow and it SHOWS on my lids.</li>
            <li> These may work very well to create a double lid for ppl with monolid(s)</li>
            <li> I think I got an old batch.</li>
            <li> natural look, with immediate eye lifting effects.  </li>
            <li> well after a week of use , i began to realize the tape is really conspicuous and even my male co worker asked me whats going on with my eyelids!</li>
            <li> This tape widens my eyes considerably, and I can&#x27;t feel them while they are on.  </li>
            <li> I have old age sagging eyelids and was looking for some way to lift them up without surgery</li>
            <li> My right eye is a monolid and left double lid.</li>
            <li> When I first received this item there were no instructions in English, only Korean</li>
            <li> TRUE, since it was an account that has been closed, the money bounced back to them.&lt;br /&gt;After asking them to refund me again, they said they couldn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;LIES.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are relatively easy to put on; involved only a little trial &amp; error.</li>
            <li> D.U.P Double Sided eyelid tape works very well  to open my hooded eyes.</li>
            <li> It looks like clear medical tape cut crescent-shape about 10mm.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m asian in my early 30s</li>
            <li> irritates eyes, it is VERY visible and does not much to improve sagging skin</li>
            <li> I ordered these first and then ordered some that were $21.00 just in case they didn&#x27;t do what I expected them to do at this very low price.</li>
            <li> now my left eye looks normal and with the tape on both eyes, they look much bigger!</li>
            <li> Even worse, the eye shadow gets stuck in the textured surface of the tapes to make them even more noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was still able to use the tape, but it seemed a little less sticky.</li>
            <li> so when i tried this, i was pleasantly surprised when i saw that the tape actually did the trick and my monolid eye was now double</li>
            <li> Pay an extra $8 and get a stretch fiber-based double eyelid product, which looks incredibly natural and works well with makeup (Mezaik or Mezical Fiber).</li>
            <li> Only one of my eyes has a severe droopy lid which makes it very apparent.</li>
            <li> It was easy to apply, and it made my lid feel less heavy with it taped up.</li>
            <li> For me, I knew pretty quickly if they we&#x27;re where I wanted them because, if not, they become rather uncomfortable within a short time.  </li>
            <li> The tape is stiff (but not uncomfortable)</li>
            <li> And while they work the same way, these were very noticeable both over and under eyeshadow when I blinked or looked down.</li>
            <li> in fact if u get it wrong the first time don&#x27;t worry cuz they are sticky enough to try a couple of times and get it right....</li>
            <li> These are very, very noticeable and I&#x27;m not sure how anyone could wear these out in public without embarrassment.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t that inconspicuous in person, but in my pictures it really looked weird, like right eye looks so much smaller than my left.</li>
            <li> It definitely looks like there&#x27;s a piece of scotch tape on your eyelid - shiny, flat, with a semi-opaque layer.</li>
            <li> I have heavy eyelids which I think make me look older.  </li>
            <li> but when i applied the make up, the tape was very visible when i blinked, looked down or closed my eyes.</li>
            <li> they should be applied with the flat side up.</li>
            <li> Other brands are such that the top piece sticks to the lower piece and is difficult to separate.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;re humans and we need to blink on a regular basis or our eyeballs will dry out.    </li>
            <li> It took a few tries to get both sides to match and they really do they trick.</li>
            <li> I have uneven eyelids and my trouble eyelid is my right eye.</li>
            <li> all i have to say is don&#x27;t be afraid to try them for how many you get</li>
            <li> they aren&#x27;t really that noticeable though if u put heavy black eyeshadow</li>
            <li> Did I mention that the other eye product/s instructions were in Chinese?</li>
            <li> Sometimes my eye will go back to monolid, but if I put the tape back on for a few hours, it will go back to double-eyelid for the next few days.</li>
            <li> Had to look at the tiny picture  directions to try to understand how to use.&lt;br /&gt;The tiny clear half  moons were hard to apply to the eye lid.  </li>
            <li> tried wearing the tape once or twice and simply covered it with dark eyeliner.</li>
            <li> ( I am Asian and have a mono lid) and I had a hard time cutting to fit into my eyes and it is really not meant for eyes because It fells off easily until i got tired and stopped doing it...</li>
            <li> This little piece of tape did help open my eyes.</li>
            <li> These little adhesive strips are like an instant eye lift without the cost and the pain.</li>
            <li> Also someone suggested trying it on for a few hours before applying makeup and the eye should still be double lid after that tape is gone</li>
            <li> and after those tries the tape is still sticky</li>
            <li> THEN I understood this product does not really \\&quot;lift\\&quot; your eyelid.  </li>
            <li> Arrived a day or two before expected date.</li>
            <li> The outer surface is a bit rough</li>
            <li> so I expected them to be sticky from both sides</li>
            <li> No one knows I&#x27;m wearing them unless I were to keep my eyes closed while someone was looking at me.  </li>
            <li> A bit thicker than expected.  </li>
            <li> They stick together when you remove so need to be careful.  </li>
            <li> These are stiff, and only have adhesive on one side</li>
            <li> and i have been really insecure about having no fold in my right eye.</li>
            <li> I have uneven eyelids, one eye has a double lid while my other eye is a monolid</li>
            <li> at first it didn&#x27;t really do much, and it was a little painful.</li>
            <li> This item comes with no instructions and left my eyes raw from the glue, did not do anything like it said it would</li>
            <li> it was not double sided and was thick enough to not be hidden when worn Basically, product was of no use and did not solve its purpose.</li>
            <li> but i was disappointed that i wasnt able to blend it in well so that you cant see it...    </li>
            <li> I have a ptosis that means one lid is lower than the other.</li>
            <li> the other side of my lid just flaps over the tape and nothing happened.</li>
            <li> After I saw that infomercial about this other eyelid tape product i decided to look it up in amazon since i don&#x27;t wanna be tied up with this</li>
            <li> I usually have the double eye-lid but it disappears once in a while.</li>
            <li> so they&#x27;re not quite as invisible as other brands, but I&#x27;ve learned to put them on so it doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li> It was expensive at first</li>
            <li> Whenever you blink, or have your eyes in any position besides wide open(looking down), everyone can tell you&#x27;re wearing tape.  </li>
            <li> I have found a similar product on Amazon that comes in different sizes (thin, medium, etc.)</li>
            <li> Before, I use a common tape just to make my eyelid double</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I bought too much of it.</li>
            <li> I have been using these eyelid tape charms for the past few months and find these to be quite helpful with my overall eyelid appearance.  </li>
            <li> The tape is thick and sticky and that&#x27;s what makes it work, but I could never wear this in public.</li>
            <li> application perfection might take a few tries.  </li>
            <li> big and thick shows on the eyelid...</li>
            <li> They are certainly a lot less expensive than the Dream</li>
            <li> After a few tries I think I have it down.</li>
            <li> I purchased these due to my heavy eyelid, and they make a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> One of the cons is that if you raise your eyebrows, they are definitely visible and I usually wear very heavy dark makeup and it can create lines around the strips.</li>
            <li> Choose these if you want a slightly wider tape.</li>
            <li> a little doesn&#x27;t bother the \\&quot;stayability\\&quot; of the tape at all.....</li>
            <li> I went on You Tube and watched a few videos on how to use this product.  </li>
            <li> and I just wasted 8 dollars.</li>
            <li> takes a few times to figure out hope to put them on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had hooded eyes, and with age, it only gets worse.</li>
            <li> This product is a waste of time and money, would not buy again.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY..........</li>
            <li> The green fork is for enhancing the crease in your eyelids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Product worked like a charm Received it in a few days.</li>
            <li> i am not a huge infomercial person but when i saw a simular product like this on tv i had to try it....</li>
            <li> the tape is only sticky on one side so the green applicator is useless.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I couldn&#x27;t find the same brand online.  </li>
            <li> Goodbye uneven eyelids!</li>
            <li> I use this for my modeling makeup; even in my closeups, you are not able to tell that I have eyelid tape on.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I wasted 5 bucks!</li>
            <li> It is very difficult to get the correct fold and have the strip hidden in it at the same time.</li>
            <li> at first i was doubtful since it&#x27;s way cheaper than the advertised product</li>
            <li> I played around with putting them on and I was disappointed I didn&#x27;t see  much of a lift.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s hard to use</li>
            <li> also, it is hard for me to cover it with makeup</li>
            <li> It takes at least 10 years off my age.</li>
            <li> Too thick and visible.</li>
            <li> I thought the tape was too thick</li>
            <li> The tape is thick and has a sort of bumpy cover on the front</li>
            <li> , sometimes an end will roll up on finger prior to placement, and impossible to straighten out.  </li>
            <li> Not only would it not stick, but it would not stay flat and looked horrible.</li>
            <li> I think the users that gave horrible reviews either aren&#x27;t using them right</li>
            <li> In a desperate search for something (other than surgery) to lift my lids i ordered this product.  </li>
            <li> I guess it will just have to remain my secret.</li>
            <li> I am so self conscious and hated looking in a mirror.</li>
            <li> Once when I wasn&#x27;t wearing them, someone told me I looked tired, so I know they make a difference, but not so that anyone knows what it is that I&#x27;ve done.  </li>
            <li> en...this tape is really thick and uncomfortable to wear....</li>
            <li> These are really noticeable and awful.</li>
            <li> recommend applying the eyelid tape after you have done your makeup (false lashes included).</li>
            <li> and you seriously can&#x27;t see them!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 54 years old and felt horrible about my face.  </li>
            <li> i have hated the appearance of my eyelids for some time and have often dreamed(only a dream) of getting an upper eyelid lift....</li>
            <li> These stuck to my eyes, were very hard to apply, and if you want to put makeup over them, forget about it!</li>
            <li> The videos also show you what to do with that weird wishbone/toothpick thingy.    </li>
            <li> I bought these after trying the Dreamlook eyelid tapes which are expensive.</li>
            <li> OR are getting the wrong size.</li>
            <li> The tool is useless, and I wouldn&#x27;t reccomend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Not too expensive.</li>
            <li> I was probably trying to use it for the wrong thing.</li>
            <li> Difficult to remove from adhesive paper</li>
            <li> This product wasn&#x27;t very expensive</li>
            <li> I guess that was my bad</li>
            <li> So, if you receive this item don&#x27;t be frustrated..</li>

            <li> , it&#x27;s just stupid!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve acquired terribly droopy eyelids.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t get it to work correctly and it felt terrible.</li>
            <li> However, everytime I blinked or looked sort of downward, they were horribly visible.</li>

            <li> Great product and great price.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It fixed my uneven eyelids and even made them look better. The tape is thick and sticky and that&#x27;s what makes it work, but I could never wear this in public. Each piece is sticky enough for multiple uses too! One pack lasted me over four months with continuous use. I wear them at night and around the house. My eyelids now stay through the whole day! I definitely recommend for so done wanted to make their eyelids fold symmtrically!</li>
            <li> I have uneven eyelids, one eye has a double lid while my other eye is a monolid so when i tried this, i was pleasantly surprised when i saw that the tape actually did the trick and my monolid eye was now double but when i applied the make up, the tape was very visible when i blinked, looked down or closed my eyes. Maybe because i am a beginner, i don&#x27;t know how to use it well but it would have been great if the tape was solid because then it should blend in with the makeup better, instead of seaming like you have an eye wart or something... it does the trick but i was disappointed that i wasnt able to blend it in well so that you cant see it...    UPDATE  I&#x27;ve been using the tape for several months now and i love it. The problem i had mentioned above was just that i was a beginner who didnt know how to use it but now that i do, i love this tape! And people really cant notice, even after i tell them i have it on! This tape does the trick so well and i love that my makeup finally looks even! I will definitely continue buying these!!  Also someone suggested trying it on for a few hours before applying makeup and the eye should still be double lid after that tape is gone but my eye is so droopy that this does not work for me but it does not matter, i love having the tape on, it last all day and you really cant tell i have it on, even when i do not wear makeup, i love having the tape on to have my eyes look even.</li>
            <li> I am 55 years old and have drooping eyelids. This tape is like having a eyelid lift for free. At first I was self conscious about   wearing the tape because I thought it showed. I asked several friends and family if they noticed the tape. Not one person had noticed the tape, even after I pointed it out they still couldn&#x27;t see it. It takes at least 10 years off my age. I can&#x27;t believe that everyone isn&#x27;t wearing this tape. I guess it will just have to remain my secret.</li>
            <li> at first i didn&#x27;t know how to put on the tape but i kept trying like 5 times to put it on perfectly and after those tries the tape is still sticky and i didn&#x27;t have to use another one. will def buy more. you couldn&#x27;t even tell i had the tape on and after i take the tape out, i still had eyelids for a while. the tape is only sticky on one side so the green applicator is useless.</li>
            <li> No direction comes with this I have looked it up on the internet with no luck. I have tried to use them and still can&#x27;t figure out where to put them on the eyelid.</li>
            <li> The tape is good maybe for at home however its noticeable when wearing it out in public so I only use the tape when taking pictures ^^</li>
            <li> When I first received this item there were no instructions in English, only Korean so I was sort of upset. After practicing just once or twice I figured out how to use the tape and it DOES work. So, if you receive this item don&#x27;t be frustrated..just give it a try and you will like the results. I put some eyeshadow on over the tape and it is not noticeable but for the first time in a long time, I can wear eyeshadow and it SHOWS on my lids. Before my upper lids would cover this part of my eyes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit big for my eyes but that&#x27;s not that big of a problem since I can cut it.  However, it is also very noticeable compared to the wonder eyelid tape.  It&#x27;s still a good starter product though.</li>
            <li> Once I realized how to apply them they worked pretty well. NOTE: they should be applied with the flat side up. This works well for me. Delivery was fast and the service was friendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;w</li>
            <li> I tried these, for the purpose of my use, these didn&#x27;t work. I have a ptosis that means one lid is lower than the other. I wanted to get something that would help me to raise and hold the lower lid to a more even level with the other eye. These are stiff, and only have adhesive on one side so they didn&#x27;t work for my needs but they do not state that they help with ptosis so I cannot complain that they don&#x27;t work at all. These may work very well to create a double lid for ppl with monolid(s)</li>
            <li> I bought this out of curiousity and the fact it was cheap.  They just don&#x27;t work.  I can&#x27;t imagine how someone could make them work.  makeup doesn&#x27;t cover well and well, it&#x27;s just stupid!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed when I opened this product.  These strips are only sticky on one side and there are NO English instructions in the package.  I was expecting the strips to be sticky on both sides to \\&quot;lift\\&quot; the eye lid by sticking the bottom part of the lid to the top part of the lid creating a crease.  The other reviews on this product are useless because all they say is once you figure out (on your own) how to use the product the results are great.    I went on You Tube and watched a few videos on how to use this product.  THEN I understood this product does not really \\&quot;lift\\&quot; your eyelid.  What it DOES do is force your eyelid to fold over on itself.  So by positioning this semi-stiff tape properly on your eye lid, you can decrease the amount of &#x27;droopy&#x27; lid and shove more of your lid into the crease area.  So yes, once you figure out how to use these, I think they might work out well.  Time will tell.  I have not tried to wear these with makeup yet so I cannot say how that works yet.    I strongly recommend watching the videos on You Tube.  They were way more helpful than these reviews.  The videos also show you what to do with that weird wishbone/toothpick thingy.    After figuring out how this product is intended to work, I can see the error in my assuming the strips should be sticky on both sides.  If they were sticky on both sides, essentially sticking your lower lid to the top of the lid, it would make it difficult to blink.  LOL!    So if you buy this product, good luck!  I hope it works for me.</li>
            <li> Before, I use a common tape just to make my eyelid double ( I am Asian and have a mono lid) and I had a hard time cutting to fit into my eyes and it is really not meant for eyes because It fells off easily until i got tired and stopped doing it... Then I saw this here in amazon and I was really amaze, the first try is perfect and it fits perfectly and doesn&#x27;t remove easily plus it will make your eyes younger.... I will buy again after I used the 50 pairs... (-: Awesome product! I will recommend this for every one who wants to make their eyes shine</li>
            <li> I bought these after trying the Dreamlook eyelid tapes which are expensive. These were easier to handle and I didn&#x27;t have to apply a gel to the sticky back like I do with the Dreamlook. And while they work the same way, these were very noticeable both over and under eyeshadow when I blinked or looked down. Even worse, the eye shadow gets stuck in the textured surface of the tapes to make them even more noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose if you are going to wear them without any eye makeup they might work, but they are not something I will use and would not recommend.</li>
            <li> This stuff works just as it stated..My eyelids are much more noticeable with the double eyelid tape...Definately reccommend it for anyone wanting to increase their eye lids.</li>
            <li> What kind of a double eyelid tape isn&#x27;t double sided...? I made a better one at home with scotch tape that was double sided. So one side sticks to the eyelid and the other side of my lid just flaps over the tape and nothing happened. Except I have a tape in my eye now. Unless I am not using correctly, this does not work for droopy eyelid and I just wasted 8 dollars.</li>
            <li> I think I got an old batch. Not only would it not stick, but it would not stay flat and looked horrible. I watched the video 10 timesa and it is shot from an angle that makes it unclear. Did I mention that the other eye product/s instructions were in Chinese?</li>
            <li> It is too visible.  I do not understand why manufacturer needs to use tape that has holes all over.  I beleive the initial idea was that it helps on better make up - but it is not at all.&lt;br /&gt;I wish they make the product with smooth tape, and blended color with skin (transparent) after we wear them</li>
            <li> I READ THE DIRECTIONS AND STILL NEVER COULD USE THESE AS THEY WERE DESIGNED TO BUT I DID HAVE MANY LAUGHS BECAUSE OF THEM IT ARRIVED ON TIME AND FUNCTIONS AS ITS SUPOSE TOI JUST COULDNT GET THEM TO WORKPROPERLY</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re an older woman with drooping eyelids, this product will change your life!  it&#x27;s truly an instant eyelift and a huge boost in self-esteem.  natural look, with immediate eye lifting effects.  application perfection might take a few tries.  if you&#x27;re unsure how to apply youtube the video.  many asian women use this product, but i swear it should be marketed to older women.  amazing results for a small amount of money and effort!</li>
            <li> My sister bought me some eyelid tape from China and they worked great.  Unfortunately I couldn&#x27;t find the same brand online.  So I purchased these.  These do not work as well because I cannot cover it up with makeup.  The ones I&#x27;ve been using would blend in under my eye shadows, but this one stands out and become noticeable.  On a positive note, if you wear it just bare with no makeup, the clear tape does blend in.</li>
            <li> This product looks hideous on my eyes. It definitely looks like there&#x27;s a piece of scotch tape on your eyelid - shiny, flat, with a semi-opaque layer. Eye makeup does not work with this product, either. Pay an extra $8 and get a stretch fiber-based double eyelid product, which looks incredibly natural and works well with makeup (Mezaik or Mezical Fiber). I remember this product costing much cheaper than this listed price, too.</li>
            <li> love them.  makes my eyes look so much better.  takes a few times to figure out hope to put them on.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for more eyelid, but the tape is too visible and I don&#x27;t know how anyone can hide it with makeup. I&#x27;m caucasian with deep eye-sockets. Using this tape I can create just about any eyelid-shape I want - so for stage and possibly photographs these could be useful. For out and about - no way.</li>
            <li> I most deff an pleased. Thank you so much. Arrived a day or two before expected date. I ordered these first and then ordered some that were $21.00 just in case they didn&#x27;t do what I expected them to do at this very low price. However I do love them more then the ones that were more expensive. I will always buy these one as they work well and give me the eye lids that I hoped to have with them. The word for this product is AWESOME.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 28 and I&#x27;ve acquired terribly droopy eyelids. I&#x27;m very sensitive about it and when I saw these, I was all kinds of excited. It took a few tries to get both sides to match and they really do they trick. The create a double eyelid. One of the cons is that if you raise your eyebrows, they are definitely visible and I usually wear very heavy dark makeup and it can create lines around the strips. But, if the makeup is light, it&#x27;s fine. I think the users that gave horrible reviews either aren&#x27;t using them right OR are getting the wrong size. I would recommend these.</li>
            <li> I purchased it before because it is not that pricey.. It&#x27;s okay, does what it says but it&#x27;s OBVIOUS even when i put eye make up...I also tried fiber double eyelid but it&#x27;s hard to use so I ordered different brand of double eyelid tape and it will be arriving tomorrow, I hope it is not that visible compared with this tape..(-:</li>
            <li> Only one of my eyes has a severe droopy lid which makes it very apparent. I am so self conscious and hated looking in a mirror. I can&#x27;t afford cosmetic surgery and didn&#x27;t know what to do. I&#x27;m 54 years old and felt horrible about my face.  I bought this product and it has changed my life.  Instantly, I felt \\&quot;normal\\&quot; again.  This product is basically very easy to apply and extremely comfortable. I am SO pleased - there are no words to describe how well this product works.  Exceptional, phenomenal, etc.  I wear one every day and will continue to do so in the future. I highly recommend purchasing this.  It&#x27;s the best money you&#x27;ll ever spend to look good.</li>
            <li> Well, I put it to the test by Skyping my sister asking her which eye looked best, and she chose the eye with the tape! It was easy to apply, and it made my lid feel less heavy with it taped up. I will most likely purchase more in the future!</li>
            <li> I really like this product! It&#x27;s simple to use and the instructions on the package made it easy for me to understand how the tapes should be applied correctly.  I like them, because they are pre-cut and quick and easy to apply and open up my eyes as with age, my eyelids have become more puffy and hooded. I will certainly purchase this again and recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t get it to work correctly and it felt terrible.</li>
            <li> Love them. They work !</li>
            <li> I bought two Eyelid tapes. Both my mom and I love it really much! It is really convenient to use!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m asian in my early 30s and i have been really insecure about having no fold in my right eye. It wasn&#x27;t that inconspicuous in person, but in my pictures it really looked weird, like right eye looks so much smaller than my left. After I saw that infomercial about this other eyelid tape product i decided to look it up in amazon since i don&#x27;t wanna be tied up with this every month charge on my credit card. Didn&#x27;t find the exact product though, and stumbled across this amazing product! at first i was doubtful since it&#x27;s way cheaper than the advertised product but i read the reviews and most of them were good so i decided what do i have to lose anyway. I got it today , and put it on right away. at first it didn&#x27;t really do much, and it was a little painful. so i got online and went to this website (which they put on the package); and this link should take you to the proper way of putting them [...] ...and voila! now my left eye looks normal and with the tape on both eyes, they look much bigger! I LOVE IT!!!    UPDATE  well after a week of use , i began to realize the tape is really conspicuous and even my male co worker asked me whats going on with my eyelids! i know im putting them on right since i read all the instructions from their website and all the videos in youtube. they aren&#x27;t really that noticeable though if u put heavy black eyeshadow but i dont wanna look so over made-up all the time, i looked like i was going on a girls night out at work. i saw the brand Dream Look in a walgreens store and i tried them on, it&#x27;s way lots better than this korean product, hardly noticeable and just the right size. im going back to walgreens to get that last box!</li>
            <li> After several attempts of fidgeting with the stickers, I&#x27;ve realized I have no patience in evening out my wonk eyes.</li>
            <li> I like this product, and I think it works great! Unfortunately, I bought too much of it. I usually have the double eye-lid but it disappears once in a while. I bought it for those circumstances. I wish I had only bought one package instead of two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, the only con was that when it arrived, parts of the eye tape seemed to have \\&quot;melted\\&quot;. Not all parts, but one or two. I was still able to use the tape, but it seemed a little less sticky. It was still a great product though!</li>
            <li> This item comes with no instructions and left my eyes raw from the glue, did not do anything like it said it would so I would never buy again, big mistake.</li>
            <li> they are better then surgery .i learned to put it on first day cant live without them. i am so happy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every brand of eye tape, and these are my favorite. They stick all day. The outer surface is a bit rough so they&#x27;re not quite as invisible as other brands, but I&#x27;ve learned to put them on so it doesn&#x27;t matter. Choose these if you want a slightly wider tape.</li>
            <li> I thought it said double sided eyelid tape so I expected them to be sticky from both sides but they weren&#x27;t I guess that was my bad though</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a year and my item never came in.&lt;br /&gt;After hounding them for what feels like forever,&lt;br /&gt;they finally decided to refund me.&lt;br /&gt;They sent the money to a card I lost and said they already&lt;br /&gt;refunded my money back.&lt;br /&gt;NOT TRUE, since it was an account that has been closed, the money bounced back to them.&lt;br /&gt;After asking them to refund me again, they said they couldn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;LIES.&lt;br /&gt;Horrible and sketchy.&lt;br /&gt;I really wish i could have experienced this product.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work like i thought it would on my eyelids - good luck to others wanting results&lt;br /&gt;blah blah blah</li>
            <li> This little piece of tape did help open my eyes. I have a drooping or hooded eye, and the tape worked nicely. It looks like clear medical tape cut crescent-shape about 10mm. It works.</li>
            <li> it was not double sided and was thick enough to not be hidden when worn Basically, product was of no use and did not solve its purpose.</li>
            <li> This product wasn&#x27;t very expensive so I thought I would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;Directions were not in English. Had to look at the tiny picture  directions to try to understand how to use.&lt;br /&gt;The tiny clear half  moons were hard to apply to the eye lid.  They were visible, and anyone looking at me close up would be able to see that something was stuck to my eye. I played around with putting them on and I was disappointed I didn&#x27;t see  much of a lift.</li>
            <li> but, because I have oily skin, and even though I washed the oil off, the did not work for me.</li>
            <li> I love these....why spend $$$$$ on cosmetic eyelid surgery???</li>
            <li> Too thick and visible.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t figure out how to use it properly or proper placement. I&#x27;ve tried to apply several times and it looked obvious that I have TAPE on my eye lids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I cannot judge nor rate fairly..... So I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars for price and delivery.</li>
            <li> i am not a huge infomercial person but when i saw a simular product like this on tv i had to try it....my mom&#x27;s side of the family has genetically droopy eyelids and i am only 37 and am seeing the effects.  i have hated the appearance of my eyelids for some time and have often dreamed(only a dream) of getting an upper eyelid lift.... so when i looked on amazn and saw these at this price i figured why not give it a try. i am happy to say i love them!  i like to put mine up toward the middle of my lid so i can still apply some shadow next to my lashes and the makeup getting on them a little doesn&#x27;t bother the \\&quot;stayability\\&quot; of the tape at all.....in fact if u get it wrong the first time don&#x27;t worry cuz they are sticky enough to try a couple of times and get it right....and you seriously can&#x27;t see them!  they have a bit of a textured look to them by themselves but when u get them on they are transparent.....all i have to say is don&#x27;t be afraid to try them for how many you get it&#x27;s totally worth it!</li>
            <li> big and thick shows on the eyelid...</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe the results from this product! I have uneven eyelids and my trouble eyelid is my right eye. My right eye is a monolid and left double lid. I wore the tape on my mono eyelid for a week day/night, and couldn&#x27;t believe the magic it did! Goodbye uneven eyelids! I am very happy with this product! I will continue on using this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Asian and I have one parallel eyelid and one drooping, tapered eyelid. This eyelid tape really does the trick for me. Not only is it breathable, but it also is not seen by my friends or anyone around me. I use this for my modeling makeup; even in my closeups, you are not able to tell that I have eyelid tape on.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend applying the eyelid tape after you have done your makeup (false lashes included). It will make it a much cleaner and simpler experience than if you tried to apply your makeup afterward. Also, you will still be able to see the tape when you close your eyes, but if you are just blinking, no one will notice.&lt;br /&gt;When applying the tape, make sure it is close to your lash line because it will help fold your eyelid skin correctly.&lt;br /&gt;If you want a one-sided eyelid tape that is bound to work when used correctly, then this is a worthy investment.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> I have droopy eye lids, and I tried this product for night out occasions. When properly placed on the eye lid, it works wonders! My eyes look so much more open and young! BUT, it sometimes takes me 15 minutes to place them properly!! It is very difficult to get the correct fold and have the strip hidden in it at the same time. I think it would help if the strip had a slightly different shape. One of the sides is straight, which does not help follow the eye ball shape.</li>
            <li> I use this every day.  I have heavy eyelids which I think make me look older.  This tape widens my eyes considerably, and I can&#x27;t feel them while they are on.  They stay in place, but come off easily.  No one knows I&#x27;m wearing them unless I were to keep my eyes closed while someone was looking at me.  I wore them for 8 months before my husband knew it and only then because he watched me applying them one morning.  My daughters didn&#x27;t know I was wearing them for 6 months before I told them I was.  Once when I wasn&#x27;t wearing them, someone told me I looked tired, so I know they make a difference, but not so that anyone knows what it is that I&#x27;ve done.  I wish it had come with some kind of instructions for placement, however, I think it is different for each individual depending upon the shape of their eye and how deep set they are.  They are inexpensive enough to experiment with a little to find where you like them best.</li>
            <li> I tried this eyelid tape. It Actually worked and my eyes looked younger. However, everytime I blinked or looked sort of downward, they were horribly visible. I wont give up on eyelid tape but this brand kind of sucks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always want to try eyelid tape after seeing videos of people wearing them.  These are very, very noticeable and I&#x27;m not sure how anyone could wear these out in public without embarrassment.  When your eyes are open, you can&#x27;t see the tape at all.    Whenever you blink, or have your eyes in any position besides wide open(looking down), everyone can tell you&#x27;re wearing tape.  Hello!!! We&#x27;re humans and we need to blink on a regular basis or our eyeballs will dry out.    Better to go au natural and forgo the tape.</li>
            <li> These stuck to my eyes, were very hard to apply, and if you want to put makeup over them, forget about it! The tool is useless, and I wouldn&#x27;t reccomend this product to anyone. I wasted 5 bucks!</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery, item is wonderful, works fantastic on my eyes and stays on till I remove it, and not visible at all.</li>
            <li> Thought this was a good product.  Took a while to put it on properly and when I did, with some shiny eyeshadow (dark colour) on top was quite good for me. I&#x27;m 55 and while I cant afford an eye lift, this will have to do for me!&lt;br /&gt;Cathy</li>
            <li> I have been using these eyelid tape charms for the past few months and find these to be quite helpful with my overall eyelid appearance.  People cannot tell when I am wearing these.  Love these!!!</li>
            <li> This product works well and was easy to use.  They do a good job eliminating my &amp;#34;hooded&amp;#34; lids.  They are certainly a lot less expensive than the Dream Look eye lift tape you see on TV.  I have found a similar product on Amazon that comes in different sizes (thin, medium, etc.) and found that I like the thin tape the best.</li>
            <li> A bit thicker than expected.  They stick together when you remove so need to be careful.  Good for the price but would pay up next time for the better quality ones from Japan.</li>
            <li> en...this tape is really thick and uncomfortable to wear.... also, it is hard for me to cover it with makeup</li>
            <li> working for me and i would recommed this to those who dont have doubled eyelids. i will order another set ilove it</li>
            <li> i get the idea but i thought this was double sided if it was it would of probably worked</li>
            <li> irritates eyes, it is VERY visible and does not much to improve sagging skin</li>
            <li> I thought the tape was too thick so I ordered different kind and plus it doesn&#x27;t stick very well. Not too expensive.</li>
            <li> I have old age sagging eyelids and was looking for some way to lift them up without surgery so I ordered this product. When it arrived I could not find any instructions as to how to apply it so I ended up just throwing it away. I was probably trying to use it for the wrong thing.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for the price. The results are great. I used them for a wedding and I looked younger as I had an eyelid surgery. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The ad said double tape this was not what i wanted. I assume double meant double sided.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item because it was only $1 ($3 plus S+H). I read the good reviews and had hope, but I should&#x27;ve read the negative reviews. The tape is easily applicable, however like others say, it&#x27;s very noticeable when you close your eyes or blink. The tape is thick and has a sort of bumpy cover on the front so it does not blend in easily. I do not recommend this to others. I&#x27;m waiting for the double-sided tape to become cheaper so that I can buy it, never buying from this brand again. Should&#x27;ve known cheap price&#x3D; cheap brand!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE-11/6/12&lt;br /&gt;I tried wearing the tape once or twice and simply covered it with dark eyeliner. Only one person verbally told me she noticed what was on my eyes and asked what it was. But thanks to the tape, my eyelids are now even and double-eyelided without wearing any tape! :)) I am a super happy girl. Sometimes my eye will go back to monolid, but if I put the tape back on for a few hours, it will go back to double-eyelid for the next few days.</li>
            <li> I like this product and a good seller. i received it very quick. I felt surprise when I opened the package. I got two free skincare samples in the package.</li>
            <li> The tape works really well but it&#x27;s so noticeable. This was the first time purchasing double eyelid tape ever. I looked up a bunch of YouTube videos to see how to apply it. I know for sure that I applied it correctly. Even when I put on my makeup you can still clearly see it! It&#x27;s not something I&#x27;m purchasing again.</li>
            <li> It helped me turn my mono eyelid to a double but only temporary, good thing it comes with alot of tape. It was expensive at first but I figured since its an import it&#x27;s the appropriate price</li>
            <li> Big help to some of clients that needs a eyelid for a btter eyeshadow</li>
            <li> These are only sticky on one side. I thought it was double sided since its been in business for so long that it would have to be the best. How do you have double eyelids if it only sticks to one side?</li>
            <li> If you have drooping eye lids it does help to an extent. If you apply it at an off angle it makes your eye even puffier. Need to take your time applying the tape.</li>
            <li> I thought this was double sided eye tape.  D.U.P Double Sided eyelid tape works very well  to open my hooded eyes.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product and so simple. I&#x27;ve always had hooded eyes, and with age, it only gets worse. These little adhesive strips are like an instant eye lift without the cost and the pain. Easy to attach and remove. You don&#x27;t even know they are there. Love them and will definitely continue to use them.</li>
            <li> I purchased these due to my heavy eyelid, and they make a noticeable difference. They are relatively easy to put on; involved only a little trial &amp; error. After a few tries I think I have it down. For me, I knew pretty quickly if they we&#x27;re where I wanted them because, if not, they become rather uncomfortable within a short time.  For the money, they&#x27;re pretty good...cheaper than a brow lift.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed in this product!  I was looking for a double sided tape for hooded eyes.  Because there was no information in English I could not tell exactly what they were.  I would not recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Selected this product because as an aging woman my droopy eyelids are affecting my eyesight.  In a desperate search for something (other than surgery) to lift my lids i ordered this product.  Difficult to remove from adhesive paper, sometimes an end will roll up on finger prior to placement, and impossible to straighten out.  Does not work, stilll visible on lid after makeup applied.</li>
            <li> This product is a waste of time and money, would not buy again. One positive thing I did receive the product a head of time which was good.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY..........I figured for $3.00 I would try them, should have known it was too good to be true.  It looked like I put a piece of medical tape on my eye!  Tried many times, but to no avail!</li>
            <li> OK, I don&#x27;t know Chinese, so I have no clue as to how I&#x27;m supposed to use this thing. All the instructions are in Chinese (i think it&#x27;s Chinese) I am still trying to figure out the blue/green contraption. Looks like i might just toss this thing.</li>
            <li> This eyelid tape is nice because it comes in a compact, square envelope that prevents the tape from getting dirty.  The green fork is for enhancing the crease in your eyelids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tape itself is better than other brands I have tried because first, it is easy to remove from the card.  Other brands are such that the top piece sticks to the lower piece and is difficult to separate.  The tape is stiff (but not uncomfortable) so it is good quality.</li>
            <li> Product worked like a charm Received it in a few days. I am very pleased with the product and service.</li>
            <li> These are really noticeable and awful. And after trying them out i realized i like my eyes hooded the way they are. I would suggest leaving your eyes as they are because hooded eyes are sexy!</li>
