    <ol>
            <li> I have been using this for a couple of years at $7.99 a tube.It is sad the company discontinued it,now you can make a large profit.</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful! I don&#x27;t know what I would do without this product. I will definitely order again</li>
            <li> This is the best denture product out there. No mess, No ooze, and best of all no taste. It beats all of the other denture adhesives hands down.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE ONLY PRODUCT THAT WORKS TO FIX MY PROBLEM.I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY THEY ARE NOT GOING TO KEEP  MAKING IT AVAILABLE.</li>
            <li> Brought as much as I could afford! This product is scarce. Best denture adhesive on the market.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to dentures &amp; have tried everything. It&#x27;s easy to apply and take off the dentures. 1 tube has lasted me 2 months now!.</li>
            <li> For the first time in my 76 years I have top and bottom plates.  All of my teeth have been extracted. Talking to me, my dentist recommended my buying Cushion Grip.  He said he thought it was the best dental adhesive because it works with a thinner coating. Unfortunately our local pharmacies had discontinued stocking Cushion Grip. I went on line to Amazon and ordered four tubes.  I have been very pleased.  It really works well, for multiple days.  I don&#x27;t have to clean my false teeth every night, but can go three or four days. Thank you Cushion Grip.</li>
            <li> I baught this item for about $5. Now that it was discontinued some people have raised the price to beyond greedy levels. Very shameful.</li>
            <li> Great product--- just too expensive--- last year we purchased it at CVS for $ 7.00 a tube.  Now look at the price !!!</li>
            <li> just what the doctor didn&#x27;t order.  I found this by accident, and I have used it every since. My dental professional, didn&#x27;t even offer it as and alternative to the normal store offerings.  I was so happy when I happened upon a you tube video/videos, and that did it, I was sold.  Been ordering and using ever since.  Great product, really works as advertised.</li>
            <li> As far as Cushion Grip goes,it works great.It makes the dentures so much more comfortable,it&#x27;s like night and day.But don&#x27;t buy it thinking it is an adhesive or you will be giving it a one star review!! It relines them more than glues them in.It brings back the suction is what it does.I sometimes still use a small dab of adhesive if I really want them stuck firmly but if I&#x27;m just at work or kicking around the house,their fine without it.I just got my dentures relined at my denture guy a few weeks ago and I came right home and relined them myself with Cushion Grip they fit sooooooo much and were sooooooooo much more comfy. This guys been doing dentures for 35 plus years and I&#x27;ve been using C G for a few months and my fit was way,way better than his.Thats how  magic I feel this stuff is.I your dentures are uncomfortable,don&#x27;t put up with it,get Cushion Grip and you will say wow!!! I do have one complaint about Amazon though. Twice I ordered a four pack of Cushion Grip (for around $23) and twice for no reason it was cancelled and a week later the price quadrupled to over $20 bucks per tube.This stuff is good but don&#x27;t buy it here,.you can still get it at CVS for $7.99 per tube</li>
            <li> There is nothing on the market to beat Cushion Grip if you have ill fitting dentures.  Cushion Grip forms to your gums and sets up enough that you can eat, brush and clean.  Replace about twice a week.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since I found it at a Wal-Mart store. The comfort and firmness has been a huge benefit to me. I recommend it to everyone because it will allow your appliances to last longer. It will prevent your gums from getting sore spots. The length of time that the paste will last in your mouth is immeasurable. If you have to apply paste or powder more than once a day, you need to have this at your disposal and you will save time and money with this product!.I have had my appliances since 2002. I only use Cushion grip on my lower devices. My devices are still in like new condition! They do not fall out by accident, ever! I put the dentures in in the morning and I still have to try a little bit to remove them at the end of the day ! I replace the cushion grip every 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Price has gotten ridiculous.  This company lost a customer....what is this $105.00 crap??</li>
            <li> The best I have tried but very expensive.</li>
            <li> Best ever for denture wearers.</li>
            <li> I love the product, but it has become way too expensive!  Last December, I purchased 4 tubes in the mid eighties.  I checked yesterday and one tube is $79.00!  What happened!  At this time, I will not be purchasing.</li>
            <li> This product for dentures is terrible and simmilar to concrete.  Once you get it onto a denture it takers a jackhammer to get off.  Go back to Fixodent or something that will come off.  I was amazed at how hard this stuff really became.  Totally unreal.  Try something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon unsatisfied customer</li>
            <li> This is the best thing I had since I cannot afford implants.  It keeps them tight and I can eat without gagging.</li>
            <li> this is a very good product works well ..  will buy it again .ihave already told my family about it</li>
            <li> I have used Cushion Grip for years. I can&#x27;t use anythng but Cushion Grip, but the price is completely outragious! I love this stuff and I wish I could continue using it, but I am retired and I just can&#x27;t afford these new prices. I used to be able to buy this at CVS for 7.99$/ tube.</li>
            <li> Some or the more readily available name brand denture creams/powders just wad up on the gums. This is long lasting and comfortable on the gums.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I use it on my my Compleatly In Canal (CIC) hearing aids to keep them snug in my ears to prevent feedback. This is the only thing that fixes this problem.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Best thing to make my dentures feel almost like my real teeth.  Shame that Merck quit making it and I now have to pay 3 or 4 times what it originally cost to get the same product.</li>
            <li> It is amazing how much I had to pay for this product so many love and it is being discontinued. The suppliers made out like bandits.</li>
            <li> Great product, works as it should, stays soft and pliable..  Will definitely purchase again when needed. Received quickly, shipment was good..</li>
