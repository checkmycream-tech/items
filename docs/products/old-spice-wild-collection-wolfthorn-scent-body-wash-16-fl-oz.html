            <li>The best way to describe the scent is &amp;#34;manly synthetic citrus&amp;#34;.</li>

            <li>I got this body wash because I figured it would smell as good as its deodorant counterpart.</li>

            <li>i see all these reviews saying it smells good and</li>
            <li>Wolfthorn Stick deodorant, good size for my travel kit.</li>
            <li>For all of those saying this smells great, or even neutral, just know this: to MANY people you are going to smell like you PUKED</li>
            <li>Good stuff and smells nice,</li>
            <li>and if youre going ourt why not some body sprat and top it off with some nice cologne!</li>
            <li>So pleased!</li>
            <li>If you are a fan of Happy, then I believe you will really enjoy Wolfthorn.</li>
            <li>It cleans really nice, and seems to linger on your skin for awhile after you finish your shower.</li>
            <li>But, to be honest, I kind of like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it manly?</li>
            <li>Kind of.</li>
            <li>Well, yeah it&#x27;s kind of girly too.</li>
            <li>I will say that each product has its own unique twist on the scent but they&#x27;re all great.</li>
            <li>The wild collection is awesome.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, and the deodorant.</li>
            <li>Its stronger then my favorite scent, Hawkridge.</li>
            <li>This smell reminds me more of the Kool-Aid Man than Wolfthorn.</li>
            <li>best way to describe this is that it smells like one of those Japanese air fresheners for cars.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is even better, Wolfthorn and Komodo are my two favorites.</li>
            <li>It was the most pungent foul ODOR, not scent, of rotting Limburger cheese or rotted......</li>
            <li>I love the spray of &amp;#34;wolfthorn&amp;#34; and the deodorant but dear god</li>
            <li>It smells better on your skin than in the bottle.</li>
            <li>Before I start my story, I will say I love the scent of this and the deodorant</li>
            <li>It has a citrus smell to it for sure.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be more of a lone wolf when you buy this item.</li>
            <li>I would compare it to calogne&#x27;s we buy at top pricing in stores, but in body wash form.</li>
            <li>the Wolfthorn Body Wash. It arrived on time, the cost was OK (and it got delivered to my door) and came to my surprise with a 9g (.35 oz)</li>
            <li>Good product,Works well on entire body and you dont have to use plenty at once,Suds alot and smells good too</li>
            <li>The citrus was unexpected but welcome.</li>
            <li>While leaving you smelling ultra fine.</li>
            <li>Wolfthorn having no idea what the various scents smell like since I&#x27;m a wolf lover, it smells great a little citrus scent to it, real nice!</li>
            <li>This body wash is great if you want to smell life human vomit.</li>
            <li>Why such a great difference in opinions on this scent?</li>
            <li>Fantastic fragrance after shower</li>
            <li>If that sounds bizarre, that&#x27;s because it is.</li>
            <li>The primary scent of \\&quot;Woflthorn\\&quot; is not super-tuff manly badass dude who attracts all the honeys; the primary scent is \\&quot;grapefruit\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>about as good as any old spice antiperspirant.  </li>
            <li>has a nice clean smell highly recommend</li>
            <li>In conjunction with the deodorant, I would definitely recommend this body wash and you are guaranteed to smell amazing!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Smells great, lasts pretty well after your shower, and matches up with the deodorant and cologne of the same name.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They wouldn&#x27;t sell this product to a guy if it was actually packaged the way it smells...which is bright orange-y</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a sweet musky smell to it.</li>
            <li>On full moons I find myself on the floor convulsing when using this, and my body tears to pieces</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure Old Spice was counting on that also because there is a distinct disconnect between the imagery and the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furious battling wolves and cheap peach bubble</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe wolves are bright orange-y pink in pungent golden-y brown clothing?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shipping was on time, product is worth its price, everything came well packaged.</li>
            <li>Smells like a freshly opened package of Smarties candy.</li>
            <li>That would be OK if in was 8 years old.</li>
            <li>this is more of an old guys body wash.</li>
            <li>I give this product five stars more because I (and, ahem, some other people) love the smell than anything else.</li>
            <li>When you smell this right out of the container it smells like sweets but don&#x27;t let it trick you.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t feel clean when my whole body smells like musky cheese.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe that anyone would think think it smelled good, much less want to slather it all over their body....</li>
            <li>I am super stoked about this new scent!</li>
            <li>I enjoy Old Spice.</li>
            <li>Really Mom!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a sucker for good marketing and cool graphics...which is why I bought the Wolfthorn deodorant.</li>
            <li>Its not feminine, but its different than most men&#x27;s colognes which is why he likes it.</li>
            <li>What stellar wingmen.</li>
            <li>this case, its my first aquisition of  this item.&lt;br /&gt;Smell is not so durable.&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy again.</li>
            <li>Smells EXACTLY like someone puked in a car.</li>
            <li>I thought I was the only one, but seems like this is being said by more than just myself.</li>
            <li>Love it and the commercial.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since it seems like most people like it, I assume it&#x27;s a very personal thing.  </li>
            <li>Just be aware that for some segment of the population, it will smell like you puked on yourself.</li>
            <li>As for the body wash, it&#x27;s OK, and delivers lather, suds and a different scent to wake me up from the torpor of the morning and prepare for the existential drain of another work day.</li>
            <li>cool, laid-back, and a new person.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ve read the other descriptions and/or objections to this smell, and I&#x27;ll include my own.</li>
            <li>thing is I&#x27;m not sure I don&#x27;t mind smelling bright orange-y</li>
            <li>However, I was chosen to receive the full wolfthorn set from old spice as a trial.</li>
            <li>I prefer Pure Sport or Swagger.</li>
            <li>I find this to be a pleasant change from 99% of all the other man smalls out on the market - they all seem to smell the same to me.</li>
            <li>Smells like I&#x27;ve been to a kids birthday party and drank too much punch.</li>
            <li>My husband loves this deodorant so I am getting him the whole line.</li>
            <li>i didnt even know a body wash could really do that.</li>
            <li>It really reminds me of Clinique&#x27;s cologne \\&quot;Happy\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how much this smells like stomach acid...</li>
            <li>Really like the way this smells</li>
            <li>When it comes to \\&quot;male\\&quot; body wash, I often find we are given scents that smell like nothing at all or leave us smelling like too much of a spice rack.</li>
            <li>Old spice is suppose to have manly scents, but the only manly factor of this is it smells like a guy had too many shots, and we get to bathe in the aftermath.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My father used Old Spice, his father used Old Spice, and as much as an adventurous guy I may be, I use Old Spice.</li>
            <li>These scents are NEW, fresh and leave me feeling clean all day long.</li>
            <li>As far as I&#x27;m aware this scent hasn&#x27;t hit stores yet.</li>
            <li>Old Spice&#x27;s \\&quot;Wild Collection\\&quot; is an answer to the modern classic male that will honestly make you look forward to your next shower (not that I didn&#x27;t bathe before) :-p.</li>
            <li>The spray more than the other products is nearly identical to it.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re into masculine and modern scents, give this guy a try.</li>
            <li>I do enjoy all your other products/scents.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know that either, but I&#x27;m willing to have an open mind on the topic.</li>
            <li>It definitely has a more masculine scent than some of the other new ones, like Fiji for instance.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell like the typical cheap colognes and body wash</li>
            <li>a lone majestic wolf high upon the mountain of Matterhorn.&lt;br /&gt;Besides that and getting rabies and losing my social life, 5 out of 5!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not for everyone clearly -</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe they still sell this but discontinued foxcrest which smelled like maybe something natural.</li>
            <li>Not too masculine but not too feminine</li>
            <li>The ones in the overly-manufactured plastic housings that you&#x27;d expect to find in any vehicle in a Fast &amp; Furious movie, especially Tokyo Drift.</li>
            <li>It has a definite manly cologne scent to it, much richer in fragrance.</li>
            <li>this is my fav wild collection scent.</li>
            <li>Old Spice does this well.</li>
            <li>Hey, I like Old Spice, so sue me.</li>
            <li>Took a walk on the wild side and tried</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s Old Spice.</li>
            <li>They are a sweeter, younger type of smell compared to classic Old Spice.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately its the only good one in wild collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>w/too much scent and at the same time seem to cancel personal body odor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m seeing all of these positive reviews saying it smells like candy or orange-y pink, as if that is a scent.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Old Spice Wild Collection&#x27;s Wolfthorn Scent Body Wash is another totally different scent breaking from the line of Old Spice traditional scent.</li>
            <li>After having bought multiple Old Spice products they dropped the ball on this one&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe that I&#x27;m the only one who thinks that the smell is completely heinous.</li>

            <li> My father used Old Spice, his father used Old Spice, and as much as an adventurous guy I may be, I use Old Spice.</li>
            <li> These scents are NEW, fresh and leave me feeling clean all day long.</li>
            <li> As far as I&#x27;m aware this scent hasn&#x27;t hit stores yet.</li>
            <li> Old Spice&#x27;s \\&quot;Wild Collection\\&quot; is an answer to the modern classic male that will honestly make you look forward to your next shower (not that I didn&#x27;t bathe before) :-p.</li>
            <li> The spray more than the other products is nearly identical to it.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re into masculine and modern scents, give this guy a try.</li>
            <li> I do enjoy all your other products/scents.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know that either, but I&#x27;m willing to have an open mind on the topic.</li>
            <li> It definitely has a more masculine scent than some of the other new ones, like Fiji for instance.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like the typical cheap colognes and body wash</li>
            <li> a lone majestic wolf high upon the mountain of Matterhorn.&lt;br /&gt;Besides that and getting rabies and losing my social life, 5 out of 5!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not for everyone clearly -</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe they still sell this but discontinued foxcrest which smelled like maybe something natural.</li>
            <li> Not too masculine but not too feminine</li>
            <li> The ones in the overly-manufactured plastic housings that you&#x27;d expect to find in any vehicle in a Fast &amp; Furious movie, especially Tokyo Drift.</li>
            <li> It has a definite manly cologne scent to it, much richer in fragrance.</li>
            <li> this is my fav wild collection scent.</li>
            <li> Old Spice does this well.</li>
            <li> Hey, I like Old Spice, so sue me.</li>
            <li> Took a walk on the wild side and tried</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s Old Spice.</li>
            <li> They are a sweeter, younger type of smell compared to classic Old Spice.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately its the only good one in wild collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> w/too much scent and at the same time seem to cancel personal body odor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seeing all of these positive reviews saying it smells like candy or orange-y pink, as if that is a scent.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Old Spice Wild Collection&#x27;s Wolfthorn Scent Body Wash is another totally different scent breaking from the line of Old Spice traditional scent.</li>
            <li> After having bought multiple Old Spice products they dropped the ball on this one&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe that I&#x27;m the only one who thinks that the smell is completely heinous.</li>
            <li> It still foams up quite well and the scent is in long lasting.</li>
            <li> Long lasting&lt;br</li>
            <li> but hey - I prefer this smell and hope they keep it around for a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not aware of body washes &amp;#34;going bad&amp;#34; but if there&#x27;s such a thing-</li>
            <li> I couldnt put my finger on the smell before, but after a few weeks I realized it smells EXACTLY  like green gum drops!</li>
            <li> think it helped me realize that I was maybe a little tired of richly pungent golden-y</li>
            <li> How can I be lonely when I have my three wolfdogs already with me?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not using &#x27;vomit&#x27; as a negative descriptor, I&#x27;m saying it&#x27;s actually reminiscent of it for me and triggers the same gut wrenching reaction.  </li>
            <li> They should call it LadyThorn and it should be pink.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently noticed that at the end of a long/very active day, he had only a subtle smell of this product and there was no cover-up smell of any body order.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t smell the &amp;#34;sweet, skittle-like&amp;#34; scent that other people are talking about.  </li>
            <li> I was out the other day and asked some dude what cologne he was wearing and then realized it was me.</li>
            <li> It has a rancid, foul, sour odor.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand this smell, to me it smells like if you added a little bit of grape drink powder to a bunch of dust.</li>
            <li> Alas, I&#x27;m stuck at home, alone, sniffing my fruitily fragrant wolfishly womanly pits.</li>
            <li> Sorry Old Spice.</li>
            <li> I remember growing up with a horrible association to Old Spice products, the name itself was dated, it reminded me of old men in retirement homes and it had this overall trashy, dated scent to it.</li>
            <li> I thought, that HAS to be wrong, or bad, so I grabbed the next bottle and the next, but they were all the same.</li>
            <li> te body wash had an usual side effect on me...</li>
            <li> think this is by far the worst smelling product Old Spice has to offer.</li>
            <li> THIS one went far beyond BAD.  </li>
            <li> My son was smelling all of the different Old Spice scents (he&#x27;d been using this brand for awhile) and when he smelled Wolfthorn, he immediately scrunched up his face and jerked it away from himself telling me it smelled so disgusting</li>
            <li> Disappointing lesson in false advertising for my 14 year old son.  </li>
            <li> We thought maybe it wouldn&#x27;t smell so bad after actually using it....wrong.  </li>
            <li> This took place at the Safeway in Novato, CA, so maybe there&#x27;s some explanation of why this particular batch smelled so incredibly sickening.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Smells absolutely horrible, like the smell expired?&lt;br /&gt;Regret buying it without smelling it in store first</li>
            <li> soled base with regular deodereant anround</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost convinconvinced there is something wrong with my bottle.  </li>
            <li> this stuff is bad.</li>
            <li> it is so bad, it smells like bad peaches.</li>
            <li> I hate the scent of this.</li>
            <li> but i personally hate it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found a bad smelling one yet!</li>
            <li> I made him take another shower with my shower gel because he smelled so terrible.</li>
            <li> Mike went in the trash after one disgusting use.</li>
            <li> I was I in for a nasty disappointment.i</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE.</li>
            <li> Yeah - it&#x27;s a welcomed vs the just boring &#x27;guy cologne&#x27; smell.&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> about as good as any old spice antiperspirant.  soled base with regular deodereant anround that and if youre going ourt why not some body sprat and top it off with some nice cologne!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, and the deodorant. Unfortunately its the only good one in wild collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That aside it is a bit tropical shoulda been called PANTHER something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could smell this all day.</li>
            <li> It smells like f***ing skittles</li>
            <li> A pleasant change... The citrus was unexpected but welcome.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost convinconvinced there is something wrong with my bottle.  Everyone says it smells fruity like peach bubblegum.  Mine smells like bleu cheese.  The smell is unmistakable.  I don&#x27;t know if that musk is manly or something but I think I&#x27;m going to throw it out.  I can&#x27;t feel clean when my whole body smells like musky cheese.</li>
            <li> This body wash is great if you want to smell life human vomit. Why such a great difference in opinions on this scent? Maybe this smells different to different people? For all of those saying this smells great, or even neutral, just know this: to MANY people you are going to smell like you PUKED yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only relationship this scent has to wolves is that it might keep a ravenous pack at bay.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand this smell, to me it smells like if you added a little bit of grape drink powder to a bunch of dust. I can&#x27;t believe they still sell this but discontinued foxcrest which smelled like maybe something natural. Please Oldspice bring foxcrest back.</li>
            <li> My husband always smells so good when he uses this.</li>
            <li> In conjunction with the deodorant, I would definitely recommend this body wash and you are guaranteed to smell amazing!</li>
            <li> The scent of Wolfthorn lasts but just isn&#x27;t my preference. Its stronger then my favorite scent, Hawkridge. Hopefully they keep evolving it.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the name Wolfthorn having no idea what the various scents smell like since I&#x27;m a wolf lover, it smells great a little citrus scent to it, real nice!</li>
            <li> I use all four wolfthorn products. (body spray, shower gel, antiperspirant, and deodorant)&lt;br /&gt;It has a sweet musky smell to it. I will say that each product has its own unique twist on the scent but they&#x27;re all great. Not too masculine but not too feminine either-it&#x27;s just a pleasant citrus like smell</li>
            <li> I picked up the deodorant at the store and took a whiff of the scratch &amp; sniff sticker on the package. I resisted the urge to howl in delight when I smelled this delicious blend of fruity and citrusy goodness. If this is what wolves smell like, I&#x27;m adopting a pup as soon as possible. If only I had a boyfriend to rub this all over. Alas, I&#x27;m stuck at home, alone, sniffing my fruitily fragrant wolfishly womanly pits. Yummy.</li>
            <li> This smell reminds me more of the Kool-Aid Man than Wolfthorn. Smells like I&#x27;ve been to a kids birthday party and drank too much punch. When I hear Wolfthorn I think of Cedar or Pine smell maybe. Definitely not fruit punch</li>
            <li> My husband received this as a Christmas gift from someone in our family.  We decided to throw it away because it totally smells like vomit.  It has a rancid, foul, sour odor.  I don&#x27;t smell the &amp;#34;sweet, skittle-like&amp;#34; scent that other people are talking about.  We thought maybe it wouldn&#x27;t smell so bad after actually using it....wrong.  I made him take another shower with my shower gel because he smelled so terrible.</li>
            <li> When you smell this right out of the container it smells like sweets but don&#x27;t let it trick you. It smells unbelievably great after shower!&lt;br /&gt;+ Fantastic fragrance after shower&lt;br /&gt;+ Long lasting&lt;br /&gt;This is simply a great shower gel for men!</li>
            <li> This smells sooo good. It cleans really nice, and seems to linger on your skin for awhile after you finish your shower.</li>
            <li> After having bought multiple Old Spice products they dropped the ball on this one&lt;br /&gt;Smells absolutely horrible, like the smell expired?&lt;br /&gt;Regret buying it without smelling it in store first</li>
            <li> This smells just like strawberry gummybears.  They should call it LadyThorn and it should be pink.  Mike went in the trash after one disgusting use.</li>
            <li> Good product,Works well on entire body and you dont have to use plenty at once,Suds alot and smells good too</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ve read the other descriptions and/or objections to this smell, and I&#x27;ll include my own. The scent of this reminds me nothing of wolves nor thorns. In fact, it evokes none of the howl-at-the-moon manliness that you would expect from the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best way to describe this is that it smells like one of those Japanese air fresheners for cars. The ones in the overly-manufactured plastic housings that you&#x27;d expect to find in any vehicle in a Fast &amp; Furious movie, especially Tokyo Drift. Look up &amp;#34;Air Spencer&amp;#34; if you don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m talking about. The best way to describe the scent is &amp;#34;manly synthetic citrus&amp;#34;. If that sounds bizarre, that&#x27;s because it is. But, to be honest, I kind of like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it manly? Kind of. Is it girly? Well, yeah it&#x27;s kind of girly too. But somehow it works.</li>
            <li> I enjoy Old Spice. It helps wash away my worries. Plus, it makes me feel...cool, laid-back, and a new person.</li>
            <li> The wild collection is awesome. I haven&#x27;t found a bad smelling one yet! They are a sweeter, younger type of smell compared to classic Old Spice. Plus you won&#x27;t smell like a bundle of coconuts with that Fiji/islandy stuff they have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells great, lasts pretty well after your shower, and matches up with the deodorant and cologne of the same name.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like the typical cheap colognes and body wash every guy smells like. The fragrance is even better, Wolfthorn and Komodo are my two favorites.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe that I&#x27;m the only one who thinks that the smell is completely heinous. My son was smelling all of the different Old Spice scents (he&#x27;d been using this brand for awhile) and when he smelled Wolfthorn, he immediately scrunched up his face and jerked it away from himself telling me it smelled so disgusting, it was just &amp;#34;the grossest thing he&#x27;d ever smelled&amp;#34; I told him to stop exaggerating &amp; ignored him, then he said, &amp;#34;No! Really Mom! It smells like yucky cheese!&amp;#34; At that, I grabbed it and smelled it.......WHOA!! It was the most pungent foul ODOR, not scent, of rotting Limburger cheese or rotted......something. I thought, that HAS to be wrong, or bad, so I grabbed the next bottle and the next, but they were all the same. I couldn&#x27;t believe that anyone would think think it smelled good, much less want to slather it all over their body....I shudder at the thought. This took place at the Safeway in Novato, CA, so maybe there&#x27;s some explanation of why this particular batch smelled so incredibly sickening. I&#x27;m not aware of body washes &amp;#34;going bad&amp;#34; but if there&#x27;s such a thing- THIS one went far beyond BAD.  Sorry Old Spice. I do enjoy all your other products/scents.</li>
            <li> I got this body wash because I figured it would smell as good as its deodorant counterpart. It turns out it does, and I can smell like that coming out of the shower. I give this product five stars more because I (and, ahem, some other people) love the smell than anything else. Shipping was on time, product is worth its price, everything came well packaged. Nobody cares, the smell is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a nocturnal creature, this product is for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a sucker for good marketing and cool graphics...which is why I bought the Wolfthorn deodorant. I&#x27;m sure Old Spice was counting on that also because there is a distinct disconnect between the imagery and the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furious battling wolves and cheap peach bubble gum?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They wouldn&#x27;t sell this product to a guy if it was actually packaged the way it smells...which is bright orange-y pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing is I&#x27;m not sure I don&#x27;t mind smelling bright orange-y pink.&lt;br /&gt;I think it helped me realize that I was maybe a little tired of richly pungent golden-y browns.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe wolves are bright orange-y pink in pungent golden-y brown clothing?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does the reintroduction of wolves actually benefit an ecosystem?&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know...I&#x27;m not fully convinced yet.&lt;br /&gt;Does this product smell like wolves?&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know that either, but I&#x27;m willing to have an open mind on the topic.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this deodorant so I am getting him the whole line. I couldnt put my finger on the smell before, but after a few weeks I realized it smells EXACTLY  like green gum drops! Its not feminine, but its different than most men&#x27;s colognes which is why he likes it.</li>
            <li> Totally smells like Ralph Lauren Romance Silver. The spray more than the other products is nearly identical to it.</li>
            <li> Old Spice Wild Collection&#x27;s Wolfthorn Scent Body Wash is another totally different scent breaking from the line of Old Spice traditional scent. I like this one. It definitely has a more masculine scent than some of the other new ones, like Fiji for instance. It has a definite manly cologne scent to it, much richer in fragrance. It still foams up quite well and the scent is in long lasting. It did leave me feeling refreshed and invigorated enough to write about it!</li>
            <li> man this stuff is hanus! I love the spray of &amp;#34;wolfthorn&amp;#34; and the deodorant but dear god this stuff is bad. I took a shower and was expecting it to smell as good as the spray...I was I in for a nasty disappointment.i went in and was like&amp;#34;wow what a wonderful scent of butt crack and cheese&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;do yourself a favor and don&#x27;t come close to even buying this product,unless you want to smell like garbage. -12 out of 5</li>
            <li> My son likes this body wash</li>
            <li> I was out the other day and asked some dude what cologne he was wearing and then realized it was me. I hope they don&#x27;t ever stop making this stuff. Lasts all day too.</li>
            <li> Disappointing lesson in false advertising for my 14 year old son.  The primary scent of \\&quot;Woflthorn\\&quot; is not super-tuff manly badass dude who attracts all the honeys; the primary scent is \\&quot;grapefruit\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Good stuff and smells nice, but I&#x27;d definitely recommend Axe Snake Peel bodywash to others and get that myself before I&#x27;d buy this one again.</li>
            <li> It smells better on your skin than in the bottle. I don&#x27;t know that I would buy it again. I prefer Pure Sport or Swagger.</li>
            <li> I get all the bitches with this smell. It will remove s*** stains, dirt, and sweat from your body. While leaving you smelling ultra fine.</li>
            <li> Before I start my story, I will say I love the scent of this and the deodorant, it&#x27;s amazing.&lt;br /&gt;But te body wash had an usual side effect on me... On full moons I find myself on the floor convulsing when using this, and my body tears to pieces and I change into a wolf; a lone majestic wolf high upon the mountain of Matterhorn.&lt;br /&gt;Besides that and getting rabies and losing my social life, 5 out of 5!</li>
            <li> Smells like a freshly opened package of Smarties candy. That would be OK if in was 8 years old. Not buying again.</li>
            <li> Wore this with [[ASIN:B002HJ377A The Mountain Three Wolf Moon Short Sleeve Tee]] and I couldn&#x27;t walk 10 feet without a woman stopping me to give me her number, asking me to give her a \\&quot;howl\\&quot; if I&#x27;m ever lonely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Naturally, I won&#x27;t call. How can I be lonely when I have my three wolfdogs already with me? What stellar wingmen.</li>
            <li> This fragrancy is not realy exactly same of deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;In this case, its my first aquisition of  this item.&lt;br /&gt;Smell is not so durable.&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy again.</li>
            <li> this is my fav wild collection scent.</li>
            <li> keeps me smelling good for 24 hours. i didnt even know a body wash could really do that. but this stuff can</li>
            <li> As far as I&#x27;m aware this scent hasn&#x27;t hit stores yet. However, I was chosen to receive the full wolfthorn set from old spice as a trial. All I have to say is this smells delicious. It&#x27;s a woody smell perfectly combined with a citrusy fruity smell. The deodorant I wanted to bite but that&#x27;s another review! I definitly recommend it, and I never review or recommend anything!</li>
            <li> I am super stoked about this new scent! It really reminds me of Clinique&#x27;s cologne \\&quot;Happy\\&quot;. It has a citrus smell to it for sure. Perhaps Grapefruit? If you are a fan of Happy, then I believe you will really enjoy Wolfthorn.</li>
            <li> Smells EXACTLY like someone puked in a car. HORRIBLE. I can&#x27;t believe how much this smells like stomach acid... I thought I was the only one, but seems like this is being said by more than just myself. I would NEVER buy or use this. Bearglove all the way.</li>
            <li> I hate the scent of this. it is so bad, it smells like bad peaches. i see all these reviews saying it smells good and all that but i personally hate it. this is more of an old guys body wash. You&#x27;ll be more of a lone wolf when you buy this item.</li>
            <li> Old Spice does this well. They make body washes that don&#x27;t over power w/too much scent and at the same time seem to cancel personal body odor. My son uses this product. I&#x27;ve recently noticed that at the end of a long/very active day, he had only a subtle smell of this product and there was no cover-up smell of any body order. This product seems to work as described. So pleased!</li>
            <li> Makes my girlfriend smell like a man, which was the intent.</li>
            <li> I am a Navy Seawolf and at last a Wolf can smell like a Wolf.  Love it and the commercial.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seeing all of these positive reviews saying it smells like candy or orange-y pink, as if that is a scent.&lt;br /&gt;I think this is by far the worst smelling product Old Spice has to offer. It smells like vomit, no joke. Old spice is suppose to have manly scents, but the only manly factor of this is it smells like a guy had too many shots, and we get to bathe in the aftermath.&lt;br /&gt;My girlfriend took a shower at my house yesterday and used this body wash without knowing, and almost puked. Totally thought I threw it away, but now its gone for good.&lt;br /&gt;Terrible.</li>
            <li> The product did what I needed it to do. Isn&#x27;t that the point? Chicks flip over it. What else can I say?&lt;br /&gt;BUY IT !!!</li>
            <li> There must be some genetic factor at play like with cilantro, because to me it actually smells like vomit.  I&#x27;m not using &#x27;vomit&#x27; as a negative descriptor, I&#x27;m saying it&#x27;s actually reminiscent of it for me and triggers the same gut wrenching reaction.  Another reviewer mentioned the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it seems like most people like it, I assume it&#x27;s a very personal thing.  Just be aware that for some segment of the population, it will smell like you puked on yourself.</li>
            <li> Really like the way this smells</li>
            <li> has a nice clean smell highly recommend</li>
            <li> I remember growing up with a horrible association to Old Spice products, the name itself was dated, it reminded me of old men in retirement homes and it had this overall trashy, dated scent to it. Then THIS product line (and the one shortly before it) came onto the shelves for men and my entire opinion changed. These scents are NEW, fresh and leave me feeling clean all day long. When it comes to \\&quot;male\\&quot; body wash, I often find we are given scents that smell like nothing at all or leave us smelling like too much of a spice rack. Old Spice&#x27;s \\&quot;Wild Collection\\&quot; is an answer to the modern classic male that will honestly make you look forward to your next shower (not that I didn&#x27;t bathe before) :-p. If you&#x27;re into masculine and modern scents, give this guy a try. I would compare it to calogne&#x27;s we buy at top pricing in stores, but in body wash form.</li>
            <li> Hey, I like Old Spice, so sue me. I think it&#x27;s a genetic marker thing from being from a middle-class, Irish American family. My father used Old Spice, his father used Old Spice, and as much as an adventurous guy I may be, I use Old Spice. Not all of the time, mind you, but there&#x27;s something comforting about keeping the tradition going. Took a walk on the wild side and tried the Wolfthorn Body Wash. It arrived on time, the cost was OK (and it got delivered to my door) and came to my surprise with a 9g (.35 oz) Wolfthorn Stick deodorant, good size for my travel kit. As for the body wash, it&#x27;s OK, and delivers lather, suds and a different scent to wake me up from the torpor of the morning and prepare for the existential drain of another work day. What can I say? It&#x27;s red, it&#x27;s white, it&#x27;s made in Canada and it&#x27;s Old Spice.</li>
            <li> This and the deodorant smells like gummy lifesavers. I find this to be a pleasant change from 99% of all the other man smalls out on the market - they all seem to smell the same to me. Do I like the fruit smell? Yeah - it&#x27;s a welcomed vs the just boring &#x27;guy cologne&#x27; smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not for everyone clearly - but hey - I prefer this smell and hope they keep it around for a long time.</li>
