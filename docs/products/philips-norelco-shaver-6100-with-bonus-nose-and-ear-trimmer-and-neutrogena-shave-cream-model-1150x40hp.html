            <li>,I RETURNED IT,I OWN MANY PHILIPS SHAVERS</li>
            <li>Nice being able to shave in shower.  </li>
            <li>Sensotouch is undoubtedly the best razor i have ever had a little noisey but great otherwise.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t sure which ones to buy.  </li>
            <li>The shave is okay and having the razor gives me a choice on how i want to shave that day.</li>
            <li>This one is even better.</li>
            <li>Gives a close, comfortable shave!</li>
            <li>and I wanted something more convenient.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s probably more info than is required here.</li>
            <li>I am  really love it.</li>
            <li>of cause  everyone will love the lovely phillip razor.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>For Sure</li>
            <li>I bring it to my friend。HE love it</li>
            <li>the item has sold out。i want it more</li>
            <li>I dropped my reliable Norelco of many years and needed a replacement.</li>
            <li>I find I get a much better shave.  </li>
            <li>Rotary shaver is much better than in-line ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Seller is ok.</li>
            <li>I want to say that every man should have a philips electric shavers, not because of its reputation, but because it is really very nice, I bought more than once, because it as gifts to my friends and family, in the New Year, this is a great gift for family, we all like it very much.</li>
            <li>Pretty good.</li>
            <li>Pretty good price at about $80.00.  </li>
            <li>Great for the new reduced price.</li>
            <li>It shaves very clean and charged very quickly.</li>
            <li>very good, especially the battery</li>
            <li>It is a very good present.</li>
            <li>I think the price that i paid for the shaver it should have had something better, cheap on norelco&#x27;s part.</li>
            <li>The 1150x is definitely more convenient, and comfortable too.</li>
            <li>It works good, and the price is very superise.</li>
            <li>The nose and ear trimmer is amazing and comes with a length piece for grooming bushy eyebrows, and it is good for carving out facial hair.</li>
            <li>made it easy to shave around the nose</li>
            <li>Easy keep up.</li>
            <li>I helped others to buy this razor, and they liked it very much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure thats what they want us to do because they make more money.  </li>
            <li>cleaner work fine  </li>
            <li>Works fine but not meet my skin requirements</li>
            <li>Both did a fine job</li>
            <li>Nose trimmer may be less needed but the shaver is awesome!</li>
            <li>is really good!!Wish your child healthy!</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s a huge time saver for him</li>
            <li>I bought this one, it lite weight, giver a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>The added bonus items were great too, seeing as when I bought this package it was the same price on here as the razor without the extras.</li>
            <li>Smooth Close Shave.</li>
            <li>This shaver is very ergonomically correct and that is nice.</li>
            <li>but it is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I used the free Neutrogena jell that came in the package</li>
            <li>The head is easy to remove to clean.  </li>
            <li>It is smooth and does it&#x27;s job well.</li>
            <li>relatively gentle shave，For Asians, it might be more appropriate to point Panasonic</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>You get a good dry shave, but I got a better shave in the shower using the electric shave gel that came with it.  </li>
            <li>, my husband loved it, thanks very much.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>All easy to clean and lasts a long time, and is over all a good deal.</li>
            <li>For special occasions it seems the lotion gives a closer shave.</li>
            <li>It is great that it allows you to do a wet shave.</li>
            <li>This 1150x is a great unit for wet use.  </li>
            <li>sure you really want it before you buy one</li>
            <li>To to frankly, The nose trimmer is good for me, 1150X and the charger is larger for frequency travel man.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this shaver will give me more than a decade of service as my old Norelco, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>Probably not a bad product, but just not for me.</li>
            <li>Not bad razor.  </li>
            <li>, the bathroom is nice and steamy, his pores are open and he can just quickly shave and be done!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to try the new hair trimmer since I&#x27;m more furry now than I used to be.</li>
            <li>I like how much quicker shaving with a good old razor is.  </li>
            <li>Works great just like my old one, and the new folding charger is way better for traveling than the old one.</li>
            <li>and that this is my very first electric.  </li>
            <li>Useful, razor shave very clean，its a surprise gift , my husband loved it, thanks very much.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>Previous Norelco shavers were great.  </li>
            <li>Buying this shaver with the bonus nose and ear trimmer &amp; shaver cream was a very good choice and a bargain to say the least.</li>
            <li>Works great, stays charged for a few shaves makes my mornings easyier.</li>
            <li>The shaver is fantastic, battery lasts the whole month.</li>
            <li>i enjoy using the razor but so far it does not give me a better shave then the straight razor.</li>
            <li>Did a full charge when I first got it (arrived 1/29/14) and haven&#x27;t needed to charge it again yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m pretty happy with the daily shave I get from this model.</li>
            <li>and they were right.</li>
            <li>And I can tell you that it does such a nice job providing a very close shave!</li>
            <li>I must say it is more comfortable than dry shaving.  </li>
            <li>you very much.</li>
            <li>The razor has clearly gone through some hardware revisions, because even though it is the exact same model as I had before this one has many improvements on the quality side-even though the old one was already pretty nice.</li>
            <li>My son-in-law was the first one to tell me about it</li>
            <li>He absolutely loves it!  </li>
            <li>It has sat on the sink for 3 months now, pretty &amp; pretty</li>
            <li>He loves it, good for a heavy beard.</li>
            <li>But this new razor is better than the old one.</li>
            <li>I have used I for a few weeks and am very pleased with the razor.</li>
            <li>The shaver cost is still high, but I still buy when the price is very favorable, it is worth it.</li>
            <li>I prefer to just dry shave as it&#x27;s more</li>
            <li>This one does irritate my skin more, it does not work well when using it dry.</li>
            <li>It certainly shaves my beard.</li>
            <li>and I wouldn&#x27;t take the risk with one of their products for $90 again, knowing I can&#x27;t really get my money</li>
            <li>After 4 days I just have to use the trimmer head to shorten everything up to a reasonable length</li>
            <li>thanks very much.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>very good&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Shipping fast.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re ready for your morning shave.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend very like it</li>
            <li>It is also much, much quieter.  </li>
            <li>The real bonus was the ear and nose trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Clipping my ear hair has always been a struggle, but the trimmer does the job very well.  </li>
            <li>It is much cheaper than it in china.</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast and product well packaged.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It does not do a good job shaving off a thick longer beard</li>
            <li>I previously had one of the cheep $30 razors like this and thought this would be much better with a much higher price</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m never disappointed as the improvements in technology from longer lasting batteries to smoother and precision shaving heads.</li>
            <li>After two weeks of using it with alligator clips and a power supply hooked straight up to the motor, I decided it was time for a new one.</li>
            <li>but it does a nice job as long as you don&#x27;t let your beard grow out long.</li>
            <li>Didnt think it work as well as my older norelco.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using an older model Norelco but time to replace it.</li>
            <li>Let me start by saying I use a electric razor for quick cleanup, i prefer a standard razor.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product and seller.</li>
            <li>4 days without shaving is about as long as I can go if I don&#x27;t want to go over the same spot too many times.</li>
            <li>So I bought a new razor.</li>
            <li>Sometimes new stuff does not work.</li>
            <li>All new razors shave close.</li>
            <li>Now I have the choice of buying new blades or buying a new razor.</li>
            <li>I will not buy new blades every two to three months</li>
            <li>so I will buy a new razor.</li>
            <li>I now also use a straight electric razor from Braun and it was about the same price but cuts much closer.</li>
            <li>It took some getting used to because my husband was accustomed to the old style which is stronger but much more harsh on the skin.</li>
            <li>While this shaver is good for wet or dry shaving, the all plastic construction makes it flimsy and fragile.</li>
            <li>When I first used it I did have some irritation on my neck, but that was the only time that had happened to me.</li>
            <li>The Braun is my first non-rotary shaver and will never go back to rotry style.</li>
            <li>Shaves so much better than my last electric razor, and with a LOT less irritation.  </li>
            <li>Definitely regret buy this razor and really question all this 5 star review this has received</li>
            <li>WOW</li>
            <li>My old shaver was 15 years old.</li>
            <li>You have to have the return post marked in 45 days (</li>
            <li>I would hhighly recommend this product to any man for complete groomin</li>
            <li>My  old razor was easier to use than this model</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used the shaving cream once, it didn&#x27;t really seem to make anything better or worse really.</li>
            <li>Wet shaving works but barely, requires more cleaning of unit than dry shaving.</li>
            <li>I could personally shave faster with a basic razor but will still use this over the old fashioned way becuase its way easier to clean and blades last a long time.</li>
            <li>They handled it as well as I could&#x27;ve hoped, paying for my return shipping and sending me a brand spanking new face scraper in short order.</li>
            <li>christmas, my wife replaced my last Norelco with this new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was put off by some reviewers comments calling the new Norelco shavers Chinese junk but thought I would give Norelco a chance.  </li>
            <li>The razor worked fine for about 2 months, then the blades became dull and the close shave was gone.</li>
            <li>Fast charging and holds charge for a very long time!</li>
            <li>This one really works as expected...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Norelco&#x27;s my whole life but never tried a wet shaver before.  </li>
            <li>Completely waterproof, I shave in the shower and just open and rinse when done.  </li>
            <li>He is currently in the hospital, and he has no trouble shaving with this razor.</li>
            <li>I would not buy this Razor again, thinking of returning it and going back to my old Norelco or trying a Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have to say that I use it to keep my head shaved well enough to keep it, but, I will not buy another nor purchase new blades in the future.</li>
            <li>But it takes more time and is a little messy.</li>
            <li>As a life long conventional blade razor user, start to use this device was a real departure for me.</li>

            <li> I am very happy with the decision to buy this particular electric razor.  </li>
            <li> but this new one does an excellent job.</li>
            <li> I get a best ever shave with my new shaver.  </li>
            <li> ,I RETURNED IT,I OWN MANY PHILIPS SHAVERS</li>
            <li> Nice being able to shave in shower.  </li>
            <li> Sensotouch is undoubtedly the best razor i have ever had a little noisey but great otherwise.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t sure which ones to buy.  </li>
            <li> The shave is okay and having the razor gives me a choice on how i want to shave that day.</li>
            <li> This one is even better.</li>
            <li> Gives a close, comfortable shave!</li>
            <li> and I wanted something more convenient.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s probably more info than is required here.</li>
            <li> I am  really love it.</li>
            <li> of cause  everyone will love the lovely phillip razor.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> For Sure</li>
            <li> I bring it to my friend。HE love it</li>
            <li> the item has sold out。i want it more</li>
            <li> I dropped my reliable Norelco of many years and needed a replacement.</li>
            <li> I find I get a much better shave.  </li>
            <li> Rotary shaver is much better than in-line ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seller is ok.</li>
            <li> I want to say that every man should have a philips electric shavers, not because of its reputation, but because it is really very nice, I bought more than once, because it as gifts to my friends and family, in the New Year, this is a great gift for family, we all like it very much.</li>
            <li> Pretty good.</li>
            <li> Pretty good price at about $80.00.  </li>
            <li> Great for the new reduced price.</li>
            <li> It shaves very clean and charged very quickly.</li>
            <li> very good, especially the battery</li>
            <li> It is a very good present.</li>
            <li> I think the price that i paid for the shaver it should have had something better, cheap on norelco&#x27;s part.</li>
            <li> The 1150x is definitely more convenient, and comfortable too.</li>
            <li> It works good, and the price is very superise.</li>
            <li> The nose and ear trimmer is amazing and comes with a length piece for grooming bushy eyebrows, and it is good for carving out facial hair.</li>
            <li> made it easy to shave around the nose</li>
            <li> Easy keep up.</li>
            <li> I helped others to buy this razor, and they liked it very much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure thats what they want us to do because they make more money.  </li>
            <li> cleaner work fine  </li>
            <li> Works fine but not meet my skin requirements</li>
            <li> Both did a fine job</li>
            <li> Nose trimmer may be less needed but the shaver is awesome!</li>
            <li> is really good!!Wish your child healthy!</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a huge time saver for him</li>
            <li> I bought this one, it lite weight, giver a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> The added bonus items were great too, seeing as when I bought this package it was the same price on here as the razor without the extras.</li>
            <li> Smooth Close Shave.</li>
            <li> This shaver is very ergonomically correct and that is nice.</li>
            <li> but it is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I used the free Neutrogena jell that came in the package</li>
            <li> The head is easy to remove to clean.  </li>
            <li> It is smooth and does it&#x27;s job well.</li>
            <li> relatively gentle shave，For Asians, it might be more appropriate to point Panasonic</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> You get a good dry shave, but I got a better shave in the shower using the electric shave gel that came with it.  </li>
            <li> , my husband loved it, thanks very much.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> All easy to clean and lasts a long time, and is over all a good deal.</li>
            <li> For special occasions it seems the lotion gives a closer shave.</li>
            <li> It is great that it allows you to do a wet shave.</li>
            <li> This 1150x is a great unit for wet use.  </li>
            <li> sure you really want it before you buy one</li>
            <li> To to frankly, The nose trimmer is good for me, 1150X and the charger is larger for frequency travel man.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this shaver will give me more than a decade of service as my old Norelco, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> Probably not a bad product, but just not for me.</li>
            <li> Not bad razor.  </li>
            <li> , the bathroom is nice and steamy, his pores are open and he can just quickly shave and be done!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to try the new hair trimmer since I&#x27;m more furry now than I used to be.</li>
            <li> I like how much quicker shaving with a good old razor is.  </li>
            <li> Works great just like my old one, and the new folding charger is way better for traveling than the old one.</li>
            <li> and that this is my very first electric.  </li>
            <li> Useful, razor shave very clean，its a surprise gift , my husband loved it, thanks very much.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> Previous Norelco shavers were great.  </li>
            <li> Buying this shaver with the bonus nose and ear trimmer &amp; shaver cream was a very good choice and a bargain to say the least.</li>
            <li> Works great, stays charged for a few shaves makes my mornings easyier.</li>
            <li> The shaver is fantastic, battery lasts the whole month.</li>
            <li> i enjoy using the razor but so far it does not give me a better shave then the straight razor.</li>
            <li> Did a full charge when I first got it (arrived 1/29/14) and haven&#x27;t needed to charge it again yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m pretty happy with the daily shave I get from this model.</li>
            <li> and they were right.</li>
            <li> And I can tell you that it does such a nice job providing a very close shave!</li>
            <li> I must say it is more comfortable than dry shaving.  </li>
            <li> you very much.</li>
            <li> The razor has clearly gone through some hardware revisions, because even though it is the exact same model as I had before this one has many improvements on the quality side-even though the old one was already pretty nice.</li>
            <li> My son-in-law was the first one to tell me about it</li>
            <li> He absolutely loves it!  </li>
            <li> It has sat on the sink for 3 months now, pretty &amp; pretty</li>
            <li> He loves it, good for a heavy beard.</li>
            <li> But this new razor is better than the old one.</li>
            <li> I have used I for a few weeks and am very pleased with the razor.</li>
            <li> The shaver cost is still high, but I still buy when the price is very favorable, it is worth it.</li>
            <li> I prefer to just dry shave as it&#x27;s more</li>
            <li> This one does irritate my skin more, it does not work well when using it dry.</li>
            <li> It certainly shaves my beard.</li>
            <li> and I wouldn&#x27;t take the risk with one of their products for $90 again, knowing I can&#x27;t really get my money</li>
            <li> After 4 days I just have to use the trimmer head to shorten everything up to a reasonable length</li>
            <li> thanks very much.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> very good&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Shipping fast.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re ready for your morning shave.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend very like it</li>
            <li> It is also much, much quieter.  </li>
            <li> The real bonus was the ear and nose trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Clipping my ear hair has always been a struggle, but the trimmer does the job very well.  </li>
            <li> It is much cheaper than it in china.</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast and product well packaged.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It does not do a good job shaving off a thick longer beard</li>
            <li> I previously had one of the cheep $30 razors like this and thought this would be much better with a much higher price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m never disappointed as the improvements in technology from longer lasting batteries to smoother and precision shaving heads.</li>
            <li> After two weeks of using it with alligator clips and a power supply hooked straight up to the motor, I decided it was time for a new one.</li>
            <li> but it does a nice job as long as you don&#x27;t let your beard grow out long.</li>
            <li> Didnt think it work as well as my older norelco.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using an older model Norelco but time to replace it.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I use a electric razor for quick cleanup, i prefer a standard razor.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product and seller.</li>
            <li> 4 days without shaving is about as long as I can go if I don&#x27;t want to go over the same spot too many times.</li>
            <li> So I bought a new razor.</li>
            <li> Sometimes new stuff does not work.</li>
            <li> All new razors shave close.</li>
            <li> Now I have the choice of buying new blades or buying a new razor.</li>
            <li> I will not buy new blades every two to three months</li>
            <li> so I will buy a new razor.</li>
            <li> I now also use a straight electric razor from Braun and it was about the same price but cuts much closer.</li>
            <li> It took some getting used to because my husband was accustomed to the old style which is stronger but much more harsh on the skin.</li>
            <li> While this shaver is good for wet or dry shaving, the all plastic construction makes it flimsy and fragile.</li>
            <li> When I first used it I did have some irritation on my neck, but that was the only time that had happened to me.</li>
            <li> The Braun is my first non-rotary shaver and will never go back to rotry style.</li>
            <li> Shaves so much better than my last electric razor, and with a LOT less irritation.  </li>
            <li> Definitely regret buy this razor and really question all this 5 star review this has received</li>
            <li> WOW</li>
            <li> My old shaver was 15 years old.</li>
            <li> You have to have the return post marked in 45 days (</li>
            <li> I would hhighly recommend this product to any man for complete groomin</li>
            <li> My  old razor was easier to use than this model</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the shaving cream once, it didn&#x27;t really seem to make anything better or worse really.</li>
            <li> Wet shaving works but barely, requires more cleaning of unit than dry shaving.</li>
            <li> I could personally shave faster with a basic razor but will still use this over the old fashioned way becuase its way easier to clean and blades last a long time.</li>
            <li> They handled it as well as I could&#x27;ve hoped, paying for my return shipping and sending me a brand spanking new face scraper in short order.</li>
            <li> christmas, my wife replaced my last Norelco with this new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was put off by some reviewers comments calling the new Norelco shavers Chinese junk but thought I would give Norelco a chance.  </li>
            <li> The razor worked fine for about 2 months, then the blades became dull and the close shave was gone.</li>
            <li> Fast charging and holds charge for a very long time!</li>
            <li> This one really works as expected...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco&#x27;s my whole life but never tried a wet shaver before.  </li>
            <li> Completely waterproof, I shave in the shower and just open and rinse when done.  </li>
            <li> He is currently in the hospital, and he has no trouble shaving with this razor.</li>
            <li> I would not buy this Razor again, thinking of returning it and going back to my old Norelco or trying a Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have to say that I use it to keep my head shaved well enough to keep it, but, I will not buy another nor purchase new blades in the future.</li>
            <li> But it takes more time and is a little messy.</li>
            <li> As a life long conventional blade razor user, start to use this device was a real departure for me.</li>
            <li> My other razor is 3 yrs old and third of the price of this one.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with a 2 year warranty and an easy way to get replacement head at a low price.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine why it takes this long to email a form, or why it isn&#x27;t just on their website.  </li>
            <li> My wet shave also lasts the entire day.  </li>
            <li> It does the same thing as the newer version with minimal difference.</li>
            <li> Something to look into later down the road is buying the RQ12 Sensotouch 3D head and installing it on this as I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s compatible with this model.</li>
            <li> Idk why the previous person only give it 1</li>
            <li> I have also started to shave wet in the shower rather than a dry shave.  </li>
            <li> Learned early on to not press so hard and let  the blades do the work. .  </li>
            <li> Never found any real benefit to the really expensive shavers, they all feel the same to me.</li>
            <li> Performed as expected until it died.</li>
            <li> If your an electric shaver user I recommend trying the wet shave no matter the brand.  </li>
            <li> Wet your face, add some shave cream</li>
            <li> diffinately not what i expected.</li>
            <li> When looking for a new razor it is probably not a good choice to buy this one.</li>
            <li> This design is worse than older versions.</li>
            <li> The old one would have served my purposes with new cutting heads</li>
            <li> have very little facial hair due to my Indian heritage, I should be the easiest of customers to satisfy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extremely</li>
            <li> My husband does not like the fact that you have to change parties to use the razor in other parts of the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It makes a mess when using it wet</li>
            <li> I purchased this same model over 4 years ago when it was first released, and after plenty of use the charging circuit went bad.</li>
            <li> Much too expensive for something so plastic and prone to break.</li>
            <li> Feel the power is not very strong, but</li>
            <li> The gel is soothing and I feel I get a bit closer shave with less friction.  </li>
            <li> THIS IS THE PITS,IT DOES NOT CLEAN WELL EITHER SINCE IT DOES NOT HAVE A USED HAIR SPACE.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my other Norelco razor needed new cutting heads</li>
            <li> Only one point, gifts shaving cream packaging is broken, and some.</li>
            <li> Was pretty disappointed with this razor.</li>
            <li> have owned 2 electric razors in the past, both Norelco.</li>
            <li> I could/have spent 15 minutes using it on my face with poor results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sorry, my native language is not English.</li>
            <li> it was smaller less border around cutting blades</li>
            <li> This is a poor shaver I have to use a wet razor to get the little hairs off my neck which defeats the purpose not happy with Phillps razor at all</li>
            <li> Have to push so hard to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> It was so bad, I gave it to my wife to use, I&#x27;ll stick with my old one and Std</li>
            <li> in the mean time you get razor burn</li>
            <li> The razor is not a good choice, does not give a close</li>
            <li> I have a very tough thick beard and usually have problems getting a close shave without irritation.  </li>
            <li> Delivery was VERY slow.  </li>
            <li> No travel pouch, which was a little disappointing.</li>
            <li> Not really happy with the quality of the shave.</li>
            <li> but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Been using it for a month now and not impressed at all.</li>
            <li> I think that the head itself is too shallow and tends to be too hard on the blades and grinds horribly.</li>
            <li> Handle is a bit awkward but not a deal breaker.</li>
            <li> When it arrived, I was disappointed to learn that it did not come with a travel case.</li>
            <li> SO DISAPPOINTED because it took me two years to buy this</li>
            <li> I hate this</li>
            <li> The charging base is also a problem to keep connected to the electric cord.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed</li>
            <li> TERRIBLE SHAVE</li>
            <li> disappointed in this purchase!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Was pretty disappointed with this razor. I previously had one of the cheep $30 razors like this and thought this would be much better with a much higher price but I was wrong. My other razor is 3 yrs old and third of the price of this one. I now also use a straight electric razor from Braun and it was about the same price but cuts much closer. Definitely regret buy this razor and really question all this 5 star review this has received</li>
            <li> very good, especially the battery</li>
            <li> The nose and ear trimmer is amazing and comes with a length piece for grooming bushy eyebrows, and it is good for carving out facial hair. The Norelco itself though shaves really short and can cause irritation if not shaved often with. It does take longer to shave with because it doesnt always get everything. I could personally shave faster with a basic razor but will still use this over the old fashioned way becuase its way easier to clean and blades last a long time. All easy to clean and lasts a long time, and is over all a good deal. The product has my recommendation.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor for both my husband and one of my sons. This razor has gotten rave reviews from both of them. And I can tell you that it does such a nice job providing a very close shave! I would recommend this Norelco without reservation! My son-in-law was the first one to tell me about it and I decided to purchase 2!</li>
            <li> very nice razor, all attachments are good too. I am at second week of daily shaving on same battery charge. WOW</li>
            <li> My old shaver was 15 years old. I bought this one, it lite weight, giver a smooth shave. I love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect. Idk why the previous person only give it 1 star.&lt;br /&gt;It works good, and the price is unbeatable</li>
            <li> To husband gift, he was very loving, very good, and the price is reasonable, satisfaction. Only one point, gifts shaving cream packaging is broken, and some.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my other Norelco razor needed new cutting heads and I wasn&#x27;t sure which ones to buy.  So I bought a new razor. I&#x27;m pretty sure thats what they want us to do because they make more money.  But this new razor is better than the old one. The old one would have served my purposes with new cutting heads but this new one does an excellent job.</li>
            <li> i enjoy using the razor but so far it does not give me a better shave then the straight razor. The shave is okay and having the razor gives me a choice on how i want to shave that day. The only thing i do not like is that is no warning or pre warning to let you know the battery is getting low. I think the price that i paid for the shaver it should have had something better, cheap on norelco&#x27;s part.</li>
            <li> My husband is thrilled with it. He&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy. He has used Norelco products for years and he says this is the best one.</li>
            <li> My husbank like it, I think it worth the price, and it indeed very good, the gift with the product also very good.</li>
            <li> Previous Norelco shavers were great.  This one is even better.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor. Gives a close, comfortable shave!</li>
            <li> Figured that I&#x27;d give an electric razor a try.  Why not with the 45 day money back guarantee.  Tried it for a couple of weeks, but wasn&#x27;t quite me.  I like how much quicker shaving with a good old razor is.  Probably not a bad product, but just not for me. So I tried to return the product with the 45 day money back guarantee.  All that was is a deception ad.  You have to have the return post marked in 45 days (your supposed to use it for 30).... and to return it you have to get a form from Philips.  3 requests and 15 days later, I&#x27;m still being told &amp;#34;you&#x27;ll receive it in 3-5 business days, its being processed&amp;#34;.  I can&#x27;t imagine why it takes this long to email a form, or why it isn&#x27;t just on their website.  Very disappointed and I wouldn&#x27;t take the risk with one of their products for $90 again, knowing I can&#x27;t really get my money back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you really want it before you buy one</li>
            <li> Works perfectly even after using for 7 months. Battery works great and comes for more than 7 use.</li>
            <li> It certainly shaves my beard.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my son-in-law who was absolutely thrilled when it arrived.  He was happy  with the quality and versatility.</li>
            <li> Excellent for close shaves .  Ear and nose cleaner work fine  I would hhighly recommend this product to any man for complete groomin</li>
            <li> You get a good dry shave, but I got a better shave in the shower using the electric shave gel that came with it.  No travel pouch, which was a little disappointing.</li>
            <li> very good ，its a surprise , my husband loved it, thanks very much.&lt;br /&gt;A satisfactory shopping. Very good !I like it !</li>
            <li> TERRIBLE SHAVE,I RETURNED IT,I OWN MANY PHILIPS SHAVERS THIS IS THE PITS,IT DOES NOT CLEAN WELL EITHER SINCE IT DOES NOT HAVE A USED HAIR SPACE.</li>
            <li> I used to be a shaving cream and razor guy, but that was always a bit time consuming and I wanted something more convenient. The 1150x is definitely more convenient, and comfortable too. When I first used it I did have some irritation on my neck, but that was the only time that had happened to me. Gives a close shave too. It even handles longer hairs rather well, but there is a limit of course. 4 days without shaving is about as long as I can go if I don&#x27;t want to go over the same spot too many times. After 4 days I just have to use the trimmer head to shorten everything up to a reasonable length and then it works great. The battery life is great too! Did a full charge when I first got it (arrived 1/29/14) and haven&#x27;t needed to charge it again yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The included nose hair trimmer works well, no complaints about that at all. I&#x27;ve only used the shaving cream once, it didn&#x27;t really seem to make anything better or worse really. I prefer to just dry shave as it&#x27;s more convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m very satisfied with this shaver and would recommend it. Something to look into later down the road is buying the RQ12 Sensotouch 3D head and installing it on this as I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s compatible with this model.</li>
            <li> I buy three this kind of shavers for my friend, the type is apointed by him. He said it is very good.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my legs. I realize it is a &#x27;mans&#x27; razor, but it works great for me and no razor burn after.</li>
            <li> To to frankly, The nose trimmer is good for me, 1150X and the charger is larger for frequency travel man.</li>
            <li> A four-star review for a company that sent me a &#x27;lectric razor that did not work? Why, yes.  Sometimes new stuff does not work. Such is life. They handled it as well as I could&#x27;ve hoped, paying for my return shipping and sending me a brand spanking new face scraper in short order. The razor itself? Pretty good. Bought one about six years ago that recently gave up the ghost which is why I had to order this one. Performed as expected until it died. I&#x27;m excited to try the new hair trimmer since I&#x27;m more furry now than I used to be. That&#x27;s probably more info than is required here.</li>
            <li> Works fine but not meet my skin requirements</li>
            <li> I hate this Norelco&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;blood everywhere lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it missed up my skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;0 rating posted if I could&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will try different brand</li>
            <li> It‘s  a great gift for man. I am  really love it. of cause  everyone will love the lovely phillip razor.</li>
            <li> Seriously...this thing rules! The nose hair trimmer however is garbage. I cut the &amp;#!^ out of my nose one day.</li>
            <li> Excellent electric razor, very easy to clean, gives a smooth shave an excellent deal. Fast charging and holds charge for a very long time!</li>
            <li> If you have plan for a camping or traveling, You must need it. it makes your plan happier. so i like it</li>
            <li> I purchased this same model over 4 years ago when it was first released, and after plenty of use the charging circuit went bad. After two weeks of using it with alligator clips and a power supply hooked straight up to the motor, I decided it was time for a new one. The razor has clearly gone through some hardware revisions, because even though it is the exact same model as I had before this one has many improvements on the quality side-even though the old one was already pretty nice. Works great just like my old one, and the new folding charger is way better for traveling than the old one. The added bonus items were great too, seeing as when I bought this package it was the same price on here as the razor without the extras.</li>
            <li> This razor is one of the best shave&#x27;s I&#x27;ve had by an electric razor.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with a 2 year warranty and an easy way to get replacement head at a low price.  Great buy!!!</li>
            <li> Not bad razor.  All new razors shave close. Nice being able to shave in shower.  Delivery was VERY slow.  Even with Prime took three weeks to get item.  Handle is a bit awkward but not a deal breaker.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect. It works good, and the price is very superise.I am very happy with the decision to buy this.</li>
            <li> This one really works as expected...</li>
            <li> The razor is not a good choice, does not give a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very little facial hair due to my Indian heritage, I should be the easiest of customers to satisfy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extremely disappointed in this purchase!!!</li>
            <li> In my almost eighty seven years i have had a Schick, two or three Braun and three Norelco of which i had replaced the heads numerous times. Norelco 1150X/40 Sensotouch is undoubtedly the best razor i have ever had a little noisey but great otherwise. Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco&#x27;s my whole life but never tried a wet shaver before.  I must say it is more comfortable than dry shaving.  The gel is soothing and I feel I get a bit closer shave with less friction.  Completely waterproof, I shave in the shower and just open and rinse when done.  Comes with a charging stand(not water proof), which must be used, no plugin on the shaver its self.  I just leave it in the shower until the charge runs low.  If your an electric shaver user I recommend trying the wet shave no matter the brand.  Pretty good price at about $80.00.  Never found any real benefit to the really expensive shavers, they all feel the same to me.</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco 1150X/40HP Sensotouch 2D Electric Razor with Bonus Nose, this is useful and good gift to men! you can buy it!</li>
            <li> I&#x60;ve received this Philips Norelco 1150X/40HP Sensotouch 2D Electric Razor,and it is a very good one !It&#x60;s made in USA!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband as a stocking stuffer.  He absolutely loves it!  The best part is that you can use it in the shower so it&#x27;s a huge time saver for him, the bathroom is nice and steamy, his pores are open and he can just quickly shave and be done!  Also comes with the nose clippers, which was a happy bonus for him!&lt;br /&gt;I think I am going to get this for my father&#x27;s birthday as well!</li>
            <li> very good ，its a surprise gift , my husband loved it, thanks very much.&lt;br /&gt;A satisfactory shopping. Very good !</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m pretty happy with the daily shave I get from this model. When it arrived, I was disappointed to learn that it did not come with a travel case.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my husband and he loves it. It does not do a good job shaving off a thick longer beard but it does a nice job as long as you don&#x27;t let your beard grow out long.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor for Xmas. He loves it, good for a heavy beard. He is currently in the hospital, and he has no trouble shaving with this razor.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the decision to buy this particular electric razor.  Cool design and does a very good job.</li>
            <li> Excelente la Philips Norelco 1150X/40HP SensoTouch 2D.</li>
            <li> Useful, razor shave very clean，its a surprise gift , my husband loved it, thanks very much.&lt;br /&gt;A satisfactory shopping. Very good !</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the expectation.6 can withstand the elements and parsavs very kindly advise you to shave ideal price and quality</li>
            <li> Not really happy with the quality of the shave. Have to push so hard to get a close shave. SO DISAPPOINTED because it took me two years to buy this and it wasn&#x27;t inexpensive...</li>
            <li> Smooth Close Shave. Takes About 3 Or 4 Uses For Your Face And Hair To Properly Adjust To The Use But Once It Does The Shave Is Immaculate. Top Notch Quality, Superior Razor For Sure</li>
            <li> I think that the head itself is too shallow and tends to be too hard on the blades and grinds horribly. I read some reviews that it would not give a close shave and they were right. This shaver is very ergonomically correct and that is nice. I have to say that I use it to keep my head shaved well enough to keep it, but, I will not buy another nor purchase new blades in the future. This shaver is a $90 machine that is of $30 quality.</li>
            <li> My  old razor was easier to use than this model it was smaller less border around cutting blades made it easy to shave around the nose</li>
            <li> As a life long conventional blade razor user, start to use this device was a real departure for me. Let&#x27;s just say I&#x27;m 60+ and that this is my very first electric.  I find that I use it for a shave &amp;#34;tune-up&amp;#34; in between blade shaves. The product itself seems to be well made and works as intended. The deal offered by Amazon made this too good to pass up.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband&lt;br /&gt;it is a big surprise,very good&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy&lt;br /&gt;thank you very much.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the acquisition. Shipping fast. The quality is excellent. I recommend the seller. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Not for me. Didnt think it work as well as my older norelco.</li>
            <li> it is wonderful 。I bring it to my friend。HE love it so much。but the item has sold out。i want it more</li>
            <li> I bought one philips shaver 18years ago and can be used now except changing battery two times. I believe philip norelco.</li>
            <li> This design is worse than older versions. I don&#x27;t want to carry around an additional charging stand with me. Should have built in plugin for charging with a slim adapter. Wet shaving works but barely, requires more cleaning of unit than dry shaving. For the 80 dollars they should have included a self-cleaning stand.</li>
            <li> what can I tell you ?&lt;br /&gt;I am happy and satisfied. shaver is so good and I have no words to explane</li>
            <li> Product as described....highly recommened!</li>
            <li> I have used I for a few weeks and am very pleased with the razor. It is great that it allows you to do a wet shave. Wet your face, add some shave cream and you&#x27;re ready for your morning shave.</li>
            <li> This is a poor shaver I have to use a wet razor to get the little hairs off my neck which defeats the purpose not happy with Phillps razor at all</li>
            <li> Been using it for a month now and not impressed at all. I&#x27;ve been using an older model Norelco but time to replace it. This one does irritate my skin more, it does not work well when using it dry. It makes a mess when using it wet but it is easy to clean. The Nose and hair trimmer works great. I would not buy this Razor again, thinking of returning it and going back to my old Norelco or trying a Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Purchased the Braun 380S and very happy with it. The Braun is my first non-rotary shaver and will never go back to rotry style. The Braun version is wet/dry and works great either way, easy on my skin as well. Buy Braun, works great!</li>
            <li> Feel the power is not very strong, but relatively gentle shave，For Asians, it might be more appropriate to point Panasonic</li>
            <li> My boyfriend very like it and it so practical. To buy when it is sales promotion , the price is very good.</li>
            <li> My son loves this Electric Razor.</li>
            <li> wonderful razor for the price gets very close and doesnt tug hairs too bag. delivered on time</li>
            <li> It took some getting used to because my husband was accustomed to the old style which is stronger but much more harsh on the skin.</li>
            <li> Works real good butthe head falls apart</li>
            <li> I want to say that every man should have a philips electric shavers, not because of its reputation, but because it is really very nice, I bought more than once, because it as gifts to my friends and family, in the New Year, this is a great gift for family, we all like it very much.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I use a electric razor for quick cleanup, i prefer a standard razor.&lt;br /&gt;I have owned 2 electric razors in the past, both Norelco. Both did a fine job but like I said, I used them sparringly.&lt;br /&gt;For christmas, my wife replaced my last Norelco with this new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad: It simply does not work. I could/have spent 15 minutes using it on my face with poor results.&lt;br /&gt;  It was so bad, I gave it to my wife to use, I&#x27;ll stick with my old one and Std razors.&lt;br /&gt;  She couldnt get it to work on her legs. It has sat on the sink for 3 months now, pretty &amp; pretty useless.&lt;br /&gt;Good. It looks cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thrown it in the trash, disapointed in the razor, and in Norelco.</li>
            <li> Help a friend bought, Shaver feeling good. I like Gillette.</li>
            <li> Husband loves the close shave. Quality made. Easy keep up.</li>
            <li> Shaves so much better than my last electric razor, and with a LOT less irritation.  It is also much, much quieter.  I like this razor a lot.</li>
            <li> Works great, stays charged for a few shaves makes my mornings easyier.</li>
            <li> I bought this product in China，Through USA friends mailed to the China。This razor is really good!!Wish your child healthy!</li>
            <li> I have used this razor for about  month. I had always used a blade but took a chance on this electric.  So far so good. Learned early on to not press so hard and let  the blades do the work. .  The Nutrogena shave gel is a must.</li>
            <li> Good shaver for the money</li>
            <li> I buy 3 razer....but give me ..only one razer .</li>
            <li> diffinately not what i expected. when you get the user info it tells you it takes up to three week for you face to get used to it. in the mean time you get razor burn</li>
            <li> It is a very good present.I will buy it again and again.I would like to recommend this to my friend.</li>
            <li> One of the BEST from Philips Norelco    I&#x27;ve been shaving with Norelco shavers since 1969 and each time I buy a newer version I&#x27;m never disappointed as the improvements in technology from longer lasting batteries to smoother and precision shaving heads. Buying this shaver with the bonus nose and ear trimmer &amp; shaver cream was a very good choice and a bargain to say the least.</li>
            <li> I dropped my reliable Norelco of many years and needed a replacement. I was put off by some reviewers comments calling the new Norelco shavers Chinese junk but thought I would give Norelco a chance.  It worked.  I get a best ever shave with my new shaver.  I have also started to shave wet in the shower rather than a dry shave.  I find I get a much better shave.  I used the free Neutrogena jell that came in the package and it is very good, but DOVE soap works just as well.  My wet shave also lasts the entire day.  The real bonus was the ear and nose trimmer.  Clipping my ear hair has always been a struggle, but the trimmer does the job very well.  I like it!  I don&#x27;t know if this shaver will give me more than a decade of service as my old Norelco, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> just what i wanted  works great</li>
            <li> AAA product.  Nose trimmer may be less needed but the shaver is awesome!</li>
            <li> Returned for cord issues.</li>
            <li> While this shaver is good for wet or dry shaving, the all plastic construction makes it flimsy and fragile. While rinsing the interior of the shave head, it inadvertently fell 4&amp;#34; (below the faucet) or so into the sink and broke. Bought in February of 2014 it only lasted until October. Much too expensive for something so plastic and prone to break.</li>
            <li> The shaver is fantastic, battery lasts the whole month. Very  happy. Rotary shaver is much better than in-line ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cheers,&lt;br /&gt;Srecko</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco 1150X/40HP Sensotouch 2D Electric Razor is so good  for face，I’m use it happiness，Practicality also played a part。It works good, and the price is unbeatable。</li>
            <li> Seller is ok. But this shaver  misses a lot of hair. Gotta shave the area several times.. Waxing would be easier</li>
            <li> I would not do this again or recommend the product to anyone simply because you can&#x27;t depend on it holding a charge.</li>
            <li> Great for the new reduced price. It does the same thing as the newer version with minimal difference. I suggest buying this one if you want to save some money.</li>
            <li> My husband does not like the fact that you have to change parties to use the razor in other parts of the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the expectation.6 can withstand the elements and parsavs very kindly advise you to shave ideal price and quality</li>
            <li> Sorry, my native language is not English.It is much cheaper than it in china.It shaves very clean and charged very quickly.I think it is a good shaver.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver that performs perfect and really holds its charge. Delivery was fast and product well packaged. Good price and service. Highly recommend this product and seller.</li>
            <li> It is very good. I helped others to buy this razor, and they liked it very much. Recommend it, good choice.</li>
            <li> The shaver cost is still high, but I still buy when the price is very favorable, it is worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used electric razors for years.  This 1150x is a great unit for wet use.  I just keep mine in the shower and I&#x27;ve never had any problems with it.  The head is easy to remove to clean.  I put mine on the charger about once per week.  The bonus nose trimmer tool is also perfect for maintenance.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have a very tough thick beard and usually have problems getting a close shave without irritation.  The Norelco Shaver is very easy to use, gives a great close shave and the Neutrogena Men&#x27;s Shave Creme helped to prevent irritation.  At this time, I have not yet used the Bonus Nose and Ear trimmer.  Thank you, Greg V</li>
            <li> The razor worked fine for about 2 months, then the blades became dull and the close shave was gone. Now I have the choice of buying new blades or buying a new razor. I will not buy new blades every two to three months so I will buy a new razor. The charging base is also a problem to keep connected to the electric cord. When looking for a new razor it is probably not a good choice to buy this one.</li>
            <li> I tried the shaving lotion per the directions and it seemed to give a closer shave.  Electric shavers are not the best of shaves but it makes it easier to get going. For special occasions it seems the lotion gives a closer shave. But it takes more time and is a little messy. The nose tool is the best I have ever used-tried many.</li>
            <li> nose not have trimmer built in.</li>
            <li> Very good razor, works for me.</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;m not a fan of electric razors this one is really nice.  It is smooth and does it&#x27;s job well.</li>
            <li> Best electric razor I have ever used</li>
