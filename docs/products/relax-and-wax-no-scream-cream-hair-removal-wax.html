    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Seems like it works best if you let it sit before putting on clothes.</li>
            <li>Happy waxing!</li>
            <li>This is the best stuff around!</li>
            <li>A brazillian is NEVER a joyful experience, but with this product, it took the edge off at best.</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>yes, I am a believer in this wonderful cream</li>
            <li>Works great!!</li>
            <li>Which is great.</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>Not so happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Great product for the pain of waxing that area.  </li>
            <li>It is really a great price too.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;ll make waxing painless, but it greatly reduces the pain/sting.</li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>she was able to do the job perfectly anyway.</li>
            <li>I think what some people dont realize is this cream is not going to make a brazilian a pleasant experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the $!!!!</li>
            <li>Good luck</li>
            <li>Good for beginner wax</li>
            <li>and I applied a LOT of No Scream Cream about a good 45 min - 1 hour before hand.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product 4 times now so that I could give a fair review.</li>
            <li>I ordered it because it had good reviews.</li>
            <li>My experience from using this was good.</li>
            <li>the positive comments are LIERS!!!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was so happy that I was able to tolerate the waxing.  </li>
            <li>it worked well, it is better than nothing!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s how satisfied I am!  </li>
            <li>There are a couple of tricks though, to be successful and get the most out of it.</li>
            <li>It was easy to apply &amp; it worked great.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled that it made my brazilian wax experience \\&quot;fine\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It kind of takes the edge off but it does not prevent you from feeling the hair being ripped out from its roots.</li>
            <li>I have to say, this kind of works.</li>
            <li>I kind of have to use a lot of it</li>
            <li>I can honestly say I will never use this product again</li>
            <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t notice any numbing either.</li>
            <li>The cream does not absorb on its own, it just sits there.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll be honest with you - I am not the type of person who can handle pain.  </li>
            <li>I cannot wax without some kind of pain relief.  </li>
            <li>but I have since purchased lidocaine, and that cream is much more effective than no scream cream.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Personally, I find the pain technology wipes that come with some Sally Hansen waxing products to be more effective.</li>
            <li>I have tryed many products but this is the best numming cream by far, iv been using it for years</li>
            <li>Using this product, it is more like 6.</li>
            <li>followed the directions, applied it an hour before my appointment, used it liberally (most of the tube), took an over the counter pain reliever, wore a jean skirt (no panties) and took a towel to sit on between my bottom and skirt during the car ride.  </li>
            <li>that worked better.</li>
            <li>i guess :)</li>
            <li>And unless the salon you go to (or you do your own bikini wax) has a comfortable waiting room for you to roam around nude?</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>(It wound up being more of a quasi-bikini wax because I couldn&#x27;t take the pain)  </li>
            <li>and she had many complaints about it</li>
            <li>sure you follow the directions  and apply 45 minutes before your appointment and let it absorb into your skip</li>
            <li>:) Give it a shot if you don&#x27;t believe me...</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s better than nothing.</li>
            <li>I love the cream tho, it did as it&#x27;s supposed to do</li>
            <li>That being said, I noticed NO difference, whatsoever, and made sure to use as-directed.  </li>
            <li>Thank You &#x27; No Scream Cream&#x27; for making my waxing that more bearable.</li>
            <li>Numbed it ok but still felt quite a bit of pain with hair removal.</li>
            <li>Maybe better for waxing...</li>
            <li>I wish that this product had better directions</li>
            <li>You get done, everything looks fantastic, then you walk out the door and BAM!  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;re tearing hair out by the roots from the layers of epidermis BELOW the top layer, which is where you would be applying this cream to.  </li>
            <li>This time I rubbed the cream in a bit more.</li>
            <li>but I find that my skin tolerates the long-term effects of waxing much better than the effects of shaving, so</li>
            <li>SO GLAD</li>
            <li>Oh thank goodness for this!!&lt;br /&gt;After reading as many articles as I could manage, this is what I now do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>make sure I have eaten, because everything hurt more when you are hungry.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was pain free!</li>
            <li>Great product highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>I was able to do my legs, underarms, and stomach with NO cream.</li>
            <li>Unless you think in your mind that this would make u feel better</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m sure it would do NOTHING for a brazilian as well.</li>
            <li>Numbfast (also sold on Amazon) worked WAY better for me.  </li>
            <li>I am able to wax myself with Numbfast without bunching a washcloth between my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I used it on my legs and let it sit for more than 45 minutes before my wax appointment.</li>
            <li>but the second time was wonderful because I didnt feel any pain in wax session .</li>
            <li>Look for an experienced waxer who is highly recommended instead of relying on creams to relieve pain.</li>
            <li>But once it does its pretty good.</li>
            <li>if I just have a pretty good pain tolerance for that or if this helped, but come on&#x27; you&#x27;re getting waxed, it&#x27;s going to hurt regardless.</li>
            <li>Take 3 shots of tequila before you head in for the dreaded event, and you&#x27;ll get over it just fine:)</li>
            <li>So even though my experience was not painless, I&#x27;m satisfied with my smooth skin.</li>
            <li>Make sure to bring wipes to thoroughly clean the cream off before waxing...</li>
            <li>Be strong.</li>
            <li>Great item, barely any pain.</li>
            <li>The brazillian hurts for about 2 seconds, and then you are fine.</li>
            <li>i would suggest using ice and takin some kinnda pain medication beforehand if u wanna feel a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Well, let me tell you, I am a HUGE ninny when it comes to pain.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m writing this review about 1 hour after waxing, and the side that was untreated is still sore, while the side that was treated is pain free.</li>
            <li>Use a lot of cream and rub it in about 45 min before your wax, take two Advil and enjoy a wax a virtual pain free wax.</li>
            <li>The third time I got brave and decided to go without anything.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a complete BAMF, you should be good to roll.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s no excuse to say anyone who liked it is a liar, erm, \\&quot;LIER.\\&quot;    It works fine!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve waxed many times and i&#x27;m pretty used to the pain by now, except for my legs.</li>
            <li>n find other ways to ease the pain like a pain pill or a beer or something.. good luck!</li>
            <li>A bigger tube for the price would be nice!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT , the first time I aplied this cream didnt work as I was expecting</li>
            <li>I must say, If you follow the instructions (and also take two paracetamols an hour before your wax)... it will reduce the pain significantly.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps I have extra sensitive skin but OUCH!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>To be fair, you&#x27;re asking for a little pain with waxing, regardless of how effective a cream is.  </li>
            <li>The product was just as I have come to expect - new and effective.</li>
            <li>I truly feel like it helped with the pain just enough for me to be able to do my own bikini wax.</li>
            <li>and I can honestly say the second time was significantly better because I used this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nothing will completely take the wax sting out of it, but this sure does make it more tolerable.  </li>
            <li>cuz I&#x27;m positive it would make it a more bearable experience.</li>
            <li>But again if you NEED some kind of numbing for sensitive areas before waxing this may be the way to go!</li>
            <li>As long as you follow instructions, it will make that process much more enjoyable!</li>
            <li>I did feel some pulling, but it most certainly was nothing in comparison to not using it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;To be fair it might kill the pain of waxing some, but I&#x27;m not convinced by what I saw with epilation, or it is possible</li>
            <li>Obviously, I didn&#x27;t expect it to be painless, but this cream took about 50% of the pain away and made it surprisingly tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>so I could tolerate the FULL MONTY.  </li>
            <li>Spread on a nice coat before waxing and you wont feel nearly anything.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s definitely not bad at all)</li>
            <li>but it was pretty easy to figure out.</li>
            <li>I ordered this for my very first full Brazilian and my</li>
            <li>The first time, all I can say is OUCH!  </li>
            <li>I had my first bikini wax (Brazillian at that) and didn&#x27;t feel a THING!</li>
            <li>Whatever isn&#x27;t absorbed you can wipe off just before the wax, if you&#x27;re so embarrassed that the lady SEEING</li>
            <li>YOUR CROTCH is going to make fun of you for using a numbing cream.     </li>
            <li>I was going to give it another shot but decided it wasn&#x27;t even worth it.</li>
            <li>Product did not numb the skin at all.  </li>
            <li>this product doesnt make the waxing completely painless but it is better than having nothing at all.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the price was worth the amount in the bottle for me.</li>
            <li>but it is absolutely worth it.</li>
            <li>Worked well- not completely numb, but took edge off.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>But.. I may as well have applied hand cream because it did not numb any of the area.</li>
            <li>what it&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li>Anything is worth a try when it comes to the pain of Brazilian waxing.</li>
            <li>It was worth the cost.</li>
            <li>I explained to her that it was supposed to have been absorbed by then and apologized.</li>
            <li>i really love this product ,it really works as what named ,relax and wax with no scream ,i highly recommend it</li>
            <li>thats what it pretty much is!!  </li>
            <li>A great tip is to put the cream on and then place a small strip of saran wrap over your pelvis.</li>
            <li>I had been hesitant to rub it in a lot the first time since it states that there should be a layer of cream on the skin, and it&#x27;s not meant to be absorbed like moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Also, it has virtually no fragrance which is great, al the other products we tried had very strong fragrances which associates with pain and makes the products less desirable to use.</li>
            <li>I used a very generous layer, let it absorb for one hour, took three Aleve liquid-gels, smoked half a blunt &amp; waxed successfully for the first time.</li>
            <li>i also use Emjoi After Epilation Cream ([...]), which seems to work pretty well.</li>
            <li>I first waxed the under arm that was treated with the cream, then the one that was not treated.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Amazon!</li>
            <li>Most definitely using &amp; purchasing this again.</li>
            <li>most definitely takes the edge off.</li>
            <li>I applied this product 1 hour prior to my waxing and it felt like it hurt more than without it.</li>
            <li>Followed directions exactly.  </li>
            <li>Starts to wear off after 1.5 hrs and starts taking effect about 30 minutes after first application.</li>
            <li>It can provide you peace of mind if your a first time waxer, but that&#x27;s about all.</li>
            <li>I used the cream for my first Brazilian wax.</li>
            <li>This stuff really does work!</li>
            <li>u gotta wait for like 20 minutes after u apply it to be able to feel a difference...but its not a big difference.</li>
            <li>First time getting a wax I used this</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;d be able to finally use my epilator.</li>
            <li>I also took an Xanex for my nerves but over all the &#x27;No Scream Cream&#x27; did exactly what it was suppose to do, help relieve the pain on the site of where the waxing was suppose to take place.  </li>
            <li>, I wanted to try it out first and see how this product worked.  </li>
            <li>This was my first time getting a wax done</li>
            <li>After my first Brazilian, I was intrigued to test out this product</li>
            <li>The first time I tried it I followed the instructions on the tube but didn&#x27;t feel any difference in the amount of pain.</li>
            <li>But on my second attempt I decided to rub it in somewhat more, but not so much that it was completely absorbed.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time</li>
            <li>This really does work!</li>
            <li>I went yesterday to get my first Brazilian Wax</li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t mind laying there longer than normal because it was not a painful experience at all.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t nearly as effective as other OTC numbing ointments.  </li>
            <li>but I was far more sensitive to the heat from the wax on that side as well.  </li>
            <li>Brazilian waxes pretty much suck</li>
            <li>and I could really tell the difference (my first time I used something from Sally&#x27;s that really didn&#x27;t do anything).</li>
            <li>the hairs are so strong that each hair will get yanked maybe 5 times before it will actually come out.</li>
            <li>but this did a great job of taking the edge off and making a painful experience more endurable.</li>
            <li>This product really made the experience manageable.  </li>
            <li>Did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li>There are generic versions available.</li>
            <li>This product really helps lessen the discomfort of bikini waxing.</li>
            <li>I decided I was going to see if it really worked</li>
            <li>but the no scream cream really took the edge off the pain, it really did decrease the sting.</li>
            <li>Then I used it for real on my leg, no difference at all.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work much.  </li>
            <li>I do highly recommend this product if your thinking of get a Brazilian or bikini wax!</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>I really wanted this product to work , really.</li>
            <li>Came really fast though</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really help me at all.</li>
            <li>Now, let&#x27;s be reasonable.  </li>
            <li>I would have given it five, but I felt that $20 for an ounce of this stuff was too much.  </li>
            <li>so when I had it on, I didn&#x27;t think much of it.</li>
            <li>It really, really hurt.</li>
            <li>Even if it works really well for you, you are still going to experience some pain.</li>
            <li>Worked as advertised - I didn&#x27;t feel nearly as much pain during my brazilian wax as everyone had said.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it really helped, but I can&#x27;t say it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I noticed the pain went away really fast too</li>
            <li>And you really have to wait 20-30 minutes before waxing to let it sink in</li>
            <li>I apply it thick two times and works good.  </li>
            <li>First, you must really slather it on nice and thick.</li>
            <li>I did, and was rudely surprised soon after the first strip was ripped off.</li>
            <li>The cream was decent.</li>
            <li>i used it to epilate and man it still hurt, also its a super tiny bottle!!!!  </li>
            <li>Finally I discovered this cream and my fourth wax was almost pain free!</li>
            <li>Also, it must be allowed to dry(dries quickly) and all of this must be done about 45 minutes prior to your service.</li>
            <li>The second and last time, I applied it over an hour before, thinking it just needed more time.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>So, I would highly recommended this product.</li>
            <li>If you can afford it, you may want to give it a shot, but I wouldn&#x27;t have high expectations.</li>
            <li>The cost was high for 1 oz of cream and did not work for me.</li>
            <li>I was surprised how well it worked since the side I used the cream on had more hair than the other side.</li>
            <li>However, my problem lies in the fact that I have deeper pores so there&#x27;s a tad more than just a little bitty hair follicle getting plucked out.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t counting on this product to take ALL the pain away but even just a little bit would have been okay.</li>
            <li>Ok, so i was super skeptical about the product, and i was right.</li>
            <li>Wow this stuff really works.</li>
            <li>However, the areas that are particularly sensitive did not receive much benefit.</li>
            <li>This is BENZOCAINE: pretty much the strongest topical analgesic you can buy w/out a prescription - it&#x27;s GOING TO WORK, @</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t rub the product all the way into my skin (allowed it to be absorbed, like instructed) even left it on for 5 min.</li>
            <li>I then wear loose fitting clothing to my appointment so not to disturb the area too much, though it does soak in completely so this may not be necessary...</li>
            <li>I was far more sensitive to pain on that side than I was on the other</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t completely make the pain go away, but it helps a little and it does a lot better than this cream.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t be able to do Brazilian Waxing without this little gem!</li>
            <li>In defense of the product, I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I am able to rub it all in with no white residue left, but it definitely takes work to get all of it rubbed in.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m a seasoned veteran when it comes to eyebrow and underarm waxing as I&#x27;ve been doing it for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was sceptical at first, but now waxing is almost totally pain-free.</li>
            <li>Then again, you probably wouldn&#x27;t need a topical anesthetic in the first place.</li>
            <li>I applied both exactly the same, applied liberally, cover in saran/cling wrap for 45-60 mins while my wax heated, wipe off, and get to waxing.  </li>
            <li>If waxing does end up being my new plan of action</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t take long to feel (or should I say not feel haha)</li>
            <li>I received the product quickly, however the numbing was minimal.  </li>
            <li>I also recently used it when my 7 yr old was getting her ears pierced for the first time.</li>
            <li>only positive I can say is that on the side I put the No Scream Cream</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently 8 months pregnant and still go get regular bikini waxes.</li>
            <li>The cream probably works well for people with less sensitive skin but is less effective for those of us with highly reactive or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It did dull the pain for the most part.</li>
            <li>So this cream works great to numb my skin superficially.</li>
            <li>Dries clear and no need to rinse off, even with soy-based wax products.</li>
            <li>The most painful part of waxing is the top part</li>
            <li>I left on for over 30 minutes on the bikini area and it did not work for me at all, still felt just as much pain.</li>
            <li>Upon my arrival, I used the restroom to remove as much of the white stuff as I could, and the beautician removed the rest before she began.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did not do the complete area yet</li>
            <li>I am really sensitive to pain and was nervous about trying this out.</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really make that big of a difference.</li>
            <li>Give at least 45 minutes or more for it to work.</li>
            <li>Maybe buy a DIY kit &amp; let a good girlfriend do it while you&#x27;re drunk or something.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used EMLA in the past for electrolysis and while that can&#x27;t be used on a big area, it is much more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had multiple tattoos and piercings, and I know my pain tolerance is high for these types of things, and I&#x27;m not saying it was &amp;#34;excruciating&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>When I first tried it, the person doing my wax immediately wiped it off with a wet cloth and advised me to never use it again.</li>
            <li>My only other major waxing experience was a full leg and bikini wax</li>
            <li>it was still very painful, but after some experimentation i found that if i applied some NSC to the same area of skin every ten minutes for 40 minutes, i was able to clear the entire area of application (over 100 hairs) in one session, so for me this stuff is a very powerful way to vastly improve the amount of epilation that i can do, although i have to use more of it.  </li>
            <li>There was a major difference between cream and pill, but I didn&#x27;t want to scream or anything.</li>
            <li>sure you apply a thick layer and cover with saran wrap to keep the heat in!</li>
            <li>Yeah, down in the more sensitive areas it smarted a few times, but it was NOTHING like I had dreamed up in my mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was having trouble with epilating on my belly and some other sensitive skin and tried this a couple of times following the instructions on the tube it didn&#x27;t seem to significantly cut the discomfort much.</li>
            <li>When I came across this product I decided to give it a try... anything that might reduce the pain a little was worth a shot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The lady barely cooled the wax so both sides were taking a beating but the side that I put the No Scream Cream on?  </li>
            <li>The pain doesn&#x27;t completely disappear but it makes it totally bearable.</li>
            <li>Next time, I will be applying to all areas, except a landing strip, and see if I can get the lady garden almost completely waxed.  </li>
            <li>The pain was was not diminished in any way, and I was not able to tolerate getting a full Brazilian wax (again).  </li>
            <li>Made the wax more slippery and just made it worse.</li>
            <li>Besides there not being enough of the product, it does not dry on clear.</li>
            <li>I left it on for an hour and a half then wiped it off right before my procedure.</li>
            <li>However, the Brazilian is on an a whole other level.</li>
            <li>really did have more luck, but this didn&#x27;t numb my skin at all.  </li>
            <li>After many bikini waxes, I was very excited to purchase a product to make the experience less painful.</li>
            <li>I also think that even though the tube is small, I will have enough for at least two more waxes before I have to get a new tube.  </li>
            <li>; It takes a very long time to absorb, it works minimally, and she has to apply too much to the area to try to make it work.</li>
            <li>Didnt really do much, might have taken the edge off a little.</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to this product easing my pain even a little bit</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> Seems like it works best if you let it sit before putting on clothes.</li>
            <li> Happy waxing!</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff around!</li>
            <li> A brazillian is NEVER a joyful experience, but with this product, it took the edge off at best.</li>
            <li> Great product!</li>
            <li> yes, I am a believer in this wonderful cream</li>
            <li> Works great!!</li>
            <li> Which is great.</li>
            <li> lol</li>
            <li> Not so happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Great product for the pain of waxing that area.  </li>
            <li> It is really a great price too.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;ll make waxing painless, but it greatly reduces the pain/sting.</li>
            <li> Amazing!</li>
            <li> Amazing!</li>
            <li> she was able to do the job perfectly anyway.</li>
            <li> I think what some people dont realize is this cream is not going to make a brazilian a pleasant experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth the $!!!!</li>
            <li> Good luck</li>
            <li> Good for beginner wax</li>
            <li> and I applied a LOT of No Scream Cream about a good 45 min - 1 hour before hand.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product 4 times now so that I could give a fair review.</li>
            <li> I ordered it because it had good reviews.</li>
            <li> My experience from using this was good.</li>
            <li> the positive comments are LIERS!!!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was so happy that I was able to tolerate the waxing.  </li>
            <li> it worked well, it is better than nothing!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s how satisfied I am!  </li>
            <li> There are a couple of tricks though, to be successful and get the most out of it.</li>
            <li> It was easy to apply &amp; it worked great.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled that it made my brazilian wax experience \\&quot;fine\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It kind of takes the edge off but it does not prevent you from feeling the hair being ripped out from its roots.</li>
            <li> I have to say, this kind of works.</li>
            <li> I kind of have to use a lot of it</li>
            <li> I can honestly say I will never use this product again</li>
            <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t notice any numbing either.</li>
            <li> The cream does not absorb on its own, it just sits there.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll be honest with you - I am not the type of person who can handle pain.  </li>
            <li> I cannot wax without some kind of pain relief.  </li>
            <li> but I have since purchased lidocaine, and that cream is much more effective than no scream cream.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Personally, I find the pain technology wipes that come with some Sally Hansen waxing products to be more effective.</li>
            <li> I have tryed many products but this is the best numming cream by far, iv been using it for years</li>
            <li> Using this product, it is more like 6.</li>
            <li> followed the directions, applied it an hour before my appointment, used it liberally (most of the tube), took an over the counter pain reliever, wore a jean skirt (no panties) and took a towel to sit on between my bottom and skirt during the car ride.  </li>
            <li> that worked better.</li>
            <li> i guess :)</li>
            <li> And unless the salon you go to (or you do your own bikini wax) has a comfortable waiting room for you to roam around nude?</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> (It wound up being more of a quasi-bikini wax because I couldn&#x27;t take the pain)  </li>
            <li> and she had many complaints about it</li>
            <li> sure you follow the directions  and apply 45 minutes before your appointment and let it absorb into your skip</li>
            <li> :) Give it a shot if you don&#x27;t believe me...</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s better than nothing.</li>
            <li> I love the cream tho, it did as it&#x27;s supposed to do</li>
            <li> That being said, I noticed NO difference, whatsoever, and made sure to use as-directed.  </li>
            <li> Thank You &#x27; No Scream Cream&#x27; for making my waxing that more bearable.</li>
            <li> Numbed it ok but still felt quite a bit of pain with hair removal.</li>
            <li> Maybe better for waxing...</li>
            <li> I wish that this product had better directions</li>
            <li> You get done, everything looks fantastic, then you walk out the door and BAM!  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;re tearing hair out by the roots from the layers of epidermis BELOW the top layer, which is where you would be applying this cream to.  </li>
            <li> This time I rubbed the cream in a bit more.</li>
            <li> but I find that my skin tolerates the long-term effects of waxing much better than the effects of shaving, so</li>
            <li> SO GLAD</li>
            <li> Oh thank goodness for this!!&lt;br /&gt;After reading as many articles as I could manage, this is what I now do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> make sure I have eaten, because everything hurt more when you are hungry.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was pain free!</li>
            <li> Great product highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> I was able to do my legs, underarms, and stomach with NO cream.</li>
            <li> Unless you think in your mind that this would make u feel better</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m sure it would do NOTHING for a brazilian as well.</li>
            <li> Numbfast (also sold on Amazon) worked WAY better for me.  </li>
            <li> I am able to wax myself with Numbfast without bunching a washcloth between my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I used it on my legs and let it sit for more than 45 minutes before my wax appointment.</li>
            <li> but the second time was wonderful because I didnt feel any pain in wax session .</li>
            <li> Look for an experienced waxer who is highly recommended instead of relying on creams to relieve pain.</li>
            <li> But once it does its pretty good.</li>
            <li> if I just have a pretty good pain tolerance for that or if this helped, but come on&#x27; you&#x27;re getting waxed, it&#x27;s going to hurt regardless.</li>
            <li> Take 3 shots of tequila before you head in for the dreaded event, and you&#x27;ll get over it just fine:)</li>
            <li> So even though my experience was not painless, I&#x27;m satisfied with my smooth skin.</li>
            <li> Make sure to bring wipes to thoroughly clean the cream off before waxing...</li>
            <li> Be strong.</li>
            <li> Great item, barely any pain.</li>
            <li> The brazillian hurts for about 2 seconds, and then you are fine.</li>
            <li> i would suggest using ice and takin some kinnda pain medication beforehand if u wanna feel a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Well, let me tell you, I am a HUGE ninny when it comes to pain.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing this review about 1 hour after waxing, and the side that was untreated is still sore, while the side that was treated is pain free.</li>
            <li> Use a lot of cream and rub it in about 45 min before your wax, take two Advil and enjoy a wax a virtual pain free wax.</li>
            <li> The third time I got brave and decided to go without anything.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a complete BAMF, you should be good to roll.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s no excuse to say anyone who liked it is a liar, erm, \\&quot;LIER.\\&quot;    It works fine!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve waxed many times and i&#x27;m pretty used to the pain by now, except for my legs.</li>
            <li> n find other ways to ease the pain like a pain pill or a beer or something.. good luck!</li>
            <li> A bigger tube for the price would be nice!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT , the first time I aplied this cream didnt work as I was expecting</li>
            <li> I must say, If you follow the instructions (and also take two paracetamols an hour before your wax)... it will reduce the pain significantly.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps I have extra sensitive skin but OUCH!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> To be fair, you&#x27;re asking for a little pain with waxing, regardless of how effective a cream is.  </li>
            <li> The product was just as I have come to expect - new and effective.</li>
            <li> I truly feel like it helped with the pain just enough for me to be able to do my own bikini wax.</li>
            <li> and I can honestly say the second time was significantly better because I used this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nothing will completely take the wax sting out of it, but this sure does make it more tolerable.  </li>
            <li> cuz I&#x27;m positive it would make it a more bearable experience.</li>
            <li> But again if you NEED some kind of numbing for sensitive areas before waxing this may be the way to go!</li>
            <li> As long as you follow instructions, it will make that process much more enjoyable!</li>
            <li> I did feel some pulling, but it most certainly was nothing in comparison to not using it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;To be fair it might kill the pain of waxing some, but I&#x27;m not convinced by what I saw with epilation, or it is possible</li>
            <li> Obviously, I didn&#x27;t expect it to be painless, but this cream took about 50% of the pain away and made it surprisingly tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> so I could tolerate the FULL MONTY.  </li>
            <li> Spread on a nice coat before waxing and you wont feel nearly anything.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s definitely not bad at all)</li>
            <li> but it was pretty easy to figure out.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my very first full Brazilian and my</li>
            <li> The first time, all I can say is OUCH!  </li>
            <li> I had my first bikini wax (Brazillian at that) and didn&#x27;t feel a THING!</li>
            <li> Whatever isn&#x27;t absorbed you can wipe off just before the wax, if you&#x27;re so embarrassed that the lady SEEING</li>
            <li> YOUR CROTCH is going to make fun of you for using a numbing cream.     </li>
            <li> I was going to give it another shot but decided it wasn&#x27;t even worth it.</li>
            <li> Product did not numb the skin at all.  </li>
            <li> this product doesnt make the waxing completely painless but it is better than having nothing at all.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the price was worth the amount in the bottle for me.</li>
            <li> but it is absolutely worth it.</li>
            <li> Worked well- not completely numb, but took edge off.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> But.. I may as well have applied hand cream because it did not numb any of the area.</li>
            <li> what it&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li> Anything is worth a try when it comes to the pain of Brazilian waxing.</li>
            <li> It was worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I explained to her that it was supposed to have been absorbed by then and apologized.</li>
            <li> i really love this product ,it really works as what named ,relax and wax with no scream ,i highly recommend it</li>
            <li> thats what it pretty much is!!  </li>
            <li> A great tip is to put the cream on and then place a small strip of saran wrap over your pelvis.</li>
            <li> I had been hesitant to rub it in a lot the first time since it states that there should be a layer of cream on the skin, and it&#x27;s not meant to be absorbed like moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Also, it has virtually no fragrance which is great, al the other products we tried had very strong fragrances which associates with pain and makes the products less desirable to use.</li>
            <li> I used a very generous layer, let it absorb for one hour, took three Aleve liquid-gels, smoked half a blunt &amp; waxed successfully for the first time.</li>
            <li> i also use Emjoi After Epilation Cream ([...]), which seems to work pretty well.</li>
            <li> I first waxed the under arm that was treated with the cream, then the one that was not treated.</li>
            <li> Thanks, Amazon!</li>
            <li> Most definitely using &amp; purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> most definitely takes the edge off.</li>
            <li> I applied this product 1 hour prior to my waxing and it felt like it hurt more than without it.</li>
            <li> Followed directions exactly.  </li>
            <li> Starts to wear off after 1.5 hrs and starts taking effect about 30 minutes after first application.</li>
            <li> It can provide you peace of mind if your a first time waxer, but that&#x27;s about all.</li>
            <li> I used the cream for my first Brazilian wax.</li>
            <li> This stuff really does work!</li>
            <li> u gotta wait for like 20 minutes after u apply it to be able to feel a difference...but its not a big difference.</li>
            <li> First time getting a wax I used this</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;d be able to finally use my epilator.</li>
            <li> I also took an Xanex for my nerves but over all the &#x27;No Scream Cream&#x27; did exactly what it was suppose to do, help relieve the pain on the site of where the waxing was suppose to take place.  </li>
            <li> , I wanted to try it out first and see how this product worked.  </li>
            <li> This was my first time getting a wax done</li>
            <li> After my first Brazilian, I was intrigued to test out this product</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it I followed the instructions on the tube but didn&#x27;t feel any difference in the amount of pain.</li>
            <li> But on my second attempt I decided to rub it in somewhat more, but not so much that it was completely absorbed.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time</li>
            <li> This really does work!</li>
            <li> I went yesterday to get my first Brazilian Wax</li>
            <li> ;)  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t mind laying there longer than normal because it was not a painful experience at all.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t nearly as effective as other OTC numbing ointments.  </li>
            <li> but I was far more sensitive to the heat from the wax on that side as well.  </li>
            <li> Brazilian waxes pretty much suck</li>
            <li> and I could really tell the difference (my first time I used something from Sally&#x27;s that really didn&#x27;t do anything).</li>
            <li> the hairs are so strong that each hair will get yanked maybe 5 times before it will actually come out.</li>
            <li> but this did a great job of taking the edge off and making a painful experience more endurable.</li>
            <li> This product really made the experience manageable.  </li>
            <li> Did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li> There are generic versions available.</li>
            <li> This product really helps lessen the discomfort of bikini waxing.</li>
            <li> I decided I was going to see if it really worked</li>
            <li> but the no scream cream really took the edge off the pain, it really did decrease the sting.</li>
            <li> Then I used it for real on my leg, no difference at all.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work much.  </li>
            <li> I do highly recommend this product if your thinking of get a Brazilian or bikini wax!</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this product to work , really.</li>
            <li> Came really fast though</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really help me at all.</li>
            <li> Now, let&#x27;s be reasonable.  </li>
            <li> I would have given it five, but I felt that $20 for an ounce of this stuff was too much.  </li>
            <li> so when I had it on, I didn&#x27;t think much of it.</li>
            <li> It really, really hurt.</li>
            <li> Even if it works really well for you, you are still going to experience some pain.</li>
            <li> Worked as advertised - I didn&#x27;t feel nearly as much pain during my brazilian wax as everyone had said.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it really helped, but I can&#x27;t say it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I noticed the pain went away really fast too</li>
            <li> And you really have to wait 20-30 minutes before waxing to let it sink in</li>
            <li> I apply it thick two times and works good.  </li>
            <li> First, you must really slather it on nice and thick.</li>
            <li> I did, and was rudely surprised soon after the first strip was ripped off.</li>
            <li> The cream was decent.</li>
            <li> i used it to epilate and man it still hurt, also its a super tiny bottle!!!!  </li>
            <li> Finally I discovered this cream and my fourth wax was almost pain free!</li>
            <li> Also, it must be allowed to dry(dries quickly) and all of this must be done about 45 minutes prior to your service.</li>
            <li> The second and last time, I applied it over an hour before, thinking it just needed more time.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> So, I would highly recommended this product.</li>
            <li> If you can afford it, you may want to give it a shot, but I wouldn&#x27;t have high expectations.</li>
            <li> The cost was high for 1 oz of cream and did not work for me.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how well it worked since the side I used the cream on had more hair than the other side.</li>
            <li> However, my problem lies in the fact that I have deeper pores so there&#x27;s a tad more than just a little bitty hair follicle getting plucked out.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t counting on this product to take ALL the pain away but even just a little bit would have been okay.</li>
            <li> Ok, so i was super skeptical about the product, and i was right.</li>
            <li> Wow this stuff really works.</li>
            <li> However, the areas that are particularly sensitive did not receive much benefit.</li>
            <li> This is BENZOCAINE: pretty much the strongest topical analgesic you can buy w/out a prescription - it&#x27;s GOING TO WORK, @</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t rub the product all the way into my skin (allowed it to be absorbed, like instructed) even left it on for 5 min.</li>
            <li> I then wear loose fitting clothing to my appointment so not to disturb the area too much, though it does soak in completely so this may not be necessary...</li>
            <li> I was far more sensitive to pain on that side than I was on the other</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t completely make the pain go away, but it helps a little and it does a lot better than this cream.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be able to do Brazilian Waxing without this little gem!</li>
            <li> In defense of the product, I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I am able to rub it all in with no white residue left, but it definitely takes work to get all of it rubbed in.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m a seasoned veteran when it comes to eyebrow and underarm waxing as I&#x27;ve been doing it for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was sceptical at first, but now waxing is almost totally pain-free.</li>
            <li> Then again, you probably wouldn&#x27;t need a topical anesthetic in the first place.</li>
            <li> I applied both exactly the same, applied liberally, cover in saran/cling wrap for 45-60 mins while my wax heated, wipe off, and get to waxing.  </li>
            <li> If waxing does end up being my new plan of action</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t take long to feel (or should I say not feel haha)</li>
            <li> I received the product quickly, however the numbing was minimal.  </li>
            <li> I also recently used it when my 7 yr old was getting her ears pierced for the first time.</li>
            <li> only positive I can say is that on the side I put the No Scream Cream</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently 8 months pregnant and still go get regular bikini waxes.</li>
            <li> The cream probably works well for people with less sensitive skin but is less effective for those of us with highly reactive or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It did dull the pain for the most part.</li>
            <li> So this cream works great to numb my skin superficially.</li>
            <li> Dries clear and no need to rinse off, even with soy-based wax products.</li>
            <li> The most painful part of waxing is the top part</li>
            <li> I left on for over 30 minutes on the bikini area and it did not work for me at all, still felt just as much pain.</li>
            <li> Upon my arrival, I used the restroom to remove as much of the white stuff as I could, and the beautician removed the rest before she began.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did not do the complete area yet</li>
            <li> I am really sensitive to pain and was nervous about trying this out.</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really make that big of a difference.</li>
            <li> Give at least 45 minutes or more for it to work.</li>
            <li> Maybe buy a DIY kit &amp; let a good girlfriend do it while you&#x27;re drunk or something.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used EMLA in the past for electrolysis and while that can&#x27;t be used on a big area, it is much more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had multiple tattoos and piercings, and I know my pain tolerance is high for these types of things, and I&#x27;m not saying it was &amp;#34;excruciating&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> When I first tried it, the person doing my wax immediately wiped it off with a wet cloth and advised me to never use it again.</li>
            <li> My only other major waxing experience was a full leg and bikini wax</li>
            <li> it was still very painful, but after some experimentation i found that if i applied some NSC to the same area of skin every ten minutes for 40 minutes, i was able to clear the entire area of application (over 100 hairs) in one session, so for me this stuff is a very powerful way to vastly improve the amount of epilation that i can do, although i have to use more of it.  </li>
            <li> There was a major difference between cream and pill, but I didn&#x27;t want to scream or anything.</li>
            <li> sure you apply a thick layer and cover with saran wrap to keep the heat in!</li>
            <li> Yeah, down in the more sensitive areas it smarted a few times, but it was NOTHING like I had dreamed up in my mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was having trouble with epilating on my belly and some other sensitive skin and tried this a couple of times following the instructions on the tube it didn&#x27;t seem to significantly cut the discomfort much.</li>
            <li> When I came across this product I decided to give it a try... anything that might reduce the pain a little was worth a shot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The lady barely cooled the wax so both sides were taking a beating but the side that I put the No Scream Cream on?  </li>
            <li> The pain doesn&#x27;t completely disappear but it makes it totally bearable.</li>
            <li> Next time, I will be applying to all areas, except a landing strip, and see if I can get the lady garden almost completely waxed.  </li>
            <li> The pain was was not diminished in any way, and I was not able to tolerate getting a full Brazilian wax (again).  </li>
            <li> Made the wax more slippery and just made it worse.</li>
            <li> Besides there not being enough of the product, it does not dry on clear.</li>
            <li> I left it on for an hour and a half then wiped it off right before my procedure.</li>
            <li> However, the Brazilian is on an a whole other level.</li>
            <li> really did have more luck, but this didn&#x27;t numb my skin at all.  </li>
            <li> After many bikini waxes, I was very excited to purchase a product to make the experience less painful.</li>
            <li> I also think that even though the tube is small, I will have enough for at least two more waxes before I have to get a new tube.  </li>
            <li> ; It takes a very long time to absorb, it works minimally, and she has to apply too much to the area to try to make it work.</li>
            <li> Didnt really do much, might have taken the edge off a little.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to this product easing my pain even a little bit</li>
            <li> /&gt;To make a long story short I would say this product definitely works (especially considering I have an EXTREMELY low tolerance for pain)..</li>
            <li> Hardly felt a thing during my first wax when I used this stuff.</li>
            <li> When I misplaced my tube of No Scream Cream recently I immediately ordered a new one.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it works, we were told by our Doctor it might help our daughter with her intense fear of needles.  </li>
            <li> I decided to get my first brazilian wax and knew I needed something to at least knock the edge off.</li>
            <li> Not completely but just enough!</li>
            <li> Keep in mind this in not a professional medical grade numbing cream.</li>
            <li> Nothing will take the pain completely away, but this moves the pain down to discomfort.</li>
            <li> and nope it let me down completely.</li>
            <li> Normally I have a slight flinch when the wax strips are ripped, but not this time!</li>
            <li> This is the same active ingredient to stop pain and itching as in big brand name female products, save a bundle, compare labels and try this stuff.</li>
            <li> It goes on VERY thick and does not clean easily with a dry towel and forget about toilet paper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bikini waxed for years but was afraid to go brazilian because I wouldn&#x27;t be able to handle the pain.  </li>
            <li> This cream defnitely works as long as you apply it 45 minutes to an hour before your procedure.  </li>
            <li> Definitely be careful to follow the directions if you want it to work properly.</li>
            <li> If you are going to a salon to be waxed just take a facial cleansing cloth or wet wipe to get it off</li>
            <li> Will not completely take away the pain</li>
            <li> You also really need to layer it on thick.</li>
            <li> While my more stupid friends laugh that this is &#x27;girl stuff &#x27; when they see the label, I find that it&#x27;s better priced than similar benzocaine formulations for &#x27;manly men&#x27; ( &#x3D; the stupid friends), with the same active ingredient.</li>
            <li> Not a significant enough lessening to warrant the long lasting effects of the numbness.</li>
            <li> Is it worth the messy application and money spent for the small reduction in pain?...</li>
            <li> Other products by the same maker/distributor are used when this is the one women should be looking for.  </li>
            <li> This cream does help a lot, although as it was entioned by other reviewers it only kills about 80% of pain.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this products to others as I did so to the technician whom performed my Brazilian, this way she can pass along this cream to her other clients -</li>
            <li> It also left a little white residue that i couldnt get off.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t be pain free, but it will not make you afraid to go back for another brazilian wax.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s more than ten times as painful as yanking the hairs on my arms</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions properly, even did it a few different times and nothing feels just like without it.</li>
            <li> I now think that the reason I felt a bit of a sting in other parts is because I was not able to apply the cream very well in harder to see</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what a brazilian (or any type) wax feels like without the No Scream Cream, but with it the pain was no where near what I anticipated.</li>
            <li> And it works a lot better than other products that claim to relieve pain and numb skin.</li>
            <li> but I was not able to even complete the Brazilian session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li> Not to be graphic, but when you are growing out your hair for weeks at a time before a wax, the last thing you want is thick, gross lotion on it for the aesthetician to have to deal with.</li>
            <li> This stuff really worked to dull the sting of a bikini wax!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this cream for sensitive areas if you absolutely do not want to deal with the pain of waxing :/</li>
            <li> I noticed a reduction of approximately forty percent-enough to get my legs completely hair-free, though I might have invented a few new curse words in the process.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps a slight numbing but no major change.</li>
            <li> and it was over the top PAINFUL.  </li>
            <li> For me, not really.</li>
            <li> u&#x27;ll still feel some sensation but not nearly as much.</li>
            <li> a couple tries with no change.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to let this absorb into the skin long enough to take effect.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> And sorry, ladies, but if you think the wax hurts just the same (or worse [which is absurd]), you either have the most sensitive skin ever (and therefore shouldn&#x27;t be waxing to begin with) or you simply have no pain tolerance whatsoever.</li>
            <li> this stuff is small and expensive which could be justified if it did anything that it said it would instead of just globing up on me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s still unpleasant, and by no means will it be pain free, but to some extent, the product delivers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I put this on one under arm, but not the other.</li>
            <li> No delays in shipping or other problems.</li>
            <li> There will be some pain like the other reviewers mentioned.</li>
            <li> Maybe it was just me and other people</li>
            <li> Still hurt extremely.</li>
            <li> (and that&#x27;s not hyperbole, i mean quite literally more than ten times as painful).  </li>
            <li> This is such a pain to use, very messy and not practical at all.</li>
            <li> I applied a thin layer for an hour prior to my wax, showered it off just prior to going to my appointment.</li>
            <li> For some reason brazilian waxing  was never as bad as doing underarms for me, so I think I&#x27;m going to be fine doing it myself with this cream.</li>
            <li> I think that it is unanimous that the process of violently ripping out hair at potentially the most sensitive part of the human body will just simply be unpleasant.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s impossible to subjectively compare the levels of pain, like, with NSC and without it, but i can say that the difference is significant.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically recommend anything let alone write a review, but I avoid getting a Brazilian wax due to the pain.  </li>
            <li> Follow the directions on the container (liberal amount, not rubbed in, at least 30 min prior, etc.)</li>
            <li> Each one worse and more painfully than the last.</li>
            <li> Also, not worth the money or time that it takes to put it on.</li>
            <li> Not worth the cost.</li>
            <li> After reading review I really thought this would work for me sadly</li>
            <li> the cream is thick and white, STOP, Do not rub in.</li>
            <li> Your esthetician (sp?) should ask you to wipe down that area anyway for sanitary reasons.</li>
            <li> And here I was scheduling torture down there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions very carefully, and nothin!</li>
            <li> still screamed...but less than I would have without this...i&#x27;m a wimp</li>
            <li> I have to say that I agree with a previous review</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and did as directed by others, applied about an hour and a half before</li>
            <li> and then a half hour before I had to leave to go get waxed.  </li>
            <li> I still felt the pull and had a slight ouch when the hairs were ripped out, but with pain I could handle.  </li>
            <li> For my first wax below, I decided to get a brazilian wax (crazy, I know).</li>
            <li> This cream makes it suck a little less.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect for this product to take the pain away completely, but I expected it to at least partially take it away because it was so expensive.</li>
            <li> It was still super painful in those areas.</li>
            <li> people who have tried Lidocaine based creams and had little luck, give this a try.</li>
            <li> Not worth it at all!</li>
            <li> not even a little.</li>
            <li> It recently saved a friend&#x27;s behind from total disaster when the going got tough after 600 miles in the saddle.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately women have to go through the pain of waxing/sugaring every few weeks and sadly there are no 100% pain free products yet.</li>
            <li> By the time you&#x27;re ready to get waxed, you&#x27;ll be perfectly numb.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> waste of 15 bucks and 45 minutes of my time.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.  </li>
            <li> A waste of money.</li>
            <li> Not only was the pain WORSE on that side</li>
            <li> Unless you are reallllllly scared to get a bikini wax don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> all it did was waste 45 minutes of my time.</li>
            <li> I probably used half of the bottle...no lie!</li>
            <li> In fact, I&#x27;m not sure I felt any less pain that I would have without the cream.</li>
            <li> I later thought I uses it wrong and tried it again this time leaving it on a little but longer and still nothing</li>
            <li> This product did very little for me.</li>
            <li> It really wasn&#x27;t that bad for a first-timer.  </li>
            <li> But, I&#x27;m not sure a product that would do that exists.</li>
            <li> I found that a bit excessive.  </li>
            <li> - there&#x27;s no way to numb yourself completely, there&#x27;s always going to be a sting when being waxed</li>
            <li> Tube is too small and you need to pile the stuff on for it to work.</li>
            <li> after she yanked it all I could say was &amp;#34;That&#x27;s it?&amp;#34;... Don&#x27;t get me wrong, you definitely feel something</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Maybe I did it wrong or maybe it works for other parts but as far as I&#x27;m concerned the &amp;#34;no&amp;#34; in no scream cream was irrelevant.</li>
            <li> Very messy almost like diaper rash cream.  </li>
            <li> Extremely expensive for the amount of cream, seriously the bottle is tiny!!</li>
            <li> The side that was treated with the no scream cream was less painful and less irritated than the other side.</li>
            <li> I should give some credit to hard wax too.</li>
            <li> Does nothing to dull pain</li>
            <li> I found the places where the cream was thickest were the areas I had the least amount of pain.</li>
            <li> least to some extent.    </li>
            <li> I bought this product despite the negative review&#x27;s</li>
            <li> It worked well enough for me but 45 mins to numb the area?</li>
            <li> Waxing sucks.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for it to at least take some of the edge off a Brazilian wax</li>
            <li> You need to applied it at least 45 min before .</li>
            <li> a thick layer and the waxing still hurt like hell.</li>
            <li> Who can walk around with a cream spread thickly over their nether region for 45 mins???</li>
            <li> Works as advertised you apply it thick like it  says.  </li>
            <li> (this doesn&#x27;t mean that you won&#x27;t feel anything</li>
            <li> I was so mad that the product didn&#x27;t work and had there been any goop left in the tube, I would have thrown it</li>
            <li> (I also seriously thought about downing some tequila, but decided against it, since I had no one to drive me home).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The second time, I forgot the cream, so I popped a painkiller 45 minutes before the wax and the wax still wasn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using this, and was very disappointed after an hour.  </li>
            <li> and I hardly felt it!</li>
            <li> My anticipation before the first pull was the worst...</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t do ANYTHING but make a mess and take up my time, because it didn&#x27;t numb or even take the edge off.</li>
            <li> it just didn&#x27;t numb me at all not even a little bit.</li>
            <li> So, in conclusion, I spent $20 on lotion that went into the garbage, and my waxes have been just as painful as ever.</li>
            <li> I hate this cream it does nothing but leave a greasy, gritty residue on your skin.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s thick and weird.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s not gonna numb ur skin as if it&#x27;s dead,</li>
            <li> It does take at least 45 minutes to an hour to totally numb the area, and I did have to use quite a bit</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t completely numb but it helps if you follow the directions correctly, otherwise it doesn&#x27;t properly numb and the cream is wasted.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t condone use of illegal painkillers, but it sounds like that&#x27;s what some of you need to tolerate a Brazilian.    </li>
            <li> Too expensive and doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> Waxing is still uncomfortable after using it, but when I did not use it I did notice that it hurt.</li>
            <li> I have never waxed with out it and honestly, I never will!!!!</li>
            <li> It is expensive for the amount</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s how I knew: I was skeptical about the cream</li>
            <li> This does not take enough &amp;#34;edge off&amp;#34; to justify the insane price</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was really skeptical</li>
            <li> Sorry this product did not work at all for me.</li>
            <li> The directions vaguely state: &amp;#34;Once</li>
            <li> Very little difference and still very painful.</li>
            <li> I used this before epiliating and it still hurt like crazy.  </li>
            <li> Made my hand numb from rubbing it in.</li>
            <li> Also takes forever to numb.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a trooper n still waxed without my lady parts being numb...</li>
            <li> truly numb me</li>
            <li> When waxing or using an epilator you will need to wipe the cream off as it leaves a residue but don&#x27;t worry, the area will stay numb for about 10 minutes after re,icing the cream.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t slightly numb .</li>
            <li> Just not as bad.</li>
            <li> but not 1/2 as bad as I thought it would and</li>
            <li> oh that&#x27;s not too bad.  </li>
            <li> Before that it was so painful that I couldn&#x27;t stand it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after a painful 1st experience in (attempting) to get a Brazilian wax.  </li>
            <li> Because of that the process was still painful and I ended up shaving instead.</li>
            <li> Brazilians are painful, no if&#x27;s ands or buts.</li>
            <li> and it was so incredibly painful.</li>
            <li> It sounds to me like they&#x27;re disappointed this cream didn&#x27;t diminish the pain 100%, like</li>
            <li> but I decided to give it a shot, I would try anything to numb the pain of waxing!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t recommend this at all :(</li>
            <li> I hate shaving in winter.  </li>
            <li> O Its still painful!</li>
            <li> coming from someone who waxes, eplilates and tweezes im very disappointed in this.</li>
            <li> This product + the wax + my skin &#x3D; awful rash!</li>
            <li> I am awful with pain</li>
            <li> However, when she started I braced for this horrible horrible pain and was like,</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> On a pain scale of 1-10 (10 being highest) I give a Brazilian bikini wax a 7. Using this product, it is more like 6. Is it worth the messy application and money spent for the small reduction in pain?... For me, not really. You also really need to layer it on thick. I found the places where the cream was thickest were the areas I had the least amount of pain.</li>
            <li> I left on for over 30 minutes on the bikini area and it did not work for me at all, still felt just as much pain.</li>
            <li> I used this before epiliating and it still hurt like crazy.  It may have taken the edge off, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Brazilian waxes pretty much suck - there&#x27;s no doubt about that. They&#x27;re not for weenies, regardless of any amount of topical cream or liquor. This is BENZOCAINE: pretty much the strongest topical analgesic you can buy w/out a prescription - it&#x27;s GOING TO WORK, @ least to some extent.    Here&#x27;s the thing... The gals reviewing this obviously have a big issue w/the pain of the procedure, or else they wouldn&#x27;t have purchased the product. It sounds to me like they&#x27;re disappointed this cream didn&#x27;t diminish the pain 100%, like another review said. That&#x27;s no excuse to say anyone who liked it is a liar, erm, \\&quot;LIER.\\&quot;    It works fine! Apply it 45 min. before. Hell, do it twice if you wish. Seems like it works best if you let it sit before putting on clothes. Whatever isn&#x27;t absorbed you can wipe off just before the wax, if you&#x27;re so embarrassed that the lady SEEING YOUR CROTCH is going to make fun of you for using a numbing cream.     Anyway. It definitely takes the edge off. And sorry, ladies, but if you think the wax hurts just the same (or worse [which is absurd]), you either have the most sensitive skin ever (and therefore shouldn&#x27;t be waxing to begin with) or you simply have no pain tolerance whatsoever. Maybe buy a DIY kit &amp; let a good girlfriend do it while you&#x27;re drunk or something. I won&#x27;t condone use of illegal painkillers, but it sounds like that&#x27;s what some of you need to tolerate a Brazilian.    Good luck w/future waxing, girls. Be strong.</li>
            <li> It does seem to lessen the pain. I would have given it 5 stars if it made the experience pain-free. But, I&#x27;m not sure a product that would do that exists.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bikini waxed for years but was afraid to go brazilian because I wouldn&#x27;t be able to handle the pain.  I bought this cream hoping it would help and I was thrilled that it made my brazilian wax experience \\&quot;fine\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions, applied it an hour before my appointment, used it liberally (most of the tube), took an over the counter pain reliever, wore a jean skirt (no panties) and took a towel to sit on between my bottom and skirt during the car ride.  Upon my arrival, I used the restroom to remove as much of the white stuff as I could, and the beautician removed the rest before she began.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so happy that I was able to tolerate the waxing.  This product really made the experience manageable.  It won&#x27;t be pain free, but it will not make you afraid to go back for another brazilian wax.</li>
            <li> This is definitely not a pain-free cream. It kind of takes the edge off but it does not prevent you from feeling the hair being ripped out from its roots. Unfortunately women have to go through the pain of waxing/sugaring every few weeks and sadly there are no 100% pain free products yet.</li>
            <li> I did not notice a difference with the \\&quot;No Scream Cream\\&quot;.  I wish they would come up with a \\&quot;No Humiliation While Getting Waxed Cream\\&quot;.  Now that, I would buy!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. I tried this and it didn&#x27;t work for me at all. I know it isn&#x27;t going to get rid of the pain, but I don&#x27;t think it helped at all. I followed all instructions (putting a lot on, don&#x27;t rub it in, leave on for a hour, put saran wrap to help it soak in). I would suggest you save your money and take Advil to cut the pain - that worked better. I was going to give it another shot but decided it wasn&#x27;t even worth it.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been epilating the hair on my face for 5 months, bit by bit, about a dozen hairs per session. the hairs are so strong that each hair will get yanked maybe 5 times before it will actually come out. that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s more than ten times as painful as yanking the hairs on my arms (and that&#x27;s not hyperbole, i mean quite literally more than ten times as painful).  it&#x27;s impossible to subjectively compare the levels of pain, like, with NSC and without it, but i can say that the difference is significant.  it was still very painful, but after some experimentation i found that if i applied some NSC to the same area of skin every ten minutes for 40 minutes, i was able to clear the entire area of application (over 100 hairs) in one session, so for me this stuff is a very powerful way to vastly improve the amount of epilation that i can do, although i have to use more of it.  i also use Emjoi After Epilation Cream ([...]), which seems to work pretty well.</li>
            <li> Did absolutely nothing for me. coming from someone who waxes, eplilates and tweezes im very disappointed in this. waste of 15 bucks and 45 minutes of my time. No numbing at all.</li>
            <li> Amazing! I put this on one under arm, but not the other. I first waxed the under arm that was treated with the cream, then the one that was not treated. I also used an automatic tweezer to get the rest of the hairs. The side that was treated with the no scream cream was less painful and less irritated than the other side. I was surprised how well it worked since the side I used the cream on had more hair than the other side. Tweezing afterward was painless on the side the treated with the cream. I&#x27;m writing this review about 1 hour after waxing, and the side that was untreated is still sore, while the side that was treated is pain free. I used after waxing cream on both sides to help minimize irritation, but the difference is obvious. I wax myself, and this worked so well my next area to try is brazillion!</li>
            <li> Works!! Other products by the same maker/distributor are used when this is the one women should be looking for.  You place it on about 45 mins prior to wax.  Now keep in mind, waxing hurts anyways but this product definitely helps a lot.</li>
            <li> Good for beginner wax</li>
            <li> Wish it actually worked. But it doesnt</li>
            <li> This works, I swear by it!</li>
            <li> The product was just as I have come to expect - new and effective. No delays in shipping or other problems. Thanks, Amazon!</li>
            <li> Made my hand numb from rubbing it in. Worked well. Took away a lot of the discomfort during the process.</li>
            <li> This cream does help a lot, although as it was entioned by other reviewers it only kills about 80% of pain. I could still feel the pain while using epilator to get rid of the hair on my underarms. But that was my third attempt to do it with the epilator in  10 years and the only one that succeeded. Before that it was so painful that I couldn&#x27;t stand it. So even though my experience was not painless, I&#x27;m satisfied with my smooth skin. For some reason brazilian waxing  was never as bad as doing underarms for me, so I think I&#x27;m going to be fine doing it myself with this cream.</li>
            <li> still screamed...but less than I would have without this...i&#x27;m a wimp i guess :)</li>
            <li> I was having trouble with epilating on my belly and some other sensitive skin and tried this a couple of times following the instructions on the tube it didn&#x27;t seem to significantly cut the discomfort much. I&#x27;ve used EMLA in the past for electrolysis and while that can&#x27;t be used on a big area, it is much more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair it might kill the pain of waxing some, but I&#x27;m not convinced by what I saw with epilation, or it is possible I misunderstood some instruction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will note that EMLA is by prescription only. There are generic versions available.</li>
            <li> I have to say, this kind of works. I have always, always wanted to wax because shaving no longer meets my needs. But the pain was just too unbearable. I used a very generous layer, let it absorb for one hour, took three Aleve liquid-gels, smoked half a blunt &amp; waxed successfully for the first time. Most definitely using &amp; purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> I hate this cream it does nothing but leave a greasy, gritty residue on your skin. This cream doesn&#x27;t work at all!!!!</li>
            <li> This product really helps lessen the discomfort of bikini waxing.</li>
            <li> Ok, so i was super skeptical about the product, and i was right. I applied as they asked- about 30-40 min before the wax, a thick layer and the waxing still hurt like hell. I did not see a decrease in pain.. maybe about 20%.. but maybe that decrease is psychological, i may never know. My recommendation? Take 3 shots of tequila before you head in for the dreaded event, and you&#x27;ll get over it just fine:)</li>
            <li> It leaves a white residue, but whenever I get a bikini wax, it lessens the pain.</li>
            <li> Garbage.  Too expensive and doesn&#x27;t work.  Waste of money.  Very messy almost like diaper rash cream.  Don&#x27;t bother!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no way to use this cream without getting it all over your underpants. And unless the salon you go to (or you do your own bikini wax) has a comfortable waiting room for you to roam around nude? It&#x27;s hard to let this absorb into the skin long enough to take effect.&lt;br /&gt;Now, if you put this on your eyebrow or upper lip area, it makes the pain of threading/waxing almost non-existent. Which is great. But it&#x27;s thick and weird.</li>
            <li> I bought this product despite the negative review&#x27;s I had read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It most definitely takes the edge off. I think what some people dont realize is this cream is not going to make a brazilian a pleasant experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put two layers on, 45 minutes before a waxing. I am able to rub it all in with no white residue left, but it definitely takes work to get all of it rubbed in. I also take 2 ibuprofin 45 minutes before the waxing (Dont take aspirin, it&#x27;ll make you bleed while being waxed. Ibuprofin will help with the swelling).</li>
            <li> i really love this product ,it really works as what named ,relax and wax with no scream ,i highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I&#x27;ve tried getting waxed with and without, and it definitely makes a difference. Nothing will take the pain completely away, but this moves the pain down to discomfort. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I applied this product 1 hour prior to my waxing and it felt like it hurt more than without it.</li>
            <li> It worked well enough for me but 45 mins to numb the area? I found that a bit excessive.  Who can walk around with a cream spread thickly over their nether region for 45 mins???</li>
            <li> Followed directions exactly.  Product did not numb the skin at all.  A waste of money.</li>
            <li> it works, I did waxing and i didn&#x27;t felt that pain, that i use to feel every time i do waxing.</li>
            <li> So I got this yesterday and was on deck for my pre-vacation wax today.  I decided I was going to see if it really worked so I put it on only ONE of my underarms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh.Em.Gee.  Not only was the pain WORSE on that side but I was far more sensitive to the heat from the wax on that side as well.  The lady barely cooled the wax so both sides were taking a beating but the side that I put the No Scream Cream on?  WORSE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I was far more sensitive to pain on that side than I was on the other and I&#x27;m a seasoned veteran when it comes to eyebrow and underarm waxing as I&#x27;ve been doing it for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only positive I can say is that on the side I put the No Scream Cream she was done faster (no plucking after the waxing)... but hey, that could&#x27;ve just been a coincidence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Utter garbage.  Which is where the tube is now.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it works, we were told by our Doctor it might help our daughter with her intense fear of needles.  Placebo perhaps, but we will accept that for an easier Dr. visit.</li>
            <li> I used this as per the instructions. I should give some credit to hard wax too. There will be some pain like the other reviewers mentioned.</li>
            <li> Did not work. Only numbs the skin. The pain comes from the follicle but I didn&#x27;t think about that at the time of purchase.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this product because of the mixed reviews but I decided to give it a shot, I would try anything to numb the pain of waxing! I have to say that I agree with a previous review - there&#x27;s no way to numb yourself completely, there&#x27;s always going to be a sting when being waxed but the no scream cream really took the edge off the pain, it really did decrease the sting. I also took a few ibuprofen (at the same time I applied this cream) which made my second wax appointment MUCH, much easier. Again, no way to totally nix the pain but this did a great job of taking the edge off and making a painful experience more endurable. Happy waxing!</li>
            <li> I received the product quickly, however the numbing was minimal.  This isn&#x27;t nearly as effective as other OTC numbing ointments.  I&#x27;ll opt for another product next time.</li>
            <li> Make sure to bring wipes to thoroughly clean the cream off before waxing... otherwise you will find yourself explaining to whomever is waxing you why your vagina looks the way it does.  It goes on VERY thick and does not clean easily with a dry towel and forget about toilet paper. As for the quality of the product itself... it worked well, it is better than nothing!</li>
            <li> Works as advertised you apply it thick like it  says.  I apply it thick two times and works good.  Starts to wear off after 1.5 hrs and starts taking effect about 30 minutes after first application.</li>
            <li> Tube is too small and you need to pile the stuff on for it to work. Also takes forever to numb. But once it does its pretty good.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff around! I&#x27;m currently 8 months pregnant and still go get regular bikini waxes. A great tip is to put the cream on and then place a small strip of saran wrap over your pelvis. It helps open your pores and prevents cream from getting all over your underwear and clothes. By the time you&#x27;re ready to get waxed, you&#x27;ll be perfectly numb. (this doesn&#x27;t mean that you won&#x27;t feel anything but it&#x27;s definitely not bad at all)</li>
            <li> This is such a pain to use, very messy and not practical at all. I didn&#x27;t even notice a difference. Unless you are reallllllly scared to get a bikini wax don&#x27;t waste your time. It can provide you peace of mind if your a first time waxer, but that&#x27;s about all.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after a painful 1st experience in (attempting) to get a Brazilian wax.  (It wound up being more of a quasi-bikini wax because I couldn&#x27;t take the pain)  On my second visit to the spa, I took 2 painkillers and I applied a LOT of No Scream Cream about a good 45 min - 1 hour before hand.  (I also seriously thought about downing some tequila, but decided against it, since I had no one to drive me home).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may as well not have ever applied any of the product.  The pain was was not diminished in any way, and I was not able to tolerate getting a full Brazilian wax (again).  I was so mad that the product didn&#x27;t work and had there been any goop left in the tube, I would have thrown it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spend your money on a stronger topical anesthetic, especially if you have low pain tolerance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for me, on my next visit, I&#x27;m taking the tequila with me.</li>
            <li> There was no numbing effect. I followed instructions and waited thirty minutes, no difference- trust me! Don&#x27;t buy this lotion.</li>
            <li> if you are looking for no pain at all this cream is not for you, however it reduce the pain about %80.</li>
            <li> I used the cream for my first Brazilian wax. Minimized the pain!!</li>
            <li> Waxing sucks. This cream makes it suck a little less.  I have NO tolerance for pain so any help is a big deal. Follow the directions on the container (liberal amount, not rubbed in, at least 30 min prior, etc.) and it WILL work. It is still going to hurt, though. Just not as bad.</li>
            <li> Maybe it was just me and other people really did have more luck, but this didn&#x27;t numb my skin at all.  I&#x27;ve waxed many times and i&#x27;m pretty used to the pain by now, except for my legs. Used this on a test area on my arm where i&#x27;d pluck hair, still felt the same amount of pain.  Then I used it for real on my leg, no difference at all. Save your money! Take ibuprofen or another pain reliever and just wait about 30-45 minutes for it to take affect.  It doesn&#x27;t completely make the pain go away, but it helps a little and it does a lot better than this cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had the chance to once the product once, but the pain was reduced. Normally I have a slight flinch when the wax strips are ripped, but not this time!</li>
            <li> When I misplaced my tube of No Scream Cream recently I immediately ordered a new one.  It makes such a difference in the discomfort of waxing.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my teenage daughter and she had many complaints about it; It takes a very long time to absorb, it works minimally, and she has to apply too much to the area to try to make it work.</li>
            <li> For my first wax below, I decided to get a brazilian wax (crazy, I know). Before making my appointment, I researched and reviewed anything I could about the process and what I could possibily to reduced the &amp;#34;unbearable&amp;#34; pain that everyone talks about. When I came across this product I decided to give it a try... anything that might reduce the pain a little was worth a shot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make a long story short I would say this product definitely works (especially considering I have an EXTREMELY low tolerance for pain).. I&#x27;m not sure what a brazilian (or any type) wax feels like without the No Scream Cream, but with it the pain was no where near what I anticipated. My anticipation before the first pull was the worst... after she yanked it all I could say was &amp;#34;That&#x27;s it?&amp;#34;... Don&#x27;t get me wrong, you definitely feel something but it&#x27;s nothing compared to the pain I&#x27;ve heard others describe that don&#x27;t use any type of numbing tool.. I&#x27;m definitely going back for my follow-up in 4 weeks and I will definitely be using this cream again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you follow the directions  and apply 45 minutes before your appointment and let it absorb into your skip (DO NOT rub it in or wipe it off)... With this cream you won&#x27;t scream lol :) Give it a shot if you don&#x27;t believe me...</li>
            <li> This stuff really does work! I was sceptical at first, but now waxing is almost totally pain-free. I&#x27;ll never wax without it again!</li>
            <li> Do NOT go into a place to get your hoo-hoo waxed with this stuff on and any expectations!!!!! I did, and was rudely surprised soon after the first strip was ripped off. Yikes! Maybe I did it wrong or maybe it works for other parts but as far as I&#x27;m concerned the &amp;#34;no&amp;#34; in no scream cream was irrelevant.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I have extra sensitive skin but OUCH!!!!!!!!! For some reason this didn&#x27;t work well on me! Perhaps a slight numbing but no major change. I tried leaving it on for 40 mins to an hour on four separate occasions. Not so happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> this product doesnt make the waxing completely painless but it is better than having nothing at all. meaning, its still gonna hurt.</li>
            <li> Maybe I didn&#x27;t give it enough time.....  but I have since purchased lidocaine, and that cream is much more effective than no scream cream.  Save your money.  They did accept the return, so I give them credit for that.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work much.  Still felt lots of pain when threading the upper lip area.</li>
            <li> this product does work, it DOES not take all the pain away, but does take the edge of the pain. I do highly recommend this product if your thinking of get a Brazilian or bikini wax!</li>
            <li> Definitely relieves the pain, not 100% of the pain but it&#x27;s better than nothing. And it works a lot better than other products that claim to relieve pain and numb skin.</li>
            <li> Amazing! Truly works! The pain doesn&#x27;t completely disappear but it makes it totally bearable. Definitely buying again. Love this product!</li>
            <li> For the amount you are paying for this thing, you should be getting a much bigger tube. I do not tolerate pain well, so I bought this to use before Brazilian waxes. Besides there not being enough of the product, it does not dry on clear. You do not want white stuff all over your private parts while getting a Brazilian wax because the person waxing you might think it is something else. You should also keep in mind that it will not take away ALL the pain, but you will feel it less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I find the pain technology wipes that come with some Sally Hansen waxing products to be more effective.</li>
            <li> I have used this product 4 times now so that I could give a fair review. Waxing is still uncomfortable after using it, but when I did not use it I did notice that it hurt.</li>
            <li> Is it me?? I applied an hr before my wax and still felt pain hugh...will give it another try but it did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> This cream defnitely works as long as you apply it 45 minutes to an hour before your procedure.  I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> u gotta wait for like 20 minutes after u apply it to be able to feel a difference...but its not a big difference. i would suggest using ice and takin some kinnda pain medication beforehand if u wanna feel a huge difference.</li>
            <li> First time getting a wax I used this and it hurt... but not 1/2 as bad as I thought it would and the second wax with this had almost no pain! I have never waxed with out it and honestly, I never will!!!! It is a must buy for Brazilian waxers!!</li>
            <li> This stuff really worked to dull the sting of a bikini wax! I applied a thin layer for an hour prior to my wax, showered it off just prior to going to my appointment. It is definitely worth the $!!!!</li>
            <li> So this cream works great to numb my skin superficially. I kind of have to use a lot of it cuz I got it for my legs so I&#x27;d be able to finally use my epilator. It really doesn&#x27;t take long to feel (or should I say not feel haha) the effect of it. I&#x27;d rub it on my legs and go do something and when I realize it&#x27;s been about 20 minutes then I&#x27;m numbed. Only issue I had is that epilation still hurt. I know it&#x27;s not gonna numb ur skin as if it&#x27;s dead, u&#x27;ll still feel some sensation but not nearly as much. However, my problem lies in the fact that I have deeper pores so there&#x27;s a tad more than just a little bitty hair follicle getting plucked out. Because of that the process was still painful and I ended up shaving instead. I love the cream tho, it did as it&#x27;s supposed to do but I&#x27;m still wimpy haha. I guess I need something that numbs deeper than the surface, or perhaps I&#x27;ll just try waxing again since that&#x27;s quicker at removing a larger area of hair at a time. If waxing does end up being my new plan of action I&#x27;d definitely get this product again cuz I&#x27;m positive it would make it a more bearable experience.</li>
            <li> To be fair, you&#x27;re asking for a little pain with waxing, regardless of how effective a cream is.  That being said, I noticed NO difference, whatsoever, and made sure to use as-directed.  I&#x27;ve had multiple tattoos and piercings, and I know my pain tolerance is high for these types of things, and I&#x27;m not saying it was &amp;#34;excruciating&amp;#34; either way.  But the difference just wasn&#x27;t noticeable for me, esp. not enough to where I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> I also took an Xanex for my nerves but over all the &#x27;No Scream Cream&#x27; did exactly what it was suppose to do, help relieve the pain on the site of where the waxing was suppose to take place.  I would definitely recommend this products to others as I did so to the technician whom performed my Brazilian, this way she can pass along this cream to her other clients - that&#x27;s how satisfied I am!  Thank You &#x27; No Scream Cream&#x27; for making my waxing that more bearable.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this product to work , really. But it did nothing. I followed the instructions properly, even did it a few different times and nothing feels just like without it. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Didnt really do much, might have taken the edge off a little. It also left a little white residue that i couldnt get off. Came really fast though</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect for this product to take the pain away completely, but I expected it to at least partially take it away because it was so expensive. It didn&#x27;t really help me at all. I left it on for an hour and a half then wiped it off right before my procedure. I scratched my skin with my nail and I couldn&#x27;t feel that but then when I got the laser hair removal done, it didn&#x27;t help at all. The lady that lasers me recommended this. I personally would not buy it again for laser hair removal. It might be different for waxing.</li>
            <li> This was my second time get a bikini wax.  The first time, all I can say is OUCH!  I was going to go Brazillian, but could not finish.  I ordered this product and did as directed by others, applied about an hour and a half before and then a half hour before I had to leave to go get waxed.  I still felt the pull and had a slight ouch when the hairs were ripped out, but with pain I could handle.  I did not do the complete area yet, I wanted to try it out first and see how this product worked.  Next time, I will be applying to all areas, except a landing strip, and see if I can get the lady garden almost completely waxed.  I also think that even though the tube is small, I will have enough for at least two more waxes before I have to get a new tube.  So, I would highly recommended this product.</li>
            <li> this stuff is small and expensive which could be justified if it did anything that it said it would instead of just globing up on me. I have given this stuff a couple tries with no change. don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> it works................. just take the time to read what to do it will help</li>
            <li> The cream was decent. It doesn&#x27;t completely numb but it helps if you follow the directions correctly, otherwise it doesn&#x27;t properly numb and the cream is wasted. I would recommend this cream for sensitive areas if you absolutely do not want to deal with the pain of waxing :/ I don&#x27;t think the price was worth the amount in the bottle for me. But again if you NEED some kind of numbing for sensitive areas before waxing this may be the way to go!</li>
            <li> i bought this over a month ago hoping this would ease the pain.  and you know what it didnt do anything to ease the pain!!!!  you might as well put on a drugstore lotion cause thats what it pretty much is!!  i used it to epilate and man it still hurt, also its a super tiny bottle!!!!  DONT BUY THIS  the positive comments are LIERS!!!!!</li>
            <li> I like it. I truly feel like it helped with the pain just enough for me to be able to do my own bikini wax.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using this, and was very disappointed after an hour.  I still felt the sting during waxing.  Don&#x27;t recommend this at all :(</li>
            <li> Does nothing to dull pain</li>
            <li> This cream worked as intended, but I used A LOT! I probably used half of the bottle...no lie! This product + the wax + my skin &#x3D; awful rash! I&#x27;ve never gotten a rash from waxing before, but when I used this product I did. I have gotten waxed with and without this product, and I will just say this: A brazillian is NEVER a joyful experience, but with this product, it took the edge off at best. But for the price of this product, I would rather just go without. I can honestly say I will never use this product again and it&#x27;s a waste of money. The brazillian hurts for about 2 seconds, and then you are fine. I am awful with pain and I never once screamed, cried or yelped. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I used this before a tattoo on the back of my knee. Obviously, I didn&#x27;t expect it to be painless, but this cream took about 50% of the pain away and made it surprisingly tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;For people who have tried Lidocaine based creams and had little luck, give this a try. I&#x27;ve used up to 8% Lidocaine and it didn&#x27;t help at all.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you apply a thick layer and cover with saran wrap to keep the heat in!</li>
            <li> Hardly felt a thing during my first wax when I used this stuff. It is expensive for the amount but it is absolutely worth it. Definitely be careful to follow the directions if you want it to work properly.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work. I followed the directions and still screamed. In fact, I&#x27;m not sure I felt any less pain that I would have without the cream. I stopped using it because it only delayed me in the process.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t end up needing a numbing cream for my epilator, but I did use once to try. Worked well- not completely numb, but took edge off.</li>
            <li> Did about what I thought it would</li>
            <li> It made my skin so greasy that the wax wouldn&#x27;t stick to it.  I honestly didn&#x27;t notice any numbing either.</li>
            <li> Great product for the pain of waxing that area.  It is really a great price too.  As long as you follow instructions, it will make that process much more enjoyable!</li>
            <li> It works for me! Can&#x27;t live without it</li>
            <li> I ordered it because it had good reviews. I followed the instructions to a T n it just didn&#x27;t numb me at all not even a little bit. Thank goodness I&#x27;m a trooper n still waxed without my lady parts being numb... Don&#x27;t waste your money n find other ways to ease the pain like a pain pill or a beer or something.. good luck!</li>
            <li> I have tryed many products but this is the best numming cream by far, iv been using it for years</li>
            <li> Used on my face before using an epilator. Numbed it ok but still felt quite a bit of pain with hair removal. Not a significant enough lessening to warrant the long lasting effects of the numbness. Maybe better for waxing...</li>
            <li> This helped the pain but only took the edge off getting a bikini wax. I wish that this product had better directions but it was pretty easy to figure out.</li>
            <li> Great item, barely any pain. Makes waxing tolerable.</li>
            <li> Wow this stuff really works. I&#x27;ve had three Brazilian waxes without this cream. Each one worse and more painfully than the last. Finally I discovered this cream and my fourth wax was almost pain free! Use a lot of cream and rub it in about 45 min before your wax, take two Advil and enjoy a wax a virtual pain free wax.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never done it without this, but my waxer has started recommending to everyone because of how it seems to work for me, and she says she can tell a big difference in their reactions to the pain. Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> O Its still painful! But this takes the edge off enough that I Will not get waxed without it! I&#x27;m on my second tube!</li>
            <li> Ladies, don&#x27;t bother - this didn&#x27;t work at all. Look for an experienced waxer who is highly recommended instead of relying on creams to relieve pain.</li>
            <li> I think it may have helped curb the pain when being \\&quot;sugared,\\&quot; but it is not a miracle drug if that is what one might be expecting. Try it, though, and see how it works for you.</li>
            <li> It didnt work. This was my first time getting a wax done and i left this product on for a hour and 1/2 and it did nothing for the waxing pain.</li>
            <li> Brazilians are painful, no if&#x27;s ands or buts. But.. I may as well have applied hand cream because it did not numb any of the area. I tried on my arm, hand etc., did not rub in like recommended, and not even a tingle after 15 - 20 minutes.The cream does not absorb on its own, it just sits there. Would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I hate shaving in winter.  You get done, everything looks fantastic, then you walk out the door and BAM!  Your legs look like Sasquatch&#x27;s pits TWELVE FRIGGIN&#x27; MINUTES after you just shaved them.  So I decided to grow a pair of ovaries and epilate this winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be honest with you - I am not the type of person who can handle pain.  Maybe my brain doesn&#x27;t have that part installed.  Whatev&#x27;s.  I cannot wax without some kind of pain relief.  Since my doctor would not put me under twilight anesthesia, I purchased the No Scream Cream for the hair removal.  Now, let&#x27;s be reasonable.  No force on Earth is going to remove the pain from waxing or epilating.  You&#x27;re tearing hair out by the roots from the layers of epidermis BELOW the top layer, which is where you would be applying this cream to.  I noticed a reduction of approximately forty percent-enough to get my legs completely hair-free, though I might have invented a few new curse words in the process.  It made the process bearable.  For that, I give it four stars.  I would have given it five, but I felt that $20 for an ounce of this stuff was too much.  It was vastly oversold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For what it&#x27;s worth.  Your mileage may vary.  Individual pain thresholds tend to do that.  If you&#x27;re a wuss, this might help you make it through a waxin&#x27;.  If you&#x27;re a complete BAMF, you should be good to roll.  Then again, you probably wouldn&#x27;t need a topical anesthetic in the first place.</li>
            <li> I bought this for bikini waxes and it definitely took the edge off. I put it on about 30 minutes before my appointment and then I wipe off any residue before the actual waxing happens. Your esthetician (sp?) should ask you to wipe down that area anyway for sanitary reasons. I also recently used it when my 7 yr old was getting her ears pierced for the first time. It definitely numbs. Not completely but just enough!</li>
            <li> This product did very little for me. I&#x27;ve read others say it &amp;#34;takes the edge off.&amp;#34; I can kinda see that but it was enough decrease in pain to justify spending money on this each time I get waxed. Id say it took the pain level from a 10 to an 8. Very little difference and still very painful.</li>
            <li> I think that it is unanimous that the process of violently ripping out hair at potentially the most sensitive part of the human body will just simply be unpleasant. After my first Brazilian, I was intrigued to test out this product and I can honestly say the second time was significantly better because I used this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s still unpleasant, and by no means will it be pain free, but to some extent, the product delivers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars because Brazilian&#x27;s are still a horrendous and dreaded experience for me. Perhaps if it came with an anesthesiologist, I would give it 5.</li>
            <li> Just trust me! Get it! I ordered this for my very first full Brazilian and my oh my did it make a difference! Here&#x27;s how I knew: I was skeptical about the cream so when I had it on, I didn&#x27;t think much of it. The wax felt like a pinch. Literally. The second time, I forgot the cream, so I popped a painkiller 45 minutes before the wax and the wax still wasn&#x27;t bad. There was a major difference between cream and pill, but I didn&#x27;t want to scream or anything. The third time I got brave and decided to go without anything. I screamed. It really, really hurt. I know we all have different thresholds for pain but GET THIS CREAM!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be able to do Brazilian Waxing without this little gem! There are a couple of tricks though, to be successful and get the most out of it. First, you must really slather it on nice and thick. Also, it must be allowed to dry(dries quickly) and all of this must be done about 45 minutes prior to your service. I then wear loose fitting clothing to my appointment so not to disturb the area too much, though it does soak in completely so this may not be necessary...hope this helps!</li>
            <li> It was easy to apply &amp; it worked great. I didn&#x27;t feel a thing after I used it. Great product!</li>
            <li> Even though I read mixed reviews I decided to give this product a try. Anything is worth a try when it comes to the pain of Brazilian waxing. The first time I tried it I followed the instructions on the tube but didn&#x27;t feel any difference in the amount of pain. Before counting it as a loss, I decided to give it another shot. This time I rubbed the cream in a bit more. I had been hesitant to rub it in a lot the first time since it states that there should be a layer of cream on the skin, and it&#x27;s not meant to be absorbed like moisturizer. But on my second attempt I decided to rub it in somewhat more, but not so much that it was completely absorbed. That seemed to help. It did dull the pain for the most part. However, the areas that are particularly sensitive did not receive much benefit. It was still super painful in those areas. In defense of the product, I have very sensitive skin. I probably shouldn&#x27;t be waxing but I find that my skin tolerates the long-term effects of waxing much better than the effects of shaving, so I do it anyway. I think this is a case-by-case situation. The cream probably works well for people with less sensitive skin but is less effective for those of us with highly reactive or sensitive skin. If you can afford it, you may want to give it a shot, but I wouldn&#x27;t have high expectations. Even if it works really well for you, you are still going to experience some pain. That&#x27;s simply the reality of waxing.</li>
            <li> Worked as advertised - I didn&#x27;t feel nearly as much pain during my brazilian wax as everyone had said.  I will definitely use this for future waxes.</li>
            <li> While the ladies may like it for cosmetic usage, I find that it takes the edge of saddle soreness when you ride your bike in 750-3000 mile races and randonnées. It recently saved a friend&#x27;s behind from total disaster when the going got tough after 600 miles in the saddle. While my more stupid friends laugh that this is &#x27;girl stuff &#x27; when they see the label, I find that it&#x27;s better priced than similar benzocaine formulations for &#x27;manly men&#x27; ( &#x3D; the stupid friends), with the same active ingredient.</li>
            <li> Extremely expensive for the amount of cream, seriously the bottle is tiny!! I would NEVER purchase this again! I don&#x27;t think it really helped, but I can&#x27;t say it didn&#x27;t. I used it for the first time I have ever gotten waxed so I&#x27;m not sure if I just have a pretty good pain tolerance for that or if this helped, but come on&#x27; you&#x27;re getting waxed, it&#x27;s going to hurt regardless. This does not take enough &amp;#34;edge off&amp;#34; to justify the insane price</li>
            <li> WILL BUY AGAIN! This really does work! I had my first bikini wax (Brazillian at that) and didn&#x27;t feel a THING! I am really sensitive to pain and was nervous about trying this out. I AM SO GLAD I DID! 5 stars!!</li>
            <li> Oh thank goodness for this!!&lt;br /&gt;After reading as many articles as I could manage, this is what I now do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t drink anything with caffeine on the day of the wax. I drinks lots of water.&lt;br /&gt;I make sure I have eaten, because everything hurt more when you are hungry.&lt;br /&gt;I use this cream before.&lt;br /&gt;I take ibuprofen before and after&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically recommend anything let alone write a review, but I avoid getting a Brazilian wax due to the pain.  So, I tried this no scream cream....I won&#x27;t ever miss an appointment again!! I was pain free! Great product highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> It leaves alot of residue and you still feel the pain. Also, not worth the money or time that it takes to put it on.</li>
            <li> Not worth it at all! Made the wax more slippery and just made it worse. No numbing feeling at all even when applied 45 minutes prior to wax.</li>
            <li> I went yesterday to get my first Brazilian Wax so I ordered this cream and thank GOD it came in the night before - whew.  I put it on 45 mins before.  BTW - My only other major waxing experience was a full leg and bikini wax and it was over the top PAINFUL.  I thought never again.  And here I was scheduling torture down there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really skeptical if this cream could a) not burn the nether regions b) truly numb me so I could tolerate the FULL MONTY.  Well, let me tell you, I am a HUGE ninny when it comes to pain.  However, when she started I braced for this horrible horrible pain and was like, oh that&#x27;s not too bad.  It really wasn&#x27;t that bad for a first-timer.  Yeah, down in the more sensitive areas it smarted a few times, but it was NOTHING like I had dreamed up in my mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yes, I am a believer in this wonderful cream and yes I will continue with the Brazilian using this cream.  It was worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I still felt the slightest tinge of pain, it did not even take the edge off.  Not worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Did not work at all. I tried a couple of times, applied different amounts each time for different time lengths but the pain is just the same as without it.</li>
            <li> Sorry this product did not work at all for me. I was hoping for it to at least take some of the edge off a Brazilian wax but it did not work. I was able to do my legs, underarms, and stomach with NO cream. So I would say I am not a total wuss when it comes to pain. However, the Brazilian is on an a whole other level. I bought this cream hoping it would help but I was not able to even complete the Brazilian session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers say it helped with the edge..Not for me. The cost was high for 1 oz of cream and did not work for me. I would recommend looking for another product.</li>
            <li> I used it last time i went for a wax and it did help but wasn&#x27;t a miracle. I noticed the pain went away really fast too</li>
            <li> Unless you think in your mind that this would make u feel better even waxing r, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. IT DOESN&#x27;T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really make that big of a difference.</li>
            <li> Truly reduces skin pain, regardless of what the issue is. Give it a short while to take effect and it will get the job done. This is the same active ingredient to stop pain and itching as in big brand name female products, save a bundle, compare labels and try this stuff. Also, it has virtually no fragrance which is great, al the other products we tried had very strong fragrances which associates with pain and makes the products less desirable to use.</li>
            <li> I wax and have been waxing for awhile now, but I was looking for something to take the edge off waxing my bikini area, thought this would work. I followed the directions. Didn&#x27;t rub the product all the way into my skin (allowed it to be absorbed, like instructed) even left it on for 5 min. longer than recommended. This product didn&#x27;t do ANYTHING but make a mess and take up my time, because it didn&#x27;t numb or even take the edge off. Will NOT be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Works great!! Did not stain or leave anything ony clothes!!  A bigger tube for the price would be nice!</li>
            <li> I got this to ease some pain for when I get my eye brows done and IT DID NOT work AT ALL. And I&#x27;m sure it would do NOTHING for a brazilian as well. I was really looking forward to this product easing my pain even a little bit and nope it let me down completely. I wasn&#x27;t counting on this product to take ALL the pain away but even just a little bit would have been okay. Definitely would not consider buying it if I had known...</li>
            <li> I recently ordered this product because I wanted to see if it would ease my bikini wax experience. This product is not going to take all the pain away as if one was having a medical procedure. What this does if used correctly is lighten the affects. Allow plenty of time between placing this in the area you need and do not rub it into the skin as if your putting lotion on. Give at least 45 minutes or more for it to work. Keep in mind this in not a professional medical grade numbing cream. My experience from using this was good. I did feel some pulling, but it most certainly was nothing in comparison to not using it.&lt;br /&gt; I did not have a problem using this and thought it helped.</li>
            <li> 15 bucks in the garbage</li>
            <li> I always use and recommend this product to help take the sting out of waxing. Dries clear and no need to rinse off, even with soy-based wax products.</li>
            <li> It takes the edge off for waxing, but it still hurts like a mofo.  Numbfast (also sold on Amazon) worked WAY better for me.  Like, not even a comparison.  I applied both exactly the same, applied liberally, cover in saran/cling wrap for 45-60 mins while my wax heated, wipe off, and get to waxing.  I will be using Numbfast for now on.  I am able to wax myself with Numbfast without bunching a washcloth between my teeth.  ;)  No scream cream is 20% benzocaine and Numbfast is 5% lidocaine.</li>
            <li> Used this before using my epilator. It does take at least 45 minutes to an hour to totally numb the area, and I did have to use quite a bit but that might be because I am a total wimp. When waxing or using an epilator you will need to wipe the cream off as it leaves a residue but don&#x27;t worry, the area will stay numb for about 10 minutes after re,icing the cream. If you are going to a salon to be waxed just take a facial cleansing cloth or wet wipe to get it off</li>
            <li> My aesthetician swears by this stuff and well, now I know why. Spread on a nice coat before waxing and you wont feel nearly anything. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;ll make waxing painless, but it greatly reduces the pain/sting.</li>
            <li> After many bikini waxes, I was very excited to purchase a product to make the experience less painful. The directions vaguely state: &amp;#34;Once the cream is thick and white, STOP, Do not rub in. It will absorb on it&#x27;s own.&amp;#34; It does NOT absorb. Not to be graphic, but when you are growing out your hair for weeks at a time before a wax, the last thing you want is thick, gross lotion on it for the aesthetician to have to deal with. When I first tried it, the person doing my wax immediately wiped it off with a wet cloth and advised me to never use it again. I explained to her that it was supposed to have been absorbed by then and apologized. So embarrassing. The second and last time, I applied it over an hour before, thinking it just needed more time. I got the same results and had to wipe it all off before getting to the salon. So, in conclusion, I spent $20 on lotion that went into the garbage, and my waxes have been just as painful as ever. DO NOT BUY THIS.</li>
            <li> I used it on my legs and let it sit for more than 45 minutes before my wax appointment. Still hurt extremely. I don&#x27;t feel like this cream did anything for the pain.</li>
            <li> This product does not help with the laser hair removal.  I have not tried it with waxing though.</li>
            <li> does not work. not even a little. I followed the instructions very carefully, and nothin! Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Works we&#x27;ll, still pain but def lessens the pain. And you really have to wait 20-30 minutes before waxing to let it sink in</li>
            <li> I decided to get my first brazilian wax and knew I needed something to at least knock the edge off. After doing some research I decided to purchase this.  I followed the directions to the T and nothing happened.  I wasn&#x27;t slightly numb . I felt everything.  I later thought I uses it wrong and tried it again this time leaving it on a little but longer and still nothing</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I used this the second time I got a brazilian and I could really tell the difference (my first time I used something from Sally&#x27;s that really didn&#x27;t do anything). Of course there is still some discomfort but I would recommend this over not using anything at all. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> After reading review I really thought this would work for me sadly all it did was waste 45 minutes of my time.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT , the first time I aplied this cream didnt work as I was expecting but the second time was wonderful because I didnt feel any pain in wax session . You need to applied it at least 45 min before .</li>
            <li> I use this once a month before every wax appointment (for my legs) and it truly does take the edge off.  Nothing will completely take the wax sting out of it, but this sure does make it more tolerable.  I won&#x27;t go without it.</li>
            <li> Will not completely take away the pain but it does take the edge off. I never wax without it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried brazillian waxing without it and it was so incredibly painful. So I decided to give this cream a try. I must say, If you follow the instructions (and also take two paracetamols an hour before your wax)... it will reduce the pain significantly.  I am not saying there is no pain but it does reduce it by 80% in my opinion. The most painful part of waxing is the top part and I hardly felt it! I now think that the reason I felt a bit of a sting in other parts is because I was not able to apply the cream very well in harder to see/reach places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lady doing my wax said it was a bit more difficult to wax me because of the cream but that being said.... she was able to do the job perfectly anyway. It just took about 10 minutes longer. I didn&#x27;t mind laying there longer than normal because it was not a painful experience at all. In fact after the session I said &amp;#34;It doesn&#x27;t hurt, I could do this everyday!&amp;#34;</li>
