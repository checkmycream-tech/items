            <li>No it doesn&#x27;t attract people, but it smells really nice, floral and fruity, so I really enjoyed it</li>
            <li>Nice compliments and great smell this oil is great for that extra touch of scent clean and refreshing and not overpowering</li>
            <li>Been using Pure Instinct for about 10 years, it  is great.</li>

            <li>It lasts for a while when used appropriately.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t do better than that.  </li>
            <li>I love the fragrance myself and it turns the ladies on.</li>
            <li>some fruity, some powdery, some musky, some fresh and bright.</li>
            <li>love to put a bit over my fragrance and let them mingle.</li>
            <li>On me it&#x27;s more of a musk scent and on my wife</li>
            <li>This was an OK product, based on the smell.</li>
            <li>For me the verdict is still out, I have used it alone and also with one of my favorite colognes.  </li>
            <li>so it was not shocking to get compliments when I wore it with my cologne.  </li>
            <li>it makes them touchy feely :)</li>
            <li>But way better price...</li>
            <li>my husband did not noticed no one noticed or started talking to me more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s awesome for attracting the opposite sex!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT.......</li>
            <li>to you very so friendly well</li>
            <li>But it smelled GREAT on each woman, tailored to her own personal essence.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received very quickly</li>
            <li>However, if you already receive a lot of attention or just want something that smells good, it&#x27;s a decent product.</li>
            <li>Great product I would really recommend.. Works very well!</li>
            <li>SIMPLE GREAT.</li>
            <li>The shipping was pretty fast and this stuff smells sooooo good.</li>
            <li>Ordered the first time from an at-home party and ran out, then found out my \\&quot;hostess\\&quot; was not selling any more products.  </li>
            <li>who&lt;br /&gt;are quite friendly as conversations start and one touched my backside&lt;</li>
            <li>Sweet, fruity, bubble-gum flavor.</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s super cool.</li>
            <li>works great with other products.</li>
            <li>This could be more of a placebo effect in peoples minds thinking it is more than it actually is.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS SCENT AND WOULD RECOMEND IT FOR ANYONE WHO WANT SOMETHING NEW.</li>
            <li>This worked exactly as it said it would!</li>
            <li>It is AMAZING how different it smelled on hundreds of women...</li>
            <li>The scent has an amazing smell and smells differently on everyone.</li>
            <li>I used to sell this product (for 2.5x the cost) at fun parties.</li>
            <li>The effects seem to last all day and the fragrance is a nice compliment.</li>
            <li>Has a nice, fruity-like smell... but doesn&#x27;t really last.</li>
            <li>Go buy your Pure Instinct today!</li>
            <li>I used Pure Instinct before in college after I bought it at a fun party.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for about a month and on the 3rd day I realized that it made my wife more affectionate towards me.</li>
            <li>Anyways, some of the experiences i&#x27;ve attained from it is more stares, winks, friendliness, and also an overall confidence in myself.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s attracted both sexes and have people definitely become more chatty with me.</li>
            <li>So I would say get a bottle if you are curious if nothing else you&#x27;ll smell nice.</li>
            <li>but especially dogs are also very friendly</li>
            <li>I love that the smell is not loud and it stays on all day.</li>
            <li>I bought pure instinct out of curiosity, but I do like its fruitiness.  </li>
            <li>The scent is nice, however just a little too much and it becomes overpowering.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>it got here fast from the shipper</li>
            <li>and it seems to have the same appealing effect now that I&#x27;m in my early 30s.  </li>
            <li>Ok so I bought this product and received it about a week ago since my other one ran out.</li>
            <li>Bottle currently 1/3 full.</li>
            <li>Alone, it is okay and the lasting strength is not very long.  </li>
            <li>This product really does work, as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  </li>
            <li>This scent is fruity, I&#x27;m not too much of a fan for fruity scents, but this is not a bad scent, I looked at other reviews, about how the scent changes</li>
            <li>Great smell doesn&#x27;t last long, Equal to the other products it&#x27;s compared to</li>
            <li>, I just wish it was a little bit more citric or if the company will have a another similar product but with a little bit more citric smell.</li>
            <li>It really makes people act different tho.</li>
            <li>Either way it&#x27;s well worth the $7 or so dollars spent on it</li>
            <li>but I do like the fragrance...very light and subtle...</li>
            <li>if you put too much you like like a shiny oily mess.</li>
            <li>It has a light scent that disappears into the skin after a few hours, but I still put a little on every day.</li>
            <li>as for the pheremone factor, I have experienced a few instances where it drove someone crazy.</li>

            <li> as for the pheremone factor, I have experienced a few instances where it drove someone crazy.</li>
            <li> It is a soft sweet fruity almost smell but not to weird a guy can&#x27;t wear it</li>
            <li> I would have everyone dab some on and then we would all take turns smelling each other about ten minutes later.</li>
            <li> You get noticed more and instead of getting the cold shoulder people spend a min to get to know you.</li>
            <li> Not overpowering, lasts fairly long.</li>
            <li> Remember to apply to \\&quot;hot spots\\&quot; such as the wrists, neck &amp; behind the ears.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line, the scent is great, the bottle it comes in frankly sucks really bad.</li>
            <li> If i go to the park or a cat from a on ramp at a stop sign and a female coming down</li>
            <li> I only use a little bit, because that&#x27;s all you need for it to take effect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about the actual pheromone effect</li>
            <li> i gave it a four because using it as an additive to my other sents, it gives my homemade cologne</li>
            <li> I love to use this as a base for any other scent I am putting on.  </li>
            <li> The smell doesn&#x27;t stick for long, however (usually goes away within 45 minutes to an hour)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m crossing or down town</li>
            <li> I feel as though it gives that little boost that we need at times.</li>
            <li> Not worth the effort to apply!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time and money.</li>
            <li> but you have those angry people in busy places</li>
            <li> However, not sure I would</li>
            <li> if you think women are going to throw themselves at you, wake up!,it&#x27;s morning and your late for work...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have problems with people not paying attention to me or being mean</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product twice and each time now the cap has either broken off or slips.</li>
            <li> I read that it gets weird after a while, and so I store it in the refrigerator.</li>
            <li> Horrible product and</li>
            <li> is some of the worst packaging for a scent i&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li> The cap is the worst part, it&#x27;s a plastic cap that screws onto a glass bottle.</li>
            <li> this smeels horrible, do yoursels a favor dont buy this,</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love the way this product smells. It lasts for a while when used appropriately. I feel as though it gives that little boost that we need at times. Love it.</li>
            <li> This product really does work, as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  Ordered the first time from an at-home party and ran out, then found out my \\&quot;hostess\\&quot; was not selling any more products.  A friend told me it was on here, and voila~ same product and cheaper~  Can&#x27;t do better than that.  Fast shipping.  Will order again.</li>
            <li> This scent is fruity, I&#x27;m not too much of a fan for fruity scents, but this is not a bad scent, I looked at other reviews, about how the scent changes so I am going to give it a try to see, how it turns out and I will send another post if it is Yay or Nay.</li>
            <li> I bought pure instinct out of curiosity, but I do like its fruitiness.  I read that it gets weird after a while, and so I store it in the refrigerator.</li>
            <li> This perfume has a great smell. It&#x27;s easy to apply and the sense stays with you for a great period of time. People should try it for themselves.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet, but let&#x27;s hope it does what it should. Smells great though. I would recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> Horrible product and it doesn&#x27;t even work. I bought it for kicks to see if my husband would notice and nothing happened. Don&#x27;t waste your time and money.</li>
            <li> Been using Pure Instinct for about 10 years, it  is great. I love the fragrance myself and it turns the ladies on.</li>
            <li> I used to sell this product (for 2.5x the cost) at fun parties. I would have everyone dab some on and then we would all take turns smelling each other about ten minutes later. It is AMAZING how different it smelled on hundreds of women...some fruity, some powdery, some musky, some fresh and bright. But it smelled GREAT on each woman, tailored to her own personal essence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love to put a bit over my fragrance and let them mingle. It&#x27;s awesome...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as for the pheremone factor, I have experienced a few instances where it drove someone crazy. No one could put their finger on it, but they all said they couldn&#x27;t get enough. Especially when I added a drop to my hair shine serum. OMG, I had men with their faces in my hair sniffing telling me how beautiful i smelled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very nice indeed.</li>
            <li> I used Pure Instinct before in college after I bought it at a fun party.  I really liked it then and it seems to have the same appealing effect now that I&#x27;m in my early 30s.  I only use a couple of dabs but that&#x27;s all it takes. The effects seem to last all day and the fragrance is a nice compliment.</li>
            <li> Sweet, fruity, bubble-gum flavor. Not overpowering, lasts fairly long. Given my circumstances, I have no idea if it has magical pheromone powers, but it is a nice unisex scent.</li>
            <li> This does smell good, But its just not for me,My friends love it. The price you can&#x27;t beat.&lt;br /&gt; My sister loved it she wears it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect it to have women flocking around me but it smells good. On me it&#x27;s more of a musk scent and on my wife it&#x27;s fruity smelling. Either way it&#x27;s well worth the $7 or so dollars spent on it and it was in my box within 4 days (over weekend period).&lt;br /&gt; 4 stars because no women have thrown theirselves to me. Lol</li>
            <li> Nice compliments and great smell this oil is great for that extra touch of scent clean and refreshing and not overpowering</li>
            <li> I only wish I could say this did anything! Not worth the effort to apply! I&#x27;m giving the product to a friend. Maybe she will have a different experience.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about a month and on the 3rd day I realized that it made my wife more affectionate towards me.</li>
            <li> This was an OK product, based on the smell. The smell doesn&#x27;t stick for long, however (usually goes away within 45 minutes to an hour) and I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in my sex appeal -- so it won&#x27;t do you &amp;#34;wonders&amp;#34; for your dating/sex life. However, if you already receive a lot of attention or just want something that smells good, it&#x27;s a decent product. Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> I love to use this as a base for any other scent I am putting on.  Helps hold the fragrance longer and the light sultry scent it gives off is perfect.</li>
            <li> it is a great product love the way it smells it got here fast from the shipper had no problems at all</li>
            <li> The scent is nice, however just a little too much and it becomes overpowering. the bottle and cap it comes with is some of the worst packaging for a scent i&#x27;ve ever seen. I&#x27;ve bought this product twice and each time now the cap has either broken off or slips. The cap is the worst part, it&#x27;s a plastic cap that screws onto a glass bottle. That obviously doesn&#x27;t work when you&#x27;re dealing with cologne, the cologne would act like a lubricant and allow for the cap to loosen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, the scent is great, the bottle it comes in frankly sucks really bad.</li>
            <li> For me the verdict is still out, I have used it alone and also with one of my favorite colognes.  I get compliments on my cologne anyway so it was not shocking to get compliments when I wore it with my cologne.  Alone, it is okay and the lasting strength is not very long.  This could be more of a placebo effect in peoples minds thinking it is more than it actually is.  As I said, I am unsure of this product and that is the review I want to leave.  This product did not demonstrate anything that made me personally believe in it yet.  Bottle currently 1/3 full.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband, smelt it &amp; kept it for myself, lol. Its great, got alot of complements.</li>
            <li> This smells amazing. I&#x27;m not sure about the actual pheromone effect but it&#x27;s super cool. Smells a bit different on everyone.</li>
            <li> This worked exactly as it said it would! I put some on and within minutes my boyfriend was all over me!</li>
            <li> Great product I would really recommend.. Works very well! When I wear this with any cologne it attracts the attention of females around me weather it&#x27;s at school or a close female friend buy it I wouldn&#x27;t lie it makes them touchy feely :)</li>
            <li> this smeels horrible, do yoursels a favor dont buy this, fi your intersted in a good phermone check into &amp;#34;Liquid Trust&amp;#34;, really good product, and amazing results</li>
            <li> Great smell doesn&#x27;t last long, Equal to the other products it&#x27;s compared to But way better price... I received very quickly</li>
            <li> Has a nice, fruity-like smell... but doesn&#x27;t really last. Still like it though. However, not sure I would but it again.</li>
            <li> Puts you in a great mood. People are nicer and pay attention. I didn&#x27;t get this for the romance aspect of it but I got it because I herd it smells amazing and lifts your mood. It is a soft sweet fruity almost smell but not to weird a guy can&#x27;t wear it but I guess that depends on the guy. It really makes people act different tho. You get noticed more and instead of getting the cold shoulder people spend a min to get to know you. I don&#x27;t have problems with people not paying attention to me or being mean but you have those angry people in busy places and they just kind of change their mood.</li>
            <li> The shipping was pretty fast and this stuff smells sooooo good. I&#x27;ve only tried this once and it was a while ago, but I wanted to try it again. Even if it doesn&#x27;t do what it says, it will make a great body perfume.</li>
            <li> The Pure instinct is wonderful. It has a light scent that disappears into the skin after a few hours, but I still put a little on every day.</li>
            <li> Love this product, smells great. works great with other products. I love that the smell is not loud and it stays on all day.</li>
            <li> Jury is still out on if it even works...but I do like the fragrance...very light and subtle...I would buy it just for that alone.</li>
            <li> if you think women are going to throw themselves at you, wake up!,it&#x27;s morning and your late for work...i gave it a four because using it as an additive to my other sents, it gives my homemade cologne the sent of the beach...clean.</li>
            <li> Ok so I bought this product and received it about a week ago since my other one ran out. Anyways, some of the experiences i&#x27;ve attained from it is more stares, winks, friendliness, and also an overall confidence in myself. I only use a little bit, because that&#x27;s all you need for it to take effect. Remember to apply to \\&quot;hot spots\\&quot; such as the wrists, neck &amp; behind the ears. My friends definitely get touchy-feely when i wear this product and they also say \\&quot;Damnit are you wearing pheromones\\&quot;?? The scent has an amazing smell and smells differently on everyone. I feel like for me it&#x27;s attracted both sexes and have people definitely become more chatty with me. Although people may be skeptic on this product for its lack of information along with the pricing, I would say this product definitely works and has shown me results! Great for social-settings along with work! Go buy your Pure Instinct today!</li>
            <li> I bought this not knowing what to think, but it smells great on me and I get compliments when I wear it.  Now does it attract the opposite sex and all that.  I can&#x27;t say that it does, but it makes men and women tell me I smell nice.  So I would say get a bottle if you are curious if nothing else you&#x27;ll smell nice.</li>
            <li> Nice smell to it. if you put too much you like like a shiny oily mess. I have tried this numerous time and no it does not work my husband did not noticed no one noticed or started talking to me more. but a nice smell dont regret buying but i thought it would work for me.</li>
            <li> No it doesn&#x27;t attract people, but it smells really nice, floral and fruity, so I really enjoyed it, I just wish it was a little bit more citric or if the company will have a another similar product but with a little bit more citric smell.</li>
            <li> It smells different on different people! It&#x27;s awesome for attracting the opposite sex! Who would have thought that perfume could make that difference?</li>
            <li> I got this and it smells great! I got already approached by women who&lt;br /&gt;are quite friendly as conversations start and one touched my backside&lt;br /&gt;and had saied that i smelled goood i don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in tbis but it works.If i go to the park or a cat from a on ramp at a stop sign and a female coming down tbe freeway amd stoppedwere I&#x27;m crossing or down town i get her talking to me and tben it&#x27;s conversations i never had even sayed one word omg its vety funny!Well works great in bars. and talking to females who&lt;br /&gt;talk to you very so friendly well get this cologne guys ad you will not be&lt;br /&gt;sorry oh and dogs not just cats but especially dogs are also very friendly pets ars lastly drawn to&lt;br /&gt;the smell well hope this review helps well bye</li>
