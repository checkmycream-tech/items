            <li>I have very fair skin and the color is perfect.</li>
            <li>Also this product is actually good for your skin!</li>
            <li>I got the lightest shade and it matches my fair skin perfectly!</li>
            <li>I use the beige color, and I have a fair to medium skin tone - blends perfectly.</li>
            <li>It works great.  </li>
            <li>Great gift</li>
            <li>This works great</li>
            <li>If you are quite fair skinned, this shade may not be ideal for you.  </li>
            <li>I am happy to find a product without toxins that works well.</li>
            <li>Really great stuff.</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>I use their foundation, mascara, and lipstick which have also been great.</li>
            <li>This concealer works great for me.</li>
            <li>Gluten-free too, which is great for me.</li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>Wearing it all day is a joy.  </li>
            <li>This is a great price for something of this quality.</li>
            <li>The product is very nice and works well.  </li>
            <li>This makeup is amazing!</li>
            <li>I have been going thru so many products to find the best quality for the best price, these lines of cosmetics are much more pricey than drugstore finds.</li>
            <li>Fairly priced concealer with good coverage and great ingredients...</li>
            <li>The formula is great, perfect tone, smooth, can be used with foundation or without (just smudge a bit with your finger on the skin).  </li>
            <li>My skin is fair, so the light color is perfect.  </li>
            <li>The color is perfect for light skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the cover up for a good 9 months</li>
            <li>Like I said - the product is good and works well.</li>
            <li>Because looks to me a really good brand.</li>
            <li>The consistency is sort of waxy, but in a good way.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, and the coverage is excellent.</li>
            <li>It is so nourishing and good for your skin.</li>
            <li>Have loved using this for years.</li>
            <li>works well and provides good coverage</li>
            <li>and I think Ecco Bella was a good choice for me.</li>
            <li>I did a good bit of research what makeup lines were organic</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and has excellent coverage.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny if you&#x27;re concerned about putting chemicals on your skin and what to have flawless skin!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m actually very pleased.</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>I was happy to see that it covers great under my eyes and over my ruddy cheeks and the color was just right.</li>
            <li>I love the convenient tube!</li>
            <li>It stays on pretty well and would give it 5 stars if I felt it stayed on perfectly.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!!</li>
            <li>Goes on easy, lasts all day, and looks and feels great on.</li>
            <li>This works very well for me, the color is perfect for my completion, and I like the fact that it has non toxic ingredients...</li>
            <li>Nice quality product, it covers well.  </li>
            <li>Nice coverage and consistency.</li>
            <li>Did not apply as nicely as I had hoped, either.</li>
            <li>Nice feel and coverage.</li>
            <li>you are looking for a makeup that will be kind to the earth and your skin, try this.</li>
            <li>The ingredients sound very safe and good for your skin.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised to have the issue I did, though, because so many people claiming to have fair skin said it was a perfect match.  </li>
            <li>This works great and offers great coverage.</li>
            <li>Love LOVE Eco Bella Products!</li>
            <li>and I really loved but was not cruelty free.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been very happy with this line so far.</li>
            <li>Love love love!</li>
            <li>I knocked off a star because I did get pimples after about 2 weeks of using it on the redness around my nose, but I&#x27;m still pretty happy with this</li>
            <li>I use this mostly for my under eye area.</li>
            <li>I love the idea of this concealer but it does not meet expectations.</li>
            <li>what more can you ask</li>
            <li>I love the eccobella products (I have the eyeliner, mascara and powder)</li>
            <li>will surely re order it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I love this Ecco Bella cover stick.  </li>
            <li>I love it üòç</li>
            <li>sticky ,no chemicals on your keeping it healthy :) .</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I had never tried this and found that I really love the coverage and ease of use.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this cover stick.</li>
            <li>just wish there were more color options</li>
            <li>Hopefully it will work better for you.</li>
            <li>I thought I ordered Medium Beige, but received Beige, but it&#x27;s OK.  </li>
            <li>Not on,y is it better for me but works as well as its &amp;#34;dirtier&amp;#34; cousins.</li>
            <li>It is a nice creamy concealer, goes on smoothly but need to set with powder.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for my Eastern Asian skin.</li>
            <li>Love this concealer.</li>
            <li>I love it ladies a must have.</li>
            <li>Like the product but needs to be made better where it is usable.</li>
            <li>I have tried most concealers.  </li>
            <li>I love the consistency of this concealer.</li>
            <li>Wish there was a more neutral undertone option.</li>
            <li>This product came on time, I was very excited to try it on.</li>
            <li>very creamy and easy to apply and feels really great on the skin</li>
            <li>It makes the concealer stay put and not absorb right in, helping with coverage for pimples where you need the concealer to kind of &amp;#34;sit&amp;#34; on top of the skin.</li>
            <li>So glad there are lead-free makeup options available.  </li>
            <li>I mostly used this for around my eyes and it does a wonderful job at covering dark circles</li>
            <li>Ok it&#x27;s smooth</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much to get good coverage.</li>
            <li>But for my purposes, as I do not break out pretty much ever (I know, lucky), it has been perfect.</li>
            <li>It covers well, and blends with my skin easily.</li>
            <li>I buy Ecco Bella lipsticks and the paper wrapped around them is just easily ripped off.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t go on easily.  </li>
            <li>easy to use and get coverage</li>
            <li>This is not only a great product but also safe for me to use.</li>
            <li>It is also easy to apply with your fingers or a concealer brush, which I use.</li>
            <li>I cannot use it and the stick melts easily (which I could live with for a good concealer that isn&#x27;t loaded with chemicals).</li>
            <li>It is light and goes on easy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not as much of a fan of their lipsticks, but love the rest!</li>
            <li>but if your light on the pressure you will be fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m light skinned, and ordered the medium.</li>
            <li>Feels  smooth</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for years and it used to cost $11 in a health food store, then over time, went up to $14 and recently $18, so I was happy to buy it from Amazon for $14.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping to find another cruelty free option that goes on easier.</li>
            <li>Use a mini real-hair bamboo brush to apply and lightly blend with end of brush or finger.  </li>
            <li>medium to light skin.</li>
            <li>bought this cover up in beige and because there weren&#x27;t may colors available</li>
            <li>I feel comfortable applying this on my face and around my eyes.</li>
            <li>Really like this natural product - goes on smoothly and has good staying power!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for super pale women like me.</li>
            <li>works okay, but doesn&#x27;t do too good of a job covering up a dark sun spot I have.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good for blemishes , but needs to be reapplied several times a day, and set with powder.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin with golden undertones and this makeup is more of a pink (cool or neutral) undertone.  </li>
            <li>Nice natural cover up.</li>
            <li>The coverage was not bad.. used it to cover my blemishes</li>
            <li>This color (beige) has the perfect yellow tint to it that counteracts my circles without being a noticeably different color than the rest of my face.</li>
            <li>It almost seems as if the sticker that seals the cover up is stuck on with super glue.</li>
            <li>, my skin tone is warm (i&#x27;m really light with yellow undertones)</li>
            <li>Love the colors and they last all day just like the cancer causing chemical filled make up brands!</li>
            <li>but it was quickly shipped after I called.</li>
            <li>I wish it wasn&#x27;t so pricey, but better ingredients cost more and I like to protect my skin from man-made chemicals when at all possible.</li>
            <li>Other wise, if you are a little less fair and have a bit more gold tone to your skin, this maybe a very good match for you.</li>
            <li>It glides on super easily with no pull, and covers very well.</li>
            <li>I had never before been able to cover my dark circles so effectively and I have tried every color corrector known.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t exactly match my color, but still was good enough.</li>
            <li>I would recomend it to anyone who wants to try something naural or those who just want an easy to apply product</li>
            <li>EXACTLY what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>It really does what it says!!</li>
            <li>easy tio aopply spreads nicely and barely accumulates in soft wrinkles!</li>
            <li>I bought it for an emergency spot treatment and it wasn&#x27;t useful.</li>
            <li>I wanted something to use around my eyes that was more natural..</li>
            <li>This product definitely has a fragrance, like a rose scent.</li>
            <li>I was on the fence with this concealer in the beginning but, after using it for several weeks, I can honestly say I had a change of heart.  </li>
            <li>My skin is medium fair with pink undertones and this is a match for my skin.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the price and investment for comfort.  </li>
            <li>I wear it with the pale powder and the bisque foundation and it works great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the greatest for covering under eye circles or other blemishes like pimples, or red cheeks.</li>
            <li>ingredient drugstore brands that actually create wrinkles and potentiallu more serious health problems. :D</li>
            <li>Tucks right into my purse...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the right color too.</li>
            <li>Works great w my skin tone, I&#x27;m pretty light but not fair.</li>
            <li>The beige was too dark for an undereye cover for someone with fair skin.</li>
            <li>I have light skin and even though it matches my skin, I feel like its a little too warm for me.</li>
            <li>I like the product very much.</li>
            <li>Over the summer, even though I am a huge fan of air conditioning, the slightly higher temps made it even softer so while I enjoy the product, it is kind of a dumb way to sell it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit dark, If I were able to redo it, I&#x27;d have selected the light.</li>
            <li>The first tube lasted me about 6 months</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel the urgency to wash chemicals off of my face the first chance I get.</li>
            <li>Not so with this, it&#x27;s an actual sticker and it took me a while to peel most of it off.  </li>
            <li>The first order was not shipped with Amazon Prime</li>
            <li>So much for purity!  </li>
            <li>They said they are aware of the sticky label problem and they are in the process of fixing it.</li>
            <li>So just make sure that your stick does not have that paper pasted over the entire tube.  </li>
            <li>This is the first product that i used from Ecco Bella.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>First off I am writing a review on my husbands account</li>
            <li>The Ecco Bella blush, cover up stick and mascara are all fabulous natural make up products.</li>
            <li>THIS is the first one that does not do that.</li>
            <li>It has only safe, non toxic ingredients.</li>
            <li>I only wish that it would come in more shades.</li>
            <li>I like the coverage, consistency, pretty much everything about this make up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it will take me a long time to use up this coverup!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a red head fair skinned person (that true pale white) and I tan in the summer, but I am pretty light colored</li>
            <li>Does really well for under eye coverups...will clunk up on dry skin or lumpy areas with blemishes, but that&#x27;s the case with most concealers</li>
            <li>It applies in a nice thin layer and blends easily.</li>
            <li>I also purchased the Ecco Bella powder in Pale and love that as well!</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t apply very well and didn&#x27;t cover very well either.</li>
            <li>Would be much happier if Ecco Bella offered a wider variety of colors.</li>
            <li>it really does the job .</li>
            <li>It works really well.  </li>
            <li>The color blends into my (light-medium) complexion and it&#x27;s very creamy.  </li>
            <li>On me, it looked very orange.  </li>
            <li>but, after playing around with it, it really does compliment my skin tone, wears well under foundation and conceals well.  </li>
            <li>really like the texture and ingredients</li>
            <li>Except it is much softer than makeup, so even after being ever so gentle when using the stick, after a couple of days it had already lost form and has gotten gunked up in the tube.</li>
            <li>Really bad!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It lasts well, but will last all day if I powder under my eyes lightly after foundation and then again after concealer.</li>
            <li>The whole thing broke off after a couple of uses.</li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s natural, but this product makes me break out and had to be applied several times a day</li>
            <li>It is worth a few more bucks.  </li>
            <li>So happy to finally have a natural alternative to my other concealers which undoubtedly pack a chemical punch.</li>
            <li>, color is nice, long lasting</li>
            <li>so i&#x27;d totally recommend it to anyone with the right skin colour!</li>
            <li>It seemed dark at first but after blending it in and using a mineral powder on top it looks natural.</li>
            <li>This was my first experience with an all natural cream coverup</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this stuff!</li>
            <li>only problem is I can&#x27;t really use it because the light shade is a little too dark for my fair complexion.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>this is one of my favorite dark cirle cover up!</li>
            <li>I really like the idea of it being a natural product.</li>
            <li>I am surprised how much i like this cover up.  </li>
            <li>But overall, I love the natural product and this is the second time I&#x27;ve bought it.</li>
            <li>I use the &amp;#34;beige&amp;#34; color all year round except for summertime where I&#x27;ll use the &amp;#34;medium-beige&amp;#34; that blends better with a tan.</li>
            <li>I use so little for it to be effective, it will last me a very long time making it worth the price a steal!</li>
            <li>Ever so slightly too yellow for certain areas of my very light skin tone</li>
            <li>I recommend the pressed powder, it easily tones down all flaws</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the one piece of make up that I don&#x27;t want to live without now.</li>
            <li>I was used to using other cover-up sticks from major brands and wanted to switch to something more natural.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive eyes and skin</li>
            <li>I like this brand because I have very sensitive skin and some products cause me to get rashes and this never has given me any problem.</li>
            <li>I am highly allergic and sensitive</li>
            <li>Oh wow!</li>
            <li>For my under eyes I usually rub the product in more so it absorbs.</li>
            <li>I really love that it&#x27;s natural and has far fewer harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>last a long time and not too drying this lasted me one year, would defintley buy againplus its ecco friendly...</li>
            <li>Recommended for natural beauty products.</li>
            <li>I have a number of allergies and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>If you are chemically sensitive, you may want to stay clear of this one.</li>
            <li>Blends well and looks natural.</li>
            <li>It covers well, blends well, and looks natural.  </li>
            <li>She has sensitive skin (redhead) and has had no problems.</li>
            <li>I do really like their foundation, however; despite the tone being different, I reorder this because of the coverage and how it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li>(see my review in ecco bella foundation natural).</li>
            <li>Works really well, but i can use it properly because the bar came broken.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>I do however have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Instead I use this cover up around my eyes and then set and buff a natural powder makeup (honey bee gardens) on the rest of my face.</li>
            <li>The stick broke early on so I have to use my finger or a brush to apply it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely more expensive, but probably worth it.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s one of the best base</li>
            <li>Under my eyes get dark and I have always had a hard time finding a good product to help cover up the under eye darkness.  </li>
            <li>This one may be a little more expensive, but you get what you pay for, in most cases.</li>
            <li>A little thick, but good coverage.</li>
            <li>This makeup is perfect for me since I don&#x27;t like to use a makeup base over my entire face.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint would be that it does settle in the fine lines under my eyes a bit, but that&#x27;s probably just the thickness of it.</li>
            <li>Only foundation I&#x27;ve used on my sensitive, acne-prone skin for the last ten years.</li>
            <li>The tube is small but it lasts a long time, no smells, states no bad stuff in it.  </li>

            <li> I have very fair skin and the color is perfect.</li>
            <li> Also this product is actually good for your skin!</li>
            <li> I got the lightest shade and it matches my fair skin perfectly!</li>
            <li> I use the beige color, and I have a fair to medium skin tone - blends perfectly.</li>
            <li> It works great.  </li>
            <li> Great gift</li>
            <li> This works great</li>
            <li> If you are quite fair skinned, this shade may not be ideal for you.  </li>
            <li> I am happy to find a product without toxins that works well.</li>
            <li> Really great stuff.</li>
            <li> Great product.  </li>
            <li> I use their foundation, mascara, and lipstick which have also been great.</li>
            <li> This concealer works great for me.</li>
            <li> Gluten-free too, which is great for me.</li>
            <li> lol.</li>
            <li> Wearing it all day is a joy.  </li>
            <li> This is a great price for something of this quality.</li>
            <li> The product is very nice and works well.  </li>
            <li> This makeup is amazing!</li>
            <li> I have been going thru so many products to find the best quality for the best price, these lines of cosmetics are much more pricey than drugstore finds.</li>
            <li> Fairly priced concealer with good coverage and great ingredients...</li>
            <li> The formula is great, perfect tone, smooth, can be used with foundation or without (just smudge a bit with your finger on the skin).  </li>
            <li> My skin is fair, so the light color is perfect.  </li>
            <li> The color is perfect for light skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the cover up for a good 9 months</li>
            <li> Like I said - the product is good and works well.</li>
            <li> Because looks to me a really good brand.</li>
            <li> The consistency is sort of waxy, but in a good way.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, and the coverage is excellent.</li>
            <li> It is so nourishing and good for your skin.</li>
            <li> Have loved using this for years.</li>
            <li> works well and provides good coverage</li>
            <li> and I think Ecco Bella was a good choice for me.</li>
            <li> I did a good bit of research what makeup lines were organic</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and has excellent coverage.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny if you&#x27;re concerned about putting chemicals on your skin and what to have flawless skin!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m actually very pleased.</li>
            <li> Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I was happy to see that it covers great under my eyes and over my ruddy cheeks and the color was just right.</li>
            <li> I love the convenient tube!</li>
            <li> It stays on pretty well and would give it 5 stars if I felt it stayed on perfectly.</li>
            <li> Enjoy!!</li>
            <li> Goes on easy, lasts all day, and looks and feels great on.</li>
            <li> This works very well for me, the color is perfect for my completion, and I like the fact that it has non toxic ingredients...</li>
            <li> Nice quality product, it covers well.  </li>
            <li> Nice coverage and consistency.</li>
            <li> Did not apply as nicely as I had hoped, either.</li>
            <li> Nice feel and coverage.</li>
            <li> you are looking for a makeup that will be kind to the earth and your skin, try this.</li>
            <li> The ingredients sound very safe and good for your skin.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised to have the issue I did, though, because so many people claiming to have fair skin said it was a perfect match.  </li>
            <li> This works great and offers great coverage.</li>
            <li> Love LOVE Eco Bella Products!</li>
            <li> and I really loved but was not cruelty free.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very happy with this line so far.</li>
            <li> Love love love!</li>
            <li> I knocked off a star because I did get pimples after about 2 weeks of using it on the redness around my nose, but I&#x27;m still pretty happy with this</li>
            <li> I use this mostly for my under eye area.</li>
            <li> I love the idea of this concealer but it does not meet expectations.</li>
            <li> what more can you ask</li>
            <li> I love the eccobella products (I have the eyeliner, mascara and powder)</li>
            <li> will surely re order it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I love this Ecco Bella cover stick.  </li>
            <li> I love it üòç</li>
            <li> sticky ,no chemicals on your keeping it healthy :) .</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I had never tried this and found that I really love the coverage and ease of use.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love this cover stick.</li>
            <li> just wish there were more color options</li>
            <li> Hopefully it will work better for you.</li>
            <li> I thought I ordered Medium Beige, but received Beige, but it&#x27;s OK.  </li>
            <li> Not on,y is it better for me but works as well as its &amp;#34;dirtier&amp;#34; cousins.</li>
            <li> It is a nice creamy concealer, goes on smoothly but need to set with powder.  </li>
            <li> Perfect for my Eastern Asian skin.</li>
            <li> Love this concealer.</li>
            <li> I love it ladies a must have.</li>
            <li> Like the product but needs to be made better where it is usable.</li>
            <li> I have tried most concealers.  </li>
            <li> I love the consistency of this concealer.</li>
            <li> Wish there was a more neutral undertone option.</li>
            <li> This product came on time, I was very excited to try it on.</li>
            <li> very creamy and easy to apply and feels really great on the skin</li>
            <li> It makes the concealer stay put and not absorb right in, helping with coverage for pimples where you need the concealer to kind of &amp;#34;sit&amp;#34; on top of the skin.</li>
            <li> So glad there are lead-free makeup options available.  </li>
            <li> I mostly used this for around my eyes and it does a wonderful job at covering dark circles</li>
            <li> Ok it&#x27;s smooth</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much to get good coverage.</li>
            <li> But for my purposes, as I do not break out pretty much ever (I know, lucky), it has been perfect.</li>
            <li> It covers well, and blends with my skin easily.</li>
            <li> I buy Ecco Bella lipsticks and the paper wrapped around them is just easily ripped off.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t go on easily.  </li>
            <li> easy to use and get coverage</li>
            <li> This is not only a great product but also safe for me to use.</li>
            <li> It is also easy to apply with your fingers or a concealer brush, which I use.</li>
            <li> I cannot use it and the stick melts easily (which I could live with for a good concealer that isn&#x27;t loaded with chemicals).</li>
            <li> It is light and goes on easy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not as much of a fan of their lipsticks, but love the rest!</li>
            <li> but if your light on the pressure you will be fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m light skinned, and ordered the medium.</li>
            <li> Feels  smooth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and it used to cost $11 in a health food store, then over time, went up to $14 and recently $18, so I was happy to buy it from Amazon for $14.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping to find another cruelty free option that goes on easier.</li>
            <li> Use a mini real-hair bamboo brush to apply and lightly blend with end of brush or finger.  </li>
            <li> medium to light skin.</li>
            <li> bought this cover up in beige and because there weren&#x27;t may colors available</li>
            <li> I feel comfortable applying this on my face and around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Really like this natural product - goes on smoothly and has good staying power!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect for super pale women like me.</li>
            <li> works okay, but doesn&#x27;t do too good of a job covering up a dark sun spot I have.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good for blemishes , but needs to be reapplied several times a day, and set with powder.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin with golden undertones and this makeup is more of a pink (cool or neutral) undertone.  </li>
            <li> Nice natural cover up.</li>
            <li> The coverage was not bad.. used it to cover my blemishes</li>
            <li> This color (beige) has the perfect yellow tint to it that counteracts my circles without being a noticeably different color than the rest of my face.</li>
            <li> It almost seems as if the sticker that seals the cover up is stuck on with super glue.</li>
            <li> , my skin tone is warm (i&#x27;m really light with yellow undertones)</li>
            <li> Love the colors and they last all day just like the cancer causing chemical filled make up brands!</li>
            <li> but it was quickly shipped after I called.</li>
            <li> I wish it wasn&#x27;t so pricey, but better ingredients cost more and I like to protect my skin from man-made chemicals when at all possible.</li>
            <li> Other wise, if you are a little less fair and have a bit more gold tone to your skin, this maybe a very good match for you.</li>
            <li> It glides on super easily with no pull, and covers very well.</li>
            <li> I had never before been able to cover my dark circles so effectively and I have tried every color corrector known.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t exactly match my color, but still was good enough.</li>
            <li> I would recomend it to anyone who wants to try something naural or those who just want an easy to apply product</li>
            <li> EXACTLY what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> It really does what it says!!</li>
            <li> easy tio aopply spreads nicely and barely accumulates in soft wrinkles!</li>
            <li> I bought it for an emergency spot treatment and it wasn&#x27;t useful.</li>
            <li> I wanted something to use around my eyes that was more natural..</li>
            <li> This product definitely has a fragrance, like a rose scent.</li>
            <li> I was on the fence with this concealer in the beginning but, after using it for several weeks, I can honestly say I had a change of heart.  </li>
            <li> My skin is medium fair with pink undertones and this is a match for my skin.</li>
            <li> It is well worth the price and investment for comfort.  </li>
            <li> I wear it with the pale powder and the bisque foundation and it works great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the greatest for covering under eye circles or other blemishes like pimples, or red cheeks.</li>
            <li> ingredient drugstore brands that actually create wrinkles and potentiallu more serious health problems. :D</li>
            <li> Tucks right into my purse...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the right color too.</li>
            <li> Works great w my skin tone, I&#x27;m pretty light but not fair.</li>
            <li> The beige was too dark for an undereye cover for someone with fair skin.</li>
            <li> I have light skin and even though it matches my skin, I feel like its a little too warm for me.</li>
            <li> I like the product very much.</li>
            <li> Over the summer, even though I am a huge fan of air conditioning, the slightly higher temps made it even softer so while I enjoy the product, it is kind of a dumb way to sell it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit dark, If I were able to redo it, I&#x27;d have selected the light.</li>
            <li> The first tube lasted me about 6 months</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel the urgency to wash chemicals off of my face the first chance I get.</li>
            <li> Not so with this, it&#x27;s an actual sticker and it took me a while to peel most of it off.  </li>
            <li> The first order was not shipped with Amazon Prime</li>
            <li> So much for purity!  </li>
            <li> They said they are aware of the sticky label problem and they are in the process of fixing it.</li>
            <li> So just make sure that your stick does not have that paper pasted over the entire tube.  </li>
            <li> This is the first product that i used from Ecco Bella.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> First off I am writing a review on my husbands account</li>
            <li> The Ecco Bella blush, cover up stick and mascara are all fabulous natural make up products.</li>
            <li> THIS is the first one that does not do that.</li>
            <li> It has only safe, non toxic ingredients.</li>
            <li> I only wish that it would come in more shades.</li>
            <li> I like the coverage, consistency, pretty much everything about this make up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it will take me a long time to use up this coverup!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a red head fair skinned person (that true pale white) and I tan in the summer, but I am pretty light colored</li>
            <li> Does really well for under eye coverups...will clunk up on dry skin or lumpy areas with blemishes, but that&#x27;s the case with most concealers</li>
            <li> It applies in a nice thin layer and blends easily.</li>
            <li> I also purchased the Ecco Bella powder in Pale and love that as well!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t apply very well and didn&#x27;t cover very well either.</li>
            <li> Would be much happier if Ecco Bella offered a wider variety of colors.</li>
            <li> it really does the job .</li>
            <li> It works really well.  </li>
            <li> The color blends into my (light-medium) complexion and it&#x27;s very creamy.  </li>
            <li> On me, it looked very orange.  </li>
            <li> but, after playing around with it, it really does compliment my skin tone, wears well under foundation and conceals well.  </li>
            <li> really like the texture and ingredients</li>
            <li> Except it is much softer than makeup, so even after being ever so gentle when using the stick, after a couple of days it had already lost form and has gotten gunked up in the tube.</li>
            <li> Really bad!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It lasts well, but will last all day if I powder under my eyes lightly after foundation and then again after concealer.</li>
            <li> The whole thing broke off after a couple of uses.</li>
            <li> Love that it&#x27;s natural, but this product makes me break out and had to be applied several times a day</li>
            <li> It is worth a few more bucks.  </li>
            <li> So happy to finally have a natural alternative to my other concealers which undoubtedly pack a chemical punch.</li>
            <li> , color is nice, long lasting</li>
            <li> so i&#x27;d totally recommend it to anyone with the right skin colour!</li>
            <li> It seemed dark at first but after blending it in and using a mineral powder on top it looks natural.</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with an all natural cream coverup</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this stuff!</li>
            <li> only problem is I can&#x27;t really use it because the light shade is a little too dark for my fair complexion.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> this is one of my favorite dark cirle cover up!</li>
            <li> I really like the idea of it being a natural product.</li>
            <li> I am surprised how much i like this cover up.  </li>
            <li> But overall, I love the natural product and this is the second time I&#x27;ve bought it.</li>
            <li> I use the &amp;#34;beige&amp;#34; color all year round except for summertime where I&#x27;ll use the &amp;#34;medium-beige&amp;#34; that blends better with a tan.</li>
            <li> I use so little for it to be effective, it will last me a very long time making it worth the price a steal!</li>
            <li> Ever so slightly too yellow for certain areas of my very light skin tone</li>
            <li> I recommend the pressed powder, it easily tones down all flaws</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the one piece of make up that I don&#x27;t want to live without now.</li>
            <li> I was used to using other cover-up sticks from major brands and wanted to switch to something more natural.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive eyes and skin</li>
            <li> I like this brand because I have very sensitive skin and some products cause me to get rashes and this never has given me any problem.</li>
            <li> I am highly allergic and sensitive</li>
            <li> Oh wow!</li>
            <li> For my under eyes I usually rub the product in more so it absorbs.</li>
            <li> I really love that it&#x27;s natural and has far fewer harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> last a long time and not too drying this lasted me one year, would defintley buy againplus its ecco friendly...</li>
            <li> Recommended for natural beauty products.</li>
            <li> I have a number of allergies and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> If you are chemically sensitive, you may want to stay clear of this one.</li>
            <li> Blends well and looks natural.</li>
            <li> It covers well, blends well, and looks natural.  </li>
            <li> She has sensitive skin (redhead) and has had no problems.</li>
            <li> I do really like their foundation, however; despite the tone being different, I reorder this because of the coverage and how it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> (see my review in ecco bella foundation natural).</li>
            <li> Works really well, but i can use it properly because the bar came broken.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> I do however have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Instead I use this cover up around my eyes and then set and buff a natural powder makeup (honey bee gardens) on the rest of my face.</li>
            <li> The stick broke early on so I have to use my finger or a brush to apply it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely more expensive, but probably worth it.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s one of the best base</li>
            <li> Under my eyes get dark and I have always had a hard time finding a good product to help cover up the under eye darkness.  </li>
            <li> This one may be a little more expensive, but you get what you pay for, in most cases.</li>
            <li> A little thick, but good coverage.</li>
            <li> This makeup is perfect for me since I don&#x27;t like to use a makeup base over my entire face.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint would be that it does settle in the fine lines under my eyes a bit, but that&#x27;s probably just the thickness of it.</li>
            <li> Only foundation I&#x27;ve used on my sensitive, acne-prone skin for the last ten years.</li>
            <li> The tube is small but it lasts a long time, no smells, states no bad stuff in it.  </li>
            <li> I was worried that I&#x27;d have to compromise quality for something with natural ingredients, but this performs just like any other brand.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a more natural made make up that was less expensive while I saved up for the other brand</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too pink or yellow,</li>
            <li> so the damage to my bank account was only dramatic the first time around when I had to buy a lot all at once.</li>
            <li> The only issue is they are a little pricey but the products seem to last well</li>
            <li> I still choose to wear it because its not too drastic and for all the other benefits mentioned above.</li>
            <li> It is slightly dry, but goes on well over moisturizer and stays on throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Requires very little for complete coverage of a 30 something woman.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate, it is soft enough to glide on, but thick enough to cover those little spots . . .</li>
            <li> just right.&lt;br /&gt;I was using the standard Maybelline concealer (medium beige)  forever, but this has less junk in it.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and am on my 2nd tube of it.</li>
            <li> Only reason I knocked it down a star was because the tube didn&#x27;t come in a box - it was completely wrapped in a horrible product lab/sticker that was a HUGE pain to get off!  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one part of a team, with the foundation and powder a little bit will go a long way.</li>
            <li> It only takes a small amount to cover.</li>
            <li> I use it to cover dark undereye circles as well and all other imperfections on my face.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for the girlfriend, it was too dark for her.</li>
            <li> My only complaint of the product, and I do hope they change it.  </li>
            <li> I was worried it would be to dark for me.</li>
            <li> It can break really easily :(</li>
            <li> I use this every day near my eyes and I do not feel bad one bit sleeping in this or using near my eyes.</li>
            <li> Works well for undereyes, less harmful chemicals here.</li>
            <li> The color is off - unless your skin is slightly orange in color.</li>
            <li> My previous concealer was a liquid</li>
            <li> and I set with a little powder, will be buying again</li>
            <li> When I open it, the stick was broken .Now</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s not full of chemicals!</li>
            <li> Usually within a few minutes my eyes are itchy and tearing up.  </li>
            <li> I usually use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love that this concealer doesn&#x27;t contain all the nasty chemicals that the drugstore brands have too.</li>
            <li> I do reapply it under my eyes at least once a day.</li>
            <li> Also, it is really thick.</li>
            <li> It is thick (it will go on tougher than a lipstick consistency)</li>
            <li> I mean it is stick coverup</li>
            <li> Gave 3 stars because the color is not a good match for me.  </li>
            <li> The stick was broken when I received it.  </li>
            <li> The only base makeup I use.  </li>
            <li> I wish they would make a larger version of this specifically for a base make up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a makeup company that I can stand behind for a while now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m unable to us it.</li>
            <li> It has already broken from the base and is now shifting inside the tube.  </li>
            <li> I hope I was wrong!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like writing bad reviews but this item was disappointing.  </li>
            <li> It is very difficult to find a foundation make up that doesn&#x27;t have fragrance to it.</li>
            <li> However Ecco Bella has  put a thick piece of paper over the tube that  leaves a STICKY DISGUSTING RESIDUE ALL OVER THE TUBE when it is removed.  </li>
            <li> But the packaging is terrible - half way though use the stick breaks at the base.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for makeup that I do not feel bad about putting on my skin.</li>
            <li> but I was disappointed by this coverup stick.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Some idiot management guy who has never used the product probably thought that one up.  </li>
            <li> The packaging however is HORRIBLE.</li>
            <li> It was horrible to try to get off</li>
            <li> I have to use disgusting &#x27;\\&quot;GOO BEGONE\\&quot; to get rid of that disgusting sticky residue.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works well for undereyes, less harmful chemicals here.</li>
            <li> I use this mostly for my under eye area. It seemed dark at first but after blending it in and using a mineral powder on top it looks natural. The only reason I&#x27;m giving it four stars is because the stick broke after a week or two. I still use it because it works well, but I hope they fix that problem.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for makeup that I do not feel bad about putting on my skin. I love the idea of this concealer but it does not meet expectations. The color is off - unless your skin is slightly orange in color. Also, it is really thick. I cannot use it and the stick melts easily (which I could live with for a good concealer that isn&#x27;t loaded with chemicals). The stick was broken when I received it.  I will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> last a long time and not too drying this lasted me one year, would defintley buy againplus its ecco friendly...what more can you ask</li>
            <li> This is the only cover up that I will buy.  It works great.  I use this, then put the flowercolor powder on, then the bronzer powder.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I love the eccobella products (I have the eyeliner, mascara and powder) but I was disappointed by this coverup stick. It didn&#x27;t apply very well and didn&#x27;t cover very well either. I bought it for an emergency spot treatment and it wasn&#x27;t useful. I recommend the pressed powder, it easily tones down all flaws</li>
            <li> Really like this natural product - goes on smoothly and has good staying power!  Only reason I knocked it down a star was because the tube didn&#x27;t come in a box - it was completely wrapped in a horrible product lab/sticker that was a HUGE pain to get off!  Recommended for natural beauty products.</li>
            <li> Fairly priced concealer with good coverage and great ingredients... only problem is I can&#x27;t really use it because the light shade is a little too dark for my fair complexion. Would be much happier if Ecco Bella offered a wider variety of colors.</li>
            <li> this is one of my favorite dark cirle cover up! easy tio aopply spreads nicely and barely accumulates in soft wrinkles! will surely re order it</li>
            <li> I went all organic, non toxic a while back. I have been going thru so many products to find the best quality for the best price, these lines of cosmetics are much more pricey than drugstore finds. This concealer has been the best I have found period. Out of all concealers, not just organic. I have the darkest under eye circles that are reddish purple. This color (beige) has the perfect yellow tint to it that counteracts my circles without being a noticeably different color than the rest of my face. Now if I use it anywhere else that is not reddish, it sticks out. But for my purposes, as I do not break out pretty much ever (I know, lucky), it has been perfect. I had never before been able to cover my dark circles so effectively and I have tried every color corrector known. I use so little for it to be effective, it will last me a very long time making it worth the price a steal!</li>
            <li> Oh wow! This makeup is amazing! Works like a dream under eyes and in the convenience of a stick. It&#x27;s perfect for carrying in your purse for touch ups. It&#x27;s not greasy and stays put all day. Also this product is actually good for your skin! No toxic chemicals and nourishing oils. I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good for blemishes , but needs to be reapplied several times a day, and set with powder. It&#x27;s ok. I&#x27;m light skinned, and ordered the medium. It&#x27;s a bit dark, If I were able to redo it, I&#x27;d have selected the light.</li>
            <li> The only base makeup I use.  I use it for my foundation.  One lasts me about 6-9 months depending on how often I wear makeup.  Requires very little for complete coverage of a 30 something woman.</li>
            <li> I love this Ecco Bella cover stick.  I use it everyday and am on my 2nd tube of it. The first tube lasted me about 6 months and I use it as needed all over my face.  I recommend this product for sure!!!!!</li>
            <li> I like this concealer. Works great w my skin tone, I&#x27;m pretty light but not fair. It&#x27;s not too pink or yellow, just right.&lt;br /&gt;I was using the standard Maybelline concealer (medium beige)  forever, but this has less junk in it. It works as well as that for me, but it feels lighter. It&#x27;s definitely more expensive, but probably worth it.</li>
            <li> Love that it&#x27;s natural, but this product makes me break out and had to be applied several times a day</li>
            <li> I love it üòç it really does the job . Feels  smooth&lt;br /&gt;Not sticky ,no chemicals on your keeping it healthy :) . Great gift</li>
            <li> I do like this cover up.  I just dab it on the blemishes and it covers well and stays on. Can&#x27;t complain. Have a problem with Rosacea so I have a lot to cover.</li>
            <li> Really impressed! Love love love!</li>
            <li> EXACTLY what I was looking for! I love this product. It covers well, and blends with my skin easily. I don&#x27;t have to wear powder over it like I did with store products. I really like the idea of it being a natural product. I don&#x27;t feel the urgency to wash chemicals off of my face the first chance I get. Will definitely be purchasing again when I run out!</li>
            <li> I had never tried this and found that I really love the coverage and ease of use. Will buy this again.</li>
            <li> Bought this for the girlfriend, it was too dark for her.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It works really well.  I am towards then end and it broke but I can still use it and will buy another one.  It really does what it says!!</li>
            <li> I like the coverage, consistency, pretty much everything about this make up. However, after purchase, I read it is not as &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; as I thought. I will continue to use it, but probably won&#x27;t buy again if EWG doesn&#x27;t approve.</li>
            <li> I like the product very much. I use it as a spot foundation.  The color blends into my (light-medium) complexion and it&#x27;s very creamy.  What I do not like, however, is the sticker they wrapped around it.  I buy Ecco Bella lipsticks and the paper wrapped around them is just easily ripped off.  Not so with this, it&#x27;s an actual sticker and it took me a while to peel most of it off.  My only complaint of the product, and I do hope they change it.  I also hope they omit the palm oil in the future----I didn&#x27;t know it was in there and forests are being decimated for this product.  Not acceptable.  By the time this tube is done, if they have not changed oils I may change brands.</li>
            <li> The coverage was not bad.. used it to cover my blemishes</li>
            <li> This works very well for me, the color is perfect for my completion, and I like the fact that it has non toxic ingredients...</li>
            <li> I have been buying this product for several years.  It is worth a few more bucks.  I have a number of allergies and sensitive skin.  This has been the best product and brand that I have tried.</li>
            <li> I love this cover stick. I have very sensitive eyes and skin but this product has no downside. I purchased the beige color and plan to purchase the medium beige as I have medium olive skin and in summer trend to be darker.</li>
            <li> I wanted something to use around my eyes that was more natural.. This works great, color is nice, long lasting and I set with a little powder, will be buying again</li>
            <li> This product definitely has a fragrance, like a rose scent. If you are chemically sensitive, you may want to stay clear of this one. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> The color is perfect for light skin. Does really well for under eye coverups...will clunk up on dry skin or lumpy areas with blemishes, but that&#x27;s the case with most concealers I think. I really love that it&#x27;s natural and has far fewer harsh chemicals. Happy customer!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a more natural made make up that was less expensive while I saved up for the other brand I usually use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did do the job your looking for which it why I gave it three stars; I just personally didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> I have mixed reviews about this product. The cover up it&#x27;s self works great! The packaging however is HORRIBLE. It almost seems as if the sticker that seals the cover up is stuck on with super glue. It was horrible to try to get off and still I can&#x27;t get it all off.</li>
            <li> Will buy again. I use this every day near my eyes and I do not feel bad one bit sleeping in this or using near my eyes.</li>
            <li> Nice quality product, it covers well.  The ingredients sound very safe and good for your skin.  I was surprised to have the issue I did, though, because so many people claiming to have fair skin said it was a perfect match.  On me, it looked very orange.  I even double checked that I ordered beige and rechecked people&#x27;s reviews.  I&#x27;m not a red head fair skinned person (that true pale white) and I tan in the summer, but I am pretty light colored and this was just too orange for me.  If you are quite fair skinned, this shade may not be ideal for you.  I&#x27;m going to search and see if they make anything lighter.  I was under the impression I had ordered their lightest shade, but I like the quality and the company stance, so I hope I was wrong!  Other wise, if you are a little less fair and have a bit more gold tone to your skin, this maybe a very good match for you.</li>
            <li> I am happy to find a product without toxins that works well. Nice coverage and consistency. Blends well and looks natural.</li>
            <li> I was on the fence with this concealer in the beginning but, after using it for several weeks, I can honestly say I had a change of heart.  I  think that it has a firmer texture that I was not used to but, after playing around with it, it really does compliment my skin tone, wears well under foundation and conceals well.  I would re-purchase.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this stuff! It&#x27;s the greatest for covering under eye circles or other blemishes like pimples, or red cheeks. I use the Powder and foundation in this brad as well! I can&#x27;t imagine life without these products! They nurish and hydrate my skin while giving it a dewy youthful glow! Love LOVE Eco Bella Products! Worth every penny if you&#x27;re concerned about putting chemicals on your skin and what to have flawless skin!</li>
            <li> The tube is small but it lasts a long time, no smells, states no bad stuff in it.  Hasn&#x27;t creased on me.  Definitely brightens up the darkness around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I bought this in Beige and believe it works well for under eye and blemish coverage.  It is slightly dry, but goes on well over moisturizer and stays on throughout the day.</li>
            <li> This makeup is perfect for me since I don&#x27;t like to use a makeup base over my entire face.  I just \\&quot;touch up\\&quot; blemishes and go.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate, it is soft enough to glide on, but thick enough to cover those little spots . . . all day</li>
            <li> Best cover up stick that&#x27;s not full of chemicals! It&#x27;s the one piece of make up that I don&#x27;t want to live without now.</li>
            <li> really like the texture and ingredients just wish there were more color options, my skin tone is warm (i&#x27;m really light with yellow undertones) this concealer is way too pink/orange. very creamy and easy to apply and feels really great on the skin so i&#x27;d totally recommend it to anyone with the right skin colour!</li>
            <li> works okay, but doesn&#x27;t do too good of a job covering up a dark sun spot I have.</li>
            <li> Really great stuff. Says on all day. Didn&#x27;t exactly match my color, but still was good enough.</li>
            <li> I love the convenient tube! Tucks right into my purse... Be warned it will melt if you leave it in the heat!</li>
            <li> I saw this on Urbanette Magazine and bought it. It&#x27;s perfect for super pale women like me. It glides on super easily with no pull, and covers very well.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t blend well with my skin. I still use it from time to time but I have moved on to different concealers. I wanted it to work well but didn&#x27;t match my skin tone well. Hopefully it will work better for you. It has a  yellow tone which I think was the issue for me.</li>
            <li> The formula is great, perfect tone, smooth, can be used with foundation or without (just smudge a bit with your finger on the skin).  But the packaging is terrible - half way though use the stick breaks at the base.</li>
            <li> I thought I ordered Medium Beige, but received Beige, but it&#x27;s OK.  I&#x27;ve used this product for years and it used to cost $11 in a health food store, then over time, went up to $14 and recently $18, so I was happy to buy it from Amazon for $14.  I like this brand because I have very sensitive skin and some products cause me to get rashes and this never has given me any problem.</li>
            <li> Great organic cosmetics! I&#x27;m allergic to everything from toxic overload in my body and I have had zero issues with these cosmetics. It took me two years to find a company I could use. The only issue is they are a little pricey but the products seem to last well so the damage to my bank account was only dramatic the first time around when I had to buy a lot all at once. Love the colors and they last all day just like the cancer causing chemical filled make up brands!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Will definitely be ordering again.  The first order was not shipped with Amazon Prime but it was quickly shipped after I called.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like writing bad reviews but this item was disappointing.  It doesn&#x27;t go on easily.  I just got it and have only used it a couple times.  It has already broken from the base and is now shifting inside the tube.  I may need to find another container to put it in and use a brush to apply it.  My previous concealer was a liquid and I really loved but was not cruelty free.  I&#x27;m hoping to find another cruelty free option that goes on easier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the cover up for a good 9 months and I&#x27;m very happy with it.  My skin is fair, so the light color is perfect.  I was used to using other cover-up sticks from major brands and wanted to switch to something more natural.  I was worried that I&#x27;d have to compromise quality for something with natural ingredients, but this performs just like any other brand.  It covers well, blends well, and looks natural.  A little bit goes a long way.  I use their foundation, mascara, and lipstick which have also been great.</li>
            <li> I would give this product 5 stars if it were packaged differently. It comes like a tube of lipstick. Except it is much softer than makeup, so even after being ever so gentle when using the stick, after a couple of days it had already lost form and has gotten gunked up in the tube. Over the summer, even though I am a huge fan of air conditioning, the slightly higher temps made it even softer so while I enjoy the product, it is kind of a dumb way to sell it.</li>
            <li> My tween daughter bought this and loves it. It only takes a small amount to cover. She has sensitive skin (redhead) and has had no problems.</li>
            <li> Been using this for a couple of years.  So glad there are lead-free makeup options available.  It&#x27;s the right color too.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it doesn&#x27;t have any of the questionable ingredients that so many cosmetic products contain. Not on,y is it better for me but works as well as its &amp;#34;dirtier&amp;#34; cousins. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> This concealer works great for me. I have very fair skin and the color is perfect. It applies in a nice thin layer and blends easily.</li>
            <li> easy to use and get coverage</li>
            <li> Best cover stick! I use it for foundation it gives great coverage! It is very difficult to find a foundation make up that doesn&#x27;t have fragrance to it. I am highly allergic and sensitive so I started using this and it&#x27;s one of the best base make ups I have used. I wish they would make a larger version of this specifically for a base make up.</li>
            <li> I got the lightest shade and it matches my fair skin perfectly! It blends well and is creamy. I&#x27;m giving it four stars because of the packaging. It can break really easily :(</li>
            <li> Purchased because product is chemical-free.  It is a nice creamy concealer, goes on smoothly but need to set with powder.  Gave 3 stars because the color is not a good match for me.  I have fair skin with golden undertones and this makeup is more of a pink (cool or neutral) undertone.  I do really like their foundation, however; despite the tone being different, I reorder this because of the coverage and how it feels on my skin. (see my review in ecco bella foundation natural).</li>
            <li> The product is very nice and works well.  However Ecco Bella has  put a thick piece of paper over the tube that  leaves a STICKY DISGUSTING RESIDUE ALL OVER THE TUBE when it is removed.  But in order to open up the product to use it, you must remove that paper.  WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?  Some idiot management guy who has never used the product probably thought that one up.  I have to use disgusting &#x27;\\&quot;GOO BEGONE\\&quot; to get rid of that disgusting sticky residue.  So much for purity!  Really bad!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;POSTED LATER - UPDATE:  I got in touch with manufacturer on 1/16/14.  They said they are aware of the sticky label problem and they are in the process of fixing it. So just make sure that your stick does not have that paper pasted over the entire tube.  Like I said - the product is good and works well.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my Eastern Asian skin. Can&#x27;t go out without this on!</li>
            <li> Under my eyes get dark and I have always had a hard time finding a good product to help cover up the under eye darkness.  This is the best product and I will continue to use this as part of my beauty routine.</li>
            <li> A little thick, but good coverage.</li>
            <li> This is the first product that i used from Ecco Bella. Works really well, but i can use it properly because the bar came broken.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m expecting this can be solve! Because looks to me a really good brand.</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with an all natural cream coverup and I&#x27;m actually very pleased. I mostly used this for around my eyes and it does a wonderful job at covering dark circles but I notice I do break out when I use this elsewhere (around the nose/chin) I do however have sensitive skin and I&#x27;ve yet to find a concealer that doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts/clog pores. Instead I use this cover up around my eyes and then set and buff a natural powder makeup (honey bee gardens) on the rest of my face. This combo leaves my skin looking flawless. I knocked off a star because I did get pimples after about 2 weeks of using it on the redness around my nose, but I&#x27;m still pretty happy with this and I&#x27;m never going back to 200+ ingredient drugstore brands that actually create wrinkles and potentiallu more serious health problems. :D</li>
            <li> I am surprised how much i like this cover up.  It is light and goes on easy.  Covers well and lasts all day.  I would recomend it to anyone who wants to try something naural or those who just want an easy to apply product</li>
            <li> This product came on time, I was very excited to try it on. When I open it, the stick was broken .Now I&#x27;m unable to us it.The color tone is orange I&#x27;ll never by this!!!</li>
            <li> Love this concealer. I ordered the Beige. I used my fingers to apply under my eyes and then a concealer brush for anywhere on the face as needed. So happy to finally have a natural alternative to my other concealers which undoubtedly pack a chemical punch. The consistency is sort of waxy, but in a good way. It makes the concealer stay put and not absorb right in, helping with coverage for pimples where you need the concealer to kind of &amp;#34;sit&amp;#34; on top of the skin. For my under eyes I usually rub the product in more so it absorbs. Will def order again. I also purchased the Ecco Bella powder in Pale and love that as well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m freckled and have red hair. My skin is medium fair with pink undertones and this is a match for my skin. It stays on pretty well and would give it 5 stars if I felt it stayed on perfectly. I do reapply it under my eyes at least once a day. But overall, I love the natural product and this is the second time I&#x27;ve bought it. I wish it wasn&#x27;t so pricey, but better ingredients cost more and I like to protect my skin from man-made chemicals when at all possible.</li>
            <li> This is the best concealer I&#x27;ve ever used. It goes on smoothly, and the coverage is excellent. Love that this concealer doesn&#x27;t contain all the nasty chemicals that the drugstore brands have too. This one may be a little more expensive, but you get what you pay for, in most cases. Gluten-free too, which is great for me. I use the beige color, and I have a fair to medium skin tone - blends perfectly.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to all dyes and perfumes. This is not only a great product but also safe for me to use.</li>
            <li> Only foundation I&#x27;ve used on my sensitive, acne-prone skin for the last ten years. The best! Used to work for this company and that&#x27;s how I found out about the product. Use a mini real-hair bamboo brush to apply and lightly blend with end of brush or finger.  I use the &amp;#34;beige&amp;#34; color all year round except for summertime where I&#x27;ll use the &amp;#34;medium-beige&amp;#34; that blends better with a tan. Enjoy!! ;)</li>
            <li> This works great and offers great coverage. I use it to cover dark undereye circles as well and all other imperfections on my face.  It lasts well, but will last all day if I powder under my eyes lightly after foundation and then again after concealer. My only complaint would be that it does settle in the fine lines under my eyes a bit, but that&#x27;s probably just the thickness of it.</li>
            <li> First off I am writing a review on my husbands account lol. Ok it&#x27;s smooth it glides it stays on for hours. It brightens and lightens all at the same time. It is so nourishing and good for your skin. I love it ladies a must have. I purchased the beige I have medium to light skin. I like my concealer lighter to pop eye area.  . The only con about it is it can break but if your light on the pressure you will be fine.</li>
            <li> The beige was too dark for an undereye cover for someone with fair skin. Did not apply as nicely as I had hoped, either. I returned it.</li>
            <li> This is my &#x27;&#x27;go to&#x27;&#x27; blemish cover-up. Goes on easy, lasts all day, and looks and feels great on. Ever so slightly too yellow for certain areas of my very light skin tone but it goes well under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Nice feel and coverage. The stick broke early on so I have to use my finger or a brush to apply it. I may try another brand for comparison purposes.</li>
            <li> Have loved using this for years. The Ecco Bella blush, cover up stick and mascara are all fabulous natural make up products. I&#x27;m not as much of a fan of their lipsticks, but love the rest!</li>
            <li> works well and provides good coverage</li>
            <li> Nice natural cover up. Fits my beige skin tone.</li>
            <li> The whole thing broke off after a couple of uses. Like the product but needs to be made better where it is usable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a makeup company that I can stand behind for a while now and I think Ecco Bella was a good choice for me. I did a good bit of research what makeup lines were organic and I felt that Ecco Bella offered the best ingredients at the best pricepoint with organic certifications.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this cover up in beige and because there weren&#x27;t may colors available I was worried it would be to dark for me. I was happy to see that it covers great under my eyes and over my ruddy cheeks and the color was just right. I wear it with the pale powder and the bisque foundation and it works great. It is thick (it will go on tougher than a lipstick consistency) I mean it is stick coverup so keep your expectations in line. You don&#x27;t need much to get good coverage. If you don&#x27;t like how it pulls at your skin because of the consistency, use a brush or dab it on to apply it. It&#x27;s one part of a team, with the foundation and powder a little bit will go a long way. I&#x27;m sure it will take me a long time to use up this coverup!&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a makeup that will be kind to the earth and your skin, try this. I&#x27;ve been very happy with this line so far.</li>
            <li> I have tried most concealers.  Usually within a few minutes my eyes are itchy and tearing up.  THIS is the first one that does not do that. It is well worth the price and investment for comfort.  Wearing it all day is a joy.  Have used for years and won&#x27;t buy anything else. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Kinda greasy feeling and doesn&#x27;t cover as well as commercial concealer.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for several years now. I love the consistency of this concealer. It goes on smooth and has excellent coverage. It is also easy to apply with your fingers or a concealer brush, which I use. I like that it cimes in a solud stick as well. This is a great price for something of this quality. It has only safe, non toxic ingredients. I feel comfortable applying this on my face and around my eyes. I only wish that it would come in more shades. I have light skin and even though it matches my skin, I feel like its a little too warm for me. Wish there was a more neutral undertone option. I still choose to wear it because its not too drastic and for all the other benefits mentioned above.</li>
