            <li>I wanted to do something to enhance my head piece and this exotic stick eye</li>
            <li>I was able to use them twice.</li>
            <li>variety, you can also wear it below your eye, instead of on top of your lid...</li>
            <li>Glitter was good for first use</li>
            <li>They were easy to put on but did take some time for my to get use to wearing them but within an hour or so</li>
            <li>They are easy to apply.</li>
            <li>These were relatively easy to apply and are reusable which was fantastic.</li>
            <li>I wore these on Halloween, and they were a huge hit with the Trick or Treaters.</li>
            <li>Great purchase, I think I will buy another set to have for future use.</li>
            <li>These were amazing and pretty easy to put on and it was my first time ever to try eye art too.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m excited about wearing it.</li>
            <li>They were easy to put on, stayed on for the whole time and were easy to remove.  </li>
            <li>The whole point of stage make up is to make sure your make up \\&quot;pops\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>All the rhinestones look different shapes and size wise.</li>
            <li>I loved it and it was so, so simple to apply.  </li>
            <li>They work great, although they could be a little bit tougher as they come apart easily</li>
            <li>I bought a couple of different colors and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li>Luckily my friend had some eyelash glue that I could use to keep it on.</li>
            <li>The design is really pretty!</li>
            <li>so I had to cut them up and only could use bits and had to make my own design.</li>
            <li>It was worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I only used the bottom part of the lids because the top eyelid stickie looked like a &amp;#34;Sticker&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It looks exactly as advertised, though</li>
            <li>I will most likely order from this company again.</li>
            <li>Very Glam!</li>
            <li>I got so many compliments and won second place in the costume contest!  </li>
            <li>I would absolutely order them again.</li>
            <li>I wore them for 8 hours straight</li>
            <li>/&gt;They should warn that you&#x27;re supposed to be a trained professional to apply!!!</li>
            <li>but I wasn&#x27;t able to keep those on either, most likely because I don&#x27;t have any experience with false eyelashes.</li>
            <li>The lashes were a little too heavy for me but the sticker was great.</li>
            <li>I had a professional makeup artist put them on for me because you need steady hands.</li>
            <li>Overall this is a decent product.</li>
            <li>The eyelash glue is made from natural latex, so latex allergy sufferers order a different eyelash glue.</li>
            <li>Sometime things do not adhere to your skin very well when you&#x27;re wearing  face full of make-up, but this product stayed in place all day &amp; all night long... and without irritating my sensitive skin!&lt;br</li>

            <li> The false eyelashes are really pretty</li>
            <li> It gave my costume the little extra touch it need to stand out.</li>
            <li> I had given away my accessories that came with my costume as I traditionally pass them out to little girls.  </li>
            <li> Also it was hard to wash off and left my skin red &amp; irritated for 3 days after use.</li>

            <li> but then it dried up and got gooy</li>
            <li> stuff was expensive and I was extremely disappointed that I had to create my own look after the strips got stuck togther.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But the eyelash glue was basically as hard as a rock</li>
            <li> I am disappointed at how I could have such a failure in comparison to the other reviews.  </li>
            <li> Eyelashes are too short so look awkward.  </li>
            <li> I received a ton of compliments I mean a ton!</li>
            <li> Adhesive was poor and defective all around.  </li>
            <li> But after a while they started irritating the skin around my eyes</li>
            <li> So sad this product failed on every point.  </li>
            <li> As soon as I pealed them off they twisted and would not un twist</li>
            <li> All the eye bling is not reusable as after one use my makeup underneath stuck to plastic so impossible to reuse.  </li>
            <li> Bad quality.</li>
            <li> (Mad Hatter beat me out!)</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m just horrible at applying this though.</li>

            <li> I wore these on Halloween, and they were a huge hit with the Trick or Treaters. I would absolutely order them again. The eyelash glue is made from natural latex, so latex allergy sufferers order a different eyelash glue.</li>
            <li> These were relatively easy to apply and are reusable which was fantastic. I used them for a 2 week long theatrical production. The whole point of stage make up is to make sure your make up \\&quot;pops\\&quot;. These definitely do the trick. I bought a couple of different colors and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. Will be recommending these to all of my theatrical buddies.</li>
            <li> So sad this product failed on every point.  Could not use it for my costume, so I waisted my money.  I don&#x27;t believe the other reviews. The glue didn&#x27;t stay - so you need to get your own adhesive.  Eyelashes are too short so look awkward.  As soon as I pealed them off they twisted and would not un twist so I had to cut them up and only could use bits and had to make my own design. Glitter was good for first use but then it dried up and got gooy and I could not use it a second time as it wont apply. Also it was hard to wash off and left my skin red &amp; irritated for 3 days after use. All the eye bling is not reusable as after one use my makeup underneath stuck to plastic so impossible to reuse.  Adhesive was poor and defective all around.  Cannot recommend this product.  I am disappointed at how I could have such a failure in comparison to the other reviews.  Making me feel either my product was defective or the other reviews are untrue.</li>
            <li> I bought the Xotic Eyes for Trinidad Carnivale. I only used the bottom part of the lids because the top eyelid stickie looked like a &amp;#34;Sticker&amp;#34;. Maybe I&#x27;m just horrible at applying this though.</li>
            <li> They work great, although they could be a little bit tougher as they come apart easily and they need a restickable sheet to keep using them.</li>
            <li> The design is really pretty! I love the top and bottom eyes! But the eyelash glue was basically as hard as a rock and I couldn&#x27;t use it at all. Luckily my friend had some eyelash glue that I could use to keep it on. It lasted all night but I can&#x27;t say it was 100% because of the product because I used a different company&#x27;s eyelash glue. I wore these eyes to EDC Las Vegas and got so many compliments! But after a while they started irritating the skin around my eyes and I had to take them off, but that could have been from the desert heat and from sweating all night. The false eyelashes are really pretty but I wasn&#x27;t able to keep those on either, most likely because I don&#x27;t have any experience with false eyelashes. They are harder to put on than they look! Overall this is a decent product. I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s reusable though because when I took them off they were all sweaty and gross.</li>
            <li> I received so many compliments on my eyes the night I wore these for Halloween. I wore them for 8 hours straight and they stayed in place perfectly.  So happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by the glamorous picture in the description!&lt;br /&gt;No instructions were included in the packaging and the web site was a joke.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff was expensive and I was extremely disappointed that I had to create my own look after the strips got stuck togther.&lt;br /&gt;They should warn that you&#x27;re supposed to be a trained professional to apply!!!</li>
            <li> Bad quality. All the rhinestones look different shapes and size wise. Both eyes are not the same.</li>
            <li> This xotic eyes product was awesome! I loved it and it was so, so simple to apply.  I wore it in place of a mask for a masquerade ball and received so many compliments.  I would recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had the chance to wear it yet. Bought it for a Mardi Gras Ball I&#x27;ll be attending this weekend. It looks exactly as advertised, though and I&#x27;m excited about wearing it. Just PRAYING the applique will adhere well to my sometimes oily face. We&#x27;ll see...</li>
            <li> I had a professional makeup artist put them on for me because you need steady hands. The lashes were a little too heavy for me but the sticker was great. It worked well with my costume and stayed on for a long time. I will most likely order from this company again. It was worth every penny. It gave my costume the little extra touch it need to stand out.</li>
            <li> I got raving compliments on the stick rhinestone and eyelashes.  Everyone asked who did your make up.  I purchased these to wear with my costume as I had a Caribbean Carnival Birthday Party. I had given away my accessories that came with my costume as I traditionally pass them out to little girls.  I wanted to do something to enhance my head piece and this exotic stick eye make up was on the money.  They were easy to put on but did take some time for my to get use to wearing them but within an hour or so, I forgot I had them on.  Great purchase, I think I will buy another set to have for future use.</li>
            <li> They are easy to apply. Very Glam!</li>
            <li> These were amazing and pretty easy to put on and it was my first time ever to try eye art too. I was able to use them twice. I received a ton of compliments I mean a ton! They were a huge hit and perfect accent to my butterfly costume!</li>
            <li> was the best thing I found.  everyone loved them and I can&#x27;t wait to buy more styles from this company</li>
            <li> Sometime things do not adhere to your skin very well when you&#x27;re wearing  face full of make-up, but this product stayed in place all day &amp; all night long... and without irritating my sensitive skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For variety, you can also wear it below your eye, instead of on top of your lid... I have submitted pics to show you the difference.</li>
            <li> Got these for a Halloween costume.  They were easy to put on, stayed on for the whole time and were easy to remove.  I got so many compliments and won second place in the costume contest!  (Mad Hatter beat me out!)</li>
