            <li>that promised amazing results which didn&#x27;t come through as promised.</li>
            <li>but it was great getting it for free with my Serum purchase.</li>

            <li>My skin feels amazing and is truly glowing.</li>

            <li>Honestly, it feels like a scoop of ice cream for your eyes.</li>

            <li>The eye gel thing has a nice consistency and smells like cucumbers.</li>
            <li>Fast Service, Great Product!</li>
            <li>The eye cream it came with is nice and smells better than the serum (smells kind of like aloe vera).</li>
            <li>It blends very easily and doesn&#x27;t leave my face shiny.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried using a very strong moisturizing cream along with it</li>
            <li>The first time I used this product, I loved it already!</li>

            <li>Hopefully the replacement will be much better.</li>
            <li>Always be sure to wear an spf face cream over.</li>
            <li>Lovely serum.</li>
            <li>Love, Love, Love,</li>
            <li>I love it, I&#x27;ll continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li>Product arrived fast, feels great on the face not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>I love this serum.</li>
            <li>My skin seems to love this stuff</li>
            <li>I bought it for the face serum but love the eye treatment even more.  </li>
            <li>I love the way this product has made my skin feel.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Completely satisfied with purchase.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I also love the eye cream.  </li>
            <li>Now the look more alert and rested.</li>
            <li>I love the sano products I&#x27;ve seen the results that i was looking for.</li>
            <li>I am on my second bottle and very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>My problem is more so with the packaging than the product itself.</li>
            <li>However, don&#x27;t expect any moisturisation - although it is refreshing for summer.</li>
            <li>Also, I love the eye cream.</li>
            <li>Love how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>I was able to cut it at the bent section &amp; now the product spews everywhere.  </li>
            <li>I must say, I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li>you will love the results.</li>
            <li>Love It</li>
            <li>There is something very special about this serum and the eye cream because it shows immediate firming results.</li>
            <li>It feels very good on the face especially after the shower.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin smooth with a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>Nothing special about it, and eye gel is sticky!</li>
            <li>I love the complimentary eye gel!</li>
            <li>The skin feels very hydrated and smooth and bright.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t oily and soaks in very quickly.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend the Sano Vitamin C Serum.</li>
            <li>but so far it&#x27;s been very nice and makes my skin feel smooth.</li>
            <li>I liked this stuff at first til I realized it was making me break out.</li>
            <li>Woo,it is very good for my dry skin.</li>
            <li>Also my pump works perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>The smell is fine as well.</li>
            <li>I love that I cannot feel the Sano Serum on my skin once it dries, and it dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t find my FORMERLY huge pores in the store.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li>I started using this and took a break from drinking and with the effects of both, i&#x27;m constantly being complimented on my skin glowing and how great i look.  </li>
            <li>Leaves the skin smooth with a silky feeling.</li>
            <li>My skin is so smooth since using this product.</li>
            <li>I know when I wake up in the morning and am getting ready my eyes are somewhat puffy anyway, well this gel is amazing.</li>
            <li>Goes smoothly onto skin</li>
            <li>and they gave me a free offer for the bonus eye cream.  </li>
            <li>it absolutely did not work as stated!!!  </li>
            <li>Good serum, definitely notice difference in fine lines after applying immediately followed by the gel.</li>
            <li>I have found my new serum and eye cream, both are so amazing, hope it stays this price for awhile</li>
            <li>but i will definitely soon be ordering more of this amazing stuff</li>
            <li>It has a clean, cucumber scent.</li>
            <li>and I can wear it right underneath my makeup!</li>
            <li>My skin is soft to the touch and the product has a nice scent as well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very cooling and refreshing.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good about these products.</li>
            <li>The vitamin C serum evaporates into my skin quickly and it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>My order included the vitamin c eye cream and it is my new favorite.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a new glow to my skin and more even tone.  </li>
            <li>I love this serum and will keep buying it for myself; I don&#x27;t know if I can live without it now.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend it!!!</li>
            <li>Makes your skin feel fresh and moisturized.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not sticky and it&#x27;s easily absorbed.</li>
            <li>I saw a difference right away.  </li>
            <li>The cream feels soothing and glides right on.</li>
            <li>I was loving the Sano Vitamin C Serum and Eye Gel, when, after my first two purchases, I made the mistake of trying a seemingly similar product in order to get 2 ounces of serum instead of one.</li>
            <li>thank you very much.</li>
            <li>but since I&#x27;ve started using this stuff my wrinkles are barely visible and my laugh lines are plumping up!!</li>
            <li>I have bought several Sano products and have been pleased with them all.</li>
            <li>Love the Serum, this is my third time ordering it, however this time it did not come with the eye dropper, but in a spray bottle.</li>
            <li>This is my first time trying this product</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!</li>
            <li>I could see the difference with just using the product for first time.</li>
            <li>First of all the pump did not work.  </li>
            <li>Really!</li>
            <li>I have some fine lines on my forehead and my laugh lines are pretty deep</li>
            <li>The Sano Serum not only didn&#x27;t cause blemishes, it improved my skin so much that, for the first time I can remember, I was pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I love this product and will continue to use it as long as it remains affordable.</li>
            <li>Just received mine and so far I very much like the way it feels on my skin not sticky like others I have used as for results I will post more later</li>
            <li>I am only 22, so I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles or fine lines that I need reduced.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s actually helping to get rid of fine lines as well.</li>
            <li>I have really felt it doing much for my skin</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and am prone to breakouts, even at my age (40).</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just received my third order of the Sano Vitamin C Serum with bonus free Eye Gel.</li>
            <li>These products really improve my skin in tone, texture and firmness.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping that I would.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>products work really well for</li>
            <li>I really like this vitamin c serum it makes your face feel</li>
            <li>and I was using all over, couldn&#x27;t believe the difference,  the softness was fantastic, left a review</li>
            <li>I can say I see much difference.</li>
            <li>Now I have to be really sure it&#x27;s directly aimed at my palms, or risk losing some excess to wherever the heck it decides to squirt, since the pump doesn&#x27;t go just halfway like I want (so I always have a bit extra with each use).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unless you get plastic surgery and look crazy, I would recommend looking natural at your best</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this serum</li>
            <li>and I was surprised how much I like it.</li>
            <li>The eye gel is gentle on my skin and absorbs completely.  </li>
            <li>I have normal skin</li>
            <li>A few weeks after I started using the serum, my skin felt ok</li>
            <li>I have little splotches that aren&#x27;t easily covered up with makeup, however with this serum, it works wonders, and tends to make the edges of those splotches blend in with the color of my face a little more and not stand out and salute everyone.</li>
            <li>so I liked this product except that little plastic inner part (the straw type thing)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Today I had my make up matched to a new brand</li>
            <li>Like the product but dislike the new dispenser.</li>
            <li>have seen a huge difference in my skin in less than 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li>Dark spots are significantly lighter and my pores have diminished.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely can&#x27;t say enough about these products.</li>
            <li>old regime was Loreal youth code.</li>
            <li>really like this, will order again for the 3rd time when I am out</li>
            <li>My skin also looks brighter and have noticed that some darker spots on my face have lightened up considerably.</li>
            <li>Last but not least my skin has had no negative reaction to this product.</li>
            <li>I think it is an effective product for anyone who wants to turn back or slow down wrinkles, dark spots and fine lines.</li>
            <li>At first I was skeptical since I&#x27;ve used so many products  </li>
            <li>This other product felt heavy, slippery and oily in contrast to the light, pure, nearly water-thin consistency of my Sano Serum.</li>
            <li>Sorry I don&#x27;t have more positive results&lt;br</li>
            <li>menopause my skin changed to breakouts, large pores and dry patches.  </li>
            <li>The bonus eye serum tingles a little at first but not in an irritating way, and smells good and has a similar effect as the serum.</li>
            <li>The product refused to come out, but I didn&#x27;t want the hassle of returning it for a new one, so i just cut the extra bit off.</li>
            <li>Over time however, I notice that my skin is extremely dry and my pores very pronounced.</li>
            <li>I have only used this product for a couple days, but I have noticed a difference in the plumpness of my skin and how soft it is.</li>
            <li>I tried just the vitamin c serum first and couldn&#x27;t believe the results,  started using on half my face</li>
            <li>The serum seems to be more tightening than other Vitamin C serums I have tried in the past.  </li>
            <li>My eyes were becoming rather sleepy and tired looking.  </li>
            <li>But I used other eye products (mainly creams) they never burns.</li>

            <li> The product absorbs quickly making it perfect to use in the morning or evening.</li>
            <li> The Eye Gel is wonderful, it smells so fresh.  </li>
            <li> love their products even better when on sale!!</li>

            <li> I love this product and will rebuy!</li>
            <li> This product has lightened, brightened and smoothed my face so that it has never looked better!</li>
            <li> To be honest the price was what hooked me and man am I glad I tried it!</li>
            <li> that promised amazing results which didn&#x27;t come through as promised.</li>
            <li> but it was great getting it for free with my Serum purchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> The eye serum also works amazing.</li>
            <li> My skin feels amazing and is truly glowing.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m loving the results I&#x27;m getting.</li>
            <li> Honestly, it feels like a scoop of ice cream for your eyes.</li>
            <li> It feels nice on the skin with no oily feeling afterwards and it goes on under my makeup without that sticky feeling.</li>
            <li> The eye gel thing has a nice consistency and smells like cucumbers.</li>
            <li> Fast Service, Great Product!</li>
            <li> The eye cream it came with is nice and smells better than the serum (smells kind of like aloe vera).</li>
            <li> It blends very easily and doesn&#x27;t leave my face shiny.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using a very strong moisturizing cream along with it</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product, I loved it already!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product and love the bonus Eye Cream even more!  </li>

            <li> followed up with my favorite moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> Well okay</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Hopefully the replacement will be much better.</li>
            <li> Always be sure to wear an spf face cream over.</li>
            <li> Lovely serum.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love,</li>
            <li> I love it, I&#x27;ll continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li> Product arrived fast, feels great on the face not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> I love this serum.</li>
            <li> My skin seems to love this stuff</li>
            <li> I bought it for the face serum but love the eye treatment even more.  </li>
            <li> I love the way this product has made my skin feel.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Completely satisfied with purchase.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> I also love the eye cream.  </li>
            <li> Now the look more alert and rested.</li>
            <li> I love the sano products I&#x27;ve seen the results that i was looking for.</li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle and very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> My problem is more so with the packaging than the product itself.</li>
            <li> However, don&#x27;t expect any moisturisation - although it is refreshing for summer.</li>
            <li> Also, I love the eye cream.</li>
            <li> Love how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> I was able to cut it at the bent section &amp; now the product spews everywhere.  </li>
            <li> I must say, I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> you will love the results.</li>
            <li> Love It</li>
            <li> There is something very special about this serum and the eye cream because it shows immediate firming results.</li>
            <li> It feels very good on the face especially after the shower.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin smooth with a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> Nothing special about it, and eye gel is sticky!</li>
            <li> I love the complimentary eye gel!</li>
            <li> The skin feels very hydrated and smooth and bright.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t oily and soaks in very quickly.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend the Sano Vitamin C Serum.</li>
            <li> but so far it&#x27;s been very nice and makes my skin feel smooth.</li>
            <li> I liked this stuff at first til I realized it was making me break out.</li>
            <li> Woo,it is very good for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Also my pump works perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> The smell is fine as well.</li>
            <li> I love that I cannot feel the Sano Serum on my skin once it dries, and it dries quickly.  </li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t find my FORMERLY huge pores in the store.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> I started using this and took a break from drinking and with the effects of both, i&#x27;m constantly being complimented on my skin glowing and how great i look.  </li>
            <li> Leaves the skin smooth with a silky feeling.</li>
            <li> My skin is so smooth since using this product.</li>
            <li> I know when I wake up in the morning and am getting ready my eyes are somewhat puffy anyway, well this gel is amazing.</li>
            <li> Goes smoothly onto skin</li>
            <li> and they gave me a free offer for the bonus eye cream.  </li>
            <li> it absolutely did not work as stated!!!  </li>
            <li> Good serum, definitely notice difference in fine lines after applying immediately followed by the gel.</li>
            <li> I have found my new serum and eye cream, both are so amazing, hope it stays this price for awhile</li>
            <li> but i will definitely soon be ordering more of this amazing stuff</li>
            <li> It has a clean, cucumber scent.</li>
            <li> and I can wear it right underneath my makeup!</li>
            <li> My skin is soft to the touch and the product has a nice scent as well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very cooling and refreshing.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good about these products.</li>
            <li> The vitamin C serum evaporates into my skin quickly and it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> My order included the vitamin c eye cream and it is my new favorite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a new glow to my skin and more even tone.  </li>
            <li> I love this serum and will keep buying it for myself; I don&#x27;t know if I can live without it now.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel fresh and moisturized.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not sticky and it&#x27;s easily absorbed.</li>
            <li> I saw a difference right away.  </li>
            <li> The cream feels soothing and glides right on.</li>
            <li> I was loving the Sano Vitamin C Serum and Eye Gel, when, after my first two purchases, I made the mistake of trying a seemingly similar product in order to get 2 ounces of serum instead of one.</li>
            <li> thank you very much.</li>
            <li> but since I&#x27;ve started using this stuff my wrinkles are barely visible and my laugh lines are plumping up!!</li>
            <li> I have bought several Sano products and have been pleased with them all.</li>
            <li> Love the Serum, this is my third time ordering it, however this time it did not come with the eye dropper, but in a spray bottle.</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying this product</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> I could see the difference with just using the product for first time.</li>
            <li> First of all the pump did not work.  </li>
            <li> Really!</li>
            <li> I have some fine lines on my forehead and my laugh lines are pretty deep</li>
            <li> The Sano Serum not only didn&#x27;t cause blemishes, it improved my skin so much that, for the first time I can remember, I was pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I love this product and will continue to use it as long as it remains affordable.</li>
            <li> Just received mine and so far I very much like the way it feels on my skin not sticky like others I have used as for results I will post more later</li>
            <li> I am only 22, so I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles or fine lines that I need reduced.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s actually helping to get rid of fine lines as well.</li>
            <li> I have really felt it doing much for my skin</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and am prone to breakouts, even at my age (40).</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just received my third order of the Sano Vitamin C Serum with bonus free Eye Gel.</li>
            <li> These products really improve my skin in tone, texture and firmness.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping that I would.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> products work really well for</li>
            <li> I really like this vitamin c serum it makes your face feel</li>
            <li> and I was using all over, couldn&#x27;t believe the difference,  the softness was fantastic, left a review</li>
            <li> I can say I see much difference.</li>
            <li> Now I have to be really sure it&#x27;s directly aimed at my palms, or risk losing some excess to wherever the heck it decides to squirt, since the pump doesn&#x27;t go just halfway like I want (so I always have a bit extra with each use).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unless you get plastic surgery and look crazy, I would recommend looking natural at your best</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this serum</li>
            <li> and I was surprised how much I like it.</li>
            <li> The eye gel is gentle on my skin and absorbs completely.  </li>
            <li> I have normal skin</li>
            <li> A few weeks after I started using the serum, my skin felt ok</li>
            <li> I have little splotches that aren&#x27;t easily covered up with makeup, however with this serum, it works wonders, and tends to make the edges of those splotches blend in with the color of my face a little more and not stand out and salute everyone.</li>
            <li> so I liked this product except that little plastic inner part (the straw type thing)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Today I had my make up matched to a new brand</li>
            <li> Like the product but dislike the new dispenser.</li>
            <li> have seen a huge difference in my skin in less than 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> Dark spots are significantly lighter and my pores have diminished.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely can&#x27;t say enough about these products.</li>
            <li> old regime was Loreal youth code.</li>
            <li> really like this, will order again for the 3rd time when I am out</li>
            <li> My skin also looks brighter and have noticed that some darker spots on my face have lightened up considerably.</li>
            <li> Last but not least my skin has had no negative reaction to this product.</li>
            <li> I think it is an effective product for anyone who wants to turn back or slow down wrinkles, dark spots and fine lines.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical since I&#x27;ve used so many products  </li>
            <li> This other product felt heavy, slippery and oily in contrast to the light, pure, nearly water-thin consistency of my Sano Serum.</li>
            <li> Sorry I don&#x27;t have more positive results&lt;br</li>
            <li> menopause my skin changed to breakouts, large pores and dry patches.  </li>
            <li> The bonus eye serum tingles a little at first but not in an irritating way, and smells good and has a similar effect as the serum.</li>
            <li> The product refused to come out, but I didn&#x27;t want the hassle of returning it for a new one, so i just cut the extra bit off.</li>
            <li> Over time however, I notice that my skin is extremely dry and my pores very pronounced.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product for a couple days, but I have noticed a difference in the plumpness of my skin and how soft it is.</li>
            <li> I tried just the vitamin c serum first and couldn&#x27;t believe the results,  started using on half my face</li>
            <li> The serum seems to be more tightening than other Vitamin C serums I have tried in the past.  </li>
            <li> My eyes were becoming rather sleepy and tired looking.  </li>
            <li> But I used other eye products (mainly creams) they never burns.</li>
            <li> I unscrewed the bottle cap and found that the plastic piece inside the bottle was much too long and was bent in half and cannot be used.  </li>
            <li> In the future I will not be swayed by other product offers.</li>
            <li> I notice that the dark circles under my eyes are less noticable and my husband commented that my fine lines are much less visible</li>
            <li> This is a Vitamin C serum and eye cream with reasonable price for my age Spots, Dull Skin, Hyper pigmentation, Sagging Skin.</li>
            <li> was too long</li>
            <li> I look forward to seeing what long term use of this serum does for my skin.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t take long</li>
            <li> It has a very mild scent that is natural; do not expect any artificial fragrances and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My face normally becomes very dry during the fall and winter months, but I have been using the serum on my face once in the morning and at night before bed, and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with dryness this past year.</li>
            <li> My skin seems to stay dry and gets irritated with everything I put on it</li>
            <li> I look 10 years younger after only a few months.  </li>
            <li> Tightens your skin and makes wrinkles around eyes less obvious.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I noticed the improvements after only a few weeks.</li>
            <li> but they just jammed it in the bottle anyway.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like other oils that leave your face feeling sticky or wet.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Like some other reviewer, my serum dispenser was bent- seems like the little tube was way too long</li>
            <li> I wish i had together with all the other Sano products i bought.</li>
            <li> Other products, no matter what they claim, always make my skin break out.</li>
            <li> As soon as I felt this other product</li>
            <li> I have always looked younger than my age, but I struggled w/ acne and the scars they left behind.</li>
            <li> Pore texture serum and cream for night and dark spot corrector serum and cream with sun screen for day.  </li>
            <li> I tested it again, this time for the serum (very thin consistency) to shoot out wayyy too fast.</li>
            <li> Makes my under eye area feel tight and youthful.  </li>
            <li> but I have a little burn around my eye when I use it.</li>
            <li> Secondly the product is watery &amp; very hard to work with.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait for a week or a month down the road!</li>
            <li> I have very dark circle in my eye.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste of product</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for a few months now</li>
            <li> product was a waste of my time &amp; money.......</li>
            <li> Not to mention red, broken capillaries around my nose.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Sano vitamin c serum combo for the past few months.</li>
            <li> Before that I used the Dr Brandt no more pore line.  </li>
            <li> so I had to cut it :/.</li>
            <li> I have used this serum for the past three months.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it was the eye serum or the vitamin C serum that caused this however.</li>
            <li> I ordered another bottle but really have to stop using it as my skin is very unhappy.</li>
            <li> I dont mean they should not send the eye cream</li>
            <li> The serum itself doesn&#x27;t smell bad, but it doesn&#x27;t have the same orange/citrus smell that I associate with Vitamin C serums.</li>
            <li> Its not a good product.</li>
            <li> when I received the product, the seal covering the pump was broken and pump, to release product, did not work.  </li>
            <li> No matter how thinly applied, the non-Sano serum caused blemishes every time I used it.</li>
            <li> So, I bought her a bottle and told her my secret.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a slightly chemical scent, but isn&#x27;t unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Not sure that means it is working?!!!</li>
            <li> does some dirty things to my face at times.</li>
            <li> WHICH I HATE.</li>
            <li> VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like. It smell like fish and whem i received it, it was open.  Its not a good product.</li>
            <li> i would give it 10 stars if you could, great product!</li>
            <li> I have only used this product for a couple days, but I have noticed a difference in the plumpness of my skin and how soft it is. It is not a miracle worker but i love using it knowing im putting organic skin loving ingredients on my skin!</li>
            <li> The Eye Gel is wonderful, it smells so fresh.  The Serum vanishes into my skin without leaving any residue.  I have bought several Sano products and have been pleased with them all. I will continue to use them</li>
            <li> Good serum, definitely notice difference in fine lines after applying immediately followed by the gel. I use gel around eyes and cheeks.  However, the pump doesn&#x27;t work great.  Maybe a defect in mine.</li>
            <li> love their products even better when on sale!!</li>
            <li> I love this product.. i actually still have some left but i will definitely soon be ordering more of this amazing stuff</li>
            <li> I have used these two products for two days now. I swear I see a difference already. The eye gel feels really good when you put it on. I think I am already seeing a difference in some lines around the my mouth area. I am so glad this product went on sale. I think it is a keeper!</li>
            <li> Love the scent will post how it works after some usage.</li>
            <li> Love the Serum, this is my third time ordering it, however this time it did not come with the eye dropper, but in a spray bottle. WHICH I HATE. It&#x27;s a waste of product and I would not have ordered it had I known it would come in a spray bottle and not a dropper.</li>
            <li> This is my third bottle of this product and I love it!!!  I saw a difference right away.  I use it nightly followed up with my favorite moisturizer.  The bonus eye gel is wonderful too.  I&#x27;ve also bought the bigger size in that.  Will continue to use again and again.  I hope the price stays this low.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! At first I was skeptical since I&#x27;ve used so many products  that promised amazing results which didn&#x27;t come through as promised. To be honest the price was what hooked me and man am I glad I tried it! I absolutely can&#x27;t say enough about these products. I will be a repeat buyer from now on. HIGHLY recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> Woo,it is very good for my dry skin. Love it.</li>
            <li> The eye gel is great. A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I love it.  I have used hyaluronic acid with my skin care regime for years.  This stuff rocks!  I have just ordered enough of this brand to make it to next year.  I read where another poster said this brand had a similar bonus set last year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen a huge difference in my skin in less than 3 weeks.  Dark spots are significantly lighter and my pores have diminished.  I only use this at night.  Read where the ingredients can turn an orange tint sometimes during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today I had my make up matched to a new brand and I couldn&#x27;t find my FORMERLY huge pores in the store.&lt;br /&gt;After menopause my skin changed to breakouts, large pores and dry patches.  I have normal skin again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My old regime was Loreal youth code. I used different parts of that line for day and night.  Pore texture serum and cream for night and dark spot corrector serum and cream with sun screen for day.  Before that I used the Dr Brandt no more pore line.  Before that I used pur minerals see no pore minimizer in the pump bottle.  And before that I used ice cubes and biore strips.  Yep - just about tried it all.</li>
            <li> Well okay so I liked this product except that little plastic inner part (the straw type thing) was too long so the material was not coming out of the container so I had to cut it :/. I like all type of vit C products for my face. The only problem is that eye cream. I dont mean they should not send the eye cream but I have a little burn around my eye when I use it. Not sure that means it is working?!!! But I used other eye products (mainly creams) they never burns. I would like the seller actually answer my question about eye cream.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I definitely see an improvement in  my skin.</li>
            <li> when I received the product, the seal covering the pump was broken and pump, to release product, did not work.  I unscrewed the bottle cap and found that the plastic piece inside the bottle was much too long and was bent in half and cannot be used.  HELP!!</li>
            <li> This product might have been great but when i got it the pump was not pumping at all only to find out that it was bent at the end. I wish i had together with all the other Sano products i bought. Hopefully the replacement will be much better.</li>
            <li> It working so good!  I started using this and took a break from drinking and with the effects of both, i&#x27;m constantly being complimented on my skin glowing and how great i look.  I&#x27;ll be 28 soon and i keep getting that i&#x27;m 23.  Always be sure to wear an spf face cream over.</li>
            <li> Lovely serum. It feels very good on the face especially after the shower. Leaves the skin smooth with a silky feeling. I love the complimentary eye gel! Great for puffy eyes.</li>
            <li> great package value! great product</li>
            <li> Nothing special about it, and eye gel is sticky! I didn&#x27;t see any noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> My skin is so smooth since using this product. The eye treatment is wonderful! I&#x27;ve not found anything like it.</li>
            <li> This is my second order. My skin glows with this product. I waited for the bonus offer to come back around and ordered 2 again.</li>
            <li> I think this serum does what it says it does. I am only 22, so I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles or fine lines that I need reduced.  However, while the serum is drying, your face does feel like it is tightening and firming up.  The bonus Eye serum I don&#x27;t think I will repurchase.  I have really felt it doing much for my skin but it was great getting it for free with my Serum purchase.</li>
            <li> I use this every night before bed.  My skin looks great every morning.  A must have!</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for a few months now and I absolutely love it! I have very oily skin and am prone to breakouts, even at my age (40). This is a wonderful anti-aging serum that does not cause any additional breakouts! It has a very mild scent that is natural; do not expect any artificial fragrances and a little goes a long way. My order included the vitamin c eye cream and it is my new favorite. It has a clean, cucumber scent. It makes me so happy to know that I am helping my skin, without the use of unnatural, harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love, did I mention I LOVE this product!!  This is my third bottle of the serum and eye gel and I&#x27;m loving the results I&#x27;m getting. I am a sun worshipper and Father Sun does some dirty things to my face at times. I have little splotches that aren&#x27;t easily covered up with makeup, however with this serum, it works wonders, and tends to make the edges of those splotches blend in with the color of my face a little more and not stand out and salute everyone. Also, the texture of my skin is firmer and tighter.  AND.........the Bonus Eye Gel is absolutely wonderful!! Honestly, it feels like a scoop of ice cream for your eyes. I say &amp;#34;ice cream&amp;#34; because this gel is cool and feels wonderful when it goes on.  I know when I wake up in the morning and am getting ready my eyes are somewhat puffy anyway, well this gel is amazing. All I can say is, try it for yourself. I love it, I&#x27;ll continue to purchase it. I&#x27;m SOLD!!! Happy Happy Customer!!!</li>
            <li> Product arrived fast, feels great on the face not greasy at all. Also my pump works perfectly fine. I will rewrite a review on my results.</li>
            <li> The serum seems to be more tightening than other Vitamin C serums I have tried in the past.  I have only used this for a couple weeks but so far it&#x27;s been very nice and makes my skin feel smooth. The bonus eye serum tingles a little at first but not in an irritating way, and smells good and has a similar effect as the serum.</li>
            <li> Nice serum and cream at a very good price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount for review</li>
            <li> These products are really wonderful!  After only two days I see a visible difference in the texture and elasticity of my skin.  I can&#x27;t wait for a week or a month down the road!</li>
            <li> Vitamin C serum makes my skin glow.  I also love the eye gel! Nice bonus!</li>
            <li> This serum does the job!  Face looks great!</li>
            <li> Tightens your skin and makes wrinkles around eyes less obvious.  I will continue to buy this.</li>
            <li> I love this serum. Not only does it make my skin glow but it also does not irritate my rosacea. I notice that the dark circles under my eyes are less noticable and my husband commented that my fine lines are much less visible and I look younger. My coworkers have commented on how my skin looks healthier. I am on my second bottle and I can say I will probably be a lifetime user.</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying this product and I was surprised how much I like it. My skin seems to stay dry and gets irritated with everything I put on it but with the SANO Vitamin C Serum that&#x27;s not a problem. My skin seems to love this stuff and it&#x27;s actually helping to get rid of fine lines as well. It feels nice on the skin with no oily feeling afterwards and it goes on under my makeup without that sticky feeling. It&#x27;s fairly inexpensive and I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Reordered for my mom again. She says it tightens her face. If she&#x27;s happy I&#x27;m happy</li>
            <li> Love both!  I bought it for the face serum but love the eye treatment even more.  It has a wonderful cucumber scent and works well on my puffy lids.</li>
            <li> Just received mine and so far I very much like the way it feels on my skin not sticky like others I have used as for results I will post more later</li>
            <li> I have used this serum for the past three months.  It blends very easily and doesn&#x27;t leave my face shiny.  My face normally becomes very dry during the fall and winter months, but I have been using the serum on my face once in the morning and at night before bed, and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with dryness this past year. The eye gel is gentle on my skin and absorbs completely.  I ordered two bottles of this (plus the bonus eye gel) and I will definitely be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> really like this, will order again for the 3rd time when I am out</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been smoothing my wrinkles. I really like it.</li>
            <li> Great quality and wonderful value.  I love the way this product has made my skin feel.  My skin is soft to the touch and the product has a nice scent as well.  I would continue to order from this supplier for future purchases.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just received my third order of the Sano Vitamin C Serum with bonus free Eye Gel. These products really improve my skin in tone, texture and firmness. Other products, no matter what they claim, always make my skin break out. The Sano Serum not only didn&#x27;t cause blemishes, it improved my skin so much that, for the first time I can remember, I was pleased with it. I even received compliments from others. I love that I cannot feel the Sano Serum on my skin once it dries, and it dries quickly.  I was loving the Sano Vitamin C Serum and Eye Gel, when, after my first two purchases, I made the mistake of trying a seemingly similar product in order to get 2 ounces of serum instead of one. Big Mistake! As soon as I felt this other product I realized I should have stuck with Sano. This other product felt heavy, slippery and oily in contrast to the light, pure, nearly water-thin consistency of my Sano Serum. No matter how thinly applied, the non-Sano serum caused blemishes every time I used it. It also made my skin feel oily the entire time it was on my skin. In the future I will not be swayed by other product offers. I strongly recommend the Sano Vitamin C Serum.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Already ordered my second bottle can&#x27;t beat the price. Skin looks and feel great.</li>
            <li> My 2nd order of this stuff within 1 week. It&#x27;s amazing and I highly recommend it. There is something very special about this serum and the eye cream because it shows immediate firming results. I will never stop using it.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! Great product. Goes smoothly onto skin and I can wear it right underneath my makeup!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery! I love this stuff. It works perfectly for my face.</li>
            <li> Used daily this Serum does create younger looking skin.</li>
            <li> A few weeks after I started using the serum, my skin felt ok and I actually thought I saw some improvements. Over time however, I notice that my skin is extremely dry and my pores very pronounced. I&#x27;ve tried using a very strong moisturizing cream along with it but this does not make a difference.  I ordered another bottle but really have to stop using it as my skin is very unhappy. Sorry I don&#x27;t have more positive results&lt;br /&gt;to report ........I was really hoping that I would.</li>
            <li> I liked this stuff at first til I realized it was making me break out. Will no longer touch the stuff. Not sure if it was the eye serum or the vitamin C serum that caused this however.</li>
            <li> Completely satisfied with purchase.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  Makes your skin feel fresh and moisturized. I will definitely but again</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I&#x27;ve noticed a new glow to my skin and more even tone.  I also love the eye cream.  It&#x27;s very cooling and refreshing.  My eyes were becoming rather sleepy and tired looking.  Now the look more alert and rested.</li>
            <li> I love the sano products I&#x27;ve seen the results that i was looking for. thank you very much.</li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle and very happy with this product. I wash my face twice daily and use this product after washing and before putting on my moisturizer. Since I&#x27;ve started using this serum, about 2 months ago, there&#x27;s been a noticeable firming of my double chin and cheeks, and a healthier tone to my face, overall. In fact, I noticed the improvements after only a few weeks. It isn&#x27;t oily and soaks in very quickly. I love this serum and will keep buying it for myself; I don&#x27;t know if I can live without it now.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product, I loved it already! It&#x27;s not sticky and it&#x27;s easily absorbed. The smell is fine as well. I would definitely purchase this again! Very nice product!</li>
            <li> My problem is more so with the packaging than the product itself. Like some other reviewer, my serum dispenser was bent- seems like the little tube was way too long but they just jammed it in the bottle anyway. The product refused to come out, but I didn&#x27;t want the hassle of returning it for a new one, so i just cut the extra bit off. I tested it again, this time for the serum (very thin consistency) to shoot out wayyy too fast. Now I have to be really sure it&#x27;s directly aimed at my palms, or risk losing some excess to wherever the heck it decides to squirt, since the pump doesn&#x27;t go just halfway like I want (so I always have a bit extra with each use). The pump is a good idea, just not so good in practice.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t notice a difference after using the serum, but hopefully with continued use. The eye gel thing has a nice consistency and smells like cucumbers. However, don&#x27;t expect any moisturisation - although it is refreshing for summer.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about three weeks and I really like it. My skin texture seems to be improving it feels and looks smoother. My skin also looks brighter and have noticed that some darker spots on my face have lightened up considerably. Last but not least my skin has had no negative reaction to this product. I look forward to seeing what long term use of this serum does for my skin.</li>
            <li> Fast Service, Great Product!</li>
            <li> This is the about the fourth or fifth bottle of sano vit c serum that i have purchased and it has become a regular part of my skin care regimen. I think it is an effective product for anyone who wants to turn back or slow down wrinkles, dark spots and fine lines. I love this product and will continue to use it as long as it remains affordable. The eye serum also works amazing.</li>
            <li> Great deal with bonus eye cream. The vitiamin C is great&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this again as well&lt;br /&gt;Sano products work really well for a great price&lt;br /&gt;Nothing is going to make wrinkles go away totally, It just smoothes your look&lt;br /&gt;Unless you get plastic surgery and look crazy, I would recommend looking natural at your best</li>
            <li> The vitamin C serum evaporates into my skin quickly and it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling. Also, I love the eye cream.</li>
            <li> I love this product and will rebuy!</li>
            <li> I could see the difference with just using the product for first time.The skin feels very hydrated and smooth and bright.In daytime I mix it with my moisturiser and apply it.Will continue buying it..</li>
            <li> Try this product! I am 41 and was looking for something that would improve my skin.  I look 10 years younger after only a few months.  Worked great for me.</li>
            <li> Love how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> The serum itself doesn&#x27;t smell bad, but it doesn&#x27;t have the same orange/citrus smell that I associate with Vitamin C serums. It&#x27;s got a slightly chemical scent, but isn&#x27;t unpleasant. The eye cream it came with is nice and smells better than the serum (smells kind of like aloe vera). The cream feels soothing and glides right on. You don&#x27;t need a lot of it! Believe me, just a dab is good for under both eyes.</li>
            <li> I really like this vitamin c serum it makes your face feel soft,,,,the eye cream is good aswell.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Sano vitamin c serum combo for the past few months. It makes my skin smooth with a healthy glow. One friend of mine went on and on about how good my skin looks. So, I bought her a bottle and told her my secret. She loves the serum too. Great value. Great product.</li>
            <li> Bought this combo &amp; have just started to use it.  First of all the pump did not work.  When I removed it from the bottle, it was bent into.  I was able to cut it at the bent section &amp; now the product spews everywhere.  Secondly the product is watery &amp; very hard to work with.  I do not like this Sano  Vit C &amp; cannot recommend it to anyone.  I noticed on another review, the problem with the pump was mentioned again.&lt;br /&gt;This product was a waste of my time &amp; money.......it absolutely did not work as stated!!!  VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!!</li>
            <li> Works for me! Waited to review until I could give accurate feedback, I love this product! Used in conjunction with diet, exercise and supplements, my skin looks incredible. Really! I have always looked younger than my age, but I struggled w/ acne and the scars they left behind. Not to mention red, broken capillaries around my nose. This product has lightened, brightened and smoothed my face so that it has never looked better!</li>
            <li> Like the product but dislike the new dispenser. Have to open up bottle every time I use it. Preferred dropper method as before</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been wanting to try a vitamin C serum and came across this based on all the good reviews. I must say, I love this stuff. It&#x27;s not like other oils that leave your face feeling sticky or wet. The product absorbs quickly making it perfect to use in the morning or evening. I especially like that I can use it under my makeup without looking greasy. My skin feels amazing and is truly glowing. I would highly recommend this serum and I especially like the eye cream. It makes my face feel amazing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this two times a day for almost two weeks and I can already see a difference. I have some fine lines on my forehead and my laugh lines are pretty deep but since I&#x27;ve started using this stuff my wrinkles are barely visible and my laugh lines are plumping up!!</li>
            <li> I have been searching for something I can afford and that works, never thought I would find it.  But the search is over!! If you are on the fence about this product,  get off and order NOW. I tried just the vitamin c serum first and couldn&#x27;t believe the results,  started using on half my face so I could see f it would change,  didn&#x27;t take long and I was using all over, couldn&#x27;t believe the difference,  the softness was fantastic, left a review and they gave me a free offer for the bonus eye cream.  It&#x27;s almost like the instant botox and smells like cucumbers,  I have found my new serum and eye cream, both are so amazing, hope it stays this price for awhile but now even if it goes up I will continue with this. Can&#x27;t say enough good about these products. Thank you Sano</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product and love the bonus Eye Cream even more!  The Eye Cream is actually a gel which I prefer because I have oily skin.  Makes my under eye area feel tight and youthful.  Thank you for the amazing products!!!</li>
            <li> I love vitamin C serum. My skin is oily. My face has wrinkle, age and pimple spot. I have very dark circle in my eye. This is a Vitamin C serum and eye cream with reasonable price for my age Spots, Dull Skin, Hyper pigmentation, Sagging Skin. It brightens my skin and fades age spots. I can say I see much difference. All I can say is TRY VITAMIN C SERUM - you will love the results.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle and I can see the difference in my skin. I always get complements on my skin and how it glow. Love It</li>
            <li> I started using this C Serum, 3 months ago. I have seen a big improvement in my skin, especially for age spots</li>
