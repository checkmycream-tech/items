            <li>These are a must if you are doing your own nails!  </li>
            <li>I was very happy with quick response and happy outcome.</li>
            <li>No lint and a good texture.  </li>
            <li>Good to remove polish</li>
            <li>When I contacted the seller, they were more than happy to send another box or refund me the cost that I paid.</li>
            <li>But, there are so many in the package!  </li>
            <li>Love them!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s better than the wipes you get from SensatioNail !</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I do my own gel nails at home.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice being able to just &#x27;wipe&#x27; up your nails.  </li>
            <li>these are my favorite nail wipes, prefer these over the IBD nail wipes which resemble a sponge that I like to use for ombre effects.</li>
            <li>These work much better than cotton.</li>
            <li>These are great for getting your nails ready to polish.</li>
            <li>Love the feel of my nails after I use them.</li>
            <li>The OPI one is nice and durable :) I use it to prep and clean my nails for gel polish.</li>

            <li>I received this item quickly but it was not what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>First I though these tissues are soaked with nail polish remover!</li>
            <li>but they are just the right size.</li>
            <li>Much better than using paper towels, because they have absolutely no lint.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t really absorb the nail polish remover, and I have to use two or three to remove polish from just one nail.  </li>
            <li>Dry out VERY quickly while using; takes 2 or 3 to do both hands or feet.</li>
            <li>These guys absorbed all of my remover which prevented them from doing the actual job.</li>
            <li>They are indeed lint free, but their practically little pieces of dryer sheet.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t see much difference than using the cotton balls, I use one wipe for 2 nails, so for me, no much difference</li>

            <li> I was pretty disappointed in them.</li>
            <li> No more fuzz in your polish!</li>
            <li> They seem thin</li>
            <li> I use them to wipe my nails off and they leave nothing behind like cotton does.</li>
            <li> Does not leave any lint behind just what it said.</li>
            <li> These are just not good, unfortunately.  </li>
            <li> These are terrible little papers.  </li>

            <li> these are my favorite nail wipes, prefer these over the IBD nail wipes which resemble a sponge that I like to use for ombre effects. Only thing is I run out fast, so next time ill get 400 count.</li>
            <li> These work much better than cotton. They take the polish off so neatly! I will purchase ore!</li>
            <li> There are numerous squares in this box even though the box looks small in size.  Much better than using paper towels, because they have absolutely no lint.</li>
            <li> From the name, I thought that these would come pre-wetted with nail polish remover.  When they didn&#x27;t, I was disappointed, but I figured I should have done more research to find what I was looking for and I&#x27;d make the best of what I got.  These are just not good, unfortunately.  They don&#x27;t really absorb the nail polish remover, and I have to use two or three to remove polish from just one nail.  I was pretty disappointed in them.</li>
            <li> I do my own gel nails at home.  So, these or something without lint are really necessary.  But, there are so many in the package!  I only use a few at a time doing them myself.  That being said the product is great.  No lint and a good texture.  They seem thin but they are just the right size.</li>
            <li> These guys absorbed all of my remover which prevented them from doing the actual job. They are indeed lint free, but their practically little pieces of dryer sheet. Not useful at all.</li>
            <li> I received this item quickly but it was not what I was expecting. The description listed says that it has 200 wipes in the box but when I received it there were only 150 wipes included as listed on the box. When I contacted the seller, they were more than happy to send another box or refund me the cost that I paid. I was very happy with quick response and happy outcome.</li>
            <li> Dry out VERY quickly while using; takes 2 or 3 to do both hands or feet. Love the OPI removers, but this delivery system of very thin material in the packets doesn&#x27;t cut it.</li>

            <li> These are great! I use them to wipe my nails off and they leave nothing behind like cotton does. Love them!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s better than the wipes you get from SensatioNail ! Plus you get a lot of them. Whenever I use the sensationail one there were times it ripped. The OPI one is nice and durable :) I use it to prep and clean my nails for gel polish. Love it!</li>
            <li> Love these handy wipes that last forever and care for my talons!</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 of this 200 wipes boxes, but instead I got 3 of 150 wipes each which is great cause I got 50 wipes bous</li>
            <li> Does not leave any lint behind just what it said.</li>
            <li> These are great for getting your nails ready to polish. Love the feel of my nails after I use them. I will continue to purchase these wipes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice being able to just &#x27;wipe&#x27; up your nails.  It helps make for a quick &#x27;clean up&#x27;.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Perfect for using with shellac manicures. Best nail wipes I&#x27;ve bought and I would definitely recommend and buy them again.</li>
            <li> These are terrible little papers.  Not worth it.</li>
            <li> Good to remove polish</li>
            <li> First I though these tissues are soaked with nail polish remover! But discovered that, they are dry wipes&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t see much difference than using the cotton balls, I use one wipe for 2 nails, so for me, no much difference</li>
