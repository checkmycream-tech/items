            <li>I simply love this perfume!</li>
            <li>Amazing price for the 3.4 oz bottle.</li>
            <li>:) I also have the Incanto Shine perfume (which smells really great too), but I think it&#x27;s more of a &amp;#34;night&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I fell in love with this perfume, and am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>My first encounter with his product is at a club restroom (lol)..</li>
            <li>and i feel in love with the scent.</li>
            <li>As soon as I got it I sprayed some on my wrist and love the way it smells on me.</li>
            <li>I love this purfume and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with my order.  </li>
            <li>I am not a big fan of floral scents but this one is just a perfect blend of its notes without making it overwhelmingly flowery.  </li>
            <li>I just love this one --</li>
            <li>I love Incanto Charms.</li>
            <li>and I love this fragrance; always get compliments on it...</li>
            <li>I love most of the scents from the Incanto line and Charms is no exception.</li>
            <li>but I love it</li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s eau de toilette, the scent fades faster than a more concentrated scent</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on the third bottle and bought this one for my sister-in-law for Christmas after she gave me a compliment on how good it is!!</li>
            <li>I recently bought a bottle of Incanto Charms perfume and all I can say is I LOVE this product!!!!!</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>perfume and this is more of a &amp;#34;daytime&amp;#34; perfume..</li>
            <li>love this smell, so I bought it for a gift.</li>
            <li>I love the elegant flavor.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>I purchased my bottle of INCANTO CHARMS by SALVATORE FERRAGAMO at a much higher price at a high-end department store (the price here on AMAZON is really good).&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the bottle is simply exquisite!</li>
            <li>This fragrance is a nice sweet smelling pleasure to wear ....</li>
            <li>My purchase arrived sooner than I expected and the bottle was huge and it smelled so good!!</li>
            <li>or it&#x27;s too strong.</li>
            <li>good and original and delivery was fast also.</li>
            <li>The perfume may be a bit watered down to some, but for me it is perfect!</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this fragrance.</li>
            <li>I wish this would be available as an Eau De Parfume instead of an Eau De Toilette.</li>
            <li>Light, floral scent.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and clean.</li>
            <li>Its a light perfume that stays for a very long time which is great for me</li>
            <li>My friends has the original incanto charms and we compared it.</li>
            <li>The perfume is exactly what my wife wanted, but the top leaks.</li>
            <li>by far the best perfume i ever smelled...  got it as a sample from sephora about 7 years ago and ordered the 3.5 fl oz one from sephora for 75 bucks back then.  </li>
            <li>Still A clean scent however.</li>
            <li>At first I was leary about ordering it online because i didn&#x27;t want it to be watered down, but it is perfect!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s particularly good as a gift (although I don&#x27;t believe in buying perfume as a gift because it&#x27;s a very personal thing people should choose for themselves).</li>
            <li>sweet scent.</li>
            <li>very light scent and decent size bottle for the price,received my order as promised!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so delicious and fresh ... very subtle hints of the musk giving it that sexy kick beyond the sweetness.  </li>
            <li>This has such a nice light scent and for all occasions.</li>
            <li>It came by quick</li>
            <li>Nevertheless I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND that you ladies try this product!!!</li>
            <li>I will order again very soon!!</li>
            <li>It was totally worth considering I saved about $50 off of department store prices.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fresh and lifts my spirit.</li>
            <li>Beautiful scent that is not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>The spray nozzle was shooting to the right</li>
            <li>Our first shipment of this was not working right.</li>
            <li>Arrived very fast by mail.</li>
            <li>i first tried the body lotion</li>
            <li>After that first bottle, i found this on amazon</li>
            <li>It was first given to me as a gift.</li>
            <li>and it smells pretty.</li>
            <li>Incanto Charms is a light sweet scent that lasts all day long.</li>
            <li>Her husband bought it at macys or saks and he paid $70.00 for a large bottle.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery from Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>that the whole concept of this fragrance was well thought of.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Fast shipment.  </li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s to be expected. :)</li>
            <li>especially if you&#x27;re the type that likes a light fragrance that doesn&#x27;t overwhelm the people standing close to you, but at the same time, not too light that people wouldn&#x27;t notice (if that makes sense).  </li>
            <li>Very feminine.</li>
            <li>I saved so much money</li>
            <li>The smell is very diluted and not lasting compare to original.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s my favorite among all the other INCANTO fragrances that Ferragamo has produced.</li>
            <li>this is my second choice to have on hand for special occasions.</li>
            <li>I usually pair it up with a vanilla lotion (like the Body Shop&#x27;s vanilla bliss lotion) and I smell AMAZING afterwards.</li>
            <li>scent is mainly white floral with a blend of passionfruit giving it that sweet and alluring character.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this cologne, however, this one seemed like it was watered down.</li>
            <li>I tried all the perfumes there and this particular perfume got stuck in my head lo..</li>
            <li>My favorite scent, doesn&#x27;t mess with my allergies.</li>
            <li>This is normally VERY expensive in the department store and I was able to get the same amazing scent for a lower price!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a fresh smelling perfume.</li>
            <li>I love how it looks with its cosmic-looking cap and the combination of blue and pink colors of the bottle.  </li>
            <li>Smells just like the sample I had, doesn&#x27;t bother my allergies, I&#x27;m very sensitive to scents.</li>
            <li>I have asthma, so I am very sensitive to smells, but this one does not bother me at all.  </li>
            <li>This perfume is the exact same as you would buy in the store.</li>
            <li>the first bottle was smaller in size...</li>
            <li>Your smell shouldn&#x27;t linger in a room, as romantic as that sounds, it means you have on way too much</li>
            <li>I love the dry down on the skin ...</li>
            <li>I ordered Incanto Shine last year as a gift someone in their early 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>You can barely smell anything even after spraying a lot.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely not into perfume that are overpowering and completely out</li>
            <li>Very green, slightly citrus a refreshing thing to wear to wake up or to refresh after a long day of work before you go out to a movie.</li>

            <li> The only drawback, the fragrance does not last long.</li>
            <li> The only con is that the fragrance does not last long.  </li>
            <li> It lasts a long time and I always get compliments.</li>
            <li> but you can wear it all year long!!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the smell seems the same but it fades out really fast</li>
            <li> Not sure how long it last.</li>
            <li> It was only a few days before Christmas.  </li>
            <li> Watered down.</li>
            <li> I wish they have a eau de parfum version of this because it doesn&#x27;t last as long as the other expensive eau de parfum(minus one star for that).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and feminine and you won&#x27;t get tired of using a perfume with this scent!!!</li>
            <li> After purchasing this product, I heard a lot of feedback from friends that buying perfume online could be risky since you are not completely sure that what you&#x27;re getting won&#x27;t be watered down.</li>
            <li> I also read all the feedback from past buyers, and I won&#x27;t lie</li>
            <li> , I started to feel a bit anxious that I was one of those that would be ripped off.</li>
            <li> Not sure if i still can return it, if i can i would.</li>
            <li> Tough to find in stores and hope I can continue finding it on line.  </li>
            <li> Well I was completely wrong.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> Too bad, I was really really disappointed.</li>
            <li> I will just have to go to a department store and pick it up :(</li>
            <li> cuz i hate to re-apply perfume thru out the day.</li>

I also read all the feedback from past buyers, and I won&#x27;t lie, I started to feel a bit anxious that I was one of those that would be ripped off. Well I was completely wrong. The perfume may be a bit watered down to some, but for me it is perfect! It lasts a long time and I always get compliments. I fell in love with this perfume, and am very satisfied with my purchase. It was totally worth considering I saved about $50 off of department store prices. I would definitely buy from them again!</li>
            <li> i first tried the body lotion cuz it was on clearance at jcpennys and i feel in love with the scent. So I bought the perfume  on amazon. It came in three days. As soon as I got it I sprayed some on my wrist and love the way it smells on me. Its a light perfume that stays for a very long time which is great for me cuz i hate to re-apply perfume thru out the day.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this cologne, however, this one seemed like it was watered down. It didn&#x27;t smell the same and had a different odor throughout the day. Too bad, I was really really disappointed. I will just have to go to a department store and pick it up :(</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift and the person whom received is very satisfied and happy...smells very nice. good and original and delivery was fast also.</li>
            <li> by far the best perfume i ever smelled...  got it as a sample from sephora about 7 years ago and ordered the 3.5 fl oz one from sephora for 75 bucks back then.  After that first bottle, i found this on amazon and ive been ordering from here ever since,  wayyyy cheaper and smells the same.</li>
            <li> This is another one of my favorites. This perfume lasts the wholeee day. It&#x27;s such a fresh smelling perfume. My cousin has me hooked on this perfume. And the price is great. Her husband bought it at macys or saks and he paid $70.00 for a large bottle. Amazon has a great price on it.</li>
            <li> I ordered Incanto Shine last year as a gift someone in their early 20&#x27;s. She loved it. I gambled this year by trying this one. She said both are very similar and she loves this one too. Arrived very fast by mail.</li>
            <li> I love this purfume and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with my order.  This is normally VERY expensive in the department store and I was able to get the same amazing scent for a lower price!  Incanto Charms is a light sweet scent that lasts all day long. At first I was leary about ordering it online because i didn&#x27;t want it to be watered down, but it is perfect!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this fragrance. It&#x27;s fresh and lifts my spirit. Amazing price for the 3.4 oz bottle. Fast delivery from Amazon.com. The only drawback, the fragrance does not last long. I wish this would be available as an Eau De Parfume instead of an Eau De Toilette.</li>
            <li> I purchased my bottle of INCANTO CHARMS by SALVATORE FERRAGAMO at a much higher price at a high-end department store (the price here on AMAZON is really good).&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the bottle is simply exquisite! I love how it looks with its cosmic-looking cap and the combination of blue and pink colors of the bottle.  The design gives the impression that the whole concept of this fragrance was well thought of.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is mainly white floral with a blend of passionfruit giving it that sweet and alluring character.  I am not a big fan of floral scents but this one is just a perfect blend of its notes without making it overwhelmingly flowery.  I love the dry down on the skin ... so delicious and fresh ... very subtle hints of the musk giving it that sexy kick beyond the sweetness.  This scent is not overpowering, can be used anytime and anywhere without being offensive.  I just love this one -- it&#x27;s my favorite among all the other INCANTO fragrances that Ferragamo has produced.</li>
            <li> This a great scent.  The only con is that the fragrance does not last long.  You will have to reapply.</li>
            <li> This perfume is the exact same as you would buy in the store. Beautiful fragrance and my boyfriend loves it on me! Fast shipment.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> My friends has the original incanto charms and we compared it. The smell is very diluted and not lasting compare to original.</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume 5 years ago, still love it!!!!!</li>
            <li> My wife got the lotion version of he perfume for Christmas and loved it. Our first shipment of this was not working right. The spray nozzle was shooting to the right and it wasn&#x27;t a spray but a stream of perfume. Amazon was awesome and sent us a replacement that was perfect</li>
            <li> I love Incanto Charms. It was first given to me as a gift. This is my 2nd time buying it. It&#x27;s not overpowering and it smells pretty.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd bottle I&#x27;ve owned...the first bottle was smaller in size...great price and I love this fragrance; always get compliments on it...</li>
            <li> Watered down. You can barely smell anything even after spraying a lot.</li>
            <li> I love most of the scents from the Incanto line and Charms is no exception. I have a love-hate relationship with a male co-worker who says this and Shine both smell like fruity trash (in the literal sense) but I love it and my husband does as well so I suppose, like everything, it&#x27;s a matter of personal opinion. Because it&#x27;s eau de toilette, the scent fades faster than a more concentrated scent would but that&#x27;s to be expected. :)</li>
            <li> I bought a perfume like this before when i was at the airport in Singapore and loved it, and wanted to get one which i did from this store. Unfortunately the smell seems the same but it fades out really fast and it&#x27;s not the same as the one i bought before. Not sure if i still can return it, if i can i would.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and clean. It&#x27;s the only perfume I&#x27;ve used for several years now. I&#x27;m definitely not into perfume that are overpowering and completely out does the woman that wears it. Your smell shouldn&#x27;t linger in a room, as romantic as that sounds, it means you have on way too much or it&#x27;s too strong. That will not be an issue with this scent. You can&#x27;t go wrong! It&#x27;s particularly good as a gift (although I don&#x27;t believe in buying perfume as a gift because it&#x27;s a very personal thing people should choose for themselves).</li>
            <li> It would suite a specific taste. Very green, slightly citrus a refreshing thing to wear to wake up or to refresh after a long day of work before you go out to a movie. Not at all a CK1 clone. Still A clean scent however.</li>
            <li> I simply love this perfume! I&#x27;m on the third bottle and bought this one for my sister-in-law for Christmas after she gave me a compliment on how good it is!! She loves it as well!</li>
            <li> Tough to find in stores and hope I can continue finding it on line.  This has such a nice light scent and for all occasions.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is a nice sweet smelling pleasure to wear .... this is my second choice to have on hand for special occasions.</li>
            <li> My favorite scent, doesn&#x27;t mess with my allergies. Also, it&#x27;s a great price. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I recently bought a bottle of Incanto Charms perfume and all I can say is I LOVE this product!!!!! My first encounter with his product is at a club restroom (lol).. I tried all the perfumes there and this particular perfume got stuck in my head lo.. and I searched this up on amazon upon arriving home.. :)  It&#x27;s light and feminine and you won&#x27;t get tired of using a perfume with this scent!!! I think it is best suited for spring/summer but you can wear it all year long!! I usually pair it up with a vanilla lotion (like the Body Shop&#x27;s vanilla bliss lotion) and I smell AMAZING afterwards. :) I also have the Incanto Shine perfume (which smells really great too), but I think it&#x27;s more of a &amp;#34;night&amp;#34; perfume and this is more of a &amp;#34;daytime&amp;#34; perfume.. I wish they have a eau de parfum version of this because it doesn&#x27;t last as long as the other expensive eau de parfum(minus one star for that). Nevertheless I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND that you ladies try this product!!! especially if you&#x27;re the type that likes a light fragrance that doesn&#x27;t overwhelm the people standing close to you, but at the same time, not too light that people wouldn&#x27;t notice (if that makes sense).  I would purchase another bottle once I run out!! the bottle looks good too!! I&#x27;m also planning o trying the Incanto heaven next, hope it&#x27;s good.. lol.</li>
            <li> very light scent and decent size bottle for the price,received my order as promised!&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with my purchase , Will definately order again in the future and passing the word,,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You!!!</li>
            <li> Beautiful scent that is not overwhelming.  I have asthma, so I am very sensitive to smells, but this one does not bother me at all.  Light, floral scent.  Very feminine.</li>
            <li> My purchase arrived sooner than I expected and the bottle was huge and it smelled so good!! I will order again very soon!! I saved so much money</li>
            <li> love this smell, so I bought it for a gift. Not sure how long it last. will have to ask the recipient and get back to yall</li>
            <li> great scent, i love it.</li>
            <li> The perfume is exactly what my wife wanted, but the top leaks. She&#x27;s tried everything to make it stop, but it can&#x27;t be helped.</li>
            <li> I got this gift for my girlfriend because she was talking about it.  It was only a few days before Christmas.  It came by quick and well she&#x27;s a happy girl.</li>
            <li> I love the elegant flavor.</li>
            <li> sweet scent. love it.</li>
