            <li>I&#x27;m just really happy with this stuff.</li>
            <li>good product</li>
            <li>I think this is a feel good product.</li>
            <li>Lasers don&#x27;t work for me because I&#x27;m fair.  </li>
            <li>It had really good reviews</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product for the money</li>
            <li>and she is also having good results.</li>
            <li>u will be satisfied!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m already satisfied after two use!</li>
            <li>And its amazing.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find this effective at all.</li>
            <li>Get a good pair of tweezers, watch your favorite 45min.</li>
            <li>The rest of my face is okay as my hair is more sparse and not as dense but my upperlip has always been a nightmare.</li>
            <li>and you just might love the difference.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I will probably buy more if needed.</li>
            <li>will update this review after I wax a couple more times.  </li>
            <li>(most of which is probably&lt;br /&gt;forged), and no legitimate endorsements.</li>
            <li>so I tried it and it works fantastic!  </li>
            <li>my chin feels smooth with no ingrown hairs!  </li>
            <li>It works better than all the rest do.  </li>
            <li>this realize you have to do something more than shaving</li>
            <li>and I am quite satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t have to buy more if it didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>I waxed most of my arms and shaved what didnt come off.</li>
            <li>In waxed areas the decrease growth is the most noticeable.</li>
            <li>this was very useful and effective.</li>
            <li>It has a very mild smell that is not offensive, and it made my skin feel very smooth.  </li>
            <li>Nair is pretty good for removing hair, and it does go beneath the skin&#x27;s surface.  </li>
            <li>So I can&#x27;t really complain, it&#x27;s good stuff.  </li>
            <li>I used \\&quot;smooth away\\&quot; on my face before applying the cream.  </li>
            <li>Eventually bought an at home hair removal system that uses a light and it turned out to be a dream.</li>
            <li>and I have noticed significant regrowth reduction.</li>
            <li>Then along came NoNo, which I excitedly bought thinking this would solve my problem.  </li>
            <li>hope this review was useful to you!</li>
            <li>It certainly didn&#x27;t hurt to try, but I am hoping it will gradually work better.</li>
            <li>Not a bad product.  </li>
            <li>IT was super embarrassing and when I would shave my legs</li>
            <li>I probably have enough Kalo left over to do a good 6 or 7 more</li>
            <li>The waxing might sting but it is so worth it to see the results.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m very pleased and will continue to use it until I get complete results!  </li>
            <li>After the hairs are removed I apply Nisim Kalo lotion, which is usually right after my morning shower.  </li>
            <li>Those hairs have now stopped growing and in only two months, as the hair was very fine.</li>
            <li>This really makes me excited to see how this is going to pan out over several more</li>
            <li>First of all, when i paid for my purchase</li>
            <li>Just enough to make it worthwhile for me.</li>
            <li>I do it this way because the hair follicles are most open after a hot shower.  </li>
            <li>I tried this product after removing unwanted hair with an epilator and it really works!  </li>
            <li>My mom uses it too, and she suggested waxing the hair off first and then epilating/</li>
            <li>: follow the instructions (apply 3 times the day you wax and 3 times the next day), be patient (it says it takes about 5 waxes and applications to see results), wax/epilate every two weeks to reduce regrowth even more efficiently</li>
            <li>If a skin product can actually make you feel better ..</li>
            <li>After shaving legs, underarm n bikini area I apply it three times on the first day</li>
            <li>i will buy again this product if i needed ;)</li>
            <li>THe second time I used it on my arms, I tweazered the hairs off since I wanted to see if it would be better than shaving and waxing.</li>
            <li>I used the cream as told and my arms are even better than last time.</li>
            <li>besides in another six months it&#x27;ll be pretty much gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My body hair was pretty much running my life.</li>
            <li>(I was using an epilator but that resulted in a large amount of ingrowing hairs.)  </li>
            <li>It started out as one or two in my twenties and eventually grew into a large patch on my chin.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a HUGE difference in the way the hair grows back.  </li>
            <li>but i didn&#x27;t notice any real inhibition of the hairs on my legs.</li>
            <li>It gets much easier as the months go by.</li>
            <li>and I gave it a fighting chance by using the whole tube.</li>
            <li>This product saved me so much time in the morning.</li>
            <li>it really works</li>
            <li>I expected better than that...</li>
            <li>This stuff is cheap and doesn&#x27;t help with facial hair at all.</li>
            <li>I gave this product two stars because the cream is very silky and does moisturize your skin, however, there was no change in hair growth as the product claims.  </li>
            <li>but it never did really get rid of the hair.</li>
            <li>I still use my NoNo in the hopes that it is killing some whiskers too, but it is the Kalo cream that really helps.   </li>
            <li>I also bought the Kalo ingrown hair treatment which works really well too, but I haven&#x27;t had to use it for weeks now.  </li>
            <li>My situation: I had really hairy legs.</li>
            <li>Like most women with PCOS I want to rid myself of the excess hair, so anything that remotely works is heaven sent.  </li>
            <li>I really cant wait to go through this again.</li>
            <li>waste of money honestly..</li>
            <li>but my chin hairs have been completely eliminated!!!  </li>
            <li>We all must learn the particular tips and tricks to enhance what we want and minimize what we don&#x27;t and this cream DOES work to a certain extent for me.</li>
            <li>I have seriously no problems,</li>
            <li>This product actually does exactly what it says!</li>
            <li>, she is very professional and much better than the previous one.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled with the results, just soft, smooth skin and no more repulsive blemishes; I consider it money well spent.  </li>
            <li>;, because I didn&#x27;t think it was normal to have hair there.</li>
            <li>I use it mainly for facial hair that i remove with a cream hair remover and its been doing great on thin hair.</li>
            <li>The hair is not black anymore, thank god, and its much thinner and lighter.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It takes some serious time before you start seeing the amazing results, but 6-8 months in</li>
            <li>However, just in my one use of applying it 6 times, it really didn&#x27;t make a dent in how much was left over.  </li>
            <li>The first product I&#x27;ve used that I can actually feel working, and see results.  </li>
            <li>So far I am sold on this product!</li>
            <li>Received this product, not sure it is doing as good of a job as expected.</li>
            <li>I havent noticed significant less hair with the Nisim Kalo Post Epilating Lotion, but what it has done is lessened the ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t reduce hair nearly as well when shaving, but it does reduce the shaving bumps on my sensitive legs dramatically.  </li>
            <li>so it is probably too early to tell.  </li>
            <li>I have tried the Nisim Kalo spray but prefer the lotion, as it keeps my skin soft.    </li>
            <li>After years of shaving hair, especially on the legs, it can become very course.  </li>
            <li>However, I just don&#x27;t have the time/patience to do this (same for the NoNo on my legs) and it is so much easier and faster to shave.  </li>
            <li>but you have to let it grow in so far before that works.  </li>
            <li>this is my review for just using it one time so far.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a little over two weeks, and I have noticed a significant reduction of hair on my face.</li>
            <li>You should take into account how you remove your unwanted hair and how strong and thick the hair is.  </li>
            <li>I seemed to have less whiskers, but there were still a lot (and new ones sprouting out all the time) and after  years of using it nothing much changed</li>
            <li>a little bit goes a looong way so that price is worth it.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s just my hair/skin in general.</li>
            <li>I would reccomend this product to anyone who waxes regularly or has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have only used the product once so far</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m seeing big patches on my legs where hair has completely stopped growing.</li>
            <li>The hair grows much slower, finer, and far less.  </li>
            <li>I switched to just bleaching the hair, but my hair grows so fast that I had to bleach every other day - 30 mins each time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it twice so far and the hair keeps getting lesser and lesser every time.  </li>
            <li>first time I used on my upper lip, I had to rewax (though there was noticeably less hair)</li>
            <li>I no longer wax, but there is a definite reduction in hair apparent from when I did wax.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t seem to have as much hair anymore in the center of my back especially.  </li>

            <li> I switched to just bleaching the hair, but my hair grows so fast that I had to bleach every other day - 30 mins each time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice so far and the hair keeps getting lesser and lesser every time.  </li>
            <li> first time I used on my upper lip, I had to rewax (though there was noticeably less hair)</li>
            <li> I no longer wax, but there is a definite reduction in hair apparent from when I did wax.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t seem to have as much hair anymore in the center of my back especially.  </li>
            <li> At first I was putting it on at least twice (sometimes three) times per day, and now it seems that just once a day in the morning is enough.  </li>
            <li> This is seriously a dream come to me, especially because Spring Break is approaching very soon!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll last a long time.</li>
            <li> I was a Vaniqa user and was tired of paying full price for it....</li>
            <li> My face is smooth and I can actually go with out makeup with out feeling really uncomfortable about my face.</li>
            <li> It does burn a little, but I have extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> The first few times are painful and take time but after that I MUCH prefer plucking once a week and having baby soft, pure skin rather than shaving everyday.</li>
            <li> It takes a long time to see results, and you just have to be patient.  </li>
            <li> I have excess facial hair due to PCOS (poly cyctis ovarian syndrome).  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t break me out, and it didn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li> Definitely takes a few tries and well I only use it on my face so its lasted for quite awhile.</li>
            <li> Only down side...</li>
            <li> In the past, I have waxed my back and shoulders, but this was discouraging because the hair would start growing back in around 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> (I should mention that I also tried in the past the medical prescription product to inhibit facial hair growth, can&#x27;t remember the name of it, and it did not work at all for me.  </li>
            <li> anyway, the hair grew back BLACK.</li>
            <li> The areas I had to shave, the hair is growing back a little slower and soft than usual.</li>
            <li> I notice that if I use it then the hair grows back a little slower and thinner</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see how it works out after the next few applications.  </li>
            <li> it was what I expected I recommend 100.%</li>
            <li> This is such a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I tried electrolysis, but it was going to be multiple visits at $25/hour, and she just talked nonstop which I didn&#x27;t like because it seemed to waste a lot of time (at $25/hour).  </li>
            <li> I have thick, black, curly moustache hair and sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I use such a small amount at one time that tube</li>
            <li> n three times on the second day giving few hours gap in btw!  </li>
            <li> As described in other reviews it takes lots of patience n</li>
            <li> and you only use a small amount each time on the face.  </li>
            <li> I was too, but it was to the point where I felt i didn&#x27;t have any other option, so I went for it</li>
            <li> My hair usually grows back with a vengence</li>
            <li> Personally I wouldn&#x27;t waste it on your legs or bikini line as I feel it would take forever and just waste a lot of cream.</li>
            <li> I have very few whiskers left, less and less all the time now, and</li>
            <li> I used the product as instructed and did not see any less hair growth over time.</li>
            <li> I used this for a year and a half</li>
            <li> I have had a problem for many years with horrible coarse chin and upper lip hairs that just seemed to be getting worse as I aged.</li>
            <li> Well....I have black hair</li>
            <li> But in my defense the hair was a little dark</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not entirely sure how this works, I&#x27;m not really worried about that, because I&#x27;m so thankful it works</li>
            <li> As dark as the hair on my head!</li>
            <li> The hair grows back eventually but slowly!</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> This might be because I hadn&#x27;t used the cream for longer than a few months.</li>
            <li> and now I just tweeze the few hairs that come up and use Kalo after.</li>
            <li> So after just a few weeks I would start getting \\&quot;stubble.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> Dont waste time on this lotion.</li>
            <li> So I just resigned myself to shaving them everyday.  </li>
            <li> and  I continued to have to shave everyday</li>
            <li> It owns a waste of money and time if your removal method is shaving.</li>
            <li> This went on for about a year until I finally came across this product after hours of searching the internet for a solution to my secret problem.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly though, I completely understand if you are skeptical about this product.</li>
            <li> other thing is that the tube of lotion is very small.  </li>
            <li> , I am Mexican/Chaldean, so the ethnicity&#x27;s are known for having thick dark hair.</li>
            <li> I was young and naive unfortunately...</li>
            <li> tv show once a week with a small magnifying mirror</li>
            <li> If you buy this product and expect your hair to stop growing after using the first tube, then you will be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I remove my hair as usual using Nair or Veet hair remover.  </li>
            <li> Will update after few months!</li>
            <li> I have spent a fortune on lazer hair removal and still have unwanted hair and whats worse is the ingrown hair.  </li>
            <li> I started with this small area</li>
            <li> It smells pretty terrible for a few seconds until it sinks into skin.</li>
            <li> it hardly matters.</li>
            <li> Yeah, it&#x27;s expensive, I&#x27;ve spent $50 every two to three weeks for over a year now</li>
            <li> and I noticed that my hair came in just as thick as before.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone looking to slow or stop hair growth.</li>
            <li> The hair was black and thick on stomach - A girl&#x27;s worst nightmare.&lt;br /&gt;So as you can imagine, I continued to shave everyday because I was so self-conscious about the black stumble.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s ridiculous compared to how hairy I</li>
            <li> And at about $200 for one or two little tubes, it&#x27;s ridiculously expensive.)  </li>
            <li> If you are still a little skeptical I would suggest doing your research or looking up some youtube videos on</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found it very hard to get rid of thicker hairs though so might take quite awhile for those</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I use it mainly for facial hair that i remove with a cream hair remover and its been doing great on thin hair. Definitely makes it grow slower and shorter. I&#x27;ve found it very hard to get rid of thicker hairs though so might take quite awhile for those but I am seeing improvement. Definitely takes a few tries and well I only use it on my face so its lasted for quite awhile. Personally I wouldn&#x27;t waste it on your legs or bikini line as I feel it would take forever and just waste a lot of cream.</li>
            <li> First of all, when i paid for my purchase i thought i was getting 4 oz. for $30, but I only got 2 oz.  The product says to continue hair removal like always and to rub this cream into your skin. I have done this repeatedly since i received the product and it has not worked.  I am so sick of plucking and rubbing this product in.  I would not recommend anyone pay for this hair removal product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find this effective at all. I followed the instructions but i didn&#x27;t notice any real inhibition of the hairs on my legs. It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Use it as the instructions tell you, after epilation, and this sruff works like a dream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several months now, and I must say I like the way it works.  I no longer wax, but there is a definite reduction in hair apparent from when I did wax.  It doesn&#x27;t reduce hair nearly as well when shaving, but it does reduce the shaving bumps on my sensitive legs dramatically.  I would reccomend this product to anyone who waxes regularly or has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have only used the product once so far so it is probably too early to tell.  It certainly didn&#x27;t hurt to try, but I am hoping it will gradually work better.</li>
            <li> I am a guy. I have thick, black, curly moustache hair and sensitive skin therefore I HATE shaving there. The rest of my face is okay as my hair is more sparse and not as dense but my upperlip has always been a nightmare. I hate having a grey shadow even AFTER I shave. So for about a year I have been plucking that area. I know, ouch, but it&#x27;s not as bad as you think. The first few times are painful and take time but after that I MUCH prefer plucking once a week and having baby soft, pure skin rather than shaving everyday. It gets much easier as the months go by. I will never go back to shaving. I use this cream as directed after I pluck. I notice that if I use it then the hair grows back a little slower and thinner but it&#x27;s not a drastic difference. Just enough to make it worthwhile for me. One time I did go back to shaving and I noticed that my hair came in just as thick as before. This might be because I hadn&#x27;t used the cream for longer than a few months. In any case, for me, the cream works but it&#x27;s not a miracle cream. We all must learn the particular tips and tricks to enhance what we want and minimize what we don&#x27;t and this cream DOES work to a certain extent for me. Try it out. ps... plucking is not that bad. Get a good pair of tweezers, watch your favorite 45min. tv show once a week with a small magnifying mirror and you just might love the difference.</li>
            <li> Received this product, not sure it is doing as good of a job as expected.</li>
            <li> After reading some of the comments left about Nisim Kalo hair inhibitor, I thought I would leave a review about my experience with this product.  If you buy this product and expect your hair to stop growing after using the first tube, then you will be disappointed.  It takes a long time to see results, and you just have to be patient.  I have been using Nisim Kalo lotion for over six months and this is what I recommend.  I remove my hair as usual using Nair or Veet hair remover.  (I was using an epilator but that resulted in a large amount of ingrowing hairs.)  Nair is pretty good for removing hair, and it does go beneath the skin&#x27;s surface.  After the hairs are removed I apply Nisim Kalo lotion, which is usually right after my morning shower.  I then use it after every shower for about three days.  I do it this way because the hair follicles are most open after a hot shower.  I don&#x27;t usually use it three times a day, although I may use it once again before I get into bed, on the first day of hair removal only.  When the hair stops growing, it stops growing in patches.  I have areas on my legs where the hair has stopped growing, but I still have stronger hairs that grow back and need to be removed.  I have also used Nisim Kalo on my chin, where I had noticed a couple of hair.  Those hairs have now stopped growing and in only two months, as the hair was very fine. I have tried the Nisim Kalo spray but prefer the lotion, as it keeps my skin soft.    The product does work, but it doesn&#x27;t work immediately.  You should take into account how you remove your unwanted hair and how strong and thick the hair is.  After years of shaving hair, especially on the legs, it can become very course.  If you persevere you will see results, but be prepared to be patient as it may take up to a year before all hair is gone.      I hope this review is helpful to anyone who is unsure about purchasing Nisim Kalo lotion.</li>
            <li> I tried this product after removing unwanted hair with an epilator and it really works!  The hair grows much slower, finer, and far less.  I&#x27;ve used it twice so far and the hair keeps getting lesser and lesser every time.  So I can&#x27;t really complain, it&#x27;s good stuff.  :)</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a little over two weeks, and I have noticed a significant reduction of hair on my face. I have noticed that I still have some very coarse hairs. I would recommend this product to anyone looking to slow or stop hair growth.</li>
            <li> This product absolutly DOES NOT WORK!!! I followed the instructions to the T and there was NO change in hair growth and I gave it a fighting chance by using the whole tube. I applied 3 times a day as well as the following days as instructed after I pulled hair from the root and all it did was break me out! I would hate for anyone else to be as disipointed as I was/am. Too bad they don&#x27;t have a - rating. I&#x27;d give this product a -5.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working great. I use it after my laser treatments and after plucking and my face is staying smoother longer. I use such a small amount at one time that tube I&#x27;ll last a long time. I will probably buy more if needed. Only down side... It smells pretty terrible for a few seconds until it sinks into skin.</li>
            <li> This product saved me so much time in the morning. virtually no hair came back and what did took longer to come back. i defiantly recommend this product. it really works</li>
            <li> this was very useful and effective. My sister has very coarse hair and this product helped her keep it to a minimum</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work at all and it caused me severe itching ... I expected better than that...waste of money honestly..</li>
            <li> Not a bad product.  I used \\&quot;smooth away\\&quot; on my face before applying the cream.  It does burn a little, but I have extremely sensitive skin.  It didn&#x27;t break me out, and it didn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  It has a very mild smell that is not offensive, and it made my skin feel very smooth.  We&#x27;ll see how it works out after the next few applications.  It DOES say on the bottle that it will take 4-6 hair removal and application cycles before you will see results.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 2 months for my legs and upper lip (and a week on my underarms) and I have noticed significant regrowth reduction. My mom uses it too, and she suggested waxing the hair off first and then epilating/waxing every two weeks to help reduce hair growth even more.&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used on my upper lip, I had to rewax (though there was noticeably less hair) after two weeks and then three weeks after that, and now I just tweeze the few hairs that come up and use Kalo after. I also feel like I don&#x27;t have to wax my legs as often as I used to (I used to have to wax every 2 weeks)&lt;br /&gt;Tips: follow the instructions (apply 3 times the day you wax and 3 times the next day), be patient (it says it takes about 5 waxes and applications to see results), wax/epilate every two weeks to reduce regrowth even more efficiently</li>
            <li> The first product I&#x27;ve used that I can actually feel working, and see results.  If a skin product can actually make you feel better .. if that&#x27;s possible .. this one does.</li>
            <li> The reason I have three is because its been a month or lets say twice I have used it as directed! So far I&#x27;m very pleased and will continue to use it until I get complete results!  After shaving legs, underarm n bikini area I apply it three times on the first day n three times on the second day giving few hours gap in btw!  The hair grows back eventually but slowly! As described in other reviews it takes lots of patience n u will be satisfied!  I&#x27;m already satisfied after two use! Will update after few months! Again great products comes with great patience</li>
            <li> I bought this b/c I was a Vaniqa user and was tired of paying full price for it....&lt;br /&gt;However, you get what you pay for. This stuff is cheap and doesn&#x27;t help with facial hair at all. I will be going back to using Vaniqa.</li>
            <li> good product it was what I expected I recommend 100.% i will buy again this product if i needed ;)</li>
            <li> I gave this product two stars because the cream is very silky and does moisturize your skin, however, there was no change in hair growth as the product claims.  I used the product as instructed and did not see any less hair growth over time.</li>
            <li> I have use it for a while. And its amazing. I have thicker hair so it takes a longer time.</li>
            <li> I think this is a feel good product. Hasn&#x27;t worked for me, but I think people think it works for awhile as you tackle eliminating hair growth. Don&#x27;t buy!</li>
            <li> This product actually does exactly what it says! I am usually very skeptical when it comes to these things.  I am a guy who has some back and shoulder hair.  I am getting close to 30 and it seems to be growing thicker and thicker.  In the past, I have waxed my back and shoulders, but this was discouraging because the hair would start growing back in around 3 weeks.  So after just a few weeks I would start getting \\&quot;stubble.\\&quot;  I read the reviews here on Amazon and decided to give Kalo a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last time I had my back waxed I applied this lotion as recommended (six times a day for two days).  I have noticed a HUGE difference in the way the hair grows back.  Instead of it growing back in 3 weeks and be fully grown in by about 6 weeks, it has taken about 4 months for it to fully grow back.  Now that it has grown back, I have noticed that overall it seems noticeably thinner than it was.  I don&#x27;t seem to have as much hair anymore in the center of my back especially.  This really makes me excited to see how this is going to pan out over several more waxes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other thing is that the tube of lotion is very small.  However, just in my one use of applying it 6 times, it really didn&#x27;t make a dent in how much was left over.  I probably have enough Kalo left over to do a good 6 or 7 more waxes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update this review after I wax a couple more times.  So far I am sold on this product!</li>
            <li> This product does nothing except soften your skin a bit.&lt;br /&gt;I looked up all of the ingredients and there is only one which&lt;br /&gt;can be deemed as having a &amp;#34;slight estrogen effect&amp;#34;. And that&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t equal hair removal. This is such a waste of money. And you can tell this company&lt;br /&gt;thrives on customer feedback (most of which is probably&lt;br /&gt;forged), and no legitimate endorsements. It&#x27;s just&lt;br /&gt;skin softening lotion!!!</li>
            <li> I used this for a year and a half and my results got slimmer and slimmer but it never did really get rid of the hair. Eventually bought an at home hair removal system that uses a light and it turned out to be a dream. Dont waste time on this lotion.</li>
            <li> I have had a problem for many years with horrible coarse chin and upper lip hairs that just seemed to be getting worse as I aged. It started out as one or two in my twenties and eventually grew into a large patch on my chin. Lasers don&#x27;t work for me because I&#x27;m fair.  I tried electrolysis, but it was going to be multiple visits at $25/hour, and she just talked nonstop which I didn&#x27;t like because it seemed to waste a lot of time (at $25/hour).  So I didn&#x27;t go back.  I couldn&#x27;t pluck the hairs because they would become ingrown.  So I just resigned myself to shaving them everyday.  But I could always feel the stubble which bothered me and they would sometimes become ingrown too.  Then along came NoNo, which I excitedly bought thinking this would solve my problem.  Well after using NoNo for over six months I noticed it did help in that I seemed to have less whiskers, but there were still a lot (and new ones sprouting out all the time) and after  years of using it nothing much changed and  I continued to have to shave everyday and I still suffered from ingrown hairs quite often. Then about six months ago I did an online search for hair removal and discovered Kalo.  It had really good reviews so I tried it and it works fantastic!  I have very few whiskers left, less and less all the time now, and my chin feels smooth with no ingrown hairs!  I still use my NoNo in the hopes that it is killing some whiskers too, but it is the Kalo cream that really helps.   I also thought I would try the Kalo on my legs and I even bought a depilator.  However, I just don&#x27;t have the time/patience to do this (same for the NoNo on my legs) and it is so much easier and faster to shave.  I guess I just don&#x27;t care enough about the hair on my legs.  And besides, I figure it will be so much more expensive if I&#x27;m using it on my legs too.  So to save money, I&#x27;m just saving the cream and spray for my face.  At first I was putting it on at least twice (sometimes three) times per day, and now it seems that just once a day in the morning is enough.  I also bought the Kalo ingrown hair treatment which works really well too, but I haven&#x27;t had to use it for weeks now.  So I am really happy with the Kalo products and hopefully my experience can help someone else suffering from this really annoying and unsightly problem.   (I should mention that I also tried in the past the medical prescription product to inhibit facial hair growth, can&#x27;t remember the name of it, and it did not work at all for me.  And at about $200 for one or two little tubes, it&#x27;s ridiculously expensive.)  Update 06/16/15:  About a year ago, I couldn&#x27;t take it anymore because I started breaking out with ingrowns again.  So I found another electrologist, she is very professional and much better than the previous one.  Yeah, it&#x27;s expensive, I&#x27;ve spent $50 every two to three weeks for over a year now but my chin hairs have been completely eliminated!!!  We&#x27;re still working on the upper lip hairs which were never as coarse as the chin hairs and don&#x27;t cause ingrowns for me . . . but I want them GONE.  I&#x27;m thrilled with the results, just soft, smooth skin and no more repulsive blemishes; I consider it money well spent.  So the bottom line is that I still recommend Kalo, it does work, just not 100%.  If you want a permanent solution, electrolysis is the only way to go.  Anything else, including lasers, is a temporary fix.</li>
            <li> Product didn&#x27;t work. It owns a waste of money and time if your removal method is shaving. I went online and found elyn which works with any method of hair removal</li>
            <li> I bought this product to use on my upper lip facial hair.  For years I bleached it but that stopped working.  I tried for awhile to wax it--that was too painful. And I tried the pencil shavers that are out now but you have to let it grow in so far before that works.  So I decided to try this.  Well....I have black hair so I knew from the start if this was going to work I would have to be persistent and patient!  I have been using this every 5 days or so since last February (2012)  and I like it!  It works better than all the rest do.  I&#x27;m not hair free yet, but the amount of hair has decreased and the hair that does come in is fairer.  I put no time limit on it.  It&#x27;s a good product for the money and you only use a small amount each time on the face.  I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> My situation: I had really hairy legs. Like boy hairy. IT was super embarrassing and when I would shave my legs would get seriously irritated and it was just bad all the time. Someone recommended this to me because I was already epilating and I don&#x27;t know how I ever lived without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes some serious time before you start seeing the amazing results, but 6-8 months in I&#x27;m seeing big patches on my legs where hair has completely stopped growing. On my arms and my pits the hair has all but stopped. It&#x27;s unreal how well it has worked.  What hasn&#x27;t stopped growing is turning so blonde it hardly matters. I can go days without shaving now and still wear shorts. That&#x27;s ridiculous compared to how hairy I was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do get a lot of ingrown hairs but that&#x27;s just my hair/skin in general. When I use PFB Vanish I have seriously no problems, besides in another six months it&#x27;ll be pretty much gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re thinking about getting this realize you have to do something more than shaving, you have to pluck, epilate, wax, or something like that. If you&#x27;re thinking about this realize it&#x27;s going to take like a year depending on your situation and you might not even see noticeable results for like 2-4 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not entirely sure how this works, I&#x27;m not really worried about that, because I&#x27;m so thankful it works but from what I&#x27;ve heard: it kills about 10% of the hair off each time you use it starting around the second or third time you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of luck to you!</li>
            <li> I am on my second tube and will by third.  I have excess facial hair due to PCOS (poly cyctis ovarian syndrome).  I have spent a fortune on lazer hair removal and still have unwanted hair and whats worse is the ingrown hair.  Like most women with PCOS I want to rid myself of the excess hair, so anything that remotely works is heaven sent.  I havent noticed significant less hair with the Nisim Kalo Post Epilating Lotion, but what it has done is lessened the ingrown hairs.  My face is smooth and I can actually go with out makeup with out feeling really uncomfortable about my face.</li>
            <li> My story is simple,&lt;br /&gt;I made the terrible mistake of shaving my stomach hair, the area under the belly button a.k.a &amp;#34;Happy Trail&amp;#34;, because I didn&#x27;t think it was normal to have hair there. I was young and naive unfortunately... But in my defense the hair was a little dark and I didn&#x27;t realize I could just bleach it with Jolen bleach! (Which I would also recommend).&lt;br /&gt;But anyway, the hair grew back BLACK. As dark as the hair on my head! Mind you, I am Mexican/Chaldean, so the ethnicity&#x27;s are known for having thick dark hair. I know some people say that hair growing back thicker/darker after shaving is a myth, but from MY experience it is NOT a myth. The hair was black and thick on stomach - A girl&#x27;s worst nightmare.&lt;br /&gt;So as you can imagine, I continued to shave everyday because I was so self-conscious about the black stumble. This went on for a while until I started to get ingrown hairs, so I stopped that immediately. I switched to just bleaching the hair, but my hair grows so fast that I had to bleach every other day - 30 mins each time. My body hair was pretty much running my life. This went on for about a year until I finally came across this product after hours of searching the internet for a solution to my secret problem.&lt;br /&gt;In short, it works. I have only used it once and I am quite satisfied with the results. The hair is not black anymore, thank god, and its much thinner and lighter. This is seriously a dream come to me, especially because Spring Break is approaching very soon! (I&#x27;m 18 by the way)&lt;br /&gt;Honestly though, I completely understand if you are skeptical about this product. I was too, but it was to the point where I felt i didn&#x27;t have any other option, so I went for it and I am very very happy that I did. If you are still a little skeptical I would suggest doing your research or looking up some youtube videos on it.&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review was useful to you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my chin after tweezing.  I started with this small area so I wouldn&#x27;t have to buy more if it didn&#x27;t work.  It doesn&#x27;t.  I am still tweezing the same hairs at the same rate as before.  Disappointing.</li>
            <li> this is my review for just using it one time so far. I waxed most of my arms and shaved what didnt come off. I followed the instructions and rubbed in the cream 3x for 2days and I am very happy. My hair usually grows back with a vengence but there is a definate slowing, especially in the areas the wax removed the hairs. In waxed areas the decrease growth is the most noticeable. The areas I had to shave, the hair is growing back a little slower and soft than usual. I really cant wait to go through this again. The waxing might sting but it is so worth it to see the results. i would suggest this to any one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update: THe second time I used it on my arms, I tweazered the hairs off since I wanted to see if it would be better than shaving and waxing. I used the cream as told and my arms are even better than last time. I do have some areas I&#x27;m going to have to tweazer off again but nothing like before. The hairs are softer and lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tweazered my eyebrows and I had almost nothing grow back at all. Also, I did my moms eyebrows and she is also having good results. I&#x27;m just really happy with this stuff. Plus you dont need to put a lot on. a little bit goes a looong way so that price is worth it.</li>
