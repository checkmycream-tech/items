            <li>For one thing many people have fragrance allergies.  </li>
            <li>Lovely smell, not greasy.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>scented one as well, but I think this is my favorite.</li>

            <li>These days strong fragrances are out.</li>
            <li>The product was fairly priced, arrived promptly, and my only regret is that I didn&#x27;t order more :)</li>
            <li>This product is hands down an awesome product.</li>
            <li>I will not be ordering this again unless I can find a fragrance free product.</li>

            <li>Not too strong, just right.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The vitamin B5 in this (panthenol) is also nice not just for retaining moisture, but also has been studied to possibly help rheumatoid arthritis and could be stress-reducing.</li>
            <li>and my feet always end up feeling soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>I l also love that this cream is made from natural ingredients.</li>

            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and keeps my hands soft.</li>
            <li>Most hand creams in retail stores are full of questionable ingredients; even more so for store brands.</li>
            <li>I would really encourage people to check this out at a store before ordering it if you haven&#x27;t used it before to see if you like the scent.  </li>

            <li>This is decently priced considering</li>
            <li>That being said, someone ought to give the old Watkins company a modern understanding of fragrance.  </li>
            <li>This product is so strong smelling that even a small amount worn and all will be aware of my presence.  </li>
            <li>The aloe and green tea description sounded nice and mild, but I can&#x27;t get past the smell.  </li>

            <li> I like the consistency of this lotion, but the Aloe &amp; Green tea scent is just too overpowering for me. It&#x27;s hard to even comment on the effectiveness of the moisturizing properties, since I can&#x27;t use it due to the scent. Disappointed. :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m rating this only on the scent, which I found unbearable.  I can&#x27;t quite describe it, only that it smells like a lemon scented cleaner for the house.  And, the scent stays on my hands even after washing them a couple of times.  I would really encourage people to check this out at a store before ordering it if you haven&#x27;t used it before to see if you like the scent.  Other than that, it&#x27;s an OK hand lotion - a little thick and hard to rub in, but I could have lived with that.  It was just the Aloe and Green Tea scent that I just couldn&#x27;t handle.</li>
            <li> This is a nice, non-greasy hand cream. I do like the smell, but it&#x27;s rather strong.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love Watkins hand creams and this is my favorite and I can never seem to find it anywhere. So I was delighted when I found vendors selling it on Amazon. I have found all their hand creams to be effective and smell great, but this one is heavenly. The product was fairly priced, arrived promptly, and my only regret is that I didn&#x27;t order more :)</li>
            <li> Have use Watkins witch hazel for years.  This is fabulous hand cream!</li>
            <li> Love this scent, nice on skin.</li>
            <li> This leaves the skin wonderfully soft.  Absorbs well.  That being said, someone ought to give the old Watkins company a modern understanding of fragrance.  These days strong fragrances are out. For one thing many people have fragrance allergies.  This product is so strong smelling that even a small amount worn and all will be aware of my presence.  P U!  Aloe and green tea implies mild scent.  Wrong.  I will not be ordering this again unless I can find a fragrance free product.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get enough of this - works great especially during the winter, when hands get chapped and dry.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Great smell too!!</li>
            <li> Lovely smell, not greasy.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I had gotten a kit with a small sample of it in it previously.  This cream is awesome, it has a light scent which is not overpowering and really moisturizes my hands when I need it.  In my job, I am constantly washing my hands to they tend to be dried out, and it is hard to find a lotion/cream that is not greasy and this one is not super greasy and absorbs pretty quick into my skin.</li>
            <li> I live in the North East and my hands get very dry. This is a nice thick cream with great coverage. It smells nice and works well.</li>
            <li> Most hand creams in retail stores are full of questionable ingredients; even more so for store brands. This is decently priced considering it&#x27;s 99% natural, with vitamins and botanical extracts and oils. Synthetic ingredients never fee like your hands are getting the moisture they need. But this feels replenishing, naturally. There are a few other scents, but Aloe &amp; Green Tea smells wonderful to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vitamin B5 in this (panthenol) is also nice not just for retaining moisture, but also has been studied to possibly help rheumatoid arthritis and could be stress-reducing. Sounds good to me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The non-greasy formula really is nice. There&#x27;s nothing worse to me than greasy fingers. It&#x27;s a creamy consistency, not watery, and the calendula &amp; shea butter are so soothing to my hands.</li>
            <li> All winter long, my hands show the effects of the cold weather.  This hand cream said paraben free, phthalates free, dyes free, and propylene glycol free.  Having natural ingredients instead of chemicals is important to me.  I also like shea butter very much. So far, this one has not caused a skin rash itself.  It is creamy and leaves my hands feeling silky, not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I plan to reorder in see if it &#x27;wears well&#x27; over time (no untoward effects for my skin).</li>
            <li> Cream works great but this scent is awful to me. I will purchase again in maybe the lemon cream scent.</li>
            <li> The aloe and green tea description sounded nice and mild, but I can&#x27;t get past the smell.  It is moisturizing, but the scent gives me a headache.  If you like strong smells, this is the one for you!</li>
            <li> Nice smell and does not leave you with a greasy feel. It absorbs quickly and keeps my hands soft. I keep a tube in my purse so I can use it every time I wash my hands while I&#x27;m at work or away from home.</li>
            <li> This product is hands down an awesome product. It does not leave your hands greasy, just nice and moisturized. Also, it is has a great smell! Not too strong, just right. I would say, this is an excellent product for just about anyone!</li>
            <li> As a bit of a germophobe, I am continuously washing my hands and I cannot stand that watery, soupy lotion. I love the J. R. Watkins hand cream because it is an actual cream! Thick and even better, natural &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Very moisturizing but not greasy.</li>
            <li> Amazing for dry skin in the winter. I will definitely repurchase!</li>
            <li> This hand cream is great because it keeps my hands feeling just right and it has a nice smell. It doesn&#x27;t t leave my hands greasy or dry. This lotion is also 99 percent natural ingredients. I will be buying this all the time. Even the people I let use it wants to buy it ! The best thing about it is that you don&#x27;t need a lot of it on your hands.</li>
            <li> I carry a tube of this in my neverfull tote and every time I rub it into my hands,  someone comments on how great it smells.    My boss walked by my area and commented on how nice I smelled. He wanted to pick up the \\&quot;perfume\\&quot; for his wife. I told him it was only green tea hand cream and he was amazed.    I like the lemon scented one as well, but I think this is my favorite. I am almost done with this tube, but I plan on buying more of this scent. Many compliments.</li>
            <li> This hand cream is instantly moisturizing without being greasy - it would be appropriate for both hot and cold climates.  The scent is refreshing, clean and healthy-smelling (in a good way!)  The price is reasonable for the product and the packaging is attractive.  Recommended!</li>
            <li> This natural hand lotion is a wonderful addition my to purse contents. The scent is light, fragrant, and floral, without being overpowering. The non-greasy formula makes my hands feel amazingly soft. Love the lotion and definitely would encourage others to buy this product.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Non greasy and very moisturizing. Smells fantastic and leaves my hands baby smooth. Must have!</li>
            <li> My favorite hand/foot cream! I rub this on my feet each night before I go to sleep and my feet always end up feeling soft and smooth! One of my favorite aspects of this cream is that it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel. I l also love that this cream is made from natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Great hand cream, and the smell adds to the experience.</li>
