            <li>Otherwise it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li>they don&#x27;t hold any kind of shape to the finger and rub against the polish themselves !!</li>

            <li>I love these!</li>
            <li>Nice concept</li>
            <li>This is a good idea of a product to help keep nails safe when polishing.  </li>
            <li>I received some kind of nail polish remover cups...</li>
            <li>Very cheap</li>
            <li>I have to take more caution in trying not to break these than keeping my nails from getting messed up.</li>
            <li>work for you the best way possible</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re okay</li>
            <li>The clips shift while you&#x27;re wearing them causing just as many smudges on nails as not using them at all.</li>
            <li>They would have got a five star if they packed them better .</li>
            <li>and they are too cute.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t appreciate not being able to track it</li>
            <li>I can do a lot more with my hands while my nails are drying.  </li>
            <li>When someone says they&#x27;re cheap, believe me, THEY ARE!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to fear anyone or anything ruining my nails anymore because it&#x27;s well-covered and protected by these adorable things.</li>
            <li>I should have known better than to buy these.</li>
            <li>Ok I wouldn&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li>I got them early so that was great.</li>
            <li>The top part can swivel and you can adjust it to fit the angle of your nail.</li>
            <li>and they crack easily.</li>
            <li>The clips bend and break easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok for nail painting, but not for protecting and using things right away!</li>
            <li>Cheaply made but easy to use.  </li>
            <li>*** because of how cheap they are and they were.  </li>
            <li>They all fit on my fingers.</li>
            <li>The nail polishin at home is more fun now with these cover kit</li>
            <li>Since they were so cheap we both threw them away.</li>
            <li>This are great, they make your nails dry quickly and you won&#x27;t ruin them</li>
            <li>love them absolute nail saver</li>
            <li>so they are pretty cheap</li>
            <li>u can actually use the bathroom while your nails are drying amazing</li>
            <li>:) The plastic is too cheap, but the product overall is worth of its price.</li>
            <li>They looked useful, but didn&#x27;t work well at all.  </li>
            <li>Ordered enough to give away to friends who really liked them also.</li>
            <li>so they didn&#x27;t lean more toward the left or right.</li>
            <li>but I was able to snap them back together with no problem.</li>
            <li>Love these bought them not really thinking they would work but would be worth a try and they are worth every penny</li>
            <li>I wish more buyers would put fourth the effort to let their customers track their orders.</li>
            <li>but i am overall quite pleased</li>
            <li>I love this product so much because it keeps my wet, manicured nails secure.</li>
            <li>These work really well.  </li>
            <li>I really like them,  </li>
            <li>Broke apart and does not protect nail very well.</li>
            <li>It also had no tracking info the whole time.</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t really do anything with them on anyway.</li>
            <li>(basically a plastic shield you attach to your fingers with hair clips), but what do you really expect.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li>This product worked very well and kept my nails from being exposed while I waited out the drying time.</li>
            <li>I actually really like this.</li>
            <li>The nail clips are very easy-to-use and very efficient in helping you not mess up your freshly painted nails.</li>
            <li>I dont think if it fit my skinny long fingers it would work anyway.</li>
            <li>Will be upgrading to a more expensive, reputable version.</li>
            <li>my mom and little goddaughter absolutely love them ^_^</li>
            <li>They move, so it actually messes up fresh nail polish.</li>
            <li>I normal smudge it a lot and this product does not help.</li>
            <li>Which is good because one was already broken when it arrived.</li>
            <li>They are flimsy and break easily and don&#x27;t even slightly protect your nails.</li>
            <li>I can see how these would be useful for some people, but, if you&#x27;re waiting for your nails to dry, and you want to do something with your hands, these aren&#x27;t the protective covers to help you with that.</li>
            <li>Other than that they really are a nice little gadget to have to keep your nails from getting ruined!</li>
            <li>Do not waste your time, money or mani on this stuff.</li>
            <li>If your just using them for home, they probably would work but stay completely still.</li>
            <li>I feel that it protects my nails quite a bit, and really acts as a reminder to myself that I recently painted my nails, Sometimes I wonder if my nails will accidentally bump the cover though--</li>
            <li>nothing so far.</li>
            <li>The clips hurt, and the shields either stick up too far or touch the nail, fouling up the polish.  </li>
            <li>These was not at all what I expected and I rarely use them.</li>
            <li>A few came broken but as for the rest they work good thanks</li>
            <li>specially if you have your kids around no more mess&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>And they do generally protect my nails.</li>
            <li>i barely use it because it tends to smudge my painted nails.</li>
            <li>Seems like you barely touch something &amp; the cover flips up.</li>
            <li>most of them were either disassembled or broken.</li>
            <li>Many arrived broken and in pieces</li>
            <li>Wasted my money and wasn&#x27;t worth sending back.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s far easier to just sit with my hands on the table for 10 minutes to allow the polish to dry.  </li>
            <li>these little clippy nail guard thingys work very well</li>
    </ol>

            <li> these little clippy nail guard thingys work very well</li>
            <li> They work pretty well, but they are hard to get on the bigger fingers.  </li>
            <li> They can still mess up wet nails if you move your fingers a certain way.  </li>
            <li> but when I opened up my package more than half of them were broken in some way</li>
            <li> I guess its so that it covers even extra long nails</li>
            <li> If you use these often, they won&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> The product came exactly as it was promised and there were none of the tip covers missing, i didn&#x27;t give 5 stars because it pinches my thumbs a little bit</li>
            <li> They are not perfect and a bit cheap</li>
            <li> like the title, i ended up receiving a different item that expected.</li>
            <li> Also, I have very small fingers, and the clips were almost too small to fit.</li>
            <li> I seen other people write that they only got one....</li>
            <li> Helps me dry my nails in no time without getting them chipped and damaged</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little cumbersome though, which I guess is what is necessary to protect nails from being smushed.</li>
            <li> However my one complaint is that the actual piece that covers your nail is really big.</li>
            <li> Came in a box that was crushed.</li>
            <li> I spent three dollars for one piece of plastic?</li>
            <li> It did help me not to smudge my nails when they are wet.</li>
            <li> They move on the fingers and made my job harder</li>
            <li> , I had to apply another coat of polish when the safety guard touched the wet nail and put a dent in a couple nails.</li>
            <li> Whomever package this item stuff all of the nail clamps in a very small package instead of spending an extra dollar for a larger package.</li>
            <li> Very cheap plastic:(</li>
            <li> Always helpful for the clumsy painter such as myself</li>
            <li> Used Scotch tape also to hold the covers down.</li>
            <li> When I tried to straighten them out they snapped in half.  </li>
            <li> i mess them up by making a smudge on them..</li>
            <li> Protector can touch nailpolish and mess it up.</li>
            <li> , I didn&#x27;t mess up my manicure.</li>
            <li> When they ate on if you move your fingert just a little bit your nail bumps it</li>
            <li> I decided after receiving these that it would be easier to just put my clients under the drying lamp a little longer rather than use them.  </li>
            <li> Some of the covers were a little joggly and had to be positons</li>
            <li> Wish the hinges were a little stronger.</li>
            <li> Item is crap - quality is exactly would I should have expected for such a ridiculously inexpensive item.</li>
            <li> waste you money and end up like me.</li>
            <li> Two was missing</li>
            <li> Waste of money</li>
            <li> so they don&#x27;t mess up all my hard work.  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed I paid for a set of ten and wanted all ten, we do have ten fingers not one.</li>
            <li> They arrived in less than 2 weeks!!</li>
            <li> Shipped slowly.</li>
            <li> Thin cardboard box inside small padded envelope and the cardboard box was smashed upon receiving the item.  </li>
            <li> I will say that they do become a slight bit uncomfortable on your fingers after awhile because they are clips.</li>
            <li> They were a little awkward to use.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with these and after testing them out a few times I&#x27;ve added them to the list of failed purchases.</li>
            <li> two arrived broken</li>
            <li> They also came packaged poorly.  </li>
            <li> I received this item broken..</li>
            <li> None of them were broken.</li>
            <li> I would like to review this product, however, I was sent the wrong one.</li>
            <li> So needless to say</li>
            <li> A bit silly, but they work for what they are supposed to.  </li>
            <li> KINDA SILLY BUT WORKS</li>
            <li> Quite disappointing.</li>
            <li> Do not buy awful quality do not work at all waste of money do not buy!</li>
            <li> but please do not send broken!!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very awkward, like fake toy nails.</li>
            <li> Is bad item , I don&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li> This is a piece of crap.</li>
            <li> hate it</li>
            <li> these are worthless.</li>
            <li> made like crap..</li>
            <li> I gave a set to my daughter-in-law, and she hated them too.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t wast money with this stupid cyprustec finger!</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t fits,doesn&#x27;t work and you will look like a stupid too!</li>
            <li> horrible items</li>
            <li> These things are absolutely terrible.</li>
            <li> nothing to say, it just terrible thing</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s ok for nail painting, but not for protecting and using things right away!</li>
            <li> Whomever package this item stuff all of the nail clamps in a very small package instead of spending an extra dollar for a larger package. When I received the items two of them were already broke when i open the package.</li>

            <li> I love these! Always helpful for the clumsy painter such as myself</li>
            <li> i bought them cuz eveytime i do my nails i mess them up by making a smudge on them.. horrible items</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with these and after testing them out a few times I&#x27;ve added them to the list of failed purchases. The clips shift while you&#x27;re wearing them causing just as many smudges on nails as not using them at all. Nice concept but it need A LOT of improvement.</li>
            <li> I really like them,  does what it&#x27;s suppose to.  They would have got a five star if they packed them better .</li>
            <li> these little clippy nail guard thingys work very well and they are too cute. my mom and little goddaughter absolutely love them ^_^</li>
            <li> Love these bought them not really thinking they would work but would be worth a try and they are worth every penny love them absolute nail saver u can actually use the bathroom while your nails are drying amazing</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed I paid for a set of ten and wanted all ten, we do have ten fingers not one.</li>
            <li> Item is crap - quality is exactly would I should have expected for such a ridiculously inexpensive item. Will be upgrading to a more expensive, reputable version.</li>
            <li> Shipped slowly. Came in a box that was crushed. Junk. Broke apart and does not protect nail very well. Protector can touch nailpolish and mess it up.</li>
            <li> This is a good idea of a product to help keep nails safe when polishing.  They can still mess up wet nails if you move your fingers a certain way.  They also came packaged poorly.  Thin cardboard box inside small padded envelope and the cardboard box was smashed upon receiving the item.  It is a good product for the price.  I don&#x27;t appreciate not being able to track it I wish more buyers would put fourth the effort to let their customers track their orders.</li>
            <li> I was expecting these items to be a piece of s*** because of how cheap they are and they were.  I seen other people write that they only got one.... Well I got 12. Which is good because one was already broken when it arrived. It also had no tracking info the whole time. Never purchasing these again and will not recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> It only came with one nail cover! i thought it was supposed to come with ten?? I spent three dollars for one piece of plastic? There is no way i&#x27;m ever gonna buy this again....don&amp;#34;t waste you money and end up like me. This is a piece of crap.</li>
            <li> This actually works!!! You can use it on your toes (just don&#x27;t walk with it)</li>
            <li> They work pretty well, but they are hard to get on the bigger fingers.  It did help me not to smudge my nails when they are wet.</li>
            <li> Great product specially if you have your kids around no more mess&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use and save time thank you</li>
            <li> I would like to review this product, however, I was sent the wrong one. I received some kind of nail polish remover cups...</li>
            <li> They are not as helpful as I thought they would be. I would not recommend them to friends. Too bulky.</li>
            <li> These things are absolutely terrible. They are flimsy and break easily and don&#x27;t even slightly protect your nails. I tried them out and my polish was smudged within seconds. Do not waste your time, money or mani on this stuff.</li>
            <li> My package came with only 9 nail covers for some reason. I can see how these would be useful for some people, but, if you&#x27;re waiting for your nails to dry, and you want to do something with your hands, these aren&#x27;t the protective covers to help you with that. You can&#x27;t even touch your phone with these clips on your fingers. They&#x27;re very awkward, like fake toy nails. Also, I have very small fingers, and the clips were almost too small to fit.</li>
            <li> Oh of course if there is something to make nail polish easier I will be ordering it. But his was a bust!</li>
            <li> Finally, i can do my nails at night!</li>
            <li> Do not buy awful quality do not work at all waste of money do not buy! If u must get a different brand or something</li>
            <li> They arrived in less than 2 weeks!! Haven&#x27;t had a chance to use them yet, but they look just like in the picture.  Seems like a great idea that looks like it will work well. And for the price!!!</li>
            <li> I received this item broken.. I think it&#x27;s a good idea but please do not send broken!!</li>
            <li> I got them early so that was great. None of them were broken. They all fit on my fingers. And they do generally protect my nails. However my one complaint is that the actual piece that covers your nail is really big. I guess its so that it covers even extra long nails but for me it was just big and bulky and I couldn&#x27;t really do anything with them on anyway. So needless to say, I didn&#x27;t mess up my manicure.</li>
            <li> I  only got 8  of them instead  10 and I have 10 fingers. Two was missing</li>
            <li> I thought that these would be awesome and so helpful but when I opened up my package more than half of them were broken in some way so they are pretty cheap</li>
            <li> The nail polishin at home is more fun now with these cover kit :) The plastic is too cheap, but the product overall is worth of its price.</li>
            <li> A bit silly, but they work for what they are supposed to.  I can do a lot more with my hands while my nails are drying.  They are not perfect and a bit cheap (basically a plastic shield you attach to your fingers with hair clips), but what do you really expect.  I like them and use them often.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made but easy to use.  I decided after receiving these that it would be easier to just put my clients under the drying lamp a little longer rather than use them.  They move on the fingers and made my job harder, I had to apply another coat of polish when the safety guard touched the wet nail and put a dent in a couple nails. If your just using them for home, they probably would work but stay completely still.</li>
            <li> When I received the product some were bent.  When I tried to straighten them out they snapped in half.  Very cheap plastic:(</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t wast money with this stupid cyprustec finger! doesn&#x27;t fits,doesn&#x27;t work and you will look like a stupid too! hate it</li>
            <li> The clips bend and break easily. If you use these often, they won&#x27;t last long. They were a little awkward to use.</li>
            <li> Does not work for piano fingers..... I dont think if it fit my skinny long fingers it would work anyway. Wish i read the  reviews.</li>
            <li> took like 1 month shipped from china,for the quality you know you can imagine cause its made in china.</li>
            <li> I ordered these. they came in 6 weeks. most of them were either disassembled or broken. Quite disappointing. When someone says they&#x27;re cheap, believe me, THEY ARE!</li>
            <li> The product came exactly as it was promised and there were none of the tip covers missing, i didn&#x27;t give 5 stars because it pinches my thumbs a little bit but i am overall quite pleased</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really work. Waste of money</li>
            <li> Helps me dry my nails in no time without getting them chipped and damaged</li>
            <li> This product worked very well and kept my nails from being exposed while I waited out the drying time.I will say that they do become a slight bit uncomfortable on your fingers after awhile because they are clips.Other than that they really are a nice little gadget to have to keep your nails from getting ruined!</li>
            <li> I love this product so much because it keeps my wet, manicured nails secure. I don&#x27;t have to fear anyone or anything ruining my nails anymore because it&#x27;s well-covered and protected by these adorable things.</li>
            <li> I actually really like this. I feel that it protects my nails quite a bit, and really acts as a reminder to myself that I recently painted my nails, Sometimes I wonder if my nails will accidentally bump the cover though-- nothing so far. Some of the covers were a little joggly and had to be positons so they didn&#x27;t lean more toward the left or right. Otherwise it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li> These was not at all what I expected and I rarely use them. I guess they do what they&#x27;re suppose to just not my cup of tea.</li>
            <li> I should have known better than to buy these. They don&#x27;t stay on. They move, so it actually messes up fresh nail polish.</li>
            <li> This are great, they make your nails dry quickly and you won&#x27;t ruin them</li>
            <li> I am a nail enthusiast and I have to say- these are worthless. They don&#x27;t actually protect my nails. I paid for plastic, that Im going to just throw away.</li>
            <li> nothing to say, it just terrible thing</li>
            <li> Theoretically it works well. The top part can swivel and you can adjust it to fit the angle of your nail. It&#x27;s a little cumbersome though, which I guess is what is necessary to protect nails from being smushed.</li>
            <li> made like crap.. they don&#x27;t hold any kind of shape to the finger and rub against the polish themselves !!</li>
            <li> They looked useful, but didn&#x27;t work well at all.  The clips hurt, and the shields either stick up too far or touch the nail, fouling up the polish.  Plus I couldn&#x27;t do a thing with them on!  I couldn&#x27;t grasp a glass to take a drink, couldn&#x27;t pick up anything since I could only use the pads of my fingers.  It&#x27;s far easier to just sit with my hands on the table for 10 minutes to allow the polish to dry.  I gave a set to my daughter-in-law, and she hated them too.  Since they were so cheap we both threw them away.</li>
            <li> A few came broken but as for the rest they work good thanks</li>
            <li> Wasted my money and wasn&#x27;t worth sending back. its falling apart, its just hair clips attached to a plastic thing</li>
            <li> Ok I wouldn&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> The nail clips are very easy-to-use and very efficient in helping you not mess up your freshly painted nails.</li>
            <li> like the title, i ended up receiving a different item that expected. it was still a nail protector but it was wasn&#x27;t clip-on like the picture. Its  a plastic dome with a rubber tip that has an opening  to insert your fingers. i barely use it because it tends to smudge my painted nails. i wish i got what the picture shows though :c</li>
            <li> Many arrived broken and in pieces</li>
            <li> When I do my nails I normal smudge it a lot and this product does not help.</li>
            <li> Had to wrap them with velcro straps to keep them from flipping up. Wish the hinges were a little stronger. Seems like you barely touch something &amp; the cover flips up. Used Scotch tape also to hold the covers down. Ordered enough to give away to friends who really liked them also.</li>
            <li> KINDA SILLY BUT WORKS</li>
            <li> Is bad item , I don&#x27;t like it</li>
    </ol>
