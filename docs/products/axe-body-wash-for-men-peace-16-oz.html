    <ol>
            <li>It is a great purchase for the price and thank you Amazon for delivering this to my door rather than having to carry it from the store!  </li>
            <li>For the price and amount, one (for the majority of the time) receives a wonderful product.  </li>
            <li>This fragrance is very nice!</li>
            <li>Great scent at a great price.</li>
            <li>It lathers great, and the smell lasts for quite a while.</li>
            <li>Works and smells great.</li>
            <li>You will smell great, trust me.</li>
            <li>LOL.</li>
            <li>Axe Peace Shower Gel smells great and cleans quite well.  </li>
            <li>contrast, this body wash lathers great and does a great job of cleaning.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a pleasant smell that lasts through the day.</li>
            <li>and I must say that both of them are equally pleasant to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li>if it smelled good.</li>
            <li>The product lathers well and does a good job.</li>
            <li>Hugs are good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;She didn&#x27;t like the fact it was Axe, but she loved it after I showered.</li>
            <li>He smells good when he gets out of the shower...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved Axe body wash</li>
            <li>nice shower gel,  does a good job cleaning and smells great as well.</li>
            <li>Good shower gel and very refreshing</li>
            <li>My college son is very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Excellent choice for a body wash and has a scent many will enjoy.</li>
            <li>love the smell!</li>
            <li>Bought this for my husband - love the scent!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an okay scent, but not at all pleasant.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s honestly amazing.</li>
            <li>Nice smell to it.  </li>
            <li>Not for ourselves but for the men in our lives because men &amp;#34;didn&#x27;t wear that kind of thing.&amp;#34</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is nice and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>My brother said it lathers up nicely</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need cologne as the deodorant leaves a nice but not overpowering scent.  </li>
            <li>Peace is a good product to be sure, but is it more than twice as good as the budget brand?</li>
            <li>This one has a good lather, but I have had better.  </li>
            <li>This is a healthy constructed bottle with a good portion of a nicely crafted and smelling bath</li>
            <li>shower gel has a nice woodsy manly smell to it.</li>
            <li>, I also have to admit that Axe products are quite good with the largest number of and most sophisticated fragrances.</li>
            <li>It smells earthy, warm, cuddly, spicy, and sexy.  </li>
            <li>but it is strong and musky!  </li>
            <li>After rinsing and toweling off the shower get left a very nice clean scent on my skin; and the bathroom smelled great, too!</li>
            <li>Try this body wash on your guy, he will be clean and good smelling.</li>
            <li>Cool design on packaging and good scent</li>
            <li>Husband says that it has a nice lather to it and makes his skin feel clean and nice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I&#x27;ve used AXE products before I wasn&#x27;t surprised that this one is a very good product, too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I&#x27;ve used AXE products before I wasn&#x27;t surprised that this one is a very good product, too.</li>
            <li>Girls love the scent too.</li>
            <li>Love the product but ad was confusing.&lt;br /&gt;Thought i was getting 3 for the price of one.  </li>
            <li>But after being satisfied with the Anarchy deodorant, I thought I&#x27;d give Axe&#x27;s shower</li>
            <li>I hope that the marketing \\&quot;genius\\&quot; at Axe makes a lot of money, and I&#x27;m sure they do.  </li>
            <li>and we&#x27;re sure to appeal to the \\&quot;old\\&quot; generation or the rebellious one.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s better smelling stuff on the market.  </li>
            <li>Even Axe has made better products than this.</li>
            <li>Unlike cologne, I love the way Axe smells on men.  </li>
            <li>Instead, it screams &amp;#34;clean,&amp;#34; and I&#x27;m perfectly okay</li>
            <li>I love how Axe bottles their shower gel.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, he really likes this shower gel and told me that he would happily use it again.</li>
            <li>received fast, great product</li>
            <li>My Young Grandson Loved it!</li>
            <li>It lathers up really nice and gets you clean.</li>
            <li>Axe Peace is another very good fragrance that makes good lather and cleanses well with little greasy residue.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much gel to get the good suds either.  </li>
            <li>I remember when Axe first came out and it seemed like mostly we women were purchasing it!  </li>
            <li>It has a nice fragrance without overwhelming and does not take much to feel refreshed.</li>
            <li>Makes the skin feel clean and smooth!</li>
            <li>, this gel gets sudsy easily.  </li>
            <li>It has a strong citrusy note that lingers a bit afterwards.  </li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t find the temporary strong scent bothersome.</li>
            <li>It lathers well with not much required, smells good and cleans good.  </li>
            <li>It felt fine and didn&#x27;t irritate my skin</li>
            <li>Our inspiration for creating the &#x60;Make Love Not War&#x27; campaign for AXE Peace was knowing that our ability to bring guys and girls together could be used powerfully to have an impact on a huge scale.&#x27;</li>
            <li>The male of the house says this Axe &amp;#34;Peace&amp;#34; scent is great for waking you up in the morning.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy this body wash.</li>
            <li>Just because it is called &amp;#34;Peace&amp;#34; don&#x27;t expect it to have a light scent.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say that if you enjoy a stronger scent from your soap then this is up your alley.  </li>
            <li>Whatever the mystery ingredient is can be dealt with by having a good sense of humor with the ladies and/or looking ridiculously hot and neither of those have anything to do with higher priced soaps.</li>
            <li>I love it when my husband showers right before going to bed</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Peace&amp;#34; is by far my most favorite scent that Axe makes.  </li>
            <li>and I felt clean after my shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Be clean.</li>
            <li>Be clean.</li>
            <li>rinses clean and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue.</li>
            <li>Yes, that&#x27;s right!  </li>
            <li>While this body wash won&#x27;t necessarily make your irresistible to the object of your affections as the marketing campaign suggests, it does get you clean and smelling good.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I felt clean enough when I got out of the shower, so that has to be good for something, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried my first AXE product last year and though it worked great.</li>
            <li>Overall, a good product.</li>
            <li>this price, it&#x27;s not a bad deal.</li>
            <li>They may not want to leave the shower and that is not a bad thing.  </li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t over-powering but has enough of a masculine and pleasant smell to effectively deodorize and the right texture and consistency to smoothly clean.  </li>
            <li>I like when men smell fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>find the names and claims printed on products these days sometimes humorous, if not completely ridiculous, and this one is no exception.</li>
            <li>After using this product I would say the lather produced by AXE PEACE is adequate.</li>
            <li>However, once you begin working it into a lather be prepared for that mild fragrance to get quite a bit stronger.</li>
            <li>This is a good product that delivers more than sophomoric advertising slogans.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll most likely get some more.  </li>
            <li>In general, this kind of body wash lasts longer than soap, doesn&#x27;t slip out of your hand, is easier to work up into a lather and doesn&#x27;t leave a soapy residue in the shower stall like hand soap does.</li>
            <li>Almost every one of their products smells great and will continue to keep the user fresh while working in extreme conditions.</li>
            <li>I have used over a half a dozen of these gels and they all smell great and lather</li>
            <li>The scent is very masculine and refreshing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Where this gel is a real winner is the light hint of musk smell that it leaves.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave you smelling fresh smelling at all once you step out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Except for this review, please don&#x27;t use &amp;#34;club&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;seals&amp;#34; in the same sentence, let&#x27;s be nice out there!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a surprise that AXE is a nice quality product with a lasting and fresh scent that makes you feel like a man.</li>
            <li>Since Axe commercials seem to focus on the stud market alone, how fun for us to give it a whirl!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>BUT since I work in an industrial environment and need a product that will keep me fresh, I stick with AXE.</li>
            <li>Worth a try.</li>
            <li>/&gt;\\&quot;AXE PEACE, a unique fragrance so addictive it sets you up to make love, not war.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do wish that the gel were more concentrated because I need more gel of this brand to wash my body than other brands of shower gels that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>As any other Axe product, Axe Peace Shower Gel smells awesome, and that make me come back to Axe products again and again.</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s all a gimmick to promote the product to strapping young men full of hormones (unless they are gay),</li>
            <li>A product that actually makes boys want to take a shower and clean themselves deserves more than 5 stars.  </li>
            <li>and he loved how it smelled, just like other Axe products.  </li>
            <li>and some are $8 to $10, but there must be something extra special in the more pricey ones.</li>
            <li>This was right up my alley.</li>
            <li>If Unilever is genuinely aiming at generating unprecedented awareness of a healthy global message, thus encouraging young people to take simple but meaningful actions that will have a positive impact on the future of their communities, it would seem to me they would gladly AXE this message off this bottle.</li>
            <li>Luckily, it wasn&#x27;t that much but still worth</li>
            <li>The scent is not overpowering and leaves you with a pleasant smell (at least according to my wife) and a feeling of being clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a foamy body wash for men that does a decent job of getting you clean.  </li>
            <li>It is really a pleasing smell, very earthy, and not at all like a lot of shower gels that smell like cheap perfume.  </li>
            <li>No one will probably even notice it unless they get very very close to you.  </li>
            <li>This product smells so nice and really cleans my stinky mechanic husband after a long work day.</li>
            <li>What it smells like exactly, I can&#x27;t say.</li>
            <li>Being a fan of Axe products, this shower gel has not failed me since using it.  </li>
            <li>I was particularly interested in this AXE product since I stopped using hand soap in the shower a number of years ago and started using a shower gel (aka body wash) instead.</li>
            <li>I think women should smell pretty and men should smell like men.  </li>
            <li>Smells great, and the scent seems to last long.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it may be a deal breaker with some picky women who are cognizant of such things.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s exactly what this stuff smells like.</li>
            <li>I do not seeing myself running out to attain this particular shower gel again, mainly because Axe has so many other wonderful versions, such as Snake Peel, Excite, Rise and Deep Space.</li>
            <li>Well thankfully this one does come with a very \\&quot;detailed\\&quot; set of instructions printed right on the bottle: \\&quot;Squeeze gel out.</li>
            <li>Well thankfully this one does come with a very \\&quot;detailed\\&quot; set of instructions printed right on the bottle: \\&quot;Squeeze gel out.</li>
            <li>The AXE Peace campaign aims to generate unprecedented awareness of the peace message and encourage young people to take simple but meaningful actions that will have a positive impact on the future of their communities and the world they will inherit.</li>
            <li>But the Axe line is incredibly popular with early teen males, and my son is no exception.</li>
            <li>The container fits perfectly on my shower ledge and the wider base means a more sturdy position.</li>
            <li>The AXE PEACE Revitalizing Shower Gel I am reviewing comes in an ample 16 fluid ounce recyclable plastic bottle with an easy to use pop-up dispenser lid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has the same (strong) smell that all Axe products have</li>
            <li>He did mention that the scent was a little overpowering when putting it on in the shower, but if fades to a nice scent after being washed off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this soap.  </li>
            <li>He really likes it too.</li>
            <li>Shower gels aren&#x27;t something I use very often.</li>
            <li>I ordered this on the Amazon Vine for my son, and he really likes it.</li>
            <li>When you lather on the Axe Peace shower gel, you&#x27;ll feel like you&#x27;re soaring over ocean waters in a Greenpeace boat saving seals, while getting ready for the Club you&#x27;re about to go</li>
            <li>It is light, not fancy and also hasn&#x27;t caused anyone to tackle me in the middle of the supermarket.</li>
            <li>Who wants to smell like a ginger man cookie?</li>
            <li>It cleans body very well.</li>
            <li>I used about a half dollar sized drop of gel the first time, covering my body and arms, and then went with one more dab to take care of my legs and feet.</li>
            <li>The gel is fragrant but not overpowering, like many other Axe products.</li>
            <li>I like the masculine smell and evidently so does my family.</li>
            <li>I like the masculine smell and evidently so does my family.</li>
            <li>I must admit, the slick advertising of Unilever (parent company of Axe) is quite effective in the marketplace.</li>
            <li>Peace, a unique fragrance so addictive it sets you up to make love, not war&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Warning: unlimited female attention&amp;#34; probably grab the attention of consumers in a much younger age group than this</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t like to wear fragrances, but this is nice.</li>
            <li>When the get is initially squeezed out of the bottle it has a relatively mild scent.</li>
            <li>The main difference between this and both the shampoo and face wash is in the color.</li>
            <li>Not sure if it really &#x27;revitalizes&#x27; as it claims on the label, but I love this product like many other Axe Men products.</li>
            <li>It always seems like more work than simply using a bar of soap, as lazy as that may sound.</li>
            <li>I was bemused by the rich and deep aquamarine color, until I smelled Old Bay.  </li>
            <li>For me I prefer a little more lather, but that is a matter of preference.  </li>
            <li>My husband likes it and it is not as strong a smell as the other ones</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, Axe Peace Shower Gel smells great</li>
            <li>Peace is one of the higher priced ones and while I love its quality, I&#x27;m a man on a ridiculously stingy budget and finding ways to cut cost here</li>
            <li>So when I saw this new AXE Revitalizing Shower Gel</li>
            <li>A great purchase for any guys who like the other Axe scents such as Apollo or Dark Temptation, as he alternates between those often.</li>
            <li>But the gel has a very masculine smell</li>
            <li>I am also strange in that I am not crazy about men who use cologne.  </li>
            <li>Whether you use a washcloth, a net body pouf or a plain bath sponge the gel easily works up into a reasonable amount lather.</li>
            <li>And believe me, this smells old.  </li>
            <li>The label says something like, \\&quot;The cleaner you are, the dirtier you get,\\&quot; complete with graphics of a nude man in silhouette showering and then talking to a ahem...lady...and is it just me or is the man still nude?</li>
            <li>AXE products are specifically designed and marketed for young men by the British-Dutch Unilever Company.</li>
            <li>I guess that is why I have always like Old Spice.  </li>
            <li>I reminds me of my father when he shaved and then patted some Old Spice on his face.  </li>
            <li>I appreciate earthy scents rather than perfumey or overly masculine cologne smells.</li>
            <li>The scent of Peace left me with much to be desired.  </li>
            <li>It does what a good shower gel is supposed to, though not at the humorously exaggerated level printed on the bottle.</li>
            <li>It does what a good shower gel is supposed to, though not at the humorously exaggerated level printed on the bottle.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m all for peace, but trying to raise awareness of our need for international peace through the marketing of products like deodorant body sprays, antiperspirant sprays, deodorant sticks, antiperspirant sticks, roll-ons, shampoos, styling creams, a face wash, shave and shower gels seem like a relatively roundabout way of doing that, albeit it could be potentially a very profitable campaign for Unilever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Yes that is correct, Old Bay, the cooking spice, again, not Old Spice, BUT Old Bay.  </li>
            <li>They now make Old Spice deodorant which when used is enough.  </li>
            <li>I use Old Spice, English Leather and Brut colognes.  </li>
            <li>The smell of this product seems closer to English Leather than Old Spice or Brut.</li>
            <li>I just want to caution people ordering this through Amazon since mine came with the top broken and a fine liquid mess all over the box and my other products.</li>
            <li>Dense enough to use just a little at a time, the Axe Peace Shower Gel, 16 Fluid Ounce has a nice smell that is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Because the citrus that stands out above all of the other &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; scents that emanate from the bottle doesn&#x27;t really scream &amp;#34;man&amp;#34; at me.  </li>
            <li>I paid too much for one and could have gone to walmart for half the price.</li>
            <li>Very convenient if you put it on auto-ship and the price is the same as in stores or less.</li>
            <li>I do notice that the smell doesn&#x27;t linger, which might be a good or bad thing depending on how you want your shower gel to perform.&lt;br</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> It is a great purchase for the price and thank you Amazon for delivering this to my door rather than having to carry it from the store!  </li>
            <li> For the price and amount, one (for the majority of the time) receives a wonderful product.  </li>
            <li> This fragrance is very nice!</li>
            <li> Great scent at a great price.</li>
            <li> It lathers great, and the smell lasts for quite a while.</li>
            <li> Works and smells great.</li>
            <li> You will smell great, trust me.</li>
            <li> LOL.</li>
            <li> Axe Peace Shower Gel smells great and cleans quite well.  </li>
            <li> contrast, this body wash lathers great and does a great job of cleaning.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a pleasant smell that lasts through the day.</li>
            <li> and I must say that both of them are equally pleasant to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> if it smelled good.</li>
            <li> The product lathers well and does a good job.</li>
            <li> Hugs are good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;She didn&#x27;t like the fact it was Axe, but she loved it after I showered.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved Axe body wash</li>
            <li> nice shower gel,  does a good job cleaning and smells great as well.</li>
            <li> Good shower gel and very refreshing</li>
            <li> My college son is very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent choice for a body wash and has a scent many will enjoy.</li>
            <li> love the smell!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband - love the scent!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay scent, but not at all pleasant.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s honestly amazing.</li>
            <li> Nice smell to it.  </li>
            <li> Not for ourselves but for the men in our lives because men &amp;#34;didn&#x27;t wear that kind of thing.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is nice and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> My brother said it lathers up nicely</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need cologne as the deodorant leaves a nice but not overpowering scent.  </li>
            <li> Peace is a good product to be sure, but is it more than twice as good as the budget brand?</li>
            <li> This one has a good lather, but I have had better.  </li>
            <li> This is a healthy constructed bottle with a good portion of a nicely crafted and smelling bath</li>
            <li> shower gel has a nice woodsy manly smell to it.</li>
            <li> , I also have to admit that Axe products are quite good with the largest number of and most sophisticated fragrances.</li>
            <li> It smells earthy, warm, cuddly, spicy, and sexy.  </li>
            <li> but it is strong and musky!  </li>
            <li> After rinsing and toweling off the shower get left a very nice clean scent on my skin; and the bathroom smelled great, too!</li>
            <li> Try this body wash on your guy, he will be clean and good smelling.</li>
            <li> Cool design on packaging and good scent</li>
            <li> Husband says that it has a nice lather to it and makes his skin feel clean and nice.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I&#x27;ve used AXE products before I wasn&#x27;t surprised that this one is a very good product, too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I&#x27;ve used AXE products before I wasn&#x27;t surprised that this one is a very good product, too.</li>
            <li> Girls love the scent too.</li>
            <li> Love the product but ad was confusing.&lt;br /&gt;Thought i was getting 3 for the price of one.  </li>
            <li> But after being satisfied with the Anarchy deodorant, I thought I&#x27;d give Axe&#x27;s shower</li>
            <li> I hope that the marketing \\&quot;genius\\&quot; at Axe makes a lot of money, and I&#x27;m sure they do.  </li>
            <li> and we&#x27;re sure to appeal to the \\&quot;old\\&quot; generation or the rebellious one.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s better smelling stuff on the market.  </li>
            <li> Even Axe has made better products than this.</li>
            <li> Unlike cologne, I love the way Axe smells on men.  </li>
            <li> Instead, it screams &amp;#34;clean,&amp;#34; and I&#x27;m perfectly okay</li>
            <li> I love how Axe bottles their shower gel.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, he really likes this shower gel and told me that he would happily use it again.</li>
            <li> received fast, great product</li>
            <li> My Young Grandson Loved it!</li>
            <li> It lathers up really nice and gets you clean.</li>
            <li> Axe Peace is another very good fragrance that makes good lather and cleanses well with little greasy residue.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much gel to get the good suds either.  </li>
            <li> I remember when Axe first came out and it seemed like mostly we women were purchasing it!  </li>
            <li> It has a nice fragrance without overwhelming and does not take much to feel refreshed.</li>
            <li> Makes the skin feel clean and smooth!</li>
            <li> , this gel gets sudsy easily.  </li>
            <li> It has a strong citrusy note that lingers a bit afterwards.  </li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t find the temporary strong scent bothersome.</li>
            <li> It lathers well with not much required, smells good and cleans good.  </li>
            <li> It felt fine and didn&#x27;t irritate my skin</li>
            <li> Our inspiration for creating the &#x60;Make Love Not War&#x27; campaign for AXE Peace was knowing that our ability to bring guys and girls together could be used powerfully to have an impact on a huge scale.&#x27;</li>
            <li> The male of the house says this Axe &amp;#34;Peace&amp;#34; scent is great for waking you up in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoy this body wash.</li>
            <li> Just because it is called &amp;#34;Peace&amp;#34; don&#x27;t expect it to have a light scent.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say that if you enjoy a stronger scent from your soap then this is up your alley.  </li>
            <li> Whatever the mystery ingredient is can be dealt with by having a good sense of humor with the ladies and/or looking ridiculously hot and neither of those have anything to do with higher priced soaps.</li>
            <li> I love it when my husband showers right before going to bed</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Peace&amp;#34; is by far my most favorite scent that Axe makes.  </li>
            <li> and I felt clean after my shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be clean.</li>
            <li> Be clean.</li>
            <li> rinses clean and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue.</li>
            <li> Yes, that&#x27;s right!  </li>
            <li> While this body wash won&#x27;t necessarily make your irresistible to the object of your affections as the marketing campaign suggests, it does get you clean and smelling good.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I felt clean enough when I got out of the shower, so that has to be good for something, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried my first AXE product last year and though it worked great.</li>
            <li> Overall, a good product.</li>
            <li> this price, it&#x27;s not a bad deal.</li>
            <li> They may not want to leave the shower and that is not a bad thing.  </li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t over-powering but has enough of a masculine and pleasant smell to effectively deodorize and the right texture and consistency to smoothly clean.  </li>
            <li> I like when men smell fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> find the names and claims printed on products these days sometimes humorous, if not completely ridiculous, and this one is no exception.</li>
            <li> After using this product I would say the lather produced by AXE PEACE is adequate.</li>
            <li> However, once you begin working it into a lather be prepared for that mild fragrance to get quite a bit stronger.</li>
            <li> This is a good product that delivers more than sophomoric advertising slogans.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll most likely get some more.  </li>
            <li> In general, this kind of body wash lasts longer than soap, doesn&#x27;t slip out of your hand, is easier to work up into a lather and doesn&#x27;t leave a soapy residue in the shower stall like hand soap does.</li>
            <li> Almost every one of their products smells great and will continue to keep the user fresh while working in extreme conditions.</li>
            <li> I have used over a half a dozen of these gels and they all smell great and lather</li>
            <li> The scent is very masculine and refreshing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Where this gel is a real winner is the light hint of musk smell that it leaves.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave you smelling fresh smelling at all once you step out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Except for this review, please don&#x27;t use &amp;#34;club&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;seals&amp;#34; in the same sentence, let&#x27;s be nice out there!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a surprise that AXE is a nice quality product with a lasting and fresh scent that makes you feel like a man.</li>
            <li> Since Axe commercials seem to focus on the stud market alone, how fun for us to give it a whirl!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> BUT since I work in an industrial environment and need a product that will keep me fresh, I stick with AXE.</li>
            <li> Worth a try.</li>
            <li> /&gt;\\&quot;AXE PEACE, a unique fragrance so addictive it sets you up to make love, not war.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do wish that the gel were more concentrated because I need more gel of this brand to wash my body than other brands of shower gels that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> As any other Axe product, Axe Peace Shower Gel smells awesome, and that make me come back to Axe products again and again.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s all a gimmick to promote the product to strapping young men full of hormones (unless they are gay),</li>
            <li> A product that actually makes boys want to take a shower and clean themselves deserves more than 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> and he loved how it smelled, just like other Axe products.  </li>
            <li> and some are $8 to $10, but there must be something extra special in the more pricey ones.</li>
            <li> This was right up my alley.</li>
            <li> If Unilever is genuinely aiming at generating unprecedented awareness of a healthy global message, thus encouraging young people to take simple but meaningful actions that will have a positive impact on the future of their communities, it would seem to me they would gladly AXE this message off this bottle.</li>
            <li> Luckily, it wasn&#x27;t that much but still worth</li>
            <li> The scent is not overpowering and leaves you with a pleasant smell (at least according to my wife) and a feeling of being clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a foamy body wash for men that does a decent job of getting you clean.  </li>
            <li> It is really a pleasing smell, very earthy, and not at all like a lot of shower gels that smell like cheap perfume.  </li>
            <li> No one will probably even notice it unless they get very very close to you.  </li>
            <li> This product smells so nice and really cleans my stinky mechanic husband after a long work day.</li>
            <li> What it smells like exactly, I can&#x27;t say.</li>
            <li> Being a fan of Axe products, this shower gel has not failed me since using it.  </li>
            <li> I was particularly interested in this AXE product since I stopped using hand soap in the shower a number of years ago and started using a shower gel (aka body wash) instead.</li>
            <li> I think women should smell pretty and men should smell like men.  </li>
            <li> Smells great, and the scent seems to last long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it may be a deal breaker with some picky women who are cognizant of such things.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s exactly what this stuff smells like.</li>
            <li> I do not seeing myself running out to attain this particular shower gel again, mainly because Axe has so many other wonderful versions, such as Snake Peel, Excite, Rise and Deep Space.</li>
            <li> Well thankfully this one does come with a very \\&quot;detailed\\&quot; set of instructions printed right on the bottle: \\&quot;Squeeze gel out.</li>
            <li> Well thankfully this one does come with a very \\&quot;detailed\\&quot; set of instructions printed right on the bottle: \\&quot;Squeeze gel out.</li>
            <li> The AXE Peace campaign aims to generate unprecedented awareness of the peace message and encourage young people to take simple but meaningful actions that will have a positive impact on the future of their communities and the world they will inherit.</li>
            <li> But the Axe line is incredibly popular with early teen males, and my son is no exception.</li>
            <li> The container fits perfectly on my shower ledge and the wider base means a more sturdy position.</li>
            <li> The AXE PEACE Revitalizing Shower Gel I am reviewing comes in an ample 16 fluid ounce recyclable plastic bottle with an easy to use pop-up dispenser lid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has the same (strong) smell that all Axe products have</li>
            <li> He did mention that the scent was a little overpowering when putting it on in the shower, but if fades to a nice scent after being washed off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like this soap.  </li>
            <li> He really likes it too.</li>
            <li> Shower gels aren&#x27;t something I use very often.</li>
            <li> I ordered this on the Amazon Vine for my son, and he really likes it.</li>
            <li> When you lather on the Axe Peace shower gel, you&#x27;ll feel like you&#x27;re soaring over ocean waters in a Greenpeace boat saving seals, while getting ready for the Club you&#x27;re about to go</li>
            <li> It is light, not fancy and also hasn&#x27;t caused anyone to tackle me in the middle of the supermarket.</li>
            <li> Who wants to smell like a ginger man cookie?</li>
            <li> It cleans body very well.</li>
            <li> I used about a half dollar sized drop of gel the first time, covering my body and arms, and then went with one more dab to take care of my legs and feet.</li>
            <li> The gel is fragrant but not overpowering, like many other Axe products.</li>
            <li> I like the masculine smell and evidently so does my family.</li>
            <li> I like the masculine smell and evidently so does my family.</li>
            <li> I must admit, the slick advertising of Unilever (parent company of Axe) is quite effective in the marketplace.</li>
            <li> Peace, a unique fragrance so addictive it sets you up to make love, not war&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Warning: unlimited female attention&amp;#34; probably grab the attention of consumers in a much younger age group than this</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t like to wear fragrances, but this is nice.</li>
            <li> When the get is initially squeezed out of the bottle it has a relatively mild scent.</li>
            <li> The main difference between this and both the shampoo and face wash is in the color.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it really &#x27;revitalizes&#x27; as it claims on the label, but I love this product like many other Axe Men products.</li>
            <li> It always seems like more work than simply using a bar of soap, as lazy as that may sound.</li>
            <li> I was bemused by the rich and deep aquamarine color, until I smelled Old Bay.  </li>
            <li> For me I prefer a little more lather, but that is a matter of preference.  </li>
            <li> My husband likes it and it is not as strong a smell as the other ones</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, Axe Peace Shower Gel smells great</li>
            <li> Peace is one of the higher priced ones and while I love its quality, I&#x27;m a man on a ridiculously stingy budget and finding ways to cut cost here</li>
            <li> So when I saw this new AXE Revitalizing Shower Gel</li>
            <li> A great purchase for any guys who like the other Axe scents such as Apollo or Dark Temptation, as he alternates between those often.</li>
            <li> But the gel has a very masculine smell</li>
            <li> I am also strange in that I am not crazy about men who use cologne.  </li>
            <li> Whether you use a washcloth, a net body pouf or a plain bath sponge the gel easily works up into a reasonable amount lather.</li>
            <li> And believe me, this smells old.  </li>
            <li> The label says something like, \\&quot;The cleaner you are, the dirtier you get,\\&quot; complete with graphics of a nude man in silhouette showering and then talking to a ahem...lady...and is it just me or is the man still nude?</li>
            <li> AXE products are specifically designed and marketed for young men by the British-Dutch Unilever Company.</li>
            <li> I guess that is why I have always like Old Spice.  </li>
            <li> I reminds me of my father when he shaved and then patted some Old Spice on his face.  </li>
            <li> I appreciate earthy scents rather than perfumey or overly masculine cologne smells.</li>
            <li> The scent of Peace left me with much to be desired.  </li>
            <li> It does what a good shower gel is supposed to, though not at the humorously exaggerated level printed on the bottle.</li>
            <li> It does what a good shower gel is supposed to, though not at the humorously exaggerated level printed on the bottle.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m all for peace, but trying to raise awareness of our need for international peace through the marketing of products like deodorant body sprays, antiperspirant sprays, deodorant sticks, antiperspirant sticks, roll-ons, shampoos, styling creams, a face wash, shave and shower gels seem like a relatively roundabout way of doing that, albeit it could be potentially a very profitable campaign for Unilever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yes that is correct, Old Bay, the cooking spice, again, not Old Spice, BUT Old Bay.  </li>
            <li> They now make Old Spice deodorant which when used is enough.  </li>
            <li> I use Old Spice, English Leather and Brut colognes.  </li>
            <li> The smell of this product seems closer to English Leather than Old Spice or Brut.</li>
            <li> I just want to caution people ordering this through Amazon since mine came with the top broken and a fine liquid mess all over the box and my other products.</li>
            <li> Dense enough to use just a little at a time, the Axe Peace Shower Gel, 16 Fluid Ounce has a nice smell that is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Because the citrus that stands out above all of the other &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; scents that emanate from the bottle doesn&#x27;t really scream &amp;#34;man&amp;#34; at me.  </li>
            <li> I paid too much for one and could have gone to walmart for half the price.</li>
            <li> Very convenient if you put it on auto-ship and the price is the same as in stores or less.</li>
            <li> I do notice that the smell doesn&#x27;t linger, which might be a good or bad thing depending on how you want your shower gel to perform.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The budget brand which has almost no advertising (and little advertising cost) also makes plenty of lather, cleanses well and leaves little residue (and has two scents: refreshing or active sport) will set you back $1.88 per 12oz.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shower gel is a typical blue while the shampoo and face wash are both a vivid yellow.</li>
            <li> All round a high quality product.  </li>
            <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t last very long, otherwise it would have been a 5.</li>
            <li> I still have to laugh at whoever comes up with these names, and what&#x27;s worse is the lab rat who came up with the scent!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The scents that you get across all three products are very similar and work well in tandem with each other.</li>
            <li> As for the smell it is hard for me to describe and smell tends to be highly subjective anyway.  </li>
            <li> Does not leave my skin dry either.  </li>
            <li> recall reading a review of a particular hair shampoo where the reviewer complained because theshampoo didn&#x27;t come with instructions.</li>
            <li> This is definitely not a scent that I personally would want to smell like, and I&#x27;m not sure any man over the age of 16 would, either.</li>
            <li> I use less of this than my dove liquid for the same foaming.</li>
            <li> My review is not that the product is bad, I love the scent of Axe Peace.</li>
            <li> really, no complaints about this; I like the &#x27;Transformers&#x27; shaped bottle (well the top-dispensing part looks like &#x27;Decepticon&#x27;) and the economy size.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s just not a very manly smell if you ask me.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not certain why some 16oz products of Axe are $4</li>
            <li> A little on a scrubby puff thing goes a long way.</li>
            <li> No disrespect to the other scents</li>
            <li> All this means is that this bottle will be empty sooner!</li>
            <li> The shower gel leaves you feeling fresh and leaves behind a subtle, citrus tinged scent that&#x27;s thankfully not too pungent like some of Axe&#x27;s other products.</li>
            <li> Alas they weren’t, Old Bay is the scent.  </li>
            <li> It does fade down after your shower.  </li>
            <li> When I say &amp;#34;hint&amp;#34; I mean it, but it seems to last all day.  </li>
            <li> Packaging is sleek and doesn&#x27;t get too messy with product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;What&#x27;s worse is the back label pomotes that by using this product you might</li>
            <li> It is a mix of green tea and sandalwood.</li>
            <li> Again, if this shower gel is supposed to make the ladies cling to my legs while I walk down the street fighting them off, I have yet to see any, unless they&#x27;re just flying past me in missed dives that I&#x27;m not noticing.</li>
            <li> but this makes the other scents seem juvenile and high-school-ish!</li>
            <li> Not sure this is his style of scent but thought he might like to try it out.</li>
            <li> &quot; I&#x27;m not sure about that, but the shower get did rinse off well</li>
            <li> and you get dressed, you hardly notice anything.</li>
            <li> If I close my eyes and think really hard</li>
            <li> He has the Peace deodorant and hair pomade as well, and it&#x27;s not the least bit overpowering.  </li>
            <li> I have received a noticeable increase in the number of hugs lately.</li>
            <li> I have received a noticeable increase in the number of hugs lately.</li>
            <li> Seriously, Axe folks?  </li>
            <li> I give it 4 stars instead of 5, because at over $5 a bottle, it is a bit expensive compared to others brands that do just as well at less cost.  </li>
            <li> I like all the AXE products but some &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; are too expensive on Amazon compared to Walmart.</li>
            <li> It just sends the wrong message.</li>
            <li> Sadly, that was not the case.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying it is bad</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Nice smell to it.  I really like this soap.  It is a great purchase for the price and thank you Amazon for delivering this to my door rather than having to carry it from the store!  Very convenient if you put it on auto-ship and the price is the same as in stores or less.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s honestly amazing. Girls love the scent too. I&#x27;d rate it 6 stars if there was another one.</li>
            <li> I switched to Axe products about 1 ½ years ago because of a sale at Target.  That was it, I was hooked.  Even though since the brand was introduced I resisted because I used a cheaper product.  Now I would not go back.  I use the shower soaps, deodorant, and spray.  All round a high quality product.  This fragrance is very nice!</li>
            <li> When I wash myself with this, my wife can&#x27;t keep her hands off me.</li>
            <li> This product smells so nice and really cleans my stinky mechanic husband after a long work day. He really likes it too. He was disapointed though that all the girls have not fallen at his feet after using it but I told him it&#x27;s because he is over 50 he is just stuck with me! Try this body wash on your guy, he will be clean and good smelling.</li>
            <li> Love the product but ad was confusing.&lt;br /&gt;Thought i was getting 3 for the price of one.  I paid too much for one and could have gone to walmart for half the price.</li>
            <li> Great scent at a great price.</li>
            <li> My son loves the Axe products, and this one is no different. It has the same (strong) smell that all Axe products have and it lathers and cleans well.</li>
            <li> This is definitely not a scent that I personally would want to smell like, and I&#x27;m not sure any man over the age of 16 would, either. But the Axe line is incredibly popular with early teen males, and my son is no exception. It lathers great, and the smell lasts for quite a while.</li>
            <li> While this body wash won&#x27;t necessarily make your irresistible to the object of your affections as the marketing campaign suggests, it does get you clean and smelling good.  The scent is not overpowering and leaves you with a pleasant smell (at least according to my wife) and a feeling of being clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> I like all the AXE products but some &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; are too expensive on Amazon compared to Walmart.</li>
            <li> I remember when Axe first came out and it seemed like mostly we women were purchasing it!  Not for ourselves but for the men in our lives because men &amp;#34;didn&#x27;t wear that kind of thing.&amp;#34;  Now they have hair pomades, shampoos, shower gel -- and now my husband says he&#x27;s waiting for the body lotion! &amp;#34;Peace&amp;#34; is by far my most favorite scent that Axe makes.  It smells earthy, warm, cuddly, spicy, and sexy.  I love it when my husband showers right before going to bed so I can lay my head on his shoulder and breathe it all in. He has the Peace deodorant and hair pomade as well, and it&#x27;s not the least bit overpowering.  From now on this is the only Axe scent I want my husband to have.  No disrespect to the other scents but this makes the other scents seem juvenile and high-school-ish!</li>
            <li> The male of the house says this Axe &amp;#34;Peace&amp;#34; scent is great for waking you up in the morning.  It has a strong citrusy note that lingers a bit afterwards.  Packaging is sleek and doesn&#x27;t get too messy with product.  A great purchase for any guys who like the other Axe scents such as Apollo or Dark Temptation, as he alternates between those often.</li>
            <li> Shower gels aren&#x27;t something I use very often. In fact, it&#x27;s only when I&#x27;m offered a sample that I try one out. It always seems like more work than simply using a bar of soap, as lazy as that may sound. But after being satisfied with the Anarchy deodorant, I thought I&#x27;d give Axe&#x27;s shower gel a shot too. Get in the shower, lather up and rinse it off and you&#x27;re good to go. I used about a half dollar sized drop of gel the first time, covering my body and arms, and then went with one more dab to take care of my legs and feet. It felt fine and didn&#x27;t irritate my skin anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is nice and not overpowering. You can definitely tell it&#x27;s there on you while showering, but as soon as it&#x27;s rinsed off and you get dressed, you hardly notice anything. It&#x27;s just a pleasant smell that lasts through the day. What it smells like exactly, I can&#x27;t say. If you&#x27;ve been around people that use Axe products before, it blends in with the rest of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this price, it&#x27;s not a bad deal. I&#x27;ll probably stick to bars of soap though.</li>
            <li> My brother said it lathers up nicely and he loved how it smelled, just like other Axe products.  So it was a bug thumbs up from him!</li>
            <li> Works and smells great. I use less of this than my dove liquid for the same foaming.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell as I anticipated but I like it. Bought this as an add on for my Amazon subscription for the boyfriend. Not sure this is his style of scent but thought he might like to try it out.</li>
            <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t last very long, otherwise it would have been a 5.</li>
            <li> I hope that the marketing \\&quot;genius\\&quot; at Axe makes a lot of money, and I&#x27;m sure they do.  I still have to laugh at whoever comes up with these names, and what&#x27;s worse is the lab rat who came up with the scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slap a peace sign on the label of anything these days and we&#x27;re sure to appeal to the \\&quot;old\\&quot; generation or the rebellious one.  And believe me, this smells old.  It&#x27;s an okay scent, but not at all pleasant.  Doesn&#x27;t leave you smelling fresh smelling at all once you step out. It might as well be non-scented. It&#x27;s like some sort of man candle you&#x27;d find at Yankee.  Or motor oil if it smelled good. I definitely wouldn&#x27;t buy it again based on scent alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s worse is the back label pomotes that by using this product you might \\&quot;get some.\\&quot;  The label says something like, \\&quot;The cleaner you are, the dirtier you get,\\&quot; complete with graphics of a nude man in silhouette showering and then talking to a ahem...lady...and is it just me or is the man still nude? Seriously, Axe folks?  What a joke!  What does that have to do with peace?  If anything, you should have spelled it \\&quot;piece.\\&quot;  It even says UNLIMITED FEMALE ATTENTION underneath the graphics on the back. Again, what does that have to do with peace?  I know it&#x27;s all a gimmick to promote the product to strapping young men full of hormones (unless they are gay), but if they all smelled like this, they are in trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money.  There&#x27;s better smelling stuff on the market.  Even Axe has made better products than this.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this body wash. It lathers up really nice and gets you clean. You will smell great, trust me. However, value to product ratio I would not pay over 4 dollars for this product. Excellent choice for a body wash and has a scent many will enjoy.</li>
            <li> I ordered this on the Amazon Vine for my son, and he really likes it. The scent is very masculine and refreshing. The product lathers well and does a good job.</li>
            <li> Being a fan of Axe products, this shower gel has not failed me since using it.  It has a nice fragrance without overwhelming and does not take much to feel refreshed.</li>
            <li> I tried my first AXE product last year and though it worked great. So when I saw this new AXE Revitalizing Shower Gel I didn&#x27;t hesitate to give it a try. The product I used last year was AXE ANARCHY Antiperspirant. It was a big hit with my family but I thought it was time to move away from ANARCHY and give PEACE a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The AXE products are specifically designed and marketed for young men by the British-Dutch Unilever Company. I was particularly interested in this AXE product since I stopped using hand soap in the shower a number of years ago and started using a shower gel (aka body wash) instead. In general, this kind of body wash lasts longer than soap, doesn&#x27;t slip out of your hand, is easier to work up into a lather and doesn&#x27;t leave a soapy residue in the shower stall like hand soap does. The AXE PEACE Revitalizing Shower Gel I am reviewing comes in an ample 16 fluid ounce recyclable plastic bottle with an easy to use pop-up dispenser lid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to their website, Unilever has released an entire line of PEACE products along with a global \\&quot;AXE PEACE CAMPAIGN. The AXE Peace campaign aims to generate unprecedented awareness of the peace message and encourage young people to take simple but meaningful actions that will have a positive impact on the future of their communities and the world they will inherit. &#x60;Our inspiration for creating the &#x60;Make Love Not War&#x27; campaign for AXE Peace was knowing that our ability to bring guys and girls together could be used powerfully to have an impact on a huge scale.&#x27; says Tomas Marcenaro, Global Vice President for AXE.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m all for peace, but trying to raise awareness of our need for international peace through the marketing of products like deodorant body sprays, antiperspirant sprays, deodorant sticks, antiperspirant sticks, roll-ons, shampoos, styling creams, a face wash, shave and shower gels seem like a relatively roundabout way of doing that, albeit it could be potentially a very profitable campaign for Unilever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find the names and claims printed on products these days sometimes humorous, if not completely ridiculous, and this one is no exception. The following AXE slogan is just one of several printed on the bottle and should speak for itself:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;AXE PEACE, a unique fragrance so addictive it sets you up to make love, not war.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unilever claims this AXE PEACE shower gel produces an abundance of lather; That is a bit of an exaggeration. After using this product I would say the lather produced by AXE PEACE is adequate. Whether you use a washcloth, a net body pouf or a plain bath sponge the gel easily works up into a reasonable amount lather. When the get is initially squeezed out of the bottle it has a relatively mild scent. However, once you begin working it into a lather be prepared for that mild fragrance to get quite a bit stronger. But the gel has a very masculine smell so I didn&#x27;t find the temporary strong scent bothersome. After rinsing and toweling off the shower get left a very nice clean scent on my skin; and the bathroom smelled great, too! Unilever says this product will give me \\&quot;a super-charged clean!\\&quot; I&#x27;m not sure about that, but the shower get did rinse off well and I felt clean after my shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I think I mentioned earlier, there are several slogans printed on the bottle. There is also one catchphrase that was coupled with a two-panel graphic that I felt was inappropriate. If Unilever is genuinely aiming at generating unprecedented awareness of a healthy global message, thus encouraging young people to take simple but meaningful actions that will have a positive impact on the future of their communities, it would seem to me they would gladly AXE this message off this bottle. It just sends the wrong message. That&#x27;s just one person&#x27;s opinion and is nothing to get all worked up over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recall reading a review of a particular hair shampoo where the reviewer complained because theshampoo didn&#x27;t come with instructions. Instructions? Well thankfully this one does come with a very \\&quot;detailed\\&quot; set of instructions printed right on the bottle: \\&quot;Squeeze gel out. Lather on body. Rinse off. Be clean. Smell great.\\&quot; So there you go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;ve used AXE products before I wasn&#x27;t surprised that this one is a very good product, too. It does what a good shower gel is supposed to, though not at the humorously exaggerated level printed on the bottle. I like the masculine smell and evidently so does my family. How do I know that? I have received a noticeable increase in the number of hugs lately. Hugs are good.shampoo didn&#x27;t come with instructions. Instructions?

            <li> I like when men smell fresh and clean.  I am also strange in that I am not crazy about men who use cologne.  Especially those who smell like they took a bath in the cologne.  I think women should smell pretty and men should smell like men.  I guess that is why I have always like Old Spice.  I reminds me of my father when he shaved and then patted some Old Spice on his face.  They now make Old Spice deodorant which when used is enough.  You don&#x27;t need cologne as the deodorant leaves a nice but not overpowering scent.  Along came the Axe craze.  I knew I had to get this for my stepson to use.  Unlike cologne, I love the way Axe smells on men.  My stepson uses their product and he loves them and this product.  A product that actually makes boys want to take a shower and clean themselves deserves more than 5 stars.  So moms, if you have boys that dread taking a shower or go days without bathing (ugh), have them use this product.  They may not want to leave the shower and that is not a bad thing.  LOL.</li>
            <li> Yes, that&#x27;s right!  When you lather on the Axe Peace shower gel, you&#x27;ll feel like you&#x27;re soaring over ocean waters in a Greenpeace boat saving seals, while getting ready for the Club you&#x27;re about to go to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But really, no complaints about this; I like the &#x27;Transformers&#x27; shaped bottle (well the top-dispensing part looks like &#x27;Decepticon&#x27;) and the economy size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bar soap is so 90&#x27;s and prison-ready.  Shower gel is the only way to go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except for this review, please don&#x27;t use &amp;#34;club&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;seals&amp;#34; in the same sentence, let&#x27;s be nice out there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carry on!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a week now and I like it.  It lathers well with not much required, smells good and cleans good.  Does not leave my skin dry either.  The scent fades away however in an hour or so. I give it 4 stars instead of 5, because at over $5 a bottle, it is a bit expensive compared to others brands that do just as well at less cost.  For those having no concerns about price I would recommend this product.  As for the smell it is hard for me to describe and smell tends to be highly subjective anyway.  But I can say this.  I use Old Spice, English Leather and Brut colognes.  The smell of this product seems closer to English Leather than Old Spice or Brut.</li>
            <li> I must admit, the slick advertising of Unilever (parent company of Axe) is quite effective in the marketplace. Slogans like &amp;#34;Axe Peace, a unique fragrance so addictive it sets you up to make love, not war&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Warning: unlimited female attention&amp;#34; probably grab the attention of consumers in a much younger age group than this reviewer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, I also have to admit that Axe products are quite good with the largest number of and most sophisticated fragrances. Axe Peace is another very good fragrance that makes good lather and cleanses well with little greasy residue. This is a good product that delivers more than sophomoric advertising slogans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why three stars then? At my age, I also recognize the economics of products. At the lowest price department store (you know who), Axe Peace goes for $3.97 per 16oz bottle. The budget brand which has almost no advertising (and little advertising cost) also makes plenty of lather, cleanses well and leaves little residue (and has two scents: refreshing or active sport) will set you back $1.88 per 12oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Axe Peace is a good product to be sure, but is it more than twice as good as the budget brand? To me, the answer is &amp;#34;no&amp;#34; and overall, I give Axe Peace only three stars.</li>
            <li> My college son is very pleased with this product. Dense enough to use just a little at a time, the Axe Peace Shower Gel, 16 Fluid Ounce has a nice smell that is not overwhelming. Makes the skin feel clean and smooth!</li>
            <li> Axe Peace Shower Gel smells great and cleans quite well.  The smell isn&#x27;t over-powering but has enough of a masculine and pleasant smell to effectively deodorize and the right texture and consistency to smoothly clean.  I especially like the cedarwood smell which blends well with the nutmeg, citrus and amber.</li>
            <li> When it comes to shower gel I focus on two things, smell and lather.  This one has a good lather, but I have had better.  For me I prefer a little more lather, but that is a matter of preference.  For purposes of shower cleanup this may be an advantage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where this gel is a real winner is the light hint of musk smell that it leaves.  When I say &amp;#34;hint&amp;#34; I mean it, but it seems to last all day.  No one will probably even notice it unless they get very very close to you.  I usually don&#x27;t like to wear fragrances, but this is nice.</li>
            <li> Axe Peace Shower Gel is about what you&#x27;d expect.  It&#x27;s a foamy body wash for men that does a decent job of getting you clean.  The thing that makes it Axe though is the pungent Axe aroma.  Just because it is called &amp;#34;Peace&amp;#34; don&#x27;t expect it to have a light scent.  I&#x27;m not saying it is bad but it is strong and musky!  Especially as you shower.  It does fade down after your shower.  I did not experience an increase or decrease in female attention while using this product - FYI.  I&#x27;d say that if you enjoy a stronger scent from your soap then this is up your alley.  If not you may want to avoid the Axe brand altogether since that seems to be the norm for their product.</li>
            <li> My husband likes it and it is not as strong a smell as the other ones</li>
            <li> My review is not that the product is bad, I love the scent of Axe Peace. I just want to caution people ordering this through Amazon since mine came with the top broken and a fine liquid mess all over the box and my other products.</li>
            <li> Smells great, and the scent seems to last long.</li>
            <li> Cool design on packaging and good scent</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, Axe Peace Shower Gel smells great, it&#x27;s just not a very manly smell if you ask me.  Why?  Because the citrus that stands out above all of the other &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; scents that emanate from the bottle doesn&#x27;t really scream &amp;#34;man&amp;#34; at me.  Instead, it screams &amp;#34;clean,&amp;#34; and I&#x27;m perfectly okay with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using a loofah, this gel gets sudsy easily.  It doesn&#x27;t take much gel to get the good suds either.  The scent does stay with you throughout the day but is not overbearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt clean enough when I got out of the shower, so that has to be good for something, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all honesty, I&#x27;ve also used the Axe Harmony Shower Gel and I must say that both of them are equally pleasant to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li> My Young Grandson Loved it!</li>
            <li> The main difference between this and both the shampoo and face wash is in the color. The shower gel is a typical blue while the shampoo and face wash are both a vivid yellow. The scents that you get across all three products are very similar and work well in tandem with each other. The shower gel leaves you feeling fresh and leaves behind a subtle, citrus tinged scent that&#x27;s thankfully not too pungent like some of Axe&#x27;s other products. Again, if this shower gel is supposed to make the ladies cling to my legs while I walk down the street fighting them off, I have yet to see any, unless they&#x27;re just flying past me in missed dives that I&#x27;m not noticing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a surprise that AXE is a nice quality product with a lasting and fresh scent that makes you feel like a man. I&#x27;m sure it may be a deal breaker with some picky women who are cognizant of such things. This is a healthy constructed bottle with a good portion of a nicely crafted and smelling bath soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not certain why some 16oz products of Axe are $4 and some are $8 to $10, but there must be something extra special in the more pricey ones. Peace is one of the higher priced ones and while I love its quality, I&#x27;m a man on a ridiculously stingy budget and finding ways to cut cost here and there makes me think that soap is soap. Whatever the mystery ingredient is can be dealt with by having a good sense of humor with the ladies and/or looking ridiculously hot and neither of those have anything to do with higher priced soaps.</li>
            <li> I love how Axe bottles their shower gel. The container fits perfectly on my shower ledge and the wider base means a more sturdy position. The gel is fragrant but not overpowering, like many other Axe products. I do wish that the gel were more concentrated because I need more gel of this brand to wash my body than other brands of shower gels that I&#x27;ve tried. All this means is that this bottle will be empty sooner! Overall, a good product.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend hates the fact that she loves it.&lt;br /&gt;She didn&#x27;t like the fact it was Axe, but she loved it after I showered.</li>
            <li> We always joke about Axe products. Being 40 somethings, we do not need to feel like a magnet for every person of the opposite sex that we pass on the street. Since Axe commercials seem to focus on the stud market alone, how fun for us to give it a whirl!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, it was shipped with a piece of regular tape (like Scotch) over the opening to avoid spillage. That didn&#x27;t quite work and some was in the box and on the bottle itself. Luckily, it wasn&#x27;t that much but still worth a mention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell! It is a mix of green tea and sandalwood. I appreciate earthy scents rather than perfumey or overly masculine cologne smells. This was right up my alley. My husband enjoys it too. A little on a scrubby puff thing goes a long way. I do notice that the smell doesn&#x27;t linger, which might be a good or bad thing depending on how you want your shower gel to perform.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I recommend it for both men and women girls and boys. It is light, not fancy and also hasn&#x27;t caused anyone to tackle me in the middle of the supermarket.</li>
            <li> I had my Husband to test out this Axe Peace Shower Gel for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shower gel has a nice woodsy manly smell to it. He smells good when he gets out of the shower...which I love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Husband says that it has a nice lather to it and makes his skin feel clean and nice. He did mention that the scent was a little overpowering when putting it on in the shower, but if fades to a nice scent after being washed off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, he really likes this shower gel and told me that he would happily use it again.</li>
            <li> I would have to say out of all of Axe’s products, I fancy their shower gel/body wash.  For the price and amount, one (for the majority of the time) receives a wonderful product.  I have used over a half a dozen of these gels and they all smell great and lather wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given the prior introduction I felt I would experience the same results when using Axe’s Peace body wash.  Sadly, that was not the case. The scent of Peace left me with much to be desired.  When I poured the shower gel on my wash cloth I was bemused by the rich and deep aquamarine color, until I smelled Old Bay.  Yes that is correct, Old Bay, the cooking spice, again, not Old Spice, BUT Old Bay.  I used this product about 20 times before I wrote this review to ensure my senses weren’t fooling me.  Alas they weren’t, Old Bay is the scent.  I actually also smell a bit of metallic influence in this wash as well.  If I close my eyes and think really hard I just might sense some lavender, but that is a stretch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In contrast, this body wash lathers great and does a great job of cleaning.  I do not seeing myself running out to attain this particular shower gel again, mainly because Axe has so many other wonderful versions, such as Snake Peel, Excite, Rise and Deep Space.</li>
            <li> I know this product is made for men BUT since I work in an industrial environment and need a product that will keep me fresh, I stick with AXE. Almost every one of their products smells great and will continue to keep the user fresh while working in extreme conditions.</li>
            <li> Now, whether you want to smell like a damp forest after getting out of a shower is up to you.  It is really a pleasing smell, very earthy, and not at all like a lot of shower gels that smell like cheap perfume.  I&#x27;ll most likely get some more.  Worth a try.</li>
            <li> nice shower gel,  does a good job cleaning and smells great as well. rinses clean and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue.</li>
            <li> Good shower gel and very refreshing</li>
            <li> Received with bottles leaking all over</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved Axe body wash but this one does not have the same quality.  It seems Axe is lowering its standard.</li>
            <li> Who wants to smell like a ginger man cookie? with a hint of musk from a cowboys armpit with just a tad of brown sugar. That&#x27;s exactly what this stuff smells like. Terrible Man.... I will tell you this if it&#x27;s your sort of thing to smell like a ginger man cookie, cowboy armpit with brown sugar then be my guest this stuff will knock your socks off from eternity and beyond!!!!!</li>
            <li> received fast, great product</li>
            <li> As any other Axe product, Axe Peace Shower Gel smells awesome, and that make me come back to Axe products again and again. It cleans body very well. Not sure if it really &#x27;revitalizes&#x27; as it claims on the label, but I love this product like many other Axe Men products.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband - love the scent!</li>
