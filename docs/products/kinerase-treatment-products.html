            <li>It was ok.</li>
            <li>This is the most productive treatment i have ever tried and i have tried alot of them.</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m so glad i did.</li>
            <li>Kinerase is my favorite line for skin care.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>But if you give the products a chance to do their magic, I&#x27;m betting you won&#x27;t be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;After many trials and travails with skin-care products, I have learned that, sometimes, indeed, you do get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this peptide.</li>
            <li>Does all it claims and more.</li>
            <li>Love the feel of it when applied to my skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite anti wrinkle remedy</li>
            <li>I love, love kinerase and this</li>
            <li>Overall, this&lt;br /&gt;treatment is awesome !</li>
            <li>I love this serum.  </li>
            <li>It is excellent at improving the texture and color of my skin, especially on my chest where I haven&#x27;t been as diligent with the SPF 30!</li>
            <li>I used the original C6, and then the C8 and it was amazing with noticeable results.</li>
            <li>Great to find a product that works on older skin</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s probably great for someone with normal to oily skin.</li>
            <li>It provides the best long term results.</li>
            <li>If you do your research, you&#x27;ll learn that most scientists and dermatologists consider Peptides to be one of the most important (if not THEE most important), anti-aging ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Kinerase is great as you age especially their \\&quot;facelift\\&quot; product which is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I use the advanced cream as a daytime moisturizer all over, even as an eye treatment.</li>
            <li>The products were originally devised by doctors who were seeking to rejuvenate and regenerate the epidermis and skin cells of burn victims).</li>
            <li>This is not my favorite product product that they have but it does give your give your skin back some smoothness and a nice finish to your complexion.  </li>
            <li>I think it does a nice job of maintaining a slightly more youthful countenance overall</li>
            <li>My skin is a bit dry and when I use a Kinerase treatment my face feels great</li>
            <li>I hope this review is helpful for those of you looking for &amp;#34;the real deal&amp;#34;. :-)</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t think the bottle is full.</li>
            <li>I am a 53 year-old woman, with very good skin (thanks to my genes); but DRY skin, with acne rosacea issues.</li>
            <li>If the&lt;br /&gt;company would have a different delivery system, one that would be more accurate, rating would be 5 star.</li>
            <li>I ordered this C8 treatment to start working on my laugh lines  around my eyes.</li>
            <li>This is a nice anti-aging supplement to your daily skincare routine.  </li>
            <li>You can research the various serums and creams, and come up with a regimen tailor-made to suit your own skin-care needs.</li>
            <li>Perhaps, it&#x27;s not the right formula for me.</li>
            <li>However, I do think my complexion looks a lot brighter and the formula is very gentle.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin smooth, fresh, and fine lines minimal.</li>
            <li>both my husband and i use this religiously and love it.</li>
            <li>i have t-zone skin and have tried a number of antioxidants and first-defense type products, but i do love coming back to this one.</li>
            <li>First off this purchase was a pain to receive, as they send the shipment by USPS and required a signature.</li>
            <li>I have even been getting compliments on how great I look lately.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many things on my face and this is the first one that I can actually feel a difference with...</li>
            <li>Gave it four stars since its a bit pricy however Kinerase is one of the best facial products on the market at least for me.</li>
            <li>I use it together with the C8 Peptide Under Eye treatment and it makes me look younger and minimizes fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Might sound simple to some folks, but I work so much</li>
            <li>This product really does protect your skin and promote that glowey,</li>
            <li>I really took for granted, because of my youth</li>
            <li>, how much this product makes the difference.  </li>
            <li>and it really changed the way my skin looks and feels.  </li>
            <li>If you really want to find out about Kinerase products, go to their website.</li>
            <li>I hope this review is helpful for those of you looking for &amp;#34;the real deal&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>By the time I finished the first bottle, I could see the lines between my eyes nearly disappear!</li>
            <li>I never noticed it did anything special, above and beyond their cremes.</li>
            <li>and I will continue to use as long as it is available on Amazon as a discount.</li>
            <li>I love this product and it is much less</li>
            <li>Happy with product , wish it wasnt that expensive.</li>
            <li>The kinerase products work really well with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>All my dry patches, and my tendency to get adult acne, just fades away and my skin becomes really smooth and &amp;#34;calm&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>it goes so easily into my skin and keeps it smooth and hydrated without getting dry or heavy over time.</li>
            <li>My skin is oily to normal and very sensitive.</li>
            <li>and I live in Los Angeles where driving to the corner market takes an hour.</li>
            <li>Any time I have tried to leave kinerase, because I believed I had found something new, I always returned to it.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the only product that he uses consistently.</li>
            <li>Kinerase products are, literally, the ONLY items I&#x27;ve ever used that do exactly what Kinerase says they will do.</li>
            <li>he has sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It was either old or had been replaced with substandard cream.</li>
            <li>smooth application, but not effective- too pastie</li>
            <li>And as I&#x27;ve become older, my skin is getting really dry from using this after micro and/or acid peels.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> smooth application, but not effective- too pastie</li>
            <li> And as I&#x27;ve become older, my skin is getting really dry from using this after micro and/or acid peels.</li>
            <li> Sadly Sephora no longer carries the line, but the good news is I can still make purchases on-line for 30% less than I used to pay!   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, I usually purchase Kinerase from Amazon where I can get it at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> I realize the return time had long passed, but I never had a problem with this product before, so I didn&#x27;t feel it was necessary to check a face cream.</li>
            <li> If it is not aimed at area , you can loose some of it , and at the price,I can only give it a 4 star rating.</li>
            <li> After many years of being disappointed by skin-care products that promised everything under the sun, I finally sat down one day and did some intense research.</li>
            <li> it is thick and really does nothing.</li>
            <li> was starting to show slightly, went to the cream and then added the C8 Peptide Intensive Treatment a month later</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin this is not going to take care of your needs.</li>
            <li> Last bottle didn&#x27;t last as long as usual either</li>
            <li> but I wonder if it is a legitimate supplier when I get it online because it seems to have such a little bit in the container.</li>
            <li> I can almost promise that it is the worst product you&#x27;ve ever experienced.</li>
            <li> It is not very moisturizing at all.</li>
            <li> I stopped using this and my other Kinerase products for a little over a year and recently decided to start using them again.</li>
            <li> have wrinkling around the eyes and mouth, have spent a small fortune on this entire regime, and have zero results.  </li>
            <li> Just when I think that my skin has had it due to aging, I will buy a tube of this stuff and my skin responds immediately.  </li>
            <li> Other merchants for other products had graciously accepted returns from me for problem merchandise after the time frame, but this one refused to negotiate with me.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> but if you are looking for dramatic results,  this may not be it (am currently in my late-late 30s).</li>
            <li> and I wish there was a sample I could have gotten first because at this point I feel like I have wasted my money:(</li>
            <li> but WOW I have never had such a bad breakout before!</li>
            <li> I hardly ever write reviews but this time I think I should share.</li>
            <li> When I finally opened this product to use it after finishing another one I already had, it was contaminated and smelled bad.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!</li>
            <li> This C8 is also very expensive</li>
            <li> so they aren&#x27;t to bad</li>
            <li> If you want to try something really bad, then you can try this one.</li>
            <li> After being disappointed by strivectin i took a chance with Kinerase n6  </li>
            <li> Disappointed at the amount of $ and didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great to find a product that works on older skin and I will continue to use as long as it is available on Amazon as a discount.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make you look 30 when you are 60 but it does nice stuff for your skin and does not cause redness or soreness</li>
            <li> I ordered this C8 treatment to start working on my laugh lines  around my eyes. I am in my 30&#x27;s so they aren&#x27;t to bad but I used this product for two days and I broke out severely.  I will continue to use it and see if my skin will become tolerable but WOW I have never had such a bad breakout before! I do have oily skin so maybe that is why it didnt work well for me.   This C8 is also very expensive and I wish there was a sample I could have gotten first because at this point I feel like I have wasted my money:(</li>
            <li> It was ok. The product is good. :)</li>
            <li> I have been using lotion for about 2 years now.. my girlfriend at the time made me try it and since I have never stopped.. it def firms skin and helps eliminate wrinkles.. I&#x27;d recommend (and often do) this to anyone.</li>
            <li> both my husband and i use this religiously and love it. he has sensitive skin and it&#x27;s the only product that he uses consistently. i have t-zone skin and have tried a number of antioxidants and first-defense type products, but i do love coming back to this one. it goes so easily into my skin and keeps it smooth and hydrated without getting dry or heavy over time.</li>
            <li> This is the most productive treatment i have ever tried and i have tried alot of them. After being disappointed by strivectin i took a chance with Kinerase n6  and i&#x27;m so glad i did.</li>
            <li> First off this purchase was a pain to receive, as they send the shipment by USPS and required a signature. If I had time to be home all day to sign for a package I would have just gone to the store and bought the item myself. I had to actually wait until I had a day off and drive to the post office. Might sound simple to some folks, but I work so much and I live in Los Angeles where driving to the corner market takes an hour. So, I was irritated with that to say the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product. It is not very moisturizing at all. If you have dry skin this is not going to take care of your needs. However, I do think my complexion looks a lot brighter and the formula is very gentle. So, I&#x27;m mixed on this product. I think it&#x27;s probably great for someone with normal to oily skin. Perhaps, it&#x27;s not the right formula for me. However, at the price I paid... well, that&#x27;s unbeatable.</li>
            <li> This is not my favorite product product that they have but it does give your give your skin back some smoothness and a nice finish to your complexion.  Kinerase is great as you age especially their \\&quot;facelift\\&quot; product which is fantastic.  The only drawback is price.</li>
            <li> Kinerase is my favorite line for skin care. They were once only sold through dermatologists, then marketed out to Sephora. Sadly Sephora no longer carries the line, but the good news is I can still make purchases on-line for 30% less than I used to pay!   This product really does protect your skin and promote that glowey, \\&quot;I just won an Oscar look\\&quot; we all dream about.</li>
            <li> I stopped using this and my other Kinerase products for a little over a year and recently decided to start using them again. I will never stray from my Kinerase again! I really took for granted, because of my youth, how much this product makes the difference.  I am now 30 and was feeling like age was starting to show slightly, went to the cream and then added the C8 Peptide Intensive Treatment a month later and it really changed the way my skin looks and feels.  I have even been getting compliments on how great I look lately.  Pricey but worth every penny!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve tried many things on my face and this is the first one that I can actually feel a difference with...I  always use this!</li>
            <li> Been using this for quite awhile.  It was recommended by my dermatologist after I had a peel for sun damage.  Feels good going on and seems to smooth out the skin before make-up application.</li>
            <li> This is a nice anti-aging supplement to your daily skincare routine.  I bought this after getting a sample as I started seeing results after i used up the sample.  I think it does a nice job of maintaining a slightly more youthful countenance overall but if you are looking for dramatic results,  this may not be it (am currently in my late-late 30s).</li>
            <li> This is not the product it used to be...it is thick and really does nothing. I used the original C6, and then the C8 and it was amazing with noticeable results. Purchased at the time from Sephora.  I have tried this twice now from Amazon, and concluded that they have probably changed the formula... Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!</li>
            <li> I am now on day 28 of Kinerase&#x27;s \\&quot;28 days to younger skin\\&quot; program.  I am 41, have wrinkling around the eyes and mouth, have spent a small fortune on this entire regime, and have zero results.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Gave it four stars since its a bit pricy however Kinerase is one of the best facial products on the market at least for me. It seems to make pores in my T zone smaller. Happy with product , wish it wasnt that expensive.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for years.  Works for me.</li>
            <li> I am a 53 year-old woman, with very good skin (thanks to my genes); but DRY skin, with acne rosacea issues. After many years of being disappointed by skin-care products that promised everything under the sun, I finally sat down one day and did some intense research. As a result of this research, I found Kinerase. (read up on the history of this company if you are so inclined. It&#x27;s actually very interesting. The products were originally devised by doctors who were seeking to rejuvenate and regenerate the epidermis and skin cells of burn victims). So, after all this research, I decided to give Kinerase a try. As a result, I am a devoted fan of Kinerase products. I&#x27;ve been using their C8 Peptide serums and moisturizers for about 6 years now. Kinerase products are, literally, the ONLY items I&#x27;ve ever used that do exactly what Kinerase says they will do. If you do your research, you&#x27;ll learn that most scientists and dermatologists consider Peptides to be one of the most important (if not THEE most important), anti-aging ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the C8 Peptide under-eye serum every morning, as well as the overal C8 peptide serum. The Restructure Firming cream for the day, and Ultimate Night Moisturizer at night.  These products deliver.  Mind you, they don&#x27;t &amp;#34;deliver&amp;#34; in 48 hours.  After about a month of using the under eye serum, as well as the under-eye firming cream, I noticed that the &amp;#34;smile lines&amp;#34; around my eyes became virtually invisible.  The overall look, texture, color of my skin is vastly improved with these products.  Again -- you must be patient.  You won&#x27;t see results in 2 days.  But if you give the products a chance to do their magic, I&#x27;m betting you won&#x27;t be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After many trials and travails with skin-care products, I have learned that, sometimes, indeed, you do get what you pay for. If you really want to find out about Kinerase products, go to their website. You can research the various serums and creams, and come up with a regimen tailor-made to suit your own skin-care needs. THEN come back to Amazon (which is what I do!), and buy the products for a drastically-reduced cost, to what you will pay if you order from the Kinerase site.

            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product now for 3 weeks and have not seen any results yet.  Disappointed at the amount of $ and didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Great product. Use it daily. Kinerase is excellent .</li>
            <li> great product and service</li>
            <li> Amazing cream. Good result in 2 weeks</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I use it together with the C8 Peptide Under Eye treatment and it makes me look younger and minimizes fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Whenever I can afford it, I buy this lotion.  It does wonders for my skin. Just when I think that my skin has had it due to aging, I will buy a tube of this stuff and my skin responds immediately.  All my dry patches, and my tendency to get adult acne, just fades away and my skin becomes really smooth and &amp;#34;calm&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think the bottle is full. Might have been cheated out of content. Last bottle didn&#x27;t last as long as usual either</li>
            <li> smooth application, but not effective- too pastie</li>
            <li> Been using this for years, and does not make my skin break out. The moisturizer absorbs well into the skin. You can feel that your skin is softer when waking in the morning, after having applied this the night before</li>
            <li> I hardly ever write reviews but this time I think I should share. By the time I finished the first bottle, I could see the lines between my eyes nearly disappear! I am now on my second bottle and will continue to use this and see what happens next.</li>
            <li> If you want to try something really bad, then you can try this one. I can almost promise that it is the worst product you&#x27;ve ever experienced.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this peptide. Does all it claims and more. Ladies please buy this product. You will see the wrinkles fade just as I did!</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended that I use Kinerase products. Love the feel of it when applied to my skin.  My face looks refreshed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite anti wrinkle remedy but I wonder if it is a legitimate supplier when I get it online because it seems to have such a little bit in the container.</li>
            <li> Good price, excellent product. I&#x27;ve strayed, but I always come back to Kinerase. It provides the best long term results. Amazon always gives me the best price without having to leave the comfort of home.</li>
            <li> When I finally opened this product to use it after finishing another one I already had, it was contaminated and smelled bad. It was either old or had been replaced with substandard cream. I realize the return time had long passed, but I never had a problem with this product before, so I didn&#x27;t feel it was necessary to check a face cream. Other merchants for other products had graciously accepted returns from me for problem merchandise after the time frame, but this one refused to negotiate with me. I will not be purchasing anything from them and advise you not to, either.</li>
            <li> I love, love kinerase and this is one of my favorite products! I get optimal results with kinerase. Any time I have tried to leave kinerase, because I believed I had found something new, I always returned to it. It keeps my skin smooth, fresh, and fine lines minimal. I find this product most effective when used at night.  My skin is oily to normal and very sensitive. The kinerase products work really well with sensitive skin. I use the advanced cream as a daytime moisturizer all over, even as an eye treatment.</li>
            <li> Used this product till I couldn&#x27;t  get anymore out of bottle . Very good product. the dispenser/plunger is the only negative&lt;br /&gt;about it. If it is not aimed at area , you can loose some of it , and at the price,I can only give it a 4 star rating. If the&lt;br /&gt;company would have a different delivery system, one that would be more accurate, rating would be 5 star.Overall, this&lt;br /&gt;treatment is awesome ! and as always Amazon&#x27;s service/delivery was good !</li>
            <li> I only use Kinerase products for my face, this product works well for me.  My skin is a bit dry and when I use a Kinerase treatment my face feels great and it&#x27;s very smooth. I&#x27;ve been using this product for years, I usually purchase Kinerase from Amazon where I can get it at a reasonable price.  I&#x27;m always happy with Amazon and Kinerase.</li>
            <li> I was very happy to find this skincare product from Amazon.  I love this product and it is much less&lt;br /&gt;expensive with Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this serum.  It is excellent at improving the texture and color of my skin, especially on my chest where I haven&#x27;t been as diligent with the SPF 30!</li>
            <li> but.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought this product on the advice of my aesthetician who works in a doc&#x27;s office. I never noticed it did anything special, above and beyond their cremes. And as I&#x27;ve become older, my skin is getting really dry from using this after micro and/or acid peels. I&#x27;ve gone to botanicals for a good hydration after aggressive treatments to keep skin cancer at bay here in Hawaii.</li>
