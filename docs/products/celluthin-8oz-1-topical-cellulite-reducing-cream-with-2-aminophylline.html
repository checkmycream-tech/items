            <li>I used this stuff two times a day for about four days before I experienced 3 debilitating migraines in a row.</li>
            <li>Good</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t see where it did much good.</li>

            <li>It is kind if a mask.</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s time to add more crunches to my workout.</li>
            <li>Moreover, most men aren&#x27;t affected by cellulite like women are.   </li>
            <li>The famous one that Dr. Oz had on his show.  </li>
            <li>I am going to try one more bottle of the Dr. Oz</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, good service.</li>
            <li>and they were quite easy to work with.  </li>
            <li>the product gave me a huge rash, i had to discontinue use.</li>
            <li>Huge welts all over my legs and abdominals.</li>
            <li>so I believe my results are accurate.</li>
            <li>I also did more research on this product,  which I should have done at first, instead of taking for granted that</li>
            <li>This was appreciated from my perspective and the fact that they were very kind and willing to cancel my order when I requested it shows that they are likely doing the best that they can with such an in demand product.</li>
            <li>Finally ordered this from Bodestore and got it fairly quickly and had pretty good communication.     </li>
            <li>First let me clarify that this is not a review of the product.</li>
            <li>If you are going to buy this product you will have much better luck using an outside seller.</li>
            <li>I figured it would take more that three weeks to see results, so I continued with a different brand.  </li>
            <li>I am not overweight and was not looking to lose massive inches thanks to magic in a bottle.  </li>

            <li>I am only writing this review to better inform potential buyers.  </li>
            <li>Ok, like many of you, I was skeptical but thought I would give this a try.</li>
            <li>endorsed brand to give it just a little more time to work.</li>
            <li>I measured the circumference of each thigh before and after and sure enough, I lost 1/4 of an inch off one thigh and 3/8 of an inch of the other thigh.</li>
            <li>They put me on hold briefly and returned to tell me they could ship it out this week to me as they had just gotten a large shipment in.      </li>
            <li>I am an active female, with a 14% body fat (lean for a female!), healthy diet, and I&#x27;ve been using this for 4 weeks with no results: no reduction in thigh circumference, no improvement in skin firmness.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll be less expensive and have better results than some magic potion.</li>
            <li>I am currently on week 5-6, but I do not see any major changes in my dimples!!</li>
            <li>This company clearly has had difficulty keeping this item stocked because of the demand and only said the expected shipping date would be postponed so that they did not upset any customers.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed absolutely no results from using this product, feels like I&#x27;m just rubbing water onto my legs!</li>
            <li> Be careful of this product!</li>
            <li> But Def not worth 45 bucks.    </li>
            <li> Not worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Really not fun at all.</li>
            <li> been trying this product for a few weeks and absolutely no change would not spend another cent of $45 again</li>
            <li> needs to be stronger in the cellulite areas to help old wrinkled tired bodies to me</li>
            <li> I did give it two stars because I had some slight wrinkles under said pooch from pregnancy.</li>
            <li> , it is not worth it!</li>
            <li> And they were the bad kind of migraine where I couldn&#x27;t see for 15 minutes, followed by hours and hours of dull pain behind my eyes.</li>
            <li> I am going to have to say this was probably a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I placed the order anyway because in the ordering process it says it ships in a few days.  </li>
            <li> It was a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> I did not get a migraine or any other form of headache as others have complained of.</li>
            <li> They apparently do not stand behind their product or their word.</li>
            <li> I told them I had found it elsewhere, which was not easy, and I wanted to cancel.  </li>
            <li> Not much more to say</li>
            <li> Not sure.</li>
            <li> Not really sure if it is working or not.  </li>
            <li> CELLULITE IS HARD TO GET RID OF</li>
            <li> Once the order processed, it said I will not receive it for at least a month.  </li>
            <li> While it may have worked for him, note that he paired this up with a strict slow carb diet (and who knows how controlled the experiment was).</li>
            <li> I mean, who doesn&#x27;t want a miracle cure?</li>
            <li> However, even if it DID work  for me in the way it had for one of Tim Ferris&#x27; experiments in &amp;#34;The 4 Hour Body,&amp;#34; he measured mere millimeters of improvement, which is difficult to observe with the naked eye.</li>
            <li> I even did the slow carb diet for 3 of those weeks, and I drink a gallon of water/day!</li>
            <li> I have also being cutting down on my food portion.</li>
            <li> religiously applied this crap 2 times a day, before my workout and before bed.   </li>
            <li> I wanted to believe that this would work, but sadly it didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I am a thinner person, however I have stage 4 cellulite and can not get rid of it with exsercise or diet :-(  </li>

            <li> I am going to have to say this was probably a waste of money.  I have am in great shape, but still have the poochy area around my belly button that just won&#x27;t tighten up.  Of course we are all looking for a miracle cream, so after reading all the great reviews I thought \\&quot;wow, this may actually work for me and be the key to getting rid of this pooch\\&quot;  NOPE....religiously applied this crap 2 times a day, before my workout and before bed.   No difference in the pooch...NONE.  I did give it two stars because I had some slight wrinkles under said pooch from pregnancy. This stuff helped tighten those just a LITTLE tiny bit. But Def not worth 45 bucks.    I guess we are all allowed to be an idiot every now and then. But I have learned my lesson. I guess it&#x27;s time to add more crunches to my workout.</li>
            <li> the product gave me a huge rash, i had to discontinue use. Huge welts all over my legs and abdominals. Not much more to say</li>
            <li> I ordered this product after reading about it in the Tim Feriss&#x27;s Four Hour Body bonus section (the stubborn thigh fat one), hoping that it will help me get rid of that last bit of unattractive fat. Ferris experimented with this topical gel and found measurable results in 2 weeks. While it may have worked for him, note that he paired this up with a strict slow carb diet (and who knows how controlled the experiment was). Moreover, most men aren&#x27;t affected by cellulite like women are.   I am an active female, with a 14% body fat (lean for a female!), healthy diet, and I&#x27;ve been using this for 4 weeks with no results: no reduction in thigh circumference, no improvement in skin firmness. I even did the slow carb diet for 3 of those weeks, and I drink a gallon of water/day! I guess nothing is going to eliminate that stubborn estrogen fat.</li>
            <li> this product is very water based, and takes a while to absorb into skin.  I&#x27;ve noticed absolutely no results from using this product, feels like I&#x27;m just rubbing water onto my legs!</li>
            <li> I used this product twice a day on my stomach and thighs until the bottle ran out.  I am not overweight and was not looking to lose massive inches thanks to magic in a bottle.  I was looking for some minor tightening of the skin or improvement in texture. I didn&#x27;t get either. Work out, reduce carbs, do weight training. It&#x27;ll be less expensive and have better results than some magic potion.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have said, this product is not always in stock and can take a long time to be shipped.  I placed the order anyway because in the ordering process it says it ships in a few days.  Once the order processed, it said I will not receive it for at least a month.  I called the company and they were quite easy to work with.  I told them I had found it elsewhere, which was not easy, and I wanted to cancel.  They put me on hold briefly and returned to tell me they could ship it out this week to me as they had just gotten a large shipment in.      However, I had already placed another order and wanted to cancel.  They were very understanding and canceled my order as requested.  I am only writing this review to better inform potential buyers.  This company clearly has had difficulty keeping this item stocked because of the demand and only said the expected shipping date would be postponed so that they did not upset any customers.  This was appreciated from my perspective and the fact that they were very kind and willing to cancel my order when I requested it shows that they are likely doing the best that they can with such an in demand product.</li>
            <li> I have being trying this celluthin product after watching the Dr.Oz Show. \\&quot; How To GET Rid Of Celluite?\\&quot;  2 months now )  Let me tell you! It works on me. The dimples on my arms are not as visiable now. I have also lost inches on my arms ,stomach, legs. What else can I say. I have also being cutting down on my food portion. I was unsure at first,thought to my self just another product on the market. I just wish it were cheaper only last for one month if used 2 times a day. Of course every person is different. What works for me might not work for you. Try it. It might work for you the way it has worked for me.  Good Luck!!!!</li>
            <li> First let me clarify that this is not a review of the product. If you are going to buy this product you will have much better luck using an outside seller. I ordered on Amazon from this seller first, and got tired of waiting. The order is still pending shipment and there is no way to cancel the order - which ticks me off.    Finally ordered this from Bodestore and got it fairly quickly and had pretty good communication.     Obviously, getting an endorsement from the Tim Ferriss book 4-Hour Body has given this product&#x27;s demand a big boost. But this is just rediculous. If you can&#x27;t ship it in a resonable time-frame, just say so. Don&#x27;t keep pushing the ship date back.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, good service. The product I just used one bottle of it. I didn&#x27;t see any difference in my skin. Maybe I didn&#x27;t use it long enough. Not sure.</li>
            <li> Ok, like many of you, I was skeptical but thought I would give this a try. I mean, who doesn&#x27;t want a miracle cure? I did not diet or do anything different in the month I tried the cream so I believe my results are accurate. I put the cream on my thighs and rubbed it in with circular motion until dry twice a day for 1 month. I measured the circumference of each thigh before and after and sure enough, I lost 1/4 of an inch off one thigh and 3/8 of an inch of the other thigh. I did not get a migraine or any other form of headache as others have complained of. We are all different so I believe this product can work different on each one of us. But for me, I&#x27;m stocking up on this stuff!</li>
            <li> I used the entire bottle of this product, I saw zero results. Also this product was watery, and I didn&#x27;t care for the feel of it.  I figured it would take more that three weeks to see results, so I continued with a different brand.  The famous one that Dr. Oz had on his show.  I am currently on week 5-6, but I do not see any major changes in my dimples!! I am a thinner person, however I have stage 4 cellulite and can not get rid of it with exsercise or diet :-(  I am going to try one more bottle of the Dr. Oz endorsed brand to give it just a little more time to work.</li>
            <li> I wanted to believe that this would work, but sadly it didn&#x27;t.  However, even if it DID work  for me in the way it had for one of Tim Ferris&#x27; experiments in &amp;#34;The 4 Hour Body,&amp;#34; he measured mere millimeters of improvement, which is difficult to observe with the naked eye.</li>
            <li> been trying this product for a few weeks and absolutely no change would not spend another cent of $45 again</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any difference after using this product.  Not worth the money.  I am trying another product and will see....</li>
            <li> needs to be stronger in the cellulite areas to help old wrinkled tired bodies to me I tried but would not buy again</li>
            <li> I LIKED THE FEEL OF THE CREAM, BUT PROBABLY DIDN&#x27;T USE IT LONG ENOUGH TO TEEL A DIFFERENCE. CELLULITE IS HARD TO GET RID OF</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see where it did much good.</li>
            <li> This product does not make cellulite go away but it DOES smoothe it out every time you apply it. It is kind if a mask. It works on a temporary basis. I love it</li>
            <li> Be careful of this product! Aminophylline can trigger migraines, as I found out. I used this stuff two times a day for about four days before I experienced 3 debilitating migraines in a row. And they were the bad kind of migraine where I couldn&#x27;t see for 15 minutes, followed by hours and hours of dull pain behind my eyes. Really not fun at all. As soon as I stopped using Celluthin - the migraines stopped. I wish I could get my money back! If you have ever had a migraine - do not experiment with this stuff, it is not worth it!</li>
            <li> I have had bad cellulite for most of my adult life and this stuff actually made a big difference!  Caffeine creams can&#x27;t hold a candle to this stuff!  Will keep ordering.  It takes a while to ship.... so don&#x27;t hold your breath.  If you can stand the wait, go for it!</li>
            <li> My bottle had been opened, there was residue from it being sqeezed through and the seal was lifted between the lid and bottle itself.</li>
            <li> I,ve been using this product for a month now, twice a day, as directed.  Saw no results. I called the company for a refund which they promised, up to 30 days.  Called both numbers, several times, and no response.  They apparently do not stand behind their product or their word. I also did more research on this product,  which I should have done at first, instead of taking for granted that because Dr.Oz said it was good, it was. I would never buy or recommend anything from this company,based on their lack of communication. They can say what they want about it, but topicals just don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> This claims to help with cellulite but I used it for a while and it did nothing. It was a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> Not really sure if it is working or not.  We&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> This product actually works!</li>
            <li> NOTHING gets rid of cellulite unless you have a surgical procedure called cellulaze and laser lipo!! Which I&#x27;ve done both and will last 10 plus years!!</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t have a comment..</li>
            <li> I havent seen much improvement yet. But I have only been using the product only a few short weeks. Waiting to see the final results adfter a few months.</li>
