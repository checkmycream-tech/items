            <li> Since when has Chocolate done you wrong, this is a great fragrance!</li>
            <li> the Cologne is good they did a great job getting to me within 3 days</li>
            <li> Has a very nice sensual smell that&#x27;s last a long time. You won&#x27;t need to use much of it. As said in other reviews its in the same family relm of One Million I personally like this one better. It has more of a smooth smell to it. The cap on the bottle doesn&#x27;t fit very well that&#x27;s about the only down side I see to it. I find this interchangeable wih Perry Ellis M. The PE is actually cheaper if you work it out by how much you&#x27;re paying pure once because you get a larger bottle. So my recommendation would be if you like One million and want a big bottle but Perry Ellis M. If you just want a smaller bottle or are unfamiliar with what type of sent it is get this. Either way you can&#x27;t really lose. Women will love either sent you buy. Both can be classified as panty droppers for sure.</li>
            <li> a dream come true !!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> My husband love it....I do too...</li>
            <li> This product is truly outstanding. Not to mention that the fragrance last for roughly the 8 hr day. It&#x27;s not overpowering, and when you put in on everyone you pass will want to know what are you wearing. My husband loves wearing it, I love smelling it on him.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find this cologne for a long time and after i found it i had to buy it, this product is great, it came on time and it was brand new thanks.</li>
            <li> I ended buying 2 bottles and every other cologne made by the person. This cologne just has a sweet shuttle smell that females seem to love</li>
            <li> Product was delivered very quickly and it is My favorite cologne of all.  The scent is indescribable and the price is more than reasobable.  You have a customer for life. Love It!!!</li>
            <li> My roommate turned me on to Franck Oliver, and when he told me that he spent some $60 + for it, and I found the same thing on Amazon for under $20, I had to act on it.

Thanks!</li>
            <li> Great cologne great purchase expierance</li>
            <li> I read a review that Passion was very similar to 1 Million and I MUST agree. It is sweet, a little earthy and well balanced. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s a knock off, it&#x27;s just in the same family of smell as PR1M. It&#x27;s well made and not cheap smelling. So I would recommend this to those looking for that scent.</li>
            <li> Love this cologne, get looks every time I wear it. Good buy and great price and shipping.</li>
            <li> I really like it and and enjoy it. And also planning to buy more of frank olivier colonge. Best colonge I had so far smell real good.</li>
            <li> This is yet another great cologne by Franck Olivier. I love all of his colognes. This one smells classy and clean. It&#x27;s a great fall/winter scent. It lasts a long time, as all of his fragrances do.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this fragrance and I also like the bottle.  Thank you!  Arrived on time and packaged very well for protection.</li>
