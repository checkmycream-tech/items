    <ol>
            <li>Absolutely awesome!!</li>
            <li>I bought this one, just really great!</li>
            <li>I think the concept is excellent.</li>
            <li>Awesome product for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Not the best quality product.  </li>
            <li>great product!.  </li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>It came packaged in an attractive gift box so it would be excellent for giving - who couldn&#x27;t use one of these?</li>
            <li>Worked great for about 3 months then broke at this bendy joint.</li>
            <li>The rest of the heads for the brush work great, so I plan to keep this product.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>This is a great idea.  </li>
            <li>HE IS REALLY HAPPY  WITH THE BRUSH.  </li>
            <li>It works great.  </li>
            <li>Love the length though!!</li>
            <li>I also have a very handy place to keep it between showers that uses the folded handle feature well.</li>
            <li>If the locking mechanism were made more reliable, it would be perfect.</li>
            <li>Nothing but good.</li>
            <li>I absolutely loved this in the beginning.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t get a good grip on it. .</li>
            <li>You did a good job on making the handle virtually break-proof.</li>
            <li>My father loved this gift.</li>
            <li>hanging loop is a good length allowing me to hang it on the shower door handle.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy !!</li>
            <li>I love this bath brush set!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been amazing.</li>
            <li>Planned to use this after hip replacement surgery and quite honestly haven&#x27;t even opened it.</li>
            <li>and I think it will come in handy.</li>
            <li>They need to come up with a better idea on that attachment, otherwise it is working quite nicely.</li>
            <li>AND all the heads handy and easy to use/change in the shower.</li>
            <li>Needs a better design.</li>
            <li>I have bought many \\&quot;shower thing-a-</li>
            <li>I put a heavier spring in your unit to have it work drastically better.  </li>
            <li>It is okay.</li>
            <li>This did with the altered positions and wonderful different spunges and brushes.</li>
            <li>especially love the bending elbow ,what a pleasure to change  the angle as I need with such ease and sturdiness</li>
            <li>overall this is great !</li>
            <li>I use the lotion head the most.</li>
            <li>The head should be angle adjustable, and even be able to be turned around so the handle would not be in the way in some cases.</li>
            <li>THE EXTRA LENGTH WAS PERFECT.  </li>
            <li>I wish the handle would adjust to more angles -</li>
            <li>This is great for bathing, but, also is good for use in cleaning (house); I am short and handicap.  </li>
            <li>I find that the sponge attachments and the pumice stone work better when hand held.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even use them much better options out there</li>
            <li>I love each brush for its purpose.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>She did comment that there should be more directions.</li>
            <li>Might be ok for your or wife Mother  </li>
            <li>Its a pretty good brush.  </li>
            <li>I loved this brush at first, answer to all my prayers.  </li>
            <li>The loofah feels especially good on my very dry  skin.  </li>
            <li>This would make the brush a bit more body friendly.</li>
            <li>He reported happily he is now able to wash his back and his feet by himself.</li>
            <li>It packed well and easy to carry on a trip.</li>
            <li>AND....... this is important.......</li>
            <li>The heads seem to be fairly cheaply made.</li>
            <li>I find it a great help when taking a shower and when applying lotion to my back.</li>
            <li>Great for people who have had spinal back surgery.  </li>
            <li>The good grip brush handle is longer than regular brushes and I love the off set positions.</li>
            <li>Well worth the cost!</li>
            <li>Thanks for making a more handicapped user accessible device.</li>
            <li>Excellent quality, reaches hard to get to places</li>
            <li>so I guess thats true.  </li>
            <li>I use it for my back sometime and the angle works good for me.  </li>
            <li>I love this so much</li>
            <li>Wow, what a nice product.</li>
            <li>I wrote before, set is very nice as expected.</li>
            <li>It works great with the sponge, but with the other attachments it is a pain.</li>
            <li>I just find the handle too long for me to use comfortably (maybe because I&#x27;m short?), and I just can&#x27;t adjust the angle to work well for me TO hold it for greatest effectiveness, I have to do so mid-handle</li>
            <li>OTHER THAN THAT, ITS GREAT.</li>
            <li>Also, it arrived quickly, even during the holiday season.</li>
            <li>is the sponge attached wore out too quick.</li>
            <li>All of the different heads are lovely!</li>
            <li>If you make the head to turn around please make sure to make it so it will lock where needed, and still be strong enough to keep it from breaking.</li>
            <li>The different heads are nice to have to have if you need it.</li>
            <li>He was thrilled to gain back some independence</li>
            <li>was really surprised  at the sturdy quality and the ease of how to change out the pieces( even though I wich the sponge one was stuck on more stronger</li>
            <li>And the assorted attachments are useful.  </li>
            <li>The part of the brush snaps/breaks right where the brush handle and head join.</li>
            <li>Since it folds in half, will be good for traveling, too.    </li>
            <li>A HANDLE THAT IS EASIER TO GRIP WHEN WET AND SOAPY WOULD BE NICE.  </li>
            <li>I have difficulty applying lotion to my sore diabetic feet and this really reaches and works!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for several months now and it has lived up to my expectations and more.</li>
            <li>This set does exactly what it was meant to do.</li>
            <li>I am able to wash my back with ease.</li>
            <li>The 90&#x27; angle makes it so easy to reach my back without much effort since I have reduced mobility in my right shoulder.</li>
            <li>This one is very sturdy</li>
            <li>I really like the interchangeable heads and options they provide.  </li>
            <li>I am a Tool and Die Designer by trade, and when I see products that can be a great product but poorly designed I try to help a person out.  </li>
            <li>It stopped working after about one week which is really unacceptable for the price.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Very sturdy.</li>
            <li>I have 2 and keep one in the bath for gentle scrubbing and one in the bedroom.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like this.  </li>
            <li>you get straight or 90 degrees.  </li>
            <li>It makes getting to some spots much easier.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Very useful because I recently had hip surgery and cannot bend to wash my legs and feet.  </li>
            <li>The handle works fine even for someone with a long torso.</li>
            <li>So far its worked pretty well.</li>
            <li>So far I have just used the brush head, which is nice and soft, but I will eventually get around to using the other attachments too.  </li>
            <li>A great bath set for someone who is unable to bend well -- or really -- for anyone.  </li>
            <li>I like it mainly because it travels well.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>This would allow me to set the brush head to a more flat angle than at present when I have the handle set to a angle to make the brush to be away from the body.</li>
            <li>The sad part is, this is otherwise a great idea.</li>
            <li>I do not see this as an issue especially when positioning for better reach in the middle of my back.  </li>
            <li>It was easier to clean my back as well, which is a big plus for me.</li>
            <li>The design, although nice, is not strong enough at that point and although I made every effort to be as gentle as I could be, it broke every time at the same spot.</li>
            <li>Different head angle in the other direction might be good for other needs.</li>
            <li>Being a paraplegic in a wheelchair, I needed something extra long, so I wouldn&#x27;t have to bend over too much to clean my feet.</li>
            <li>Finally able to get those hard to places&lt;br /&gt;Great invention.</li>
            <li>Over time though the leverage of head was to much for the smaller plastic cogs at the pivot point.  </li>
            <li>I also find this set useful for back washing, pedicures, applying lotion and moisturizers on back, etc.</li>
            <li>A decent foldable bath brush with multiple attachments</li>
            <li>really like the way the handle can be at different angles unlike a regular bath brush.  </li>
            <li>I have used the pumice stone several times and no problems so far.  </li>
            <li>The only down side is that the loofah fell off the blue sponge-like backing after the first couple of uses.</li>
            <li>I was a little worried about the hinge perhaps weakening the overall design, however, this is a very well made item, is sturdy and made of quality materials.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Worked great for about 3 months then broke at this bendy joint. Needs a better design.</li>
            <li> Being a paraplegic in a wheelchair, I needed something extra long, so I wouldn&#x27;t have to bend over too much to clean my feet. This worked for that. It was easier to clean my back as well, which is a big plus for me. The only down side is that the loofah fell off the blue sponge-like backing after the first couple of uses. I&#x27;ll have to glue that back on, and hope it stays. The rest of the heads for the brush work great, so I plan to keep this product.</li>
            <li> I have used several different brushes over the years.  The plastic handles broke or the wooden ones eventually split.  This one is very sturdy so I do not see that being a problem.  I really like the interchangeable heads and options they provide.  I bought one for my daughter, too.  She likes it but said it is just a little too long...but she is short !!  I do not see this as an issue especially when positioning for better reach in the middle of my back.  Since it folds in half, will be good for traveling, too.    Enjoy !!</li>
            <li> Its a pretty good brush.  I&#x27;ve had this thing for 3 months now and usually use it wash my feet.  So far its worked pretty well. It says it doesn&#x27;t mold and I haven&#x27;t seen any mold yet so I guess thats true.  I use it for my back sometime and the angle works good for me.  The different heads are nice to have to have if you need it.</li>
            <li> A decent foldable bath brush with multiple attachments</li>
            <li> Sturdy product. Great product. Lotion distributor hard for a senior with little arm strength to use to apply lotion. Kept to use for grooming.</li>
            <li> I loved this brush at first, answer to all my prayers.  Then the brush head falls off and won&#x27;t stay one.  Now I&#x27;m reading the adjustable handle doesn&#x27;t  work. I&#x27;m not a happy camper.  Why doesn&#x27;t anyone else have this problem.</li>
            <li> I got this shower brush over a year ago. Absolutely awesome!! Nothing but good. I had a stroke 3years before. I have bought many \\&quot;shower thing-a-jig\\&quot; none of them worked. I bought this one, just really great!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my father who is disabled  due to a partially paralyzed leg, severe arthritis, and diabetic neuropathy among other things. He reported happily he is now able to wash his back and his feet by himself. It works well for him due to the length and the ability to angle the handle. He was thrilled to gain back some independence and I would highly recommend this product. Also, it arrived quickly, even during the holiday season.</li>
            <li> I am a Tool and Die Designer by trade, and when I see products that can be a great product but poorly designed I try to help a person out.  So here is the deal.  The spring is to weak that holds the head in position.  I put a heavier spring in your unit to have it work drastically better.  Over time though the leverage of head was to much for the smaller plastic cogs at the pivot point.  These cogs ended up breaking off rendering the head useless.  So here is my recommendation...... hehehe..... Make cogs out of alluminum not plastic.......... AND....... this is important....... Position the nobs so that the torque is not relying on the spring to keep the head from rotating.  Position them so that the torque is on the cog and not on the spring.  If you have a CAD system it wouldn&#x27;t take long to figure out the stress and proper positioning.....  Well I got carried away there......  Hopefully the manufacturer will read this and make some changes.</li>
            <li> It works great with the sponge, but with the other attachments it is a pain. Either you can&#x27;t get an attachment on or the attachments fall apart. If you buy it only get it with the sponge only.</li>
            <li> It is okay. The heads seem to be fairly cheaply made. I like the adjustability of it for elderly use or someone with limited shoulder/arm range of motion but I probably would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Hinge is not strong.  If you lock on anything short of all the way open it will not hold when you use it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this in the beginning. I ordered this after a car accident and a couple of bad surgeries left me not able to wash my back in any way. This did with the altered positions and wonderful different spunges and brushes. After a week though the locking mechanism stopped locking so no postion would hold. This made it impossible to wash my back with it and made it useless to me. If the locking mechanism were made more reliable, it would be perfect. It stopped working after about one week which is really unacceptable for the price. I have sent it back and I expect to be refunded for it.</li>
            <li> I use this for my feet, in the shower.  So far I have just used the brush head, which is nice and soft, but I will eventually get around to using the other attachments too.  This is a great idea.  I do wish there were a way of adjusting the length so I could make it a tiny bit shorter.  It came packaged in an attractive gift box so it would be excellent for giving - who couldn&#x27;t use one of these?</li>
            <li> Worked out I went on a 23 day road trip out west and back. It packed well and easy to carry on a trip.</li>
            <li> but the regular sponge head didn&#x27;t last long.  it started tearing and coming off after a few weeks of regular use.  Love the length though!! and the adjustable handle does make all the difference.</li>
            <li> After two or three uses, the sponges start to fall apart and/or have come unglued from each other.</li>
            <li> I love this so much I bought 2 of them  as back up and for the head replacements&lt;br /&gt;I was really surprised  at the sturdy quality and the ease of how to change out the pieces( even though I wich the sponge one was stuck on more stronger I think I will have to glue again )&lt;br /&gt;I especially love the bending elbow ,what a pleasure to change  the angle as I need with such ease and sturdiness&lt;br /&gt;but overall this is great ! would recommend to anyone with reaching challenges</li>
            <li> I like all the heads except the brush. It doesn&#x27;t hold soap or body wash! I use the lotion head the most. Makes it possible to apply creams to my lower legs and feet.</li>
            <li> My mom loves it. Thanks</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m just not a bath brush person, but issues with decreased mobility motivated me to get this and give it a try. I just find the handle too long for me to use comfortably (maybe because I&#x27;m short?), and I just can&#x27;t adjust the angle to work well for me TO hold it for greatest effectiveness, I have to do so mid-handle which then makes it slippery in my soapy hands and I can&#x27;t get a good grip on it. . I like the different brush heads, especially the pumice stone, but it is a royal pain to keep the brush AND all the heads handy and easy to use/change in the shower. Eventually, I just use the pumice stone without the handle. it&#x27;s a shame.</li>
            <li> 3rd shower I took, the handle would no longer hold position.&lt;br /&gt;Design of joint needs metal  components instead of plastic in order to handle the pressure used scrubbing back and other areas.  Not happy with unit at all..</li>
            <li> This product is a bit clumsy. I found the plastic pad they give to apply lotion a bit bla. I usually use the brush head to do this, as it also acts as a mild back or other scratcher. Helps when I use it on my back when I have an itch, and need to apply lotion to stop it. I still find the handle a bit clumsy otherwise. The head should be angle adjustable, and even be able to be turned around so the handle would not be in the way in some cases. If you make the head to turn around please make sure to make it so it will lock where needed, and still be strong enough to keep it from breaking. You did a good job on making the handle virtually break-proof. I would also like a wider head for some uses. An adjustable angle for the head might be a way to eliminate the need to turn the head around. This would allow me to set the brush head to a more flat angle than at present when I have the handle set to a angle to make the brush to be away from the body. This would make the brush a bit more body friendly. Different head angle in the other direction might be good for other needs. Thanks for making a more handicapped user accessible device.</li>
            <li> I think the concept is excellent. However the add on features and are to small for a big man like me</li>
            <li> A HANDLE THAT IS EASIER TO GRIP WHEN WET AND SOAPY WOULD BE NICE.  OTHER THAN THAT, ITS GREAT.</li>
            <li> For someone who cannot bend down to wash their legs or feet this is a God-send. All of the different heads are lovely! Very sturdy.</li>
            <li> Awesome product for me. I have difficulty applying lotion to my sore diabetic feet and this really reaches and works! I have 2 and keep one in the bath for gentle scrubbing and one in the bedroom.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like this.  It is very awkward to use on my back &amp; I am not keen on changing the brushes.</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THIS BRUSH FOR MY 77 YEAR OLD BROTHER WHO HAD TROUBLE REACHING PLACES ON HIS BACK.  HE IS REALLY HAPPY  WITH THE BRUSH.  HAVING THE EXTRA LENGTH WAS PERFECT.  I ALSO RECEIVED THE BRUSH TWO DAYS BEFORE THE ESTIMATED DELIVERY DATE AND IT WAS IN ENOUGH TIME FOR CHRISTMAS.</li>
            <li> Wow, what a nice product. I&#x27;ve had it for several months now and it has lived up to my expectations and more. I was a little worried about the hinge perhaps weakening the overall design, however, this is a very well made item, is sturdy and made of quality materials. I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I wrote before, set is very nice as expected. delivery on time,.good value for the price.Have been USING IT, LIKE IT.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality, reaches hard to get to places</li>
            <li> I just had the same thing occur with the 3rd brush like this. The part of the brush snaps/breaks right where the brush handle and head join. The design, although nice, is not strong enough at that point and although I made every effort to be as gentle as I could be, it broke every time at the same spot. The second one also had problems with the swivel, it stripped very shortly after I got it. The sad part is, this is otherwise a great idea. If they reinforced it at that small part of the bottom handle, they would have a winner.</li>
            <li> My father loved this gift. He has trouble with both shoulders and this allows him to reach his back when showering.</li>
            <li> The loofah sponge head came unglued from the base after the third use.  Not the best quality product.  I have used the pumice stone several times and no problems so far.  I wish the handle would adjust to more angles - you get straight or 90 degrees.  There needs to be a setting between 180 degrees and 90 degrees.</li>
            <li> I have only used this a couple of times and it does the job.  It feels a little weak like it can break easily.  We will see how it holds up,</li>
            <li> The worst, do NOT buy.</li>
            <li> This is great for bathing, but, also is good for use in cleaning (house); I am short and handicap.  I can attach the sponge or brush for reaching cabinets etc like putting on furniture polish, etc.</li>
            <li> great product!.  Very useful because I recently had hip surgery and cannot bend to wash my legs and feet.  The loofah feels especially good on my very dry  skin.  I would give it 5 stars but the lotion applicator was damaged when I received it.</li>
            <li> I got tired of replacing wood-handled back brushes and bought this kit. The handle works fine even for someone with a long torso. However, what are the hard plastic posts in the brush attachment for? To me, they make using the brush attachment very uncomfortable and unusable. Any suggestions about that? Can they be removed?    The loofah attachment suffices as a back cleaner for the time being. I find that the sponge attachments and the pumice stone work better when hand held. When I get to the point I can&#x27;t reach my legs and feet, then I&#x27;ll use the handle for those too.</li>
            <li> hard to use. I don&#x27;t even use them much better options out there</li>
            <li> Great product! I have osteoarthritis and now I can reach my back. The 90&#x27; angle makes it so easy to reach my back without much effort since I have reduced mobility in my right shoulder. Also I have a spa stool that I use in the shower and the handle length on the Lu La Brush enables me to reach my feet without  bending over. The good grip brush handle is longer than regular brushes and I love the off set positions. Well worth the cost! Thinking of purchasing another one just for my back and the other just for my legs and feet.</li>
            <li> Finally able to get those hard to places&lt;br /&gt;Great invention.</li>
            <li> Purchased this because I needed a brush that bends at the elbow to reach places That I can no longer scrub due to limited movement. It does exactly what I needed it for, the only problem is that it is very HEAVY. I have rheumatoid arthritis and it is just too heavy for my wrists and hands. I have a terrible time using it because of the weight. It is very well made and sturdy, so if using a heavy brush isn&#x27;t a problem, it does reach areas well. Wish they made this in 1/4 the weight so I could use it.</li>
            <li> A great bath set for someone who is unable to bend well -- or really -- for anyone.  I love this bath brush set!</li>
            <li> The attachments did not work well. If interested in buying a brush for your back this one is not a good choice..</li>
            <li> I realy like this and wanted to acknowledge it in a review.  It is well constructed.  And the assorted attachments are useful.  There is one for applying lotion and I had never considered using a tool like this to accomplish that.  It works great.  I like the way it folds up for storage.  And I like the way the angle of the brush can be adjusted.</li>
            <li> I cannot touch my toes, the loofah and pumice heads on this help me take care of my lower legs and the skin on my feet.  I don&#x27;t tend to get callouses so I can&#x27;t say how well it does for that,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the way the handle can be at different angles unlike a regular bath brush.  It makes getting to some spots much easier.&lt;br /&gt;The hanging loop is a good length allowing me to hang it on the shower door handle.  I also have a very handy place to keep it between showers that uses the folded handle feature well.</li>
            <li> This set does exactly what it was meant to do. I have been using it for months now, maybe a year. I love each brush for its purpose. I also find this set useful for back washing, pedicures, applying lotion and moisturizers on back, etc. I recommend this brush set for self and gifts for family and friends.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a back scrubber for a long time. I took a chance to spend above what I had in the past, and it paid off. I am able to wash my back with ease. Apply lotion to hard to reach spaces. It&#x27;s been amazing. I have yet to use all the different head applicators. I am pleased with my purchase. I can stop looking for back scrubbers.</li>
            <li> The pumice attachment was not glued onto the base that attaches to the brush handle.  For the cost, I hadn&#x27;t expected to have to make a repair before using!  I would not recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have recommended this set over and over. I like it mainly because it travels well.</li>
            <li> The lady that I gave it to said she loves it.  Says it gives her access to areas she had difficulty reaching.  She did comment that there should be more directions.</li>
            <li> Might be ok for your or wife Mother  but a little to fragile for me. Still it works well even though a little highly priced for the quality.</li>
            <li> The brush combo set is working as advertised. I find it a great help when taking a shower and when applying lotion to my back.</li>
            <li> I only gave it 4 stars because the loofah is separating from the sponge after only using it 2 times.  They need to come up with a better idea on that attachment, otherwise it is working quite nicely.</li>
            <li> Great for people who have had spinal back surgery.  Only&lt;br /&gt;complaint is the sponge attached wore out too quick. The&lt;br /&gt;glue on the sponge let go and the material tore.  You can&lt;br /&gt;get replacement heads at a fee.</li>
            <li> Handle is awkward and breaks very easily. I just used the tops and chucked the handle... then after about a month of use I tossed everything...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best PURCHASE EVER!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avoid if you want quality&lt;br /&gt;buy if your bored.</li>
            <li> needs anti slip on handle.</li>
            <li> Planned to use this after hip replacement surgery and quite honestly haven&#x27;t even opened it. but I will one of these days and I think it will come in handy.</li>
