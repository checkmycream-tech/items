            <li>I love this product because it also makes it faster to do my eyebrow versus using a pencil.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with item and quick delivery.</li>
            <li>This product is perfect if you want flawless looking eyebrows that last all day long with no smudging.</li>
            <li>Love it :) doesn&#x27;t smudge throughout the day but easy to remove when is time,</li>

            <li>Absolutely a great product... true to description, smooth application and easy to use, I would highly and have recommened it to many friends and family.</li>

            <li>For those with golden undertones, medium brown would work better and is a much better choice for me.  </li>
            <li>For those with golden undertones, medium brown would work better and is a much better choice for me.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>But it is easy to work with and does stay on all day.</li>
            <li>After I learned to use very little on my brush, I was able to apply it perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and blends perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Light handed strokes with their #7 brush is all you need.</li>
            <li>Use a light hand and an angle brush.</li>
            <li>This product does a great job of filling in my sparse areas, giving me a polished browline that defines my entire face.  </li>
            <li>It was worth 18 dollars for sure.</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product, I love that you do not need too much product to use on the brows...</li>
            <li>It is most certainly waterproof.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite items to use to fill in my eyebrows its so smooth &amp; easy to apply take a little practice to get the perfect brows but after a few tries this works great !</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fair with yellow undertones and have dark ash brown hair, this brow pomade matches my brows perfectly and they look natural, not overdone and not underdone.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the overall look</li>
            <li>New staple, love this product.</li>
            <li>Got to me quickly, and is by far my favorite every day beauty product.</li>
            <li>It is quite tricky to use at first because it can make your eyebrows look kind transparent in a sense particularly when you take pictures with a flash on it (from my experience) if you use too much or use it alone depending on the person.</li>
            <li>I love how natural my eyebrows look afterwards</li>
            <li>It was well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t even look like I draw them on, they look natural and look fuller. :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth your money.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to people that need to fill in their eyebrows and need an easy to use set</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, glides on, highly pigmented and stays put all day.</li>
            <li>I have used several other brands for eyebrow color and this is the BEST.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need alot of product on your angled brush, which is great since its a small container.</li>
            <li>Chocolate is a good color for anyone with dark hair that has reddish undertones.  </li>
            <li>I like very much the product!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love the fact that I got it two days earlier than what it said.</li>
            <li>I recommend to anyone that wants to try!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li>Plus my skin is oily and the powder seems to change tone once the hot summer rolls around.  </li>
            <li>Anastasia&#x27;s DIPBROW is exactly what everyone says it is...</li>
            <li>After filling in your brows, top it off with brow gel and your brows will last all day.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for your brows!!</li>
            <li>the product is and it can last you a VERY VERY long time which is great since it saves time and money.</li>
            <li>The color of this stuff is beautiful, it is easy to use but can be a little messy.</li>
            <li>I was kind of worried about the color because my hair is black.</li>
            <li>Dries v fast and doesn&#x27;t smudge even on</li>
            <li>fast delivery~</li>
            <li>Works really well for summer.</li>
            <li>It is a straight up brown with no warmth.  </li>
            <li>However, Dipbrow can look a bit drawn-on if you use too much of it.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product but will continue to use brow powder and pencil during the colder months.  </li>
            <li>The shipping was really fast, for me it took about 4 days.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping&amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>Easy to use and stays on long</li>
            <li>AMAAAAAAAZING long lasting and waterproof just amazing</li>
            <li>I love the colore dark brown</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product but am taking one star off for the color.for</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product but am taking one star off for the color.</li>
            <li>Its not smudgeproof (based on a test with my finger) but it is far more smudge-resistant (?) than other eyebrow products Ive used.</li>
            <li>Blond is lighter and warmer than Taupe which is a little more ash.  </li>
            <li>Blond is lighter and warmer than Taupe which is a little more ash.  </li>
            <li>Before the wax sets, its very easy to smudge the front of the eyebrow near the nose with a spooly to create a graduated fade instead of a harsh line.</li>
            <li>I love the texture and how if you mess up u can easily fix because it doesn&#x27;t dry too fast, but for it being the darkest shade they have I find it doesn&#x27;t match too well especially since my hair is more on the black side if I want it to look darker</li>
            <li>The powder, along with the eyebrow pencil in the same shade, slides right off when the humidity starts to climb.  </li>
            <li>and they look very natural.</li>
            <li>I use Anastasia&#x27;s brow powder duo in Medium Brown (only the lighter of the two shades) until the weather gets too hot.  </li>
            <li>Start by outlining a thin precise line underneath the brow and then doing the same to the top border of the brow.  </li>
            <li>I usually like a more natural look.</li>
            <li>this product is amazing and a little bit goes a very long way.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and does not rub off like other similar products!  </li>
            <li>They look so natural with it</li>
            <li>Natural looking.</li>
            <li>Also it&#x27;s very well packed in a big box to keep it from breaking.</li>
            <li>[[VIDEOID:mo1W8YCIGOKVHU1]]This product fills in my brows and makes them look sculpted yet natural.</li>
            <li>Also, the color is so natural.</li>
            <li>It makes my eyebrows look so natural.</li>
            <li>Makes my brows look so natural</li>
            <li>Stays put and looks natural.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s completely sweatproof.  </li>
            <li>It looks so natural it hasn&#x27;t faded or smudge, some people already complimented on my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week so far no oily eyebrows</li>
            <li>but I find that doesn&#x27;t make my eyebrows look too natural</li>
            <li>it gives a natural finish.</li>
            <li>Takes a couple of tries to get used to texture, but worth it.</li>
            <li>My tip is to make sure to close the lid extra tightly so it does not dry out.</li>
            <li>Last a few months &amp; easy to apply</li>
            <li>My hair is golden dark blond</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I expected it to be it, the product arrived in a sealed box and inside it was wrapped around bubble plastic or</li>
            <li>I use a Japonesque travel brow brush, which is really thin and stiff and works well, better than the Anastasia brow brush, which spreads out after a while, preventing me from getting a really precise line.</li>
            <li>Next to the WET &amp; WILD ULTIMATE BROW KIT, this is another product I absolutely love for my eyebrows and use it with my Wet &amp; Wild.</li>
            <li>Then, without picking up any more product, use short strokes to fill in the brow completely, taking care to do the inner edge (towards the nose) last so that there&#x27;s very little Dipbrow on the brush.  </li>
            <li>The trick is to barely tap it to the product and then wipe the excess off before applying to the brow.  </li>
            <li>I read the reviews on Amazon and so was fully aware of using only the very slightest touch of DIPBROW because a little truly does go a long way!  </li>
            <li>Slightly darker than expected, pretty much matched the intensity of my Asian black/brown hair.</li>
            <li>(to create the Dark Brown look due to my unique haircolor)</li>
            <li>Not only is it too dark, but it&#x27;s got way too much warmth in it.  </li>
            <li>Do not worry about the price because you can use so little at a time, it should last much longer than anything else...and there is quite a lot in the jar.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m fair with yellow undertones and have dark ash brown hair, this brow pomade matches my brows perfectly and they look natural, not overdone and not underdone.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the overall look</li>
            <li> New staple, love this product.</li>
            <li> Got to me quickly, and is by far my favorite every day beauty product.</li>
            <li> It is quite tricky to use at first because it can make your eyebrows look kind transparent in a sense particularly when you take pictures with a flash on it (from my experience) if you use too much or use it alone depending on the person.</li>
            <li> I love how natural my eyebrows look afterwards</li>
            <li> It was well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t even look like I draw them on, they look natural and look fuller. :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth your money.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to people that need to fill in their eyebrows and need an easy to use set</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, glides on, highly pigmented and stays put all day.</li>
            <li> I have used several other brands for eyebrow color and this is the BEST.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need alot of product on your angled brush, which is great since its a small container.</li>
            <li> Chocolate is a good color for anyone with dark hair that has reddish undertones.  </li>
            <li> I like very much the product!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love the fact that I got it two days earlier than what it said.</li>
            <li> I recommend to anyone that wants to try!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> Plus my skin is oily and the powder seems to change tone once the hot summer rolls around.  </li>
            <li> Anastasia&#x27;s DIPBROW is exactly what everyone says it is...</li>
            <li> After filling in your brows, top it off with brow gel and your brows will last all day.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for your brows!!</li>
            <li> the product is and it can last you a VERY VERY long time which is great since it saves time and money.</li>
            <li> The color of this stuff is beautiful, it is easy to use but can be a little messy.</li>
            <li> I was kind of worried about the color because my hair is black.</li>
            <li> Dries v fast and doesn&#x27;t smudge even on</li>
            <li> fast delivery~</li>
            <li> Works really well for summer.</li>
            <li> It is a straight up brown with no warmth.  </li>
            <li> However, Dipbrow can look a bit drawn-on if you use too much of it.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product but will continue to use brow powder and pencil during the colder months.  </li>
            <li> The shipping was really fast, for me it took about 4 days.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping&amp;#60;3</li>

            <li> I highly recommend this product but am taking one star off for the color.</li>
            <li> Its not smudgeproof (based on a test with my finger) but it is far more smudge-resistant (?) than other eyebrow products Ive used.</li>
            <li> Blond is lighter and warmer than Taupe which is a little more ash.  </li>
            <li> Blond is lighter and warmer than Taupe which is a little more ash.  </li>
            <li> Before the wax sets, its very easy to smudge the front of the eyebrow near the nose with a spooly to create a graduated fade instead of a harsh line.</li>
            <li> I love the texture and how if you mess up u can easily fix because it doesn&#x27;t dry too fast, but for it being the darkest shade they have I find it doesn&#x27;t match too well especially since my hair is more on the black side if I want it to look darker</li>
            <li> The powder, along with the eyebrow pencil in the same shade, slides right off when the humidity starts to climb.  </li>
            <li> and they look very natural.</li>
            <li> I use Anastasia&#x27;s brow powder duo in Medium Brown (only the lighter of the two shades) until the weather gets too hot.  </li>
            <li> Start by outlining a thin precise line underneath the brow and then doing the same to the top border of the brow.  </li>
            <li> I usually like a more natural look.</li>
            <li> this product is amazing and a little bit goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and does not rub off like other similar products!  </li>
            <li> They look so natural with it</li>
            <li> Natural looking.</li>
            <li> Also it&#x27;s very well packed in a big box to keep it from breaking.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1W8YCIGOKVHU1]]This product fills in my brows and makes them look sculpted yet natural.</li>

            <li> It looks so natural it hasn&#x27;t faded or smudge, some people already complimented on my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week so far no oily eyebrows</li>
            <li> but I find that doesn&#x27;t make my eyebrows look too natural</li>
            <li> it gives a natural finish.</li>
            <li> Takes a couple of tries to get used to texture, but worth it.</li>
            <li> My tip is to make sure to close the lid extra tightly so it does not dry out.</li>
            <li> Last a few months &amp; easy to apply</li>
            <li> My hair is golden dark blond</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I expected it to be it, the product arrived in a sealed box and inside it was wrapped around bubble plastic or</li>
            <li> I use a Japonesque travel brow brush, which is really thin and stiff and works well, better than the Anastasia brow brush, which spreads out after a while, preventing me from getting a really precise line.</li>
            <li> Next to the WET &amp; WILD ULTIMATE BROW KIT, this is another product I absolutely love for my eyebrows and use it with my Wet &amp; Wild.</li>
            <li> Then, without picking up any more product, use short strokes to fill in the brow completely, taking care to do the inner edge (towards the nose) last so that there&#x27;s very little Dipbrow on the brush.  </li>
            <li> The trick is to barely tap it to the product and then wipe the excess off before applying to the brow.  </li>
            <li> I read the reviews on Amazon and so was fully aware of using only the very slightest touch of DIPBROW because a little truly does go a long way!  </li>
            <li> Slightly darker than expected, pretty much matched the intensity of my Asian black/brown hair.</li>
            <li> (to create the Dark Brown look due to my unique haircolor)</li>
            <li> Not only is it too dark, but it&#x27;s got way too much warmth in it.  </li>
            <li> Do not worry about the price because you can use so little at a time, it should last much longer than anything else...and there is quite a lot in the jar.</li>
            <li> It can be hard to get used to at first if you are used to using a pencil</li>
            <li> This color is a dark brown with a reddish undertone, a level darker than Soft Brown (which also has a reddish undertone).  </li>
            <li> If you are of darker complexion (African American) the dark brown applies ashy.</li>
            <li> Does however fade after long day out.</li>
            <li> It goes a long way too!</li>
            <li> I need something in between dark brown and blonde.</li>
            <li> This little jar will last forever</li>

            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> It is lightweight and does not smudge like other cream makeup I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll be purchasing in other colors as well.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this product , the chocolate was the perfect color for me . If you are of darker complexion (African American) the dark brown applies ashy. As soon as I get the appropriate brush for it I would love it even more . Angle brush is recommended</li>
            <li> They look so natural with it</li>
            <li> I love this! It glides onto my eyebrows and dries very quickly I love how natural my eyebrows look afterwards I highly recommend this to people that need to fill in their eyebrows and need an easy to use set</li>
            <li> How did I ever do my eyebrows without this?  Perfect color, easy to apply, stays on forever!  Waterproof, comes off easily with makeup remover.  Natural looking.</li>
            <li> New staple, love this product. It&#x27;s easy to use, glides on, highly pigmented and stays put all day. Slightly darker than expected, pretty much matched the intensity of my Asian black/brown hair. Good for a strong look. I use it along the bottom line of my lash and to define the tail of my brow.</li>
            <li> Love it :) doesn&#x27;t smudge throughout the day but easy to remove when is time,</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY love this pomade! Perfect color chocolate &amp; blends just like hair to my brows! Now this will be my only brow product</li>
            <li> Absolutely a great product... true to description, smooth application and easy to use, I would highly and have recommened it to many friends and family.</li>
            <li> this product is amazing and a little bit goes a very long way. i definitely recommend this to everyone !</li>
            <li> I have used several other brands for eyebrow color and this is the BEST. Goes on smoothly and blends perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a lot of product, I know it will last 6-12 months. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that I got it two days earlier than what it said. Also it&#x27;s very well packed in a big box to keep it from breaking. I love this stuff! So glad I bought it while it was on sale üòÅüòç</li>
            <li> This along with the Brow Wiz - best brow products on the market.  I use this on all my clients as well as myself and it really is easy to work with and gives AMAZING results!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with item and quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I purchased the medium brown and it absolutely blend in with my skin tone beautifully. It was well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Very nice quality but i gave it a 4 because it&#x27;s not that waterproof and it takes a very long time to perfect my brows with this.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, as described!  Easy to apply and does not rub off like other similar products!  I recommend to anyone that wants to try!</li>
            <li> one of the best eye brow fillers ever! I am such a big fan of all Anastasia beverly hills products!</li>
            <li> love anything by Anastasia</li>
            <li> This is the best my eyebrows have ever looked!  The color is perfect.  After I learned to use very little on my brush, I was able to apply it perfectly.  My eyebrows are so defined now without looking &amp;#34;drawn on&amp;#34;.  I have tried expensive pencils, powders, &amp;#34;pens&amp;#34;, gels and creams, but this works the best and looks the best.  Do not worry about the price because you can use so little at a time, it should last much longer than anything else...and there is quite a lot in the jar.</li>
            <li> Perfect shade... Exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> Best eyebrow product ever.</li>
            <li> I love the colore dark brown</li>
            <li> Works well with a little product. Light handed strokes with their #7 brush is all you need. Dries v fast and doesn&#x27;t smudge even on oily skin n humid weather. Does however fade after long day out. Does not work with sparse or no hair brows I think.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1W8YCIGOKVHU1]]This product fills in my brows and makes them look sculpted yet natural. I love it! Check out the video to see how I apply using a combination of chocolate and dark brown.</li>
            <li> most amazing brow product ever! fast delivery~</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and decided to try it. Needless to say, I&#x27;m ecstatic! My brows have always been sparse and with this pomade, they look beautifully groomed, much better than a pencil or powder and the product does not run even in the highest humidity, I love this and wish I had found it years ago. Also, the color is so natural. I&#x27;m fair with yellow undertones and have dark ash brown hair, this brow pomade matches my brows perfectly and they look natural, not overdone and not underdone.</li>
            <li> I love this for my eyebrows. It makes my eyebrows look so natural. It can be hard to get used to at first if you are used to using a pencil but after a couple of tries you will get used to it.</li>
            <li> Makes my brows look so natural</li>
            <li> The DIPBROW is very easy to use and the color is beautiful!  This would be something that I would definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> Love love this product!</li>
            <li> The color of this stuff is beautiful, it is easy to use but can be a little messy. If you don&#x27;t know how to properly conceal around the brow area you might need a tutorial to use this properly without looking foolish.</li>
            <li> Works really well for summer. Stays put and looks natural. Takes a couple of tries to get used to texture, but worth it.</li>
            <li> This is the best brow product I have used. Use a light hand and an angle brush.</li>
            <li> Just letting you know its cheaper at sephora.  I got mines for 23 $ after tax. Qaulity is amazing tho</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Brows stay on through EVERYTHING!</li>
            <li> This color is a dark brown with a reddish undertone, a level darker than Soft Brown (which also has a reddish undertone).  My hair is golden dark blond but my brows are a neutral brown and Chocolate was totally the wrong shade for me. Not only is it too dark, but it&#x27;s got way too much warmth in it.  I have since purchased Medium Brown, which is the perfect color.  It is a straight up brown with no warmth.  I use Anastasia&#x27;s brow powder duo in Medium Brown (only the lighter of the two shades) until the weather gets too hot.  The powder, along with the eyebrow pencil in the same shade, slides right off when the humidity starts to climb.  Plus my skin is oily and the powder seems to change tone once the hot summer rolls around.  So in the summer I use Dipbrow and it stays in place (once it&#x27;s set) all day with no fading or color changes. It&#x27;s completely sweatproof.  It also keeps my somewhat unruly brow hairs in line.  I use a Japonesque travel brow brush, which is really thin and stiff and works well, better than the Anastasia brow brush, which spreads out after a while, preventing me from getting a really precise line. However, Dipbrow can look a bit drawn-on if you use too much of it.  The trick is to barely tap it to the product and then wipe the excess off before applying to the brow.  Start by outlining a thin precise line underneath the brow and then doing the same to the top border of the brow.  Then, without picking up any more product, use short strokes to fill in the brow completely, taking care to do the inner edge (towards the nose) last so that there&#x27;s very little Dipbrow on the brush.  This product does a great job of filling in my sparse areas, giving me a polished browline that defines my entire face.  I never go anywhere without doing my brows.  It takes me about 10 minutes to do this routine, but the effort is well rewarded.  I really like this product but will continue to use brow powder and pencil during the colder months.  Chocolate is a good color for anyone with dark hair that has reddish undertones.  For those with golden undertones, medium brown would work better and is a much better choice for me.  For those with blond brows, either Blond or Taupe would work well.  Blond is lighter and warmer than Taupe which is a little more ash.  I&#x27;m sorry that I wasted money on the wrong color, but live and learn, right?  I highly recommend this product but am taking one star off for the color.for anyone with dark hair that has reddish undertones.

            <li> Great product - goes on smoothly and leaves a great finish. I love this!</li>
            <li> Best eyebrow filler on the market and I have tried them all.  A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> The shipping was really fast, for me it took about 4 days. I was kind of worried about the color because my hair is black. I use to use black eye shadow and that would fade or rub off end of the school day. This product is now my fave product to use for my eyebrows. It looks so natural it hasn&#x27;t faded or smudge, some people already complimented on my eyebrows. I also used this for my mom&#x27;s eyebrows and she loves it. It was worth 18 dollars for sure.</li>
            <li> I have eyebrows!!  Yay!  Anastasia&#x27;s DIPBROW is exactly what everyone says it is...AWESOME!  I read the reviews on Amazon and so was fully aware of using only the very slightest touch of DIPBROW because a little truly does go a long way!  (I also brush against the jar ridge just in case.) This little jar will last forever and I only wish I&#x27;d had this years ago.  You can&#x27;t go wrong buying this product. (and a 2 ended applicator brush.)</li>
            <li> It is lightweight and does not smudge like other cream makeup I&#x27;ve used. It does not come with a brush, but i purchased the Anastasia Beverly hills brow brush #18 and it applies it perfectly. I have it in Chocolate but I&#x27;ll be purchasing in other colors as well.</li>
            <li> Love it! It goes a long way too! Doesn&#x27;t even look like I draw them on, they look natural and look fuller. :)</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite items to use to fill in my eyebrows its so smooth &amp; easy to apply take a little practice to get the perfect brows but after a few tries this works great !</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Love Anastasia Beverly Hills.</li>
            <li> I bought mine on Dec. 26 and received it on dec.28! I love this product and it&#x27;s a great gel for eyebrows. It was exactly what I expected it to be it, the product arrived in a sealed box and inside it was wrapped around bubble plastic or whatever it&#x27;s called lol so there was no damages to it. I recommend to buy it. It&#x27;s worth your money.</li>
            <li> Amazing! My eyebrows have always been lighter than my hair and this makes them match.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Fast shipping&amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved anastasia products. This product is perfect if you want flawless looking eyebrows that last all day long with no smudging.</li>
            <li> Will take some getting use to since Im so accustomed to pencil and powder, but I do like this dipbrow. You don&#x27;t need alot of product on your angled brush, which is great since its a small container.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Easy to apply. I have oily skin my eyebrows would look shiny and oily by the end of the day with other eyebrow products. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week so far no oily eyebrows no touching up during the day and they look very natural. So far best product ive used on my eyebrows. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it didn&#x27;t come with  the brush.</li>
            <li> Got to me quickly, and is by far my favorite every day beauty product. I love this stuff! And a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Last a few months &amp; easy to apply</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this DipBrow. After filling in your brows, top it off with brow gel and your brows will last all day. PERFECT!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this product! It goes on a bit thick but it just takes time to adjust and get used to.</li>

            <li> This product is fantastic. I have had it for over a year and still have plenty left. My tip is to make sure to close the lid extra tightly so it does not dry out. It also has incredible staying power; rain, sweat, you name it! It is not coming off!</li>
            <li> good product, delivery on time</li>
            <li> Next to the WET &amp; WILD ULTIMATE BROW KIT, this is another product I absolutely love for my eyebrows and use it with my Wet &amp; Wild. I love how the texture and creamy the product is and it can last you a VERY VERY long time which is great since it saves time and money. It is quite tricky to use at first because it can make your eyebrows look kind transparent in a sense particularly when you take pictures with a flash on it (from my experience) if you use too much or use it alone depending on the person. The Dark Brown is the hardest to find so I bought both the Chocolate and Ebony (to create the Dark Brown look due to my unique haircolor) and It is $18 at ULTA beauty stores and SEPHORA. I highly recommend this product for your brows!!</li>
            <li> This is very easy to use, though you do have to buy a brush separately.  You just need a little color on the brush otherwise it gets too dark for me.  But it is easy to work with and does stay on all day.</li>
            <li> I love the texture and how if you mess up u can easily fix because it doesn&#x27;t dry too fast, but for it being the darkest shade they have I find it doesn&#x27;t match too well especially since my hair is more on the black side if I want it to look darker I would have to apply more product but I find that doesn&#x27;t make my eyebrows look too natural n I usually like a more natural look.</li>
            <li> 5 star best eyes brows I recommend everyone get one</li>
            <li> It is most certainly waterproof. Its not smudgeproof (based on a test with my finger) but it is far more smudge-resistant (?) than other eyebrow products Ive used. With this product, its best for a sculpted eyebrow look similar to what most makeup artists wear. You do not have to set this with powder. Before the wax sets, its very easy to smudge the front of the eyebrow near the nose with a spooly to create a graduated fade instead of a harsh line. I love this product because it also makes it faster to do my eyebrow versus using a pencil.&lt;br /&gt;I do have one complaint, not about the product itself but it frustrates me that there is not enough colors! I need something in between dark brown and blonde.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Easy to use and stays on long</li>
            <li> I like very much the product!&lt;br /&gt;I got on time.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> AMAAAAAAAZING long lasting and waterproof just amazing</li>
            <li> Fantastic product, I love that you do not need too much product to use on the brows... I am very pleased with the overall look it gives a natural finish.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It builds well and looks amazing.</li>
            <li> Best eyebrow product I have used and the color was perfect for me. Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing product.</li>
