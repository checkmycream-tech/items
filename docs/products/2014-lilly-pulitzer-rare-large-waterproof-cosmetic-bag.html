            <li>Came fast too.</li>

            <li> The flat bottom is especially helpful to view what&#x27;s inside without items rolling out.  </li>
            <li> I can now see all the cosmetics I have in the bag &amp; it still stays fairly flat.  </li>
            <li> Larger than expected.  </li>
            <li> Larger than I expected.</li>
            <li> The only down fall is the interior of the bag is white.</li>
            <li> This bag was bigger than I expected!</li>
            <li> so if it gets dirty you can easily wipe it off.</li>
            <li> Thought it would be a little bigger</li>
            <li> Just what we expected</li>
            <li> has a shiny gold band along the zipper and around lilly Pulitzer pink fabric tag</li>
            <li> zipper is pink plastic.</li>
            <li> but I found something else for that purpose and still like this bag for other things.</li>
            <li> Disappointed as it is cheap piece of plastic/vinyl!</li>
            <li> Only complaint is I wish I bought one for myself..</li>
            <li> so it fits my eyeshawdow palettes and all my other makeup!</li>
            <li> I have the tendency to hoard makeup and have always had trouble finding a bag that can store all of my makeup.</li>
            <li> Poor stiff quality no softness or flexibility to folds</li>
            <li> When I received this bag, I was afraid I wouldn&#x27;t like it because it seemed so long.  </li>
            <li> Not a good cosmetic bag if you want to organize what you keep inside it.</li>
            <li> I was seduced by the idea of a Lilly Pulitzer bag, and must say I am annoyed at the inaccuracy of the description.  </li>
            <li> , like I said poor poor quality.</li>
            <li> which a lot of people don&#x27;t think about with a makeup bag, but I hate when the outside of the bag gets any makeup or crud on it.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t crazy about that.  </li>
            <li> Item not as described and highly disappointed in the purchase, will be returning immediately.</li>

            <li> Kinda too big in my opinion but in love with  the colors and material and the price was adorbs</li>
            <li> Wife loves this bag. Perfect size and quality for her needs.</li>
            <li> Perfect big bag - exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> I love this bag, i bought it for a Disney trip and it was perfect to hold all of my travel toiletries!</li>
            <li> This was very nice.  I didn&#x27;t realize the outside was plastic though.  Probably should have read the description more.  Anyway it is a nice size and my grand daughter will love it.</li>
            <li> I love this makeup case. Its a pretty big size case, great colors, &amp; is waterproof. I&#x27;m a Lilly junkie, so this is a nice piece to have.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s big and holds a lot</li>
            <li> perfect, received in 3 days. very spacious and looks just like the picture.</li>
            <li> Very big and roomy case. Great for traveling you could fit pretty much everything you need in here except for your shampoo bottles LOL.</li>
            <li> Awesome product and fast shipping</li>
            <li> Love this bag! Perfect size</li>
            <li> This bag is a delight! Much larger than I expected, but certainly not complaining since it can hold many things! Has a plastic feel to it and looks as though the fabric can give good protection against liquids. The print itself is beautiful and the color stand out enough where it looks almost neon. Zipper works well and doesn&#x27;t snag onto the fabric. Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase! Highly recommended, especially to those who have a larger bag and need some organization.</li>
            <li> Great Make Up Bag! I love style. The only down fall is the interior of the bag is white. Ughh Make up and white lining.... mmmm&lt;br /&gt;Although the material is great and easy to clean, which you should twice a month.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You I&#x27;m A Happy Girl!</li>
            <li> I ordered 4 of these bags for my bridesmaids. They are perfect. Waterproof material and great size. These bags can fit a lot in them. Thinking I might order another for myself. They&#x27;re adorable and the print is very bright. Love it!</li>
            <li> Holds all of my s***. Perfect.</li>
            <li> It is a plastic material and sit up straight so is great for a cosmetic bag that can sit in a small amount of water and not soak it up. The colors are more muted than they appear in the picture. It was a gift my daughter. Overall a good purchase</li>
            <li> Bigger than what I expected, but works perfectly for my make-up and other toiletries.</li>
            <li> zipper broke after two months, otherwise a beautiful bag that fit all my essentials for traveling.</li>
            <li> This was posted using a picture of a Lilly Pulitzer bag in a floral pattern - I was quite suprised when the package arrived and very suprised when I just logged on and the seller had changed the photo on Amazon as well. Item not as described and highly disappointed in the purchase, will be returning immediately.</li>
            <li> Thought it would be a little bigger but I like it.</li>
            <li> Lots of space. Love it</li>
            <li> This bag is absolutely perfect, much larger than I expected, and brand new!</li>
            <li> Was exactly like the picture and was big and lots of room on the inside deff should get this bag and the detail on it was so pretty</li>
            <li> Ordered this thursday and recieved it today!. I love it. Its just the right size! I definitely can&#x27;t wait to use this! Its super pretty in person</li>
            <li> This is a nice bag but it is not Lilly Pulitzer.  It says Est√©e Lauder/Lisa Perry.  I was seduced by the idea of a Lilly Pulitzer bag, and must say I am annoyed at the inaccuracy of the description.  However, it was a cheap bag and will hold my toiletries, so it does the trick.</li>
            <li> Just what we expected</li>
            <li> Love this bag its so big so it fits my eyeshawdow palettes and all my other makeup! And its super cute!!!</li>
            <li> This bag was bigger than I expected! I have the tendency to hoard makeup and have always had trouble finding a bag that can store all of my makeup. When I saw this bag, I fell in love with the color and thought that it would be a good replacement for the makeup bag that I already had. To my surprise, the bag holds everything that I need it to and more! The outside is water proof and can be wiped down easily if something spills on it.</li>
            <li> Poor stiff quality no softness or flexibility to folds, like I said poor poor quality. I ordered 4 other Lilly Pulitzer bags that are beautiful well made, this one is a looser.</li>
            <li> Great! Looks legit, price was amazing. It is a LITTLE smaller than I was expecting but it will be great for toiletries when I travel. I bought it as a big makeup dump bag but I found something else for that purpose and still like this bag for other things.</li>
            <li> I love that this cosmetic bag is made of a waterproof material. Great size for travel, and super cute.</li>
            <li> great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> Very nice loved it,and I got a free gift!!!!Fast delivery! Thank you!</li>
            <li> This a beautiful cosmetic bag.  I love most anything with the Lilly Pulitzer prints and this was just perfect.  I will love using this to travel and I got an extra for a friend too since the price was so perfect!</li>
            <li> Love it. Very roomy and reasonably priced</li>
            <li> Great bag! Came fast too. Love it</li>
            <li> perfect if you carry large handbags ... seems to be good quality ... love it!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent bag for traveling.  The flat bottom is especially helpful to view what&#x27;s inside without items rolling out.  The bag is colorful and will be easy to keep clean with a damp cloth.</li>
            <li> Larger than expected.  Love the water proof aspect so the bag is easy to clean on the outside, which a lot of people don&#x27;t think about with a makeup bag, but I hate when the outside of the bag gets any makeup or crud on it.  Fits in my new guess quincy tote perfectly</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot bigger than I thought it would be which is awesome!</li>
            <li> This thing holds so much stuff and is perfect for toiletries and such!  It arrived quickly and in fantastic condition.  I carry it with me on all of my overnight trips.</li>
            <li> my daughter is very happy with this comsmetic bag...thank you</li>
            <li> I really loved the size of this bag &amp; was surprised with a free gift weeks later. Will be ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li> My daughter loved it ! Bigger than it looks!</li>
            <li> This is a lot larger in person than it looks on the screen.  It wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting but that&#x27;s not Amazon&#x27;s fault.</li>
            <li> Disappointed as it is cheap piece of plastic/vinyl!</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my daughter, She loves it.</li>
            <li> Love the print and size, but I wish it had a pocket or two inside. Not a good cosmetic bag if you want to organize what you keep inside it.</li>
            <li> Perfect size! Fits everything nicely</li>
            <li> This bag was the perfect size.  I wanted something as a gift for a 13 year old--a bag she could use for dance makeup and was still big enough to hold hairspray.  This was perfect! Only complaint is I wish I bought one for myself..</li>
            <li> I love this make up bag! It got here really quick. Make up bag looks just like the picture. In love with this bag, it fits a lot of makeup, including a naked palette.</li>
            <li> Came on time. Packaged well. Perfect big bag for all the makeup under my sink. Keeps everything all organized. Perfect for taking on the road. Just as pictured!</li>
            <li> I love how fast it was shipped to me &amp; I love the item üíò</li>
            <li> When I received this bag, I was afraid I wouldn&#x27;t like it because it seemed so long.  That is a good thing for me.  I can now see all the cosmetics I have in the bag &amp; it still stays fairly flat.  It&#x27;s a very pretty color too.</li>
            <li> gorgeous &amp; big love it . üòç</li>
            <li> I bought this to use for makeup. The pattern on the bag I received does not look like the picture. It is still very cute, but more hot pink with fewer flowers - a different pattern entirely. It is a shiny plastic, and the bag is kind of narrow. It is almost more like a pouch than a bag. It is not what I was expecting, but I still use it and it works just fine. A good deal for the price!</li>
            <li> I love this makeup bag its big so its able to fit a lot of makeup.I like how it has plastic on the outside of the makeup bag so if it gets dirty you can easily wipe it off. The print is so gorgeous. This bag is exactly what it looks like on the picture and it came in very quick. I would definitley buy again.</li>
            <li> Perfect! Great size and beautiful</li>
            <li> Larger than I expected. Great bag.</li>
            <li> Arrive really fast like a day or two,when I open the package I saw the beautiful colors of it then rip the whole bag I was really surprised with my Lilly Pulitzer New makeup bag I am in love I read the reviews and they all had positive coments I love it !!!! :)</li>
            <li> Very cute, great price and holds a lot but &amp;#34;large&amp;#34; is not what I&#x27;d call it.  I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s more of a medium.</li>
            <li> Roomy and cute! Fits a lots of make up inside. Great price!</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as nice as the fabric ones and looks a little cheap.</li>
            <li> I love this makeup bag. I&#x27;ve had it for like 2 years now and it&#x27;s still strong! In lov!</li>
            <li> Great cute bag to hold all sorts of lotions and cosmetics.</li>
            <li> I love these cute little makeup bag!</li>
            <li> Did not realize the whole bag was a rubbery plastic.  I wasn&#x27;t crazy about that.  I decided not to carry it in my purse.</li>
            <li> Super cute, stores a lot</li>
            <li> Very pretty and a good size. Holds everything I need for a weekend away, makeup, wipes, etc</li>
            <li> Bigger than expectedd, but that was a positive for me. If this is something you are looking to fit into your purse it would not be the right one for that. Great material though,  easy to clean.</li>
            <li> nice large makeup bag. it has plastic shiny material on the outside and cottony fabric on the inside (so it is not waterproof inside). in a profile it is pretty flat, does not expand that much. overall pretty. has a shiny gold band along the zipper and around lilly Pulitzer pink fabric tag (the writing on a tag is in gold thread). zipper is pink plastic. looks exactly like pictured above</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> This was purchased to aid in my wife&#x27;s makeup organization with regards to travel and in our linen closet. She loves it, and it was/is bigger and more durable than I expected.</li>
