            <li> The lotion and shower gel was smaller than I expected and therefore the extra cost was not worth it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to find a pure lavender scent--and this is NOT it.</li>

            <li> Depending on how they respond, this may go down to 1 star.</li>
            <li> Instead of lavender, this is a heavy, perfume-y floral scent.</li>
            <li> Hard to find.  </li>
            <li> IT is hard to find  the tender lavender fragrance.</li>
            <li> I may be wrong, but I felt that some may have</li>

            <li> Wow!  Great customer service.  The package arrived EARLY, and the Healing Garden fragrance is sooooo nice!!  Happy Camper here...</li>
            <li> I love this product and this is the only place i can get it!!! The lavender smells right on. I also use it for my pillows!!!</li>
            <li> I gave all 3 that I had ordered away as giftsets and now they are after me for more plus I didn&#x27;t keep one for myself! What a bummer that you don&#x27;t sell these any longer....bwahhhhhh!</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find this on here. My supply is almost out the last place i had been able to find this was at kmart &amp; they no longer carry the line. I like thos because i dont have to basically take a bath in it. 1 spray on the wrist &amp; 1 spray walk through &amp; it&#x27;s plenty to last all day &amp; not be overpowering.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to find a pure lavender scent--and this is NOT it. I had high hopes from the number of high star reviews, but I should have known better--you have to actually smell it before you buy it. Instead of lavender, this is a heavy, perfume-y floral scent. And apparently it can&#x27;t be returned. I gave it 2 stars because I sent an email requesting a refund if I can&#x27;t return it. Depending on how they respond, this may go down to 1 star. Do NOT purchase this thinking that you are getting a nice lavender scent!!</li>
            <li> I did not like this at all.  It gave me a head ache right away and it doesn&#x27;t smell like fresh lavender at all.  It has a chemical smell.  I would not tell any one to buy this product.</li>
            <li> Great gifts it lavenders my favorite is very relaxing and smells wonderful</li>
            <li> My favorite.  Can&#x27;t get it anywhere else these days.</li>
            <li> I could not find Healing Garden Lavender at any stores that usually sold it, so I was very happy to find it here at Amazon. These are full sizes, not little samples.  This is the best, most natural smelling lavender at a great price!!</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance.  Hope I can find more.</li>
            <li> the large bottle of cologne did not seem to be completely filled.  I may be wrong, but I felt that some may have&lt;br /&gt;leaked enroute.  other than that, I am satisfied with the delivery.</li>
            <li> I always use The Healing Garden Mist and thought I&#x27;d buy the gift set instead.  I did not find it a good value.  The lotion and shower gel was smaller than I expected and therefore the extra cost was not worth it.  Of course, I will still purchase the Rainwater Body Mist separately.</li>
            <li> This produce it just what I expected.. I love the sent of lavender it provides, it&#x27;s very relaxing.. I would recomend this product to people who love lavender scent.</li>
            <li> Bought as gift for my mother-n-law. Lavender is her favorite scent and she was very happy with the gift.</li>
            <li> Love the scent.  Hard to find.  The small bottles are perfect for travel and my gym bag. Very soothing scent.</li>
            <li> It was okay but mot worth the cost.</li>
            <li> The gift set smells wonderful. I am planning to give these as part of a larger lavender-scented gift basket for Christmas.</li>
            <li> IT is hard to find  the tender lavender fragrance. The scent is soft and the lavender is very nice. If i find this fragrance some where else, i will buy several.</li>
            <li> Use it all the time...hard to find sometimes tho....</li>
            <li> Healing Garden products have a wonderful scent in high quality, soothing lotions, etc.  This is always a hit as a gift.</li>
