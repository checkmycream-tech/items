            <li>Good buy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used them to perfect smile lines and apply glitter/gel mixes.</li>
            <li>I love the feel of these brushes and the quality is great.  </li>
            <li>though, since they work well, fan out nicely, the bristles have all held up with no fall out.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>These are some really nice brushes.</li>
            <li>OMG I love these brushes because they have a beautiful design &amp; they are lightweight so its easy to use.</li>
            <li>And very economic product and qualitie very good, easy to store.</li>
            <li>Great gel brushes :) exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I will order this set if I ever need more.  </li>
            <li>venta ok ok</li>
            <li>So far, so good!</li>
            <li>The end resuelts was a smooth shed free strokes with me needing to work on speed and some bumps but from what i can tell any problems i&#x27;m having are from my own skills and not these.</li>
            <li>These are fairly nice, one of the brushes came unglued from the plastic handle the first time I went to use it!</li>
            <li>They are very nice brushes however, and the tips are soft and generous (full).</li>
            <li>Once again it was cheap for all of the brushes and i&#x27;ve even used it to do gel nails.</li>
            <li>They hold their shape well and are comfortable in the hand.</li>
            <li>I will use these to clean up around my nails when I do my nail art/ stamping.</li>
            <li>The price is good the ship time isn&#x27;t bad not the best but not bad.</li>
            <li>7 brushes for less that a dollar each is a great price.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice set, my daughter  really likes it he is 10 years old, has tiny hands and is super easy to use.</li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li>Just received mine and they are so pretty.</li>
            <li>and I love the purpleand white marble handles.</li>
            <li>That said, most of mine looked to be really similar in brush</li>
            <li>i have only one brush because they were so easily destroyed smh</li>
            <li>Each time I use them they kept the nails very study.</li>
            <li>Thanks for them..</li>
            <li>but if I would have spent a little more I could have gotten better ones.</li>
            <li>i hope this seller evaluates their products more thumbs down on all levels</li>
            <li>I got these brushes in hopes that I could do little details on my nails with them, but most of the time the bristles just spread out.</li>
            <li>They match exactly to some dotting tools I already bought a while back.</li>
            <li>very practical n totally meet my expectations, will order again.</li>
            <li>I use acetone or nail polish remover to clean my brushes, and they haven&#x27;t dried out or anything.</li>
            <li>did I mention the pretty pink handles?&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li>So far i&#x27;ve used this 2 brushes one of the bigger for doing gel nail extensions and 1 to do a french tip it a couple colors.</li>
            <li>They are all labeled with different sizing numbers, but the only major size difference is between 2 and 12.</li>

            <li> i have only one brush because they were so easily destroyed smh i hope this seller evaluates their products more thumbs down on all levels&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sincerely from a nail tech</li>
            <li> I ordered these to use as manicure clean-up brushes to remove polish around my cuticles and from the pictures I was expecting these to be smaller. They are very nice brushes however, and the tips are soft and generous (full). Shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li> Just as described! So far, so good! I&#x27;ve used them to perfect smile lines and apply glitter/gel mixes. I use acetone or nail polish remover to clean my brushes, and they haven&#x27;t dried out or anything.</li>
            <li> I just started working with gel polishes and use these to allpy the gel.  I love the feel of these brushes and the quality is great.  I will order this set if I ever need more.  Great buy at a great price.</li>
            <li> These are fairly nice, one of the brushes came unglued from the plastic handle the first time I went to use it!</li>
            <li> The brushes will do the job but if I would have spent a little more I could have gotten better ones. I still like em alot!</li>
            <li> I like this set. Once again it was cheap for all of the brushes and i&#x27;ve even used it to do gel nails. The bristles can tolerate the gel, definately a good set to have.Good buy.</li>

            <li> The brushes looks just like the picture, I bought it to use with the liquid gel, haven&#x27;t used it yet.</li>

            <li> very practical n totally meet my expectations, will order again. And very economic product and qualitie very good, easy to store.</li>

            <li> These are great, inexpensive, nail art design brushes. 7 brushes for less that a dollar each is a great price. That said, most of mine looked to be really similar in brush head  size. They are all labeled with different sizing numbers, but the only major size difference is between 2 and 12. I&#x27;m not worried about that though, since they work well, fan out nicely, the bristles have all held up with no fall out.&lt;br /&gt;And did I mention the pretty pink handles?&lt;br /&gt;Nice product, nice price!</li>
            <li> These are some really nice brushes. They hold their shape well and are comfortable in the hand. Will definitely order another set when these need replaced!</li>
            <li> So far i&#x27;ve used this 2 brushes one of the bigger for doing gel nail extensions and 1 to do a french tip it a couple colors. The end resuelts was a smooth shed free strokes with me needing to work on speed and some bumps but from what i can tell any problems i&#x27;m having are from my own skills and not these. The price is good the ship time isn&#x27;t bad not the best but not bad.</li>
