            <li>miss the original OPIUM!!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this wonderfully aromatic perfume!</li>
            <li>The old formula is wonderful!</li>
            <li>I love the smell of Opium</li>
            <li>ok, those of us that love the scent of opium don&#x27;t need my adjectives to describe it.</li>
            <li>many, it&#x27;s a &#x27;night time&#x27; fragrance.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am well satisfied on all accounts.</li>
            <li>The compliments I get about the way I smell have been driving me to the YSL counter for many, many years.  </li>
            <li>This is my mother&#x27;s favorite fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li>This is my favorite fragrance-holds more to the spice side than the floral.  </li>
            <li>I HAVE BEEN WEARING OPIUM FOR MORE THAN 20 YEARS.</li>
            <li>and I am so glad to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite perfume</li>
            <li>I like it because it is sophisticated and feminine, sexy but not overly musky.  </li>
            <li>Bought this for my girl friend because it is her favorite.</li>
            <li>This perfume has been my wife&#x27;s favorite for many years.</li>
            <li>Has been my favorite for over 25 years</li>
            <li>Not a watered-down version - but the true exotic spice scent I have come to love.</li>
            <li>Through searching for the original scent, I found this and am so glad that I did.  </li>
            <li>This is a Spicy Fragrance that is easily</li>
            <li>I where it everyday and get lots of comments on how wonderful I smell.</li>
            <li>The scent of Opium is fantastic.</li>
            <li>The scent has a good staying power as well, doesn&#x27;t fade away as quickly as say, Chanel no. 5, but is also not heavy as the scents of Ciara or Tabu.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it is the original eau de toilette.</li>
            <li>With the original, it was almost funny as to how many people would stop me and ask what cologne I was wearing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Opium is the one that will stay true.  </li>
            <li>you for the quick response in completing the order.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>Very pretty</li>
            <li>just a &#x27;spritz&#x27; worth and you&#x27;re set.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>And the price is right.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered this particular product before and will enjoy doing it again.  </li>
            <li>Not only have we loved it, but many of us (myself included) have had women stop us in the supermarket or other public areas to ask us which perfume we are wearing because they love the way</li>
            <li>But what really works for me is the scent&#x27;s endurance!</li>
            <li>discovered this when my most recent bottle of Opium smelled more like the scents my teenage daughters use.  </li>
            <li>women have contacted Yves Saint Laurent and were told by the company that they had changed the formula so as to appeal to more international</li>
            <li>My first introduction to this was about twenty years ago as a gift from a friend.  </li>
            <li>so, but for the first time in over 20 years, I did not get one compliment as to what perfume I was wearing.  </li>
            <li>I was thrilled to finally find the &#x27;old&#x27; Opium scent.</li>
            <li>The latter is too strong for me.</li>
            <li>Apparently, something they used in the original formula, is protected, or not allowed in the country manufacturing the perfume.</li>
            <li>I got the same quality and bottle as you would in a fine department store.</li>
            <li>and I got extremely fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Its much like espresso-Its an aquired taste and</li>
            <li>There are many other women besides me who have used Opium as their signature scent for years.  </li>
            <li>some unfathomable reason Yves Saint Laurent changed the formula of this classic scent.  </li>
            <li>Just this morning the young man at McDonald&#x27;s said \\&quot;you smell really</li>
            <li>They have made other variations of this perfume before and could have just marketed the new scent with another name - like \\&quot;Opium Spring,\\&quot; or \\&quot;Opium Poppy,\\&quot; or \\&quot;Light Opium.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>I always get her a new one when I see she is running out.</li>
            <li>I received the new bottle.  </li>
            <li>Instead, I received the new formula of Opium and had to return it.  </li>
            <li>Once these run out, if they haven&#x27;t changed the scent back to the original, I am switching not only perfumes but also perfume houses.</li>
            <li>EDT are fine and long lasting as compared to the EDP-frankly</li>
            <li>but I LOVE deep dark oriental spices and this is just the ticket!  </li>
            <li>so any compliments from young men are</li>
            <li>and I was pleasantly surprised with the price.</li>
            <li>the idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I managed to purchase a couple of bottles of the old formula at an online auction site.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the product displayed from the advertised photo thinking that it was the old formula of Opium perfume.  </li>
            <li>All in all both are well worth the money spent.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very light scent, you only have to use small dabs at a time.</li>
            <li>it is so large it is lasting a long  time</li>
            <li>Personally this smells like a girl version of Old Spice.</li>
            <li>company shipping this fake product, TUCCNI, makes no provision for return, stating it is a hazardous material, what a JOKE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I fault Amazon for connecting themselves to a FRAUDULENT company such as this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see much difference when it comes to these dark scents.</li>
            <li>good\\&quot; as I paid for my large cup of black coffee.  </li>
            <li>I give Opium a scent life of around four hours before it looses its strength while Cinnabar does not loose scent until six hours later.  </li>
            <li>and instead I got something with a black cap; it said \\&quot;Opium\\&quot; on the bottle, but it doesn&#x27;t smell like the real product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>IT WAS IN COMPLETE WRAPPER, AND I KNOW THAT IT WOULD TAKE YEARS FOR AN UN-OPENED BOTTLE TO LOOSE ITS FRAGARENCE</li>

            <li> She brought it back and said it was a faux toilet</li>
            <li> but Opium is the only one that brings me compliments every single time I wear it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Opium products so long, I can&#x27;t remember.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a long time</li>
            <li> I spray a small am&#x27;t on undergarment and I can enjoy the subtle, intoxicating fragrance until laundry day.</li>
            <li> I decided to re-visit that scent, since it has been a long while since I have been in college!  </li>
            <li> Its in close comparison with Cinnabar but Cinnabar is just a tad darker and Opium is just a tad sweeter but both are deep and dark scents.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Same complaint as other buyers of this expressed.</li>
            <li> very disappointed in the new formula it does not have any near the body and or scent that the old formula had.</li>
            <li> The new formula makes me ill, therefore, I cannot use it.  </li>
            <li> It is too bad the new opium is not the same.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the same stuff, but no fancy box and is therefore less expensive.</li>
            <li> I use it every day and  in the past people used to ask me all the time what perfume I was wearing.</li>
            <li> Opium is one of very few colognes that I can use and not have allergy problems.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but the sprayer is hard to distiguish where it is gong to come from.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, especially with the seller trying to get one over on the public.</li>
            <li> It is very difficult to get all of the perfume out of the bottle once it gets really low.  </li>
            <li> and I just seem to never get tired of it.  </li>
            <li> When I went to the store to buy a new bottle of this cologne, I found out that the scent had been changed and it was awful.  </li>
            <li> That was my understanding, I could be wrong.  </li>
            <li> I WOULD REMORE THIS BAD REVIEW,  JAF</li>
            <li> /&gt;QUITE disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have used it for well over 25 years and very disappointed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed that they&#x27;ve changed the formulation.  </li>

            <li> very disappointed in the new formula it does not have any near the body and or scent that the old formula had. I have used it for well over 25 years and very disappointed</li>
            <li> The Best Scent Ever...long time favorite.  Great price and I got extremely fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I thought this is what I ordered but what I recieved was a 3 unce bottle. Very pretty but the sprayer is hard to distiguish where it is gong to come from. As in sometimes I just spray air. I love the smell of Opium so I will survive.. Next time I will double check the bottle type and size</li>
            <li> ok, those of us that love the scent of opium don&#x27;t need my adjectives to describe it. Exotically oriental would simplify it. But what really works for me is the scent&#x27;s endurance! I spray a small am&#x27;t on undergarment and I can enjoy the subtle, intoxicating fragrance until laundry day. Don&#x27;t need a lot...just a &#x27;spritz&#x27; worth and you&#x27;re set.&lt;br /&gt;For many, it&#x27;s a &#x27;night time&#x27; fragrance. For me, all day, any day.(I&#x27;m retired).</li>
            <li> This is a Spicy Fragrance that is easily recognized!&lt;br /&gt;It is my Mom&#x27;s Signature Fragrance!&lt;br /&gt;She loves it!</li>
            <li> Lady  friend is happy , which makes me happy</li>
            <li> This perfume is marvelous! My husband LOVES it! I got the same quality and bottle as you would in a fine department store. I am well pleased!!!</li>
            <li> I have several perfumes that I wear through the week but Opium is the only one that brings me compliments every single time I wear it.  Just this morning the young man at McDonald&#x27;s said \\&quot;you smell really good\\&quot; as I paid for my large cup of black coffee.  I&#x27;m 52 so any compliments from young men are extra special!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Opium smells different on everyone but I feel sexy, youthful, and beautiful when I wear it.  I highly recommend this wonderfully aromatic perfume!</li>
            <li> Very fine product from a very great retailer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am well satisfied on all accounts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the Opium spray.  You save a good deal of money by ordering through Amazon. I&#x27;m going to order another bottle; at this price, I can stock up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this particular product before and will enjoy doing it again.  Prodoct is as advertised and shipping is prompt.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Opium products so long, I can&#x27;t remember.  But, I buy all sizes.  The smaller ones are for travel, which I do a lot.  The compliments I get about the way I smell have been driving me to the YSL counter for many, many years.  Thank God, I can once in a while find an affordable price at websites like yours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Susan</li>
            <li> This is my mother&#x27;s favorite fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for the quick response in completing the order.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite fragrance-holds more to the spice side than the floral.  I have a problem with scents changing on my skin (and NOT in a good way!).  Opium is the one that will stay true.  I was leary about ordering it online - but my fears were put at ease when I received my product.  Not a watered-down version - but the true exotic spice scent I have come to love.</li>
            <li> This is the only scent that I wear.  When I went to the store to buy a new bottle of this cologne, I found out that the scent had been changed and it was awful.  Through searching for the original scent, I found this and am so glad that I did.  I am using this product wisely because I do not want to run out.</li>
            <li> I buy this perfume for my wife several times per year. This purchase was 1) Good Price 2) Quick delivery. I was very satisfied and will use them again.</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN WEARING OPIUM FOR MORE THAN 20 YEARS. AND NEVER SMELLED ONE LIKE THIS ONE?? MY HUSBAND BOUGHT THIS LAST JUNE FOR MY BIRTHDAY. I JUST OPENED IT! IT WAS IN COMPLETE WRAPPER, AND I KNOW THAT IT WOULD TAKE YEARS FOR AN UN-OPENED BOTTLE TO LOOSE ITS FRAGARENCE&gt; THIS SMELLS LIKE ONE OF THOSE FAKES THAT ARE SOLD AS AUTHENITIC?? I WONT BUY THERE AGAIN UNLESS YOU CORRECT THIS! I AM MORE THAN HAPPY TO RETURN IT WITH ALL THE WRAPPING FOR AN EXCHANGE, AT WHICH TIME I WOULD REMORE THIS BAD REVIEW,  JAF</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff, and I have to admit it still makes me go woof-woof. I always get her a new one when I see she is running out. So impressed was I, that I purchased Opium for Men (which is also great). Now we are both on opiates (or are opiates on us?). And the price is right. If you can, get a tester. It&#x27;s the same stuff, but no fancy box and is therefore less expensive.</li>
            <li> This is not for everyone but I LOVE deep dark oriental spices and this is just the ticket!  Its in close comparison with Cinnabar but Cinnabar is just a tad darker and Opium is just a tad sweeter but both are deep and dark scents.  Its much like espresso-Its an aquired taste and this is no exception.  Although I must confess that Cinnabar seems to last a bit longer after application then Opium before re-applying.  I give Opium a scent life of around four hours before it looses its strength while Cinnabar does not loose scent until six hours later.  All in all both are well worth the money spent.  EDT are fine and long lasting as compared to the EDP-frankly I don&#x27;t see much difference when it comes to these dark scents.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it is the original eau de toilette. I have been using this product for a long time and I can see the difference. I use it every day and  in the past people used to ask me all the time what perfume I was wearing. Now, I can not smell it and it doesn&#x27;t stay in my body.</li>
            <li> This fragrance I have been wearing for 30 years.  The old formula is wonderful! It is too bad the new opium is not the same.</li>
            <li> Opium is my signature scent and I am so glad to find it on Amazon.  I where it everyday and get lots of comments on how wonderful I smell.</li>
            <li> I received this product in a timely fashion.  This is my favorite perfume and I was pleasantly surprised with the price.</li>
            <li> Personally this smells like a girl version of Old Spice. BUT if you purchase it from the actual website it smells slightly different and it lasts longer than say you purchase it from amazon.</li>
            <li> The product was known before purchasing from Amazon.  Because of fair price, no shipping charges and no tax, I chose to purchase online.</li>
            <li> The scent of Opium is fantastic. I have used it for over 20 years and it is the only scent I use. People always comment it is great.</li>
            <li> Opium is one of very few colognes that I can use and not have allergy problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell will last all day.</li>
            <li> Perfume arrived in plenty of time for Christmas.  It caused the hoped for reaction...hugs...smooches..and smiles.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to finally find the &#x27;old&#x27; Opium scent.</li>
            <li> I was under the impression that I was getting the standard Opium EDT for my wife&#x27;s birthday..... and instead I got something with a black cap; it said \\&quot;Opium\\&quot; on the bottle, but it doesn&#x27;t smell like the real product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel that I had a &#x27;bait &amp; switch&#x27; pulled on me, but as it was a birthday present we are now stuck with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;QUITE disappointed.</li>
            <li> Same complaint as other buyers of this expressed. Not the product I ordered and paid for!!!! I ordered the 3.3 oz bottle for $63.45 + shipping and received a 3.0 oz bottle listed for $57.50. This was a Valentine gift for my wife, she like others says it is a different fragrance from her existing bottle of Opium. Even I could smell the difference!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company shipping this fake product, TUCCNI, makes no provision for return, stating it is a hazardous material, what a JOKE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I fault Amazon for connecting themselves to a FRAUDULENT company such as this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shame on you Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love my Opium!!!.....by Yves Saint Laurent.  I have used it for years and I just seem to never get tired of it.  I smell great!!!</li>
            <li> My husband bought me some opium eau de toilette several years ago, and I use it almost exclusively as my signature scent.  I like it because it is sophisticated and feminine, sexy but not overly musky.  The scent has a good staying power as well, doesn&#x27;t fade away as quickly as say, Chanel no. 5, but is also not heavy as the scents of Ciara or Tabu.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FIVE YEARS LATER:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some unfathomable reason Yves Saint Laurent changed the formula of this classic scent.  There are many other women besides me who have used Opium as their signature scent for years.  Not only have we loved it, but many of us (myself included) have had women stop us in the supermarket or other public areas to ask us which perfume we are wearing because they love the way it sells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I discovered this when my most recent bottle of Opium smelled more like the scents my teenage daughters use.  I decided to buy the perfume, believing that maybe the Eau de Toilette&#x27;s alcohol was reacting to my personal skin chemistry in a different way.  It was when I looked at the reviews on the web page when I was about to purchase the perfume that tipped me off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some women have contacted Yves Saint Laurent and were told by the company that they had changed the formula so as to appeal to more international customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why would they do this?  They have made other variations of this perfume before and could have just marketed the new scent with another name - like \\&quot;Opium Spring,\\&quot; or \\&quot;Opium Poppy,\\&quot; or \\&quot;Light Opium.\\&quot;  You get the idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I managed to purchase a couple of bottles of the old formula at an online auction site.  Once these run out, if they haven&#x27;t changed the scent back to the original, I am switching not only perfumes but also perfume houses.</li>
            <li> Great product  Better than new product loved it loved it loved loved it loved it loved it loved it great</li>
            <li> Bought this for my girl friend because it is her favorite. She was thrilled and it is so large it is lasting a long  time</li>
            <li> I wanted the bottle of Opium shown in the picture.  I received the new bottle.  The latter is too strong for me.</li>
            <li> I wish I could give this review a zero star.  I have used Opium perfume for years. Recently, Opium changed their packaging AND their formula.  The new formula makes me ill, therefore, I cannot use it.  I ordered the product displayed from the advertised photo thinking that it was the old formula of Opium perfume.  Instead, I received the new formula of Opium and had to return it.  Very disappointed, especially with the seller trying to get one over on the public.</li>
            <li> My first introduction to this was about twenty years ago as a gift from a friend.  Have bought it ever since.  Like it for it&#x27;s very light scent, you only have to use small dabs at a time. Always receive comments .</li>
            <li> A representative told me, do to changes in custom regulations, they had to change the formula.  Apparently, something they used in the original formula, is protected, or not allowed in the country manufacturing the perfume. That was my understanding, I could be wrong.  They apologized, but felt they still have a very good product, with a wonderful scent.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe so, but for the first time in over 20 years, I did not get one compliment as to what perfume I was wearing.  With the original, it was almost funny as to how many people would stop me and ask what cologne I was wearing.&lt;br /&gt;I miss the original OPIUM!!</li>
            <li> Bought it for a friend so she could gift it to someone else. She brought it back and said it was a faux toilet water.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll never buy this type of product on line again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn Opium for over 25 years.  I&#x27;m very disappointed that they&#x27;ve changed the formulation.  If it ain&#x27;t broke ... don&#x27;t fix it.  Returning it .... I want my money back!</li>
            <li> This perfume has been my wife&#x27;s favorite for many years. It was easy to get it at a great price thru Amazon.</li>
            <li> I wore this all through college and was always complimented on the scent.  I decided to re-visit that scent, since it has been a long while since I have been in college!  It was just as I remembered it.  The only thing that I can say about this purchase is that the packaging and bottle were not as pictured.  Other than that, I am very happy with my purchase.  As always, I love you Amazon!</li>
            <li> Has been my favorite for over 25 years</li>
            <li> It is very difficult to get all of the perfume out of the bottle once it gets really low.  Perhaps this is intentional.</li>
