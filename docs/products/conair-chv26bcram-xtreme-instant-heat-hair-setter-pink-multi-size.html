    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The heat setting is perfect for me.</li>
            <li>Heats up great.  </li>
            <li>Heating the clips is a good idea and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got a good amount of hair</li>
            <li>They were a Christmas gift - she&#x27;s used them several times and loves how nice her hair looks - great quality product!</li>
            <li>I love the convenience and the results I get from this heated curler.</li>
            <li>I suck at curling my hair with irons,I&#x27;m always burning my fingers,face or the top of my head.</li>
            <li>Works really well and great price.</li>
            <li>I and could use about twice as many.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t wrap more hair in them if you don&#x27;t have it.</li>
            <li>I am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>Cheap product</li>
            <li>like the fact that they get warm really fast.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Just wish it came with more of the large rollers.</li>
            <li>They were inexpensive and came quickly.</li>
            <li>recommend them for women with with medium or short hair, I&#x27;m sure the clips will hold better in shorter hair.</li>
            <li>Although I preferred my older model Conair heat hair setter, this one is okay.</li>
            <li>It heats quickly and works well.</li>
            <li>It heated quickly and the surface of the rollers did not tangle my hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Either way, a good starter product for anyone who has not already owned hot curlers as long as you DO NOT expect them to &amp;#34;instantly heat in 2 minutes&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I like this product a great deal, and it leaves my hair well styled until the next washing, a very big plus for me.</li>
            <li>probably great if you have a stylist working  on your hair, but (especially for left handed clients)</li>
            <li>The box is labelled, &amp;#34;warms in 75 seconds (fastest warm time)&amp;#34; so that is what the recipient expected.</li>
            <li>I had an earlier version of these that worked a lot better.</li>
            <li>With these I don&#x27;t burn myself anymore and they give me many different styling options as well.</li>
            <li>sometimes the hot rollers fall.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Rollers heat up really fast.</li>
            <li>The flocked roller is gentle on my hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the clips really hold the curls in place</li>
            <li>I really like the difference in the sizes of the rollers.  </li>
            <li>I alternate curler sizes for more natural look.  </li>
            <li>Rollers do not get as hot aas the old set.</li>
            <li>My only wish would be for more big rollers.</li>
            <li>Heats quickly and the curls seem to last longer.</li>
            <li>I deducted a star due to the clamps used to secure the roller.</li>
            <li>The old model allowed for heat adjustment, but this new model doesn&#x27;t offer that feature.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find replacement rollers for my old one or the clips for it, so I bought this model since it is closest to the model I had before.</li>
            <li>ABout 2 years old.  </li>
            <li>The clips are only stored on the right, and only 3 at a time can be heated.</li>
            <li>I t is large enough to do the job, but small enough to fit snugly  on my shelf.</li>
            <li>Careful as the rolls do get quite warm and can be hard on your fingertips.</li>
            <li>OK if you want to go this route, but at least provide a bag to store the excess in!</li>
            <li>I really like these hot rollers, but the reason why i wouldn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the clips don&#x27;t hold too hard and</li>
            <li>The curls come out the same as my when my aunt professionally did my hair,so they do seem to be quality despite being Conair.</li>
            <li>Does everything well as advertised, EXCEPT it does not warm as quickly as advertised.&lt;br</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Does everything well as advertised, EXCEPT it does not warm as quickly as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The label says &amp;#34;instantly heats in 2 minutes&amp;#34;. Obviously this is a contradiction in itself because two minutes is not &amp;#34;instant&amp;#34;, so you will already know not to expect this, but then I gave this as a gift... The box is labelled, &amp;#34;warms in 75 seconds (fastest warm time)&amp;#34; so that is what the recipient expected. NO GO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way, a good starter product for anyone who has not already owned hot curlers as long as you DO NOT expect them to &amp;#34;instantly heat in 2 minutes&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Rollers heat up really fast. Clips to hold the rollers work well.  My only wish would be for more big rollers.</li>
            <li> I would think twice about ordering this if you have thick hair. I have very thick hair and it just put weird waves in my hair. Also, there were not enough curlers for my hair.</li>
            <li> I deducted a star due to the clamps used to secure the roller. I am using clips I had from a previous hair setter. The clamp does not secure the rolled hair. I did order additional medium sized rollers from Conair. They were inexpensive and came quickly. The heat setting is perfect for me. I love the convenience and the results I get from this heated curler. The flocked roller is gentle on my hair. I used it everyday.</li>
            <li> I had an earlier version of these that worked a lot better. I don&#x27;t think the clips really hold the curls in place, I find they tend to fall out after a couple hours even with a substantial amount of hairspray.</li>
            <li> horrible, clamps leave ridges bought separate wire holders which don&#x27;t fit.  Extremely disappointed.  Ends are glued on to each curler and the ends come off.  Cheap product</li>
            <li> I like this product a great deal, and it leaves my hair well styled until the next washing, a very big plus for me. The lid is a bonus for staying connected and my only gripe is the way the clips are handled. You forgot your left-handed clients again! The clips are only stored on the right, and only 3 at a time can be heated. Heating the clips is a good idea and probably great if you have a stylist working  on your hair, but (especially for left handed clients) the clips are fiddly to handle during styling, and they also don&#x27;t style well. OK if you want to go this route, but at least provide a bag to store the excess in!</li>
            <li> I really like the difference in the sizes of the rollers.  Heats quickly and the curls seem to last longer.</li>

            <li> Works really well and great price. Just wish it came with more of the large rollers. I&#x27;ve got a good amount of hair I and could use about twice as many.</li>
            <li> These are just electric curlers.  They are no hotter than the ones I already had.  I am not sure why they think they are hotter, but they are not.  I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I really like these hot rollers, but the reason why i wouldn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the clips don&#x27;t hold too hard and sometimes the hot rollers fall.&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that they get warm really fast.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend them for women with with medium or short hair, I&#x27;m sure the clips will hold better in shorter hair.</li>
            <li> They were a Christmas gift - she&#x27;s used them several times and loves how nice her hair looks - great quality product!</li>
            <li> Although I preferred my older model Conair heat hair setter, this one is okay. I couldn&#x27;t find replacement rollers for my old one or the clips for it, so I bought this model since it is closest to the model I had before. The old model allowed for heat adjustment, but this new model doesn&#x27;t offer that feature.</li>
            <li> The clips can&#x27;t hold the curlers in place when the hair is too thin. You can&#x27;t wrap more hair in them if you don&#x27;t have it.</li>
            <li> The set works.  I just wished the clips were fuller so they can hold up my hair which can be quite heavy since I have a lot and my hair is long.  Careful as the rolls do get quite warm and can be hard on your fingertips.</li>
            <li> Thought they would be like the set I have.  ABout 2 years old.  Not at all.  Rollers do not fit well in designated areas of  hair setter.  Rollers do not get as hot aas the old set.</li>
            <li> I purchased the product based on brand name as I&#x27;ve owned other Conair products.  It heats quickly and works well.</li>
            <li> Heats up great.  Curls last.  I alternate curler sizes for more natural look.  It does not have an on and off switch so you have to plug and unplug each time.  I found this very inconvenient. I Like to keep the rollers by the couch.  I turned them on in the morning when I get up &amp; roll my hair while watching the news</li>
            <li> It heated quickly and the surface of the rollers did not tangle my hair. I t is large enough to do the job, but small enough to fit snugly  on my shelf. I am glad I bought it.</li>
