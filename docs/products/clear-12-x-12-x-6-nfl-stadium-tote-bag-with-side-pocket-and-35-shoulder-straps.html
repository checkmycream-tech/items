            <li>I&#x27;ll buy more</li>
            <li>I think this company should make these in many configurations.</li>
            <li>Its a pretty good bag..</li>
            <li>Very quick delivery.  </li>
            <li>Holds lots of gear and is easy to store under the stadium seat.</li>
            <li>Its strong and I call carry everything in the handbag.</li>
            <li>Size is accurate, the features and details in the description are as described.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a huge bag for me</li>
            <li>Roomy comfortable to carry.</li>
            <li>What a cheaply made product.</li>
            <li>It made passing through security quick and painless.</li>
            <li>I was hoping the handle length would be perfect (not too long; not too short).  </li>
            <li>Love my clear totes.</li>
            <li>Was perfect we used them to going to the game.</li>
            <li>Purchase this for the U.S. Open due to restrictions and this bag was perfect.</li>
            <li>Some USGA clear bags were too small to carry much in but this PGA and NFL approved bag was perfect.</li>
            <li>Exactly what it said it was.</li>
            <li>Ready for some baseball!</li>
            <li>There is nothing pretty or fancy about it</li>
            <li>I just love my tote, I can&#x27;t enough about them</li>
            <li>Is the exact bag required by the NFL for stadiums.</li>
            <li>So it meet ours needs exactly.</li>
            <li>Used it for the first time yesterday at Dolphin stadium.  </li>
            <li>Large enough to fit all beauty needs!</li>
            <li>Clear 12 x 12 x 6 NFL Stadium Tote Bag with the outside pocket is nicely made.  </li>
            <li>Cheaply made - OK for a single use only.</li>
            <li>The bag exceeds my expectations, it arrived quickly, is very sturdy and holds everything including a bag of cosmetic brushes, hair dryer, hair straighter, large can of hairspray and a variety of make up, lipstick, mascara, etc.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very convenient for me.</li>
            <li>very functional for work.</li>
            <li>Basically, it&#x27;s plenty big enough to bring all your stuff to the park without being overwhelming and it fits stadium requirements.</li>
            <li>Nice quality, bigger than I expected .  </li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t hold heavy items, but that is OK.</li>
            <li>This was great for an NFL game I attended recently.  </li>
            <li>We carry all of our 10 month old baby&#x27;s stuff in this bag (including her ear muffs, diapers, wipes, and formula.</li>
            <li>Next time around I will definitely pay a little more for a decent bag.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t even have it half way full.</li>
            <li>Looks exactly as pictured, but I thought the plastic was very stiff, and I felt like the opening was a little too narrow for being able to pull things in and out of it easily.  </li>
            <li>I was complimented on it by several ladies that had to get rid of their normal bags.  </li>
            <li>They are long enough to fit on your shoulder yet they are still short enough to carry by hand and not drag on the ground.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very sturdy, so I imagine it will last for many stadium visits to come (if I ever get to an actual game).</li>
            <li>and there are cracks in the clear plastic all over the entire bag.  </li>
            <li>Great bag for work.&lt;br /&gt;Zipper is a little difficult around the corners.</li>
            <li>My order of four clear stadium bags arrived when expected.  </li>

            <li> Great bag for work.&lt;br /&gt;Zipper is a little difficult around the corners.</li>
            <li> My order of four clear stadium bags arrived when expected.  </li>
            <li> I know they&#x27;re designed for carrying to a football game, but they have many other uses.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that this held a large round brush - which I can never fit into anything because of its clunky shape.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price, but the plastic is a bit thin.</li>
            <li> About six months ago, I purchased a similar bag (different vendor) prior to a college football game - found it to be very convenient for carrying items into such a venue.  </li>
            <li> Each strap is about 29&amp;#34; long (from sewn pt to sewn pt) and is 14&amp;#34; tall.  </li>
            <li> Needed these for a military stadium graduation where you could not bring in regular bags.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this bag 3 months and use it carefully</li>
            <li> bag was exactly what i was looking for to go to a game or anything in a stadium.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is the zipper is difficult to zip closed due to the way the top falls.</li>
            <li> I use this to store yarn.  </li>
            <li> I like the fact that I can see the contents, which elevates the need to &amp;#34;rummage through a lot of yarn to find what I need.</li>
            <li> but feel that I need to be careful not to rip it at the handle seams.</li>
            <li> Bag was as expected.</li>
            <li> so I can organize my accessories and other things</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this bag for a few weeks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit small for the job I want it to do.</li>
            <li> I needed a stadium tote bag in a hurry to use at the outdoor hockey game at Levi Stadium.  </li>
            <li> No hassles getting in to Raiders game.  </li>
            <li> Worked beautifully, no problems with security at the NFL game I attended.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s the squared off shape that makes it awkward.  </li>

            <li> I needed a stadium tote bag in a hurry to use at the outdoor hockey game at Levi Stadium.  Amazon came through in two days with an excellent product.</li>
            <li> Ready for some baseball! Durable and roomy.</li>
            <li> I ordered five to be used by myself and friends that were volunteering at the US Senior Open.  Some USGA clear bags were too small to carry much in but this PGA and NFL approved bag was perfect.</li>
            <li> Already has a tear in it. I&#x27;ve had this bag for a few weeks and I don&#x27;t even have it half way full. Not bad for the price, but the plastic is a bit thin.</li>
            <li> Great bag just what I wanted</li>
            <li> My order of four clear stadium bags arrived when expected.  Size is accurate, the features and details in the description are as described.  I was hoping the handle length would be perfect (not too long; not too short).  Each strap is about 29&amp;#34; long (from sewn pt to sewn pt) and is 14&amp;#34; tall.  They are long enough to fit on your shoulder yet they are still short enough to carry by hand and not drag on the ground.  Purchased them for family members who will be attending a graduation that will be held in a stadium (still a month away).  About six months ago, I purchased a similar bag (different vendor) prior to a college football game - found it to be very convenient for carrying items into such a venue.  I&#x27;m hoping my family members will find these bags to be as convenient as I do for stadium attendance.</li>
            <li> Wonderful, sturdy bag with a great side pocket.  Holds a lot.  Would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Makes a perfect larger lunchbag! Fits everything you could ever want for lunch with room to spare. Fast service, great deal! Couldn&#x27;t find in any stores.</li>
            <li> i just wish there were more pockets for organization</li>
            <li> Perfect for NFL events and concerts at the stadium!  Good quality for the price and fit everything we needed to bring into the stadium.</li>
            <li> Roomy, perfect size for the Oakes day in Louisville.</li>
            <li> Its a pretty good bag..&lt;br /&gt;i had to use it for work, so after about 3 months though it started to rip.</li>
            <li> Its strong and I call carry everything in the handbag.</li>
            <li> Needed these for a military stadium graduation where you could not bring in regular bags. This one was perfect. I had snacks, several bottles of water (regular sized sealed bottles), a scarf, sunscreen, wallet, etc. Basically, it&#x27;s plenty big enough to bring all your stuff to the park without being overwhelming and it fits stadium requirements. It made passing through security quick and painless. It&#x27;s also very sturdy, so I imagine it will last for many stadium visits to come (if I ever get to an actual game). Definitely glad I had it.</li>
            <li> LOve it. I would recommend this seller</li>
            <li> Love my clear totes. Quite durable.</li>
            <li> Looks exactly as pictured, but I thought the plastic was very stiff, and I felt like the opening was a little too narrow for being able to pull things in and out of it easily.  Maybe it&#x27;s the squared off shape that makes it awkward.  Anyway, decided to return it.</li>

            <li> Perfect for all sports events.</li>
            <li> Broke after two stadium trips.  Cheaply made - OK for a single use only.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit small for the job I want it to do. However it is very strong and well made. So it is very good value for money.  My fault for not taking notes on the measurements.</li>
            <li> This bag is exactly as described and works perfectly to fir the NFL tote requirements.  There is nothing pretty or fancy about it but it does the job.</li>
            <li> This bag wasn&#x27;t as durable as I thought it would be. I haven&#x27;t had any problems, yet. but feel that I need to be careful not to rip it at the handle seams.</li>
            <li> Bag was as expected. Roomy comfortable to carry.</li>
            <li> This was great for an NFL game I attended recently.  I was complimented on it by several ladies that had to get rid of their normal bags.  So glad I read the entrance guidelines before the game and that Amazon delivers in 1 day!</li>
            <li> Really nice! Like the outside pocket.</li>
            <li> very functional for work.</li>
            <li> Large enough to fit all beauty needs! I am the most unorganized person in the world. I ordered this bag, hoping it would be big enough to put make up, my hair dryer, hair straighter and hairspray in for traveling. The bag exceeds my expectations, it arrived quickly, is very sturdy and holds everything including a bag of cosmetic brushes, hair dryer, hair straighter, large can of hairspray and a variety of make up, lipstick, mascara, etc. A really great buy, I could see this being perfect for someone who does make up professionally or who travels often and does not want to deal with carrying separate bags for their hair brushes and make up. I was surprised that this held a large round brush - which I can never fit into anything because of its clunky shape. A great way to organize yourself.</li>
            <li> Great bag and good quality for use at NFL games.</li>
            <li> bag was exactly what i was looking for to go to a game or anything in a stadium.</li>
            <li> Purchase this for the U.S. Open due to restrictions and this bag was perfect. It&#x27;s durable and spacious. I will definitely reorder if I ever need another.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is the zipper is difficult to zip closed due to the way the top falls.</li>
            <li> Great size bag. Larger than I thought.</li>
            <li> had for 3 weeks and it is already tearing.</li>
            <li> When I received this bag it had cracks &amp; holes at all the creases where it was folded like plastic does when it just sits in a shed or garage for months. Ive had it just over a month &amp; the stitches where the handles are attached are already coming apart.  Next time around I will definitely pay a little more for a decent bag.</li>
            <li> Love it! Perfect for the stadium concert I saw!y daughter was able to put her belongings in it as well as our souvenir shirts!</li>
            <li> I just love my tote, I can&#x27;t enough about them</li>
            <li> Is the exact bag required by the NFL for stadiums. So it meet ours needs exactly.</li>
            <li> Great quality bag. We travel several times a year to watch the Broncos play and this bag has worked wonders for us! We carry all of our 10 month old baby&#x27;s stuff in this bag (including her ear muffs, diapers, wipes, and formula. And all my stuff too!).</li>
            <li> Nice quality, bigger than I expected .  If your looking for a good size lunch bag this is for you.</li>
            <li> Great price! Delivered on time and quality seems good up to this point.</li>
            <li> Great bag for football games and the side pocket is really handy.</li>
            <li> The corners,tend to crack and leave holes.  I h a &#x27;ve had to tape them so I could continue using it.</li>
            <li> My wife says the bag is perfect for her job!</li>
            <li> Very quick delivery.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Clear 12 x 12 x 6 NFL Stadium Tote Bag with the outside pocket is nicely made.  Won&#x27;t hold heavy items, but that is OK.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Used it for the first time yesterday at Dolphin stadium.  It was perfect, it fit everything I needed.  The zipper stops anything falling out and had no problems getting through security.</li>
            <li> Great NFL stadium approved bag! Holds lots of gear and is easy to store under the stadium seat.</li>
            <li> Great bag for work.&lt;br /&gt;Zipper is a little difficult around the corners.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a huge bag for me</li>
            <li> These are great! I know they&#x27;re designed for carrying to a football game, but they have many other uses. I&#x27;m using mine to keep cosmetics in because I can see what&#x27;s in there. I&#x27;ll buy more so I can organize my accessories and other things I forget I have if I can&#x27;t see them. It seems to be good sturdy plastic and it&#x27;s put together well. It took me a minute to find the opening of the outside pocket, and it would hold a basic magazine with no problems. I think this company should make these in many configurations.</li>
            <li> Worked beautifully, no problems with security at the NFL game I attended.</li>
            <li> Was perfect we used them to going to the game. No hassles getting in to Raiders game.  Was plenty room for our goodies.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this bag 3 months and use it carefully and there are cracks in the clear plastic all over the entire bag.  What a cheaply made product.</li>
            <li> I realy like this bag.</li>
            <li> Bought it for someone who thinks it is handy.</li>
