            <li>it and be good all day: ✓</li>
            <li>The price and free prime membership shipping were also great selling points!</li>
            <li>Makes my pits smell like Christmas in a good way.</li>
            <li>Stronger at first but mellows into an awesome smell after an hour or so.</li>
            <li>The variety of scents available increase your chances of finding one that is attractive to your mate (or prospective mate).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to not have to run to the store for it.</li>
            <li>The Denali scent is really nice.</li>
            <li>but it gives off a nice scent.  </li>
            <li>good stuff i rather buy in bulk and not have to run out to find it , its cheaer and more convienant</li>
            <li>I first took a chance on Denali at the store, I was impressed that the scent was kind of spicy, without being strong or lingering.</li>
            <li>He likes it the best of all the Old Spice scents.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hide the fact that it is for a man and is so incredibly sexy.</li>
            <li>My favorite of them is Denali.</li>
            <li>I love the scent on my husband a lot.</li>
            <li>My favorite deodorant and everyone always compliments the fragrance</li>
            <li>If you love their off-beat advertising campaign (and I do), then you would probably buy their products just as a thank you for all the laughs.  </li>
            <li>I am happy to say that I sniffed this out for my husband and we both agree it&#x27;s our new favorite smell.</li>
            <li>Excellent at keeping you dry during the day.</li>
            <li>Without sounding too blunt; this product keeps me dryer and more fresh than any antiperspirant/deodorant that I have ever used!  </li>
            <li>Like because it works and has a very mild scent.</li>
            <li>and I have to scrub lightly to get it off with a bar of soap.  </li>
            <li>just so I could smell the nice soft outdoor fragrance on me.</li>
            <li>I changed to this old spice Denali about a year ago and have been very happy AND dry with it.</li>
            <li>Denali is my favorite old spice scent.</li>
            <li>I wake up in the morning smelling fresh.</li>
            <li>A bit pricey, especially given the small size, but amazing smell, not overpowering but very refreshing and enjoyable.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t stick and absorbs right away while this stuff DOESN&#x27;T come off.</li>
            <li>This one keeps him nice and dry and smelling</li>
            <li>As many have said here this deodorant will last you over a day.</li>
            <li>And he loves this deodorant better than the blue deodorant by the same&lt;</li>
            <li>This is my son&#x27;s favorite anti-perspirant and deodorant solid.</li>
            <li>Works out really well.  </li>
            <li>I much prefer the blueish-gel.</li>
            <li>I have been paying high $ for the so called &amp;#34;prescription strength&amp;#34; antiperspirant/deodorants made my Secret, Dove, Degree, etc and still not been 100% happy with their effectiveness.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Since then, I&#x27;ve been doing Subscribe &amp; Save at Amazon, so I&#x27;ve always got a new stick ready to go.</li>
            <li>Gillette&#x27;s gels always left the armpits of my shirts glittery, Speed Stick left clumps and made me itchy, Degree was too overwhelming, and Axe was...</li>
            <li>One application will last for many hours or even days depending on external conditions and activity level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does leave a white residue in armpits that requires a good amount of soap lathering to adequately remove in the shower, but likely worth the extra bit of trouble.</li>
            <li>highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had a hard time settling in to an anti-perspirant I liked.</li>
            <li>i normally use the gel type but being here where im at in the heat</li>
            <li>It keeps me dry most of the time, but leaves a white film on my shirts even after running them through the washing machine.</li>
            <li>The scent is not too overpowering yet subtle enough to smell good.</li>
            <li>Although not actually invisible, the so-called invisible solid does absorb into skin quickly and will not leave a residue on clothing.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>We hope Old Spice never discontinues or changes Denali.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend uses Old Spice and I ran out of my antiperspirant/deodorant</li>
            <li>so I used one of his Old Spice Denali samples.  </li>
            <li>He likes it so much he bought the four pack, the 3 pack body wash in Denali and is now stocked up for a long time.</li>
            <li>Not much else to say, it is exactly what you expect</li>
            <li>Sadly, the best I can do is to take my shirt off very slowly.   </li>
            <li>I like the sent of Denali Old Spice since it doesn&#x27;t transfer the smell to my clothes unlike the other sents Old Spice markets.</li>
            <li>Old Spice has come a long way since my Grandpa started using it back in the day.  </li>

            <li> We prefer this scent over Fiji, Matterhorn or any of the other new ones which to us are weird, too tropical or too feminine.</li>
            <li> It is odd this deodorant is like a cologne at time.</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s not full proof when it comes to sweating, I still would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The fresh collection is BAD ASS!</li>
            <li> Seriously... Why do people like this?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sticky and just feels nasty.</li>

            <li> Deodorant &amp; antiperspirant that is a good value. Works well to stop sweat and my wife loves the scent.</li>
            <li> It keeps me dry most of the time, but leaves a white film on my shirts even after running them through the washing machine. A second wash usually gets it out, but not always.</li>
            <li> Like because it works and has a very mild scent.</li>
            <li> Denali is my favorite old spice scent. I was using the swagger scent before this deoderant came up. I wish I could hug myself just so I could smell the nice soft outdoor fragrance on me. Sadly, the best I can do is to take my shirt off very slowly.   It lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t smell like it was created in a laboratory or a pine tree air freshener factory.</li>
            <li> I am happy to say that I sniffed this out for my husband and we both agree it&#x27;s our new favorite smell. It doesn&#x27;t hide the fact that it is for a man and is so incredibly sexy. We prefer this scent over Fiji, Matterhorn or any of the other new ones which to us are weird, too tropical or too feminine. He loves the anti-perspirant. Other brands break him out, but this one doesn&#x27;t. This one keeps him nice and dry and smelling oh so good. He likes it so much he bought the four pack, the 3 pack body wash in Denali and is now stocked up for a long time. We hope Old Spice never discontinues or changes Denali.</li>
            <li> As many have said here this deodorant will last you over a day. I wake up in the morning smelling fresh. My favorite of them is Denali. It is odd this deodorant is like a cologne at time. Stronger at first but mellows into an awesome smell after an hour or so. I have received compliments on how my pits smell. If that isn&#x27;t a selling point idk what is lol.</li>
            <li> Found it a lot cheaper then at the store.  Works out really well.  Not much else to say, it is exactly what you expect</li>
            <li> I love the scent on my husband a lot. And he loves this deodorant better than the blue deodorant by the same&lt;br /&gt;brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a hard time settling in to an anti-perspirant I liked. Gillette&#x27;s gels always left the armpits of my shirts glittery, Speed Stick left clumps and made me itchy, Degree was too overwhelming, and Axe was... well... Axe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first took a chance on Denali at the store, I was impressed that the scent was kind of spicy, without being strong or lingering. This is totally something you can wear with cologne and not have to worry about clashing scents. At the same time, it&#x27;s killer at keeping you dry. And, no clumps or itchy skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then, I&#x27;ve been doing Subscribe &amp; Save at Amazon, so I&#x27;ve always got a new stick ready to go.</li>
            <li> Great Product, great price. Love that it&#x27;s in subscribe and save!!!  It&#x27;s nice to not have to run to the store for it.</li>
            <li> This is my son&#x27;s favorite anti-perspirant and deodorant solid. The Denali scent is really nice. He likes it the best of all the Old Spice scents. It was a great price, too!</li>
            <li> Complements from girls: ✓&lt;br /&gt;Complements from guys: ✓&lt;br /&gt;Bad ass, long lasting smell: ✓&lt;br /&gt;Apply it and be good all day: ✓&lt;br /&gt;Get this thing!! The fresh collection is BAD ASS!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend uses Old Spice and I ran out of my antiperspirant/deodorant so I used one of his Old Spice Denali samples.  It works!  I have been paying high $ for the so called &amp;#34;prescription strength&amp;#34; antiperspirant/deodorants made my Secret, Dove, Degree, etc and still not been 100% happy with their effectiveness.  Without sounding too blunt; this product keeps me dryer and more fresh than any antiperspirant/deodorant that I have ever used!  The price and free prime membership shipping were also great selling points!</li>
            <li> A bit pricey, especially given the small size, but amazing smell, not overpowering but very refreshing and enjoyable. The smell is not overtly noticeable unless you lift your arms. Excellent at keeping you dry during the day. Does leave a white residue in armpits that requires a good amount of soap lathering to adequately remove in the shower, but likely worth the extra bit of trouble.</li>
            <li> My favorite deodorant and everyone always compliments the fragrance</li>
            <li> Makes my pits smell like Christmas in a good way. I have been using this brand since it came out in 2001. I like the sent of Denali Old Spice since it doesn&#x27;t transfer the smell to my clothes unlike the other sents Old Spice markets.</li>
            <li> The white stuff stays on your armpits for hours and is pretty uncomfortable. It&#x27;s sticky and just feels nasty. Seriously... Why do people like this? I much prefer the blueish-gel. It doesn&#x27;t stick and absorbs right away while this stuff DOESN&#x27;T come off. It literally sticks to your arm pit hairs and makes them all glumpy. Never buying this again.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Denali&amp;#34; is great! The scent is not too overpowering yet subtle enough to smell good. I would definitely order it again for my boyfriend!</li>
            <li> Smells and works great</li>
            <li> I changed to this old spice Denali about a year ago and have been very happy AND dry with it.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great.  Works all day and all night.  When I go to take a shower I can feel that it&#x27;s still on there and I have to scrub lightly to get it off with a bar of soap.  I still perspire with this stuff but it gives off a nice scent.  Although it&#x27;s not full proof when it comes to sweating, I still would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Item received as described.</li>
            <li> good stuff i rather buy in bulk and not have to run out to find it , its cheaer and more convienant</li>
            <li> Old Spice has come a long way since my Grandpa started using it back in the day.  If you love their off-beat advertising campaign (and I do), then you would probably buy their products just as a thank you for all the laughs.  However, for the old-school, serious-minded grumps out there, let me offer some rational reasons to purchase this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. This will inhibit underarm perspiration, just as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;2. The variety of scents available increase your chances of finding one that is attractive to your mate (or prospective mate).  My mate prefers Denali.&lt;br /&gt;3. Although not actually invisible, the so-called invisible solid does absorb into skin quickly and will not leave a residue on clothing.&lt;br /&gt;4. One application will last for many hours or even days depending on external conditions and activity level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> i normally use the gel type but being here where im at in the heat its a no go this product is a great replacement</li>
