            <li>My wife loves the Tommy Bahama, she says it smells very clean and reminds her of a trip to the beach.</li>
            <li>But while at a Tommy Bahama store on a trip she sampled Very Cool and was hooked.</li>
            <li>and you have an idea of what Very Cool will create for you.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Tommy Bahama Very Cool for Women in a 1.7 oz.</li>
            <li>Very Cool</li>
            <li>If you like aquatic scents like Cool Water, Clean, or Aqua di Goia, you&#x27;ll love this!</li>
            <li>I think its a very unique and tropical without being too strong, sweet or.typical (smelling of coconuts or suntan lotion).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what to say because on her,I it smelled wonderful, but on me,I didn&#x27;t really care for it,which is strange.</li>
            <li>Love the cool fresh ocean smell.</li>
            <li>Fresh Clean Scent!</li>
            <li>Very Cool is fresh and hints at laundry detergents and soap.</li>

            <li>I bought it when it first came out and just finished with my bottle.</li>
            <li>Think clean, clear and light citrus-tropical..yet still warm and complex</li>
            <li>I have worn Very Cool for men for several years.</li>
            <li>My wife is VERY particular, and once she finds something that works, she stays with it.</li>

            <li> so I got on Amazon website and ordered a replacement for a lot less.</li>

            <li> Not that it smells bad, I just don&#x27;t like the scent on me too much.</li>
            <li> size bottle at retail stores in the past for almost triple the price of this 3.4 oz.</li>
            <li> So for a fragrance to become a NEW signature fragrance for her after 15 years with another product would seem impossible.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to explain the smell of this</li>
            <li> I would recomend it even as a blind buy to women of any age that like tropical and even aquatic scents.</li>
            <li> I am unable to contact the shipper to advise them of this since it is a \\&quot;flammable product\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Can never go wrong with Tommy fragrance!</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m so disappointed with this Amazon purchase.</li>

            <li> I love Tommy Bahama Very Cool for Women.  This was a great deal for the price.  The shipping was free and arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> My wife is VERY particular, and once she finds something that works, she stays with it. So for a fragrance to become a NEW signature fragrance for her after 15 years with another product would seem impossible. But while at a Tommy Bahama store on a trip she sampled Very Cool and was hooked. It is lightly tropical, VERY clean and sunny, but with nice after-tones...  its there, then gone, not hanging in the air too long but enough to make the presence of the wearer known. Think clean, clear and light citrus-tropical..yet still warm and complex and you have an idea of what Very Cool will create for you.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a perfume that smells fresh and clean. Very Cool is fresh and hints at laundry detergents and soap. Definitely satisfies my fresh and clean criteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not seem to last long and feels a little too strong when I spray it on, a little too much then I am definitely looking for a headache.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely parfume, long lasting and clean scent.  I love it. I have worn it over 5 yrs and don&#x27;t plan to change anytime soon...</li>
            <li> This Tommy Bahama Very Cool Smellsss Amazing, it smells sooo GOOD. It&#x27;s smells clean and fresh and a bit sweet, it lasts all day long And it almost smells like tommy hilfiger. So if you like high end perfumes, you will love this. I can&#x27;t wait to try all of the others from tommy bahama.</li>
            <li> My daughter was the first to wear it and I had to haveit.  Love it</li>
            <li> I have worn Very Cool for men for several years. This Christmas, I purchased it for my wife. WOW!!! It smells terrific. We both like this fragrance and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Tommy Bahama Very Cool for Women in a 1.7 oz. size bottle at retail stores in the past for almost triple the price of this 3.4 oz. bottle which is twice the size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also arrived with lightning speed!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EXCELLENT VALUE!!</li>
            <li> my wife loved it , would tell everyone about it and the price is great you  just cant beat it good perfume great price.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find Very Cool - I&#x27;ve been looking for it since Tommy Bahama stopped selling it.  Found it on Amazon and ordered right away.  The package was delivered before the estimated delivery date - ALWAYS A GOOD THING. And the perfume was just as awesome as I remembered it!!</li>
            <li> nothing great about this perfume. Smells ok. I will not buy it again. It&#x27;s hard to explain the smell of this but I guess it would be ocean smell???? Sounds strange but it&#x27;s all I can come up with.</li>
            <li> This is the way summer is supposed to smell -- like a beach.  This is NOT a fruity, candy, baby powder perfume.  This is a lovely light summer scent for all of us who do not want to smell like a thirteen year old.</li>
            <li> Smells clean. Great fragrance for summer</li>
            <li> I get compliments EVERYTIME I wear this perfume. Everyone says how fresh and clean I smell. There isn&#x27;t a day that goes by that I don&#x27;t get a compliment on it.&lt;br /&gt;The perfume is a very clean smelling perfume-no fruit or spice smells. It&#x27;s an amazing deal. This is the only website I can find this perfume so I stock up!</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance. It&#x27;s perfect for daytime. So happy with the purchase and speed of delivery</li>
            <li> received this for a gift and liked it so I got on Amazon website and ordered a replacement for a lot less.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume!  I always hear comments of how good it smells!  Fresh Clean Scent!</li>
            <li> Tried this at Perfumania and had to have it. I don&#x27;t know how TB did it but they bottled the smell of Summer. This tropical beauty smells like a vacation...a day at the beach...Sea &amp; surf. Perfect summer scent.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m truly impressed by the sand and salty ocean notes with just.the right amount of tropical fruitiness. I think its a very unique and tropical without being too strong, sweet or.typical (smelling of coconuts or suntan lotion). I also find it has good staying power. I would recomend it even as a blind buy to women of any age that like tropical and even aquatic scents.</li>
            <li> My wife loves the Tommy Bahama, she says it smells very clean and reminds her of a trip to the beach.</li>
            <li> One if my customers was wearing this and after looking all over at my local department stores, I had no luck until I came across it on here. I don&#x27;t know what to say because on her,I it smelled wonderful, but on me,I didn&#x27;t really care for it,which is strange. Maybe it&amp;#34;s  my body chemistry, not so sure. Not that it smells bad, I just don&#x27;t like the scent on me too much.</li>
            <li> I remember this perfume smelling better. I bought it when it first came out and just finished with my bottle. Love the cool fresh ocean smell. I can&#x27;t believe how long it took for me to receive the perfume from Sam&#x27;s online after I paid for it! It took almost 10 days! That is just unheard of from any order I paid for.</li>
            <li> Can never go wrong with Tommy fragrance!</li>
            <li> Soooooo lovely! Fresh!</li>
            <li> this is some awesome perfume, I think this is the 5th bottle I have bought, I will continue to buy</li>
            <li> I need to order more Tommy Bahama perfumes for myself. I had commited to give this as a gift and envied it! Light, fresh smelling; it really reminds me of the islands. I will buy more of this.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume, but this smelled like RAID, I&#x27;m so sorry this stunk, I&#x27;m so disappointed with this Amazon purchase.</li>
            <li> I was so delighted to get my favorite perfume by Tommy Bahama&amp;#34; Very Cool &amp;#34; ...it was such a great deal ! I bought all 3 bottles ...&lt;br /&gt;Kat Hammer&lt;br /&gt;Nashville , TN</li>
            <li> Best perfume! If you like aquatic scents like Cool Water, Clean, or Aqua di Goia, you&#x27;ll love this! I love it for summer.</li>
            <li> Smells divine! Always get lots of compliments on this one</li>
            <li> Disappointed when I came home to open my new perfume to find it was sent to me half empty and spilled.  The box did not have any spills only the perfume box; therefore it was sent to me packed and shipped already this way.  I am unable to contact the shipper to advise them of this since it is a \\&quot;flammable product\\&quot;.  Extremely disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;Jennifer</li>
            <li> I love this scent- I always get compliments when I am wearing this - it is not overpowering like some colognes - this has a clean and fresh scent</li>
            <li> Love this product - cost very competitive!</li>
