            <li>I love mixing this Tangerine with Spruce in my diffuser.</li>

            <li>I love these oils.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this oil.</li>
            <li>I used it to make my own shampoo - I filled a bottle with 2/3 water, 1/3 Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Castile Soap, and about 10 drops of this oil, and I now have tangerine shampoo.</li>
            <li>Will be buying more of this when I run out.</li>

            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>No stinging on skin contact for me, which is great as I have very sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>Light  on the smell, Taste was also very light.</li>
            <li>Enjoyed the sweet scent of Tangerine</li>
            <li>If you do a quick search, you will see the many uses of this oil.  </li>
            <li>I use it so much I&#x27;m going to have to get some more!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try to update if I have any issues when I test out the bath bombs but its good so far!</li>
            <li>Fantastic scent</li>
            <li>Dr. Bronner&#x27;s liquid castile soap &amp; h2o to try as hand wash and it blends evenly and smoothly.</li>
            <li>Smells just like a fresh peeled tangerine!  </li>
            <li>Makes a great room freshener and works great in an oil diffuser, or for any other personal care product like soap or deodorant.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m enjoying the lovely scent three times daily.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li>This one is vibrant and rich!  </li>
            <li>I am a sucker for citrus-y scents, but this is honestly the best I have come across so far and will definitely be purchasing more to use in DIY recipes and diffuse.</li>
            <li>I also made floor cleaner with it: a bucket full of warm water, a squirt of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s, about 1/2 cup of distilled white vinegar, and 10 or so drops of this.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m satisfied but will use for a month and write another review.</li>
            <li>, it smells like a fresh tangerine.  </li>
            <li>Have used this in several projects with satisfying results - clean citrus fragrance.  </li>
            <li>i love the smell of tangerine smell it makes the whole house smell good just a small drop in each room</li>
            <li>It smells just right.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;dropper\\&quot; insert seems to just spout it right out.</li>
            <li>Not much to say, except that I love it!</li>
            <li>I will purchase more items like this in the future</li>
            <li>I am currently shopping around for a good ultrasonic aromatherapy diffuser, but I have put this it in the teensy adjunct for essential oils (just a tiny bean shaped and sized pad to drop the oil into) on my small cool mist humidifier and it distributed the smell beautifully.</li>
            <li>I have also used it in my a/c vents to add smell to the house when the air is on, and it doesn&#x27;t really work for that either.  </li>
            <li>Therefore, I&#x27;m going through it faster than I really want to.</li>
            <li>It smells like tangerines and doesn&#x27;t have a chemical smell, but I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;d really recommend this.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the smell and have already used it in other home cleaners.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using essential oils and one of the first I&#x27;ve ever bought.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this yummy smelling oil.  </li>
            <li>High quality oil.  </li>
            <li>Add a few drops to some baking soda and put the concoction in a cute container.</li>
            <li>The size and amount is not too much and not too little but just the right amount for the right price.</li>
            <li>Not as long  lasting as other oils I&#x27;ve purchased, but it smelled nice and was reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a wonderful smell, unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t seem to last long.  </li>
            <li>It is 100% pure therapeutic grade essential oil, not diluted.  </li>
            <li>Bought this to put in my homemade laundry soap to give it a bit of a natural smell without causing any skins irritations.</li>
            <li>Expensive, but is aromatic, and appears to be of good quality.  </li>
            <li>It is clean and vibrant, and a little goes a long way here!</li>

            <li> Only complaint might be that it comes out way too fast if you&#x27;re not very careful.</li>
            <li> Long lasting smell</li>
            <li> I put a little on a few cottonballs in a small dish, set it in a room and the entire room smells wonderfully fresh.</li>
            <li> I had tried this with a few other different essential oils and got nothing compared to this!</li>
            <li> As expected....</li>
            <li> The product is not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Not very strong, not very vibrant either.</li>
            <li> My migraines have been decreased and the one time I couldn&#x27;t escape one, I took my excredin along with smelling the oil and it seemed to calm the migraine down faster than usual.</li>
            <li> I will also be looking at this brand&#x27;s other scents of oils to use and would recommend to anyone who loves uplifting citrus scents!</li>
            <li> Besides putting in a diffuser, I also put a few drops in my water.</li>
            <li> I put it in my pillowcase on a cotton round along with lavender and oregano at night because Tangerine helps with restlessness.</li>
            <li> We add a few drops of this and shake.  </li>
            <li> I usually have eye floaters because of my headaches; they have been minimnal to non-existient.</li>
            <li> On the skin, it lasts about 10 min.&lt;br /&gt;In oil the result is not much better.</li>
            <li> A lot of essential oils are very expensive, but this one is not</li>
            <li> Too weak IMO.</li>
            <li> But it wasn&#x27;t expensive, so no worries.</li>
            <li> The base smells like a&lt;br /&gt;petroleum by product.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I read that Tangerine Oil can help heal stress related headaches and migraines by simply smelling the oil 3x a day. I invested in this product and I have already seen a difference. I usually have eye floaters because of my headaches; they have been minimnal to non-existient. My migraines have been decreased and the one time I couldn&#x27;t escape one, I took my excredin along with smelling the oil and it seemed to calm the migraine down faster than usual. I have already recommended this to several people who have migraines and I spoke about this on my Facebook page to get the word out. Great Job!</li>
            <li> I ordered this essential oil to help with headaches. It doesn&#x27;t hurt that I simply adore tangerines and tangerine juice. The essential oil arrived just as promised and I&#x27;m enjoying the lovely scent three times daily. Be gone headaches!</li>
            <li> Really great summer citrus fragrance that is true to it&#x27;s description.  It mixes well with unscented creams and lotions etc</li>

            <li> This oil smells wonderful and can be mixed well with others. You can use it for a variety of household and beauty needs. Good quality</li>
            <li> The aroma is lovely! It lifts your mood and puts you in a happy place! Besides putting in a diffuser, I also put a few drops in my water.</li>
            <li> Smells just like a fresh peeled tangerine!  Have used this in several projects with satisfying results - clean citrus fragrance.  Arrived quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful smell, unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t seem to last long.  I bought it to put in my laundry detergent and/or laundry sheets to add a nice smell to my otherwise scentless detergent, but it doesn&#x27;t work well for that.  I have also used it in my a/c vents to add smell to the house when the air is on, and it doesn&#x27;t really work for that either.  Perhaps this oil is not well suited for aromatherapy.</li>
            <li> As expected....good quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with this tangerine oil. It smells just right. I put it in my pillowcase on a cotton round along with lavender and oregano at night because Tangerine helps with restlessness. It does work! Only complaint might be that it comes out way too fast if you&#x27;re not very careful. The \\&quot;dropper\\&quot; insert seems to just spout it right out. Usually I only want one or two drops and often get 5 or 6. Therefore, I&#x27;m going through it faster than I really want to. But it wasn&#x27;t expensive, so no worries.</li>
            <li> We make our own laundry detergent.  We add a few drops of this and shake.  It has just enough smell on the clothes to be noticed.  I have also used it to make air freshener.  Add a few drops to some baking soda and put the concoction in a cute container.</li>
            <li> This is our favorite oil for diffusing.  My kids and I all love it.  However it did leak during transport.</li>
            <li> High quality oil.  Great smell.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Smells great in my homemade moisturizer!</li>
            <li> smells so good and great in water!</li>
            <li> smell is great, a good price I do massage and aroma therapy its got a nice tangy smell and will order more as needed.</li>
            <li> I love these oils.  I also follow them on FB and they have great ideas, information etc.  This one smells wonderful.  I will be using it in my homemade lotions.</li>
            <li> Very strong Aroma used for my kitchen. Long lasting smell</li>
            <li> I LOVE this oil. I used it to make my own shampoo - I filled a bottle with 2/3 water, 1/3 Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Castile Soap, and about 10 drops of this oil, and I now have tangerine shampoo. I also made floor cleaner with it: a bucket full of warm water, a squirt of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s, about 1/2 cup of distilled white vinegar, and 10 or so drops of this. I mopped up doggie pee and the smell was gone! it worked better than the enzyme liquid you can buy! Will be buying more of this when I run out.</li>
            <li> Not as long  lasting as other oils I&#x27;ve purchased, but it smelled nice and was reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> The product is not what I expected. The base smells like a&lt;br /&gt;petroleum by product. On the skin, it lasts about 10 min.&lt;br /&gt;In oil the result is not much better. I will not reorder.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome scent, I love it, and it&#x27;s really well priced!  A lot of essential oils are very expensive, but this one is not and it&#x27;s one of my favorites!  I use it so much I&#x27;m going to have to get some more!</li>
            <li> I origionaly purchased this to but in water to disperse the smell. works great but i alternate this eo with others depending on what is needed in my apartment, i have even blended them</li>
            <li> It smells good. I mix it with coconut oil and vitamin E at night to rub on my arms and legs. This helps to relax me and my skin looks healthier.</li>
            <li> smells great, just what i was looking for for my homemade toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Smells very nice, I&#x27;m making bath bombs with this and they kind of smell like emergenC&#x27;s nice and refreshing. I&#x27;ll try to update if I have any issues when I test out the bath bombs but its good so far!</li>
            <li> Not very strong, not very vibrant either. It smells like tangerines and doesn&#x27;t have a chemical smell, but I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;d really recommend this. Too weak IMO.</li>
            <li> Bought this to put in my homemade laundry soap to give it a bit of a natural smell without causing any skins irritations. I absolutely love the smell and have already used it in other home cleaners.</li>
            <li> I have tried MANY tangerines.  This one is vibrant and rich!  Way to go Plant Therapy!</li>
            <li> Fantastic scent, it smells like a fresh tangerine.  It is 100% pure therapeutic grade essential oil, not diluted.  Great price.  If you do a quick search, you will see the many uses of this oil.  It is an antiseptic, so it will kill bacteria and stop it from spreading.  It can release stress and anxiety, I add 2-3 drops to a bath or I use it in a burner to relax.  It can also improve circulation.</li>
            <li> This Plant Therapy brand of tangerine essential oil gives off the most incredible happy, energizing, refreshing scent! It is clean and vibrant, and a little goes a long way here! I absolutely love it. I am currently shopping around for a good ultrasonic aromatherapy diffuser, but I have put this it in the teensy adjunct for essential oils (just a tiny bean shaped and sized pad to drop the oil into) on my small cool mist humidifier and it distributed the smell beautifully. I had tried this with a few other different essential oils and got nothing compared to this! Anyway, I have also mixed it with (unscented) Dr. Bronner&#x27;s liquid castile soap &amp; h2o to try as hand wash and it blends evenly and smoothly. No stinging on skin contact for me, which is great as I have very sensitive skin! I am a sucker for citrus-y scents, but this is honestly the best I have come across so far and will definitely be purchasing more to use in DIY recipes and diffuse. I will also be looking at this brand&#x27;s other scents of oils to use and would recommend to anyone who loves uplifting citrus scents!</li>
