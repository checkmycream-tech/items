            <li>Fast and as described, thank you!</li>
            <li>But this new brand I&#x27;ve tried (Brand \\&quot;F\\&quot;) is a worthy substitute.  </li>
            <li>When he first used it I thought WOW!!</li>

            <li>Easy to cover up grey.</li>

            <li> Even after it&#x27;s dry, it&#x27;s still possible to stain your hands.</li>
            <li> It does the trick quickly, and with least amount of mess.</li>
            <li> wish this product would dry after applying.</li>
            <li> and so I figured it should at least be halfway decent.  </li>
            <li> some cans run wet...</li>
            <li> I used this to cover my partial thinning hair.  </li>
            <li> I like it , but the only issue i have is that  since the spray is black it covers my bathroom with black powder, when I touch my hair</li>
            <li> I have used other product but</li>
            <li> I am repeat customer and just rememeber to choose the right color and dont go crazy on it.</li>
            <li> I changed my hair color to black and its easier to see bald spots.</li>
            <li> I get black powder on my hand.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> You will wake up with black ink EVERYWHERE.  </li>
            <li> This product leaves a leaky black mess everywhere</li>
            <li> He put it in the morning and after he took a nap in the afternoon there was black color all over my sheets which I had to throw because Clorox could not clean them.</li>
            <li> Although it does cover our bald spots it also makes your head look like an uneven mess with darker areas than others.</li>
            <li> Just a little bit at the crown).    </li>
            <li> some don&#x27;t work at all...must use everyday as it will lay on the scalp if you sweat..</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let anyone accidentally touch your head, or they&#x27;re in for a messy surprise.  </li>
            <li> This was not easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not easy to wash out.</li>
            <li> When I first tried this product I gave it a bad review because I was not applying the prodicy correctly.</li>
            <li> Also, the bathroom had black spots too, everything that he came in contact with was black!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very dark, it sprays out thick and it gets all over your hands if you touch it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several different brands to cover my roots between colorings and this is the WORST one i&#x27;ve ever had the DISplease of using.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a long time it made my scalp itch like crazy, then started making my hair fall out .I&#x27;m not happy at all with the product Not happy</li>
            <li> It STINKS, its VERY MESSY, i had to mop my bathroom floor THREE TIMES to get it off the tiles.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like spraying thick crude oil over your head.</li>
            <li> Sorry Jerome.</li>
            <li> The product itself on the hair is not that bad</li>
            <li> Bad product has a nasty smell..</li>
            <li> I used this thing Once and was shocked at how awful it was.</li>
            <li> It covers a bit and it does hide the balding area by making the hair around thicker, but I hated the smell...</li>
            <li> It is terrible.</li>
            <li> This stuff is TERRIBLE.  </li>

            <li> This product leaves a leaky black mess everywhere you lay your head. Although it does cover our bald spots it also makes your head look like an uneven mess with darker areas than others.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband because he wanted it. It is terrible. He put it in the morning and after he took a nap in the afternoon there was black color all over my sheets which I had to throw because Clorox could not clean them. Also, the bathroom had black spots too, everything that he came in contact with was black!!! The product itself on the hair is not that bad but again when you put it on in order look natural you have to put it  all over your hair, but it gets on your face or years etc and you cannot clean it anymore (after 30 seconds from application). We use it once and throw it in the garbage with the sheets. I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It was fun. I changed my hair color to black and its easier to see bald spots. I bought it to try it. Its great it matches couldnt tell . Thanks !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a long time it made my scalp itch like crazy, then started making my hair fall out .I&#x27;m not happy at all with the product Not happy</li>
            <li> I have had other products from other companies-but they cost more and are out of stock at times---that is it</li>
            <li> When I first tried this product I gave it a bad review because I was not applying the prodicy correctly. Now, Im a big fan of this product as I use it quite almost ever day. It doesnt seem to run when im sweating and if I style my hair just right and apply the product and then put hairspray in it it doesnt rubb off and friends tell me that my hair has thicken up lol. I even got my brother hooked up in this product. I am repeat customer and just rememeber to choose the right color and dont go crazy on it.</li>
            <li> I actually really liked this item it gives your hair a little static but, it actually makes your hair look thicker and covers bald spots pretty good.</li>
            <li> some cans run wet...some don&#x27;t work at all...must use everyday as it will lay on the scalp if you sweat..&amp;#34;good looking hair&amp;#34; is better</li>
            <li> My boyfriend has always been self conscious about his crop circle on the back of his head, so I found this spray and ordered it for him. When he first used it I thought WOW!! his problem is solved in seconds and for under $10.00 too. It was amazing, you couldn&#x27;t even tell. The only problem is that periodically through the evening while we were out, he would forget he had this on his head and would touch his hair. The stuff came off on his hands. However, we danced a lot that evening and it did not drip from sweat thank goodness. It came off on the pillow as well. All in all it still does the job, and looks great.</li>
            <li> I used this to cover my partial thinning hair.  I have used other product but Jerome Russell hair color thickener spray more that met my expectation.  In fact, I have been using it for about 10 years now ... and will continue to do so if necessary for obvious reasons.  If you have a better product, I would like to try it too.</li>
            <li> I bought Dark Brown color cause my hair is dark brown, but when I sprayed it on my scalp, it was more reddish than I expected, more like Dark Auburn than dark Brown.  It covers a bit and it does hide the balding area by making the hair around thicker, but I hated the smell... It smells like cheap lotion, those with very strong scent!!  Therefore, I will return this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is TERRIBLE.  I&#x27;ve used several different brands to cover my roots between colorings and this is the WORST one i&#x27;ve ever had the DISplease of using.  It STINKS, its VERY MESSY, i had to mop my bathroom floor THREE TIMES to get it off the tiles.  Also, it comes out ALL THE TIME, ALL over your pillow, all over your forehead.  This stuff is GROSS.  i didn&#x27;t want to even give it one star, but that&#x27;s the lowest it goes.  I will say it was delivered on time, that was the only &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; thing. Please just go buy the stuff at the drug store, its MUCH better, i think its called &amp;#34;gray away&amp;#34; or something like that.</li>
            <li> Really good product for the temporary coloring of your hair. Easy to cover up grey. Would buy this item again.</li>
            <li> I like it , but the only issue i have is that  since the spray is black it covers my bathroom with black powder, when I touch my hair I get black powder on my hand.&lt;br /&gt;I wish this product would dry after applying.</li>
            <li> This was not easy to use. It&#x27;s very dark, it sprays out thick and it gets all over your hands if you touch it. Even after it&#x27;s dry, it&#x27;s still possible to stain your hands. It&#x27;s not easy to wash out. Do not sleep with it in. It will stain anything your hair touches. Think of it as hair spray paint that dries kind of chalky. It&#x27;s similar to charcoal in the way it feels. I don&#x27;t recommend for daily use only because you must wash it out daily. For women, this dries out our hair. Do not try to work out or sweat and wipe your hair with a white towel. You will regret it (&amp;#62;..&amp;#62;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Top Coverage for years, but apparently it&#x27;s no longer available. I thought they must all be pretty much the same, and this thing looked very professionally packaged and so I figured it should at least be halfway decent.  Not at all. I used this thing Once and was shocked at how awful it was. I have to imagine that most of the Good reviews are from people who&#x27;ve never used anything better.  First of all, The Smell ! It was like some kind of super-strong, chemical oil spill. Mixed with Turpentine, and the stuff they use for Fracking. The smell was Soo powerful and pervasive.  It&#x27;s not necessarily an offensive smell, it&#x27;s just a smell that would make you look at someone and think, where the heck did they just come from?!    I sprayed it on my head in the morning, and I had keep the window down as I drove to work, while trying to bend the top of my head, to catch as much wind as possible. To hopefully get it to dissipate.  And I probably could have tolerated the overwhelming chemical smell if it worked great. But, no! Sure it&#x27;ll cover the hair, but lord help you if you don&#x27;t wash it out before going to bed. You will wake up with black ink EVERYWHERE.  (and I didn&#x27;t even use that much. Just a little bit at the crown).    It&#x27;s like spraying thick crude oil over your head. Don&#x27;t let anyone accidentally touch your head, or they&#x27;re in for a messy surprise.  I also made the mistake of buying 4 cans, and after that first try, I was planning to return the other 3. But that&#x27;s not allowed. Apparently Amazon considers it hazardous (for being combustible, in a can, etc.). so they won&#x27;t accept returns.  Happy ending: I decided to give another brand a try. (don&#x27;t want to say the name, but it starts with an \\&quot;F\\&quot;) And it works Beautifully and effectively.  about as good as Top Coverage used to.  Ironically that old Top Coverage had the cheapest looking can and graphics -- but the quality of it was Amazing.  But this new brand I&#x27;ve tried (Brand \\&quot;F\\&quot;) is a worthy substitute.  Sorry Jerome. I&#x27;m getting ready to Toss those 3 cans that I can&#x27;t return.</li>
            <li> The product sprays all over the room and forget about being discreet of what is trying to conceal. At the first sign of sweat the product starts smearing and running through the forehead. Good try but not thanks.</li>
            <li> I love the stuff I have a bald spot in back of my head a spread on people think it my a hair looks so natural .Great product i recommend it to anybody</li>
            <li> Please you can spray everything. But your hair your clothes will stain from this junk</li>
            <li> I have been using this for many year now. This is the best product available in the market for hear thickeners. It does the trick quickly, and with least amount of mess. It is much better than the higher lines that are much more expensive. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Biggest problem is that the spray can eventually becomes defective and clogged but cool for hiding a little gray as well</li>
            <li> My brother loves this concealer</li>
            <li> I really like this product and would recommend it to others that have the same problem I have. It really looks natural.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a great  product, it washes out easily,i bought it in past but will buy more in the future. i just love it.</li>
            <li> Fast and as described, thank you!</li>
            <li> Husband really like this product</li>
            <li> excellent product and fast shipping</li>
            <li> Bad product has a nasty smell.. I sprayed it on my husbands hair its runny and you touch your hair to fix it or brush it and it stains your hand and the brush..</li>
