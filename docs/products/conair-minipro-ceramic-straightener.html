            <li>Great Conair CS80R MiniPro Ceramic Straightener, 0.5 Inch,</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>works as described -- very handy to use and travel with</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure it will do perfectly.</li>
            <li>Please keep in mind that&#x27;s not because it didn&#x27;t do a good job</li>
            <li>They loved it, but it went t.u.</li>
            <li>Good choice.</li>
            <li>Mother loved this product.</li>
            <li>It was good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good emergency-only-or-just-for-a-few-strands-of-hair or -better-than-nothing iron.  </li>
            <li>The travel straightener is an adorable size and comes with a beautiful carrying case.</li>
            <li>The size would be perfect to carry in a purse for a quick touch up, or for your suitcase.  </li>
            <li>and I am very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>but I love it!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this thing!</li>
            <li>Love that it fits in my purse!  </li>
            <li>and it just about got warm.  </li>
            <li>The size makes this perfect for short hair, and for the price, is a great deal.</li>
            <li>I keep it at work so the heat resistant pouch comes in handy.</li>
            <li>Nice case for travel is included.</li>
            <li>It did not come with its own pouch, even though when I bought it, the description mentioned a pouch.  </li>
            <li>I have medium-long hair that is fairly fine, but there&#x27;s a lot of it!  </li>
            <li>perfect for traveling or if u know u ll need to retouch ur roots or bangs.&lt;br /&gt;Works really great for a small straightener&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
            <li>As for the iron itself, it worked great, made my hair completely straight</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Heats up fast and works great</li>
            <li>I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Great price, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I recommend it! :)</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just adorable.</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>I am going to buy one or two more and keep them at home, office, and everywhere.</li>
            <li>I would love this size and weight at home, too.  </li>
            <li>I love the portability and its travel size</li>
            <li>so I was using the end of it more</li>
            <li>I also travel a lot, so I really enjoyed the pouch it came</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it</li>
            <li>My wife enjoyed this gift because of its quality construction and compact design.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE  this product.  </li>
            <li>I enjoyed this product for a month.</li>
            <li>I think I may have to bite the bullet and save some money for a better quality device.</li>
            <li>and I think that this would work better for thicker hair.</li>
            <li>more than once.</li>
            <li>Works perfect for my those that have short hair.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for short hair.</li>
            <li>Returned for a better iron.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect flat iron for bangs and touch ups.</li>
            <li>It heats up pretty fast but it does not have temperature control, and it is truly mini, which is wonderful for traveling or carrying in a bag.  </li>
            <li>It gets hot quickly and works great.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t the best tool to use as a primary flat iron.</li>
            <li>What I love about the case, besides it being super cute, is the fact that its thermal protected.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>If your hair is easy to straighten/curl, then go for it, it may work for you.</li>
            <li>This heats up very quickly and does the job.  </li>
            <li>and I love the case it comes with, great for short trips.</li>
            <li>I got to my roots easily.</li>
            <li>Its okay not as good as my old Conair one/</li>
            <li>I love this mini straightener, it&#x27;s perfect for traveling because it takes up so much less space!</li>
            <li>One is that I would have preferred some kind of a control over how hot I want it to get.</li>
            <li>Product was brand new and in good shape.</li>
            <li>I received my conair ceramic around october september 30th and was working just fine until today when it just died on me...</li>
            <li>The plates are smooth and it slides through hair easily, but didn&#x27;t seem too slippery.   </li>
            <li>Or, if a person&#x27;s hair is extremely fine, she might also find that her hair slips out.   </li>
            <li>Works fine though.</li>
            <li>My hair is about medium length, but I thought I would still be able to straighten it rather quickly.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s teeny, super portable, comes with a travel pouch, and has a two year warranty!</li>
            <li>But with a little practice, it&#x27;s really easy to figure out what works best.     </li>
            <li>This is a perfect little straightener.  </li>
            <li>If you see the &#x27;on&#x27; light blink when you flex the cord, it should be replaced.</li>
            <li>Compact and can fit in my diaper bag or purse for traveling.  </li>
            <li>Works great on my bangs and short hair</li>
            <li>Overall, great item.</li>
            <li>This is great for short hair.</li>
            <li>Leaves the hair silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>I took it to Vegas a few times and it worked perfect!</li>
            <li>This straightener is a great size for those of us with short hair.</li>
            <li>Overall, I greatly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>This straightener is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>The first one died after 3 years but this one is still going strong after almost 2!</li>
            <li>This mini flat iron is great, no problems and it straighten like a dream.</li>
            <li>The iron is really small and cute, perfect for travel, fit right into my cosmetics bag.  </li>
            <li>As a quick back-up for the office, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>Magic, I purchased the conair mini and my bangs and layered hair are sleek, shiney, straight, but mostly ironed just right without burning my processed hair.  </li>
            <li>It gets hot fast and it is the perfect tool for my short wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>Great for getting at small areas like bangs and okay for travel</li>
            <li>It worked really well for all the styles I love.</li>
            <li>I also have pretty fine hair</li>
            <li>It heats up quick and straighten&#x27;s my bangs in a snap.  </li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s so small, I was also able to use it successfully to curl the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li>Heats up quick.</li>
            <li>all I had was a devil lock in the front which this worked perfect for, only problem is that it didn&#x27;t seem to clamp all the way shut towards the middle of it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never burned her or myself before, and it&#x27;s quick and easy!&lt;br /</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t get very hot</li>
            <li>Heats fast easy to use and does not pull hair when in use.</li>
            <li>But it works just as well as my regular sized one for straightening, and it works better for curling!</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>Gets extremely hot!</li>
            <li>Just the right size, compact, coools quickly, and fits anywhere.</li>
            <li>good but leaves you hair very dry.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s great in a pinch when you just want to get at the few fly-away strands of hair.</li>
            <li>This iron also comes with a really cute thermal pouch that can fit into any purse, makeup bag or overnight bag, which is a definite plus.</li>
            <li>I loved it soooo much that I ordered another one as back up.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll be worth it.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s nice not to have to use a larger straightner.  </li>
            <li>and I like it better than my old one.</li>
            <li>Handled heated for about 30 seconds &amp; knew it wasn&#x27;t worth the price.</li>
            <li>I have so many curling irons and flat irons, but this one is perfect for really flatting your roots and can give a little curl.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s had a pretty easy life just lying in my desk drawer, being used maybe 2-3 times a month, so it really shouldn&#x27;t be dying yet.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who wants a quick easy fix for straight hair.</li>
            <li>The flat iron and cord slide nicely into the heat proof pouch in case you need to put it away in a hurry.   </li>
            <li>Came right away.</li>
            <li>Right heat.</li>
            <li>The heat is just right.</li>
            <li>But, all you have to do to prevent this from happening is to just try to get it right</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I have a case from an older model, so all is well.</li>
            <li>Heats up fairly quickly and is very compact.</li>
            <li>Very fast mail.  </li>
            <li>I waited up to 2 minutes for it to get hot</li>
            <li>but the handle gets pretty hot after using for a while</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get as hot as it says</li>
            <li>This mini was exactly what I needed/looking for.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted--</li>
            <li>I love this tiny curling iron!  </li>
            <li>I took this iron to Orlando, where it was pretty humid</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.    </li>
            <li>My last one lasted me about a year or more before it gave out</li>
            <li>Heats up fast and does the job!</li>
            <li>&gt; The first time I used it, I plugged it in and waited for it to heat up.</li>
            <li>the first time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This mini pro ceramic is better than my Chi flat iron.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t undertand the positive reviews, perhaps I got lemon.  </li>
            <li>I really like this, except that it gets really hot on the tips...</li>
            <li>Also, even though this is rarely used, I&#x27;m on Amazon shopping for a new one today because I got to work and needed to use it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also easy to carry around every day because it&#x27;s tiny.</li>
            <li>easy to use especially for guys with wavy hair.</li>
            <li>So even though it does heat up quickly, it takes a really long time to straighten a full head of hair.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this for short or fine hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty decent for bangs or shorter bits.  </li>
            <li>Great little product for short hair.</li>
            <li>and it would heat up really fast.</li>
            <li>(I wash my hair about twice a week, and my hair would stay straight from the time I ironed it until the time I washed it again), and held up well in humid weather.</li>
            <li>Heats up fast.  </li>
            <li>My larger iron is a BaByliss with tourmaline plates and it works great, wish I could have ordered the mini BaByliss in time for my recent vacation, I&#x27;m ordering it now to have for my next trip.  </li>
            <li>heats up fast.</li>
            <li>It worked really well for about two weeks</li>
            <li>It works well without too much risk of burned fingers.</li>
            <li>This does heat up as fast as promised, however I couldn&#x27;t get the results I wanted.</li>
            <li>The product works well and very convenience.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Gets the hair straight.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t necessarily expect a top of the line product, based on the price, but it would have been nice to get at least six months out of it before it died.</li>
            <li>All in all this works alright for what I need it for, wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for straightening the whole head.</li>
            <li>I have very freezy and curly hair</li>
            <li>really well in my handbag.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really straighten my hair.</li>
            <li>plates are small though, so expect to spend a bit more time straightening your hair than with a full size iron.</li>
            <li>Worked perfect for our daughter who has thin short hair.</li>
            <li>The only thing to be aware of is how hot the mini gets, you should not touch about the designated handles, where your fingers should be placed, while the iron is on, its gets hot.</li>
            <li>Compact, heats up quickly enough to get the job done, and is GREAT for creating small flips or curls in your hair.</li>
            <li>The straightener only has one temperature setting, and a red light which turns off when it has heated up (rather quickly).  </li>
            <li>one!&lt;br /&gt; If someone asked me what kind of flat iron they should get, I would recommend the Conair flat iron!</li>
            <li>Easy to burn fingers &amp; would have to be careful not to damage hair.</li>
            <li>It does take time to get through all of it, but it&#x27;s a decent trade off when traveling.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten better results when I apply extra pressure to the plates at the end opposite the hinge -</li>
            <li>I highly recomment this item.</li>
            <li>Luckily, I&#x27;d bought a Conair flat iron!&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I have semi-long straight hair and am a stay home mother of two young children</li>
            <li>A waste of money, glad it was inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s likely too small to be a good frustration-free tool.</li>
            <li>The iron itself heats up pretty fast, works well, and is definitely something I would recommend.</li>
            <li>and it does not get hot enough to straight the my hair line</li>
            <li>I think it needs to be at least 50% longer to be effective if you are trying to style your hair.  </li>
            <li>Straightens your hair as good if not better than a regular size.</li>
            <li>The MiniYou by Conair is a great product not only for travel purposes but for daily use in small areas (bangs/fringes).</li>
            <li>The heat bag is handy but the &amp;#34;minipro&amp;#34; is mini, very small surface</li>
            <li>Before the new school  year  </li>
            <li>I just love how little time it takes to heat up!</li>
            <li>Some of the reviews state that it didn&#x27;t get hot enough and that the plates didn&#x27;t align.</li>
            <li>This was a replacement order, had the exact same problem; IRON PLATES DO NOT LINE UP OR TOUCH.</li>
            <li>The size of the iron is about slightly thicker than an electric toothbrush, but it fits fine with the cable in the pouch, which is the size of a pencils pouch.</li>
            <li>On more humid days, just the walk from my car in to work can create completely different hair than when I left the house, so I use the iron to repair the damage once I&#x27;m back inside.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed for my short hairstyle!  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really SHORT (the hot plat part).  </li>
            <li>This tiny thing heats up fast and can fix frizzy spots on the go!</li>
            <li>You can style younger children&#x27;s hair easily with this flat iron, but if you&#x27;re looking for one to own yourself, I&#x27;d say wait until you&#x27;re at least ten years old before buying</li>
            <li>Be careful when manipulating the iron to style your hair because the material around the plates gets very hot.</li>
            <li>I also like how it doesn&#x27;t make my hair flat, but straight while I&#x27;ve still got my volume!</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how well it straightens hair</li>
            <li>really everything you need if you have short hair or are on the road.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s completely unusable.</li>
            <li>The temperature is fixed.</li>
            <li>I definitely feel I got what I paid for and it works very well, but I wish it turned itself off after a set time.  </li>
            <li>and it takes a little time to stay hot enough, but it works perfectly fine for my purpose (I have a short hair)</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t tangle in my hair or pull my hair out like some of the large flat irons.  </li>
            <li>As opposed to the other mini-flat irons, there&#x27;s no awkward glove to prevent burning; there are round grips on either side that provide comfortable grip and control.   </li>
            <li>Small and easy to take around with you.</li>
            <li>Heats up and cools down quick.</li>
            <li>I love that it is very small.</li>
            <li>I used it on my hair in small pieces and it worked just fine.</li>
            <li>But when I place this back into the bag while its hot, I actually keep the chord out of the bag.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to actually do anything to my hair.</li>
            <li>However, after about a month of using it daily, the left side stopped getting hot.</li>
            <li>About a minute later, I came back to check to on it, and it was ready to style!</li>
            <li>But, for travel, particularly international travel, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I love this little straightener, Small enough to carry around in an over night bag, heats up really quickly and works like a charm.</li>
            <li>The second is that there is very little plastic around the plates and because of the size, it&#x27;s very easy to put the flat iron too close to your scalp which does hurt just a bit.</li>
            <li>I needed a tiny straightener for my short hair at the front that wouldn&#x27;t burn me or be too large to maneuver around my bangs.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t quite live up to its larger counterpart</li>
            <li>I was really excited when I found a small (0.5) straightening iron on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>The only problem I&#x27;ve had with it, is if I run the iron over the same piece of hair multiple times, it&#x27;ll get a little static in my hair.</li>
            <li>Old one failed by having wires kinked right where they enter the case, so I&#x27;m more careful now.</li>
            <li>Its portable, small, and heats up quickly.</li>
            <li>Lightweight but heats up quickly; can use to straighten or do small flips and curls.</li>
            <li>So far I have only left it once to answer the phone and then forgotten it was on, but I am me and that is something to worry about.</li>
            <li>I keep it short and when my old mini straightener broke I could not find another one in the local stores.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d never had a mini iron before this one, so I wondered if it was just something mini irons did because their plates were so short, but I&#x27;m not seeing it as much in reviews of other mini irons.  </li>
            <li>It is small enough to effectively straighten out the small fly-aways and apply the proper curl.</li>
            <li>The only drawback to this particular model is that it doesn&#x27;t come with an asbestos travel case like other brands do.  </li>
            <li>Although it did not work as well or as quickly as my full size flat iron, it did the job in making my hair look at least presentable.  </li>
            <li>I also have really tight curls around my hairline and the regular sized iron can&#x27;t get them really well</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this iron for anyone who has short hair (shoulder length or shorter) - and someone who has fine or thin hair.</li>
            <li>I am black, so my hair is really an afro, this flat iron gets so close to the root without burning my scalp.  </li>

            <li> Great Conair CS80R MiniPro Ceramic Straightener, 0.5 Inch,</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> works as described -- very handy to use and travel with</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure it will do perfectly.</li>
            <li> Please keep in mind that&#x27;s not because it didn&#x27;t do a good job</li>
            <li> They loved it, but it went t.u.</li>
            <li> Good choice.</li>
            <li> Mother loved this product.</li>
            <li> It was good</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good emergency-only-or-just-for-a-few-strands-of-hair or -better-than-nothing iron.  </li>
            <li> The travel straightener is an adorable size and comes with a beautiful carrying case.</li>
            <li> The size would be perfect to carry in a purse for a quick touch up, or for your suitcase.  </li>
            <li> and I am very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> but I love it!  </li>

            <li> Love that it fits in my purse!  </li>
            <li> and it just about got warm.  </li>
            <li> The size makes this perfect for short hair, and for the price, is a great deal.</li>
            <li> I keep it at work so the heat resistant pouch comes in handy.</li>
            <li> Nice case for travel is included.</li>
            <li> It did not come with its own pouch, even though when I bought it, the description mentioned a pouch.  </li>
            <li> I have medium-long hair that is fairly fine, but there&#x27;s a lot of it!  </li>
            <li> perfect for traveling or if u know u ll need to retouch ur roots or bangs.&lt;br /&gt;Works really great for a small straightener&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
            <li> As for the iron itself, it worked great, made my hair completely straight</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> Heats up fast and works great</li>
            <li> I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Great price, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I recommend it! :)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just adorable.</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> I am going to buy one or two more and keep them at home, office, and everywhere.</li>
            <li> I would love this size and weight at home, too.  </li>
            <li> I love the portability and its travel size</li>
            <li> so I was using the end of it more</li>
            <li> I also travel a lot, so I really enjoyed the pouch it came</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it</li>
            <li> My wife enjoyed this gift because of its quality construction and compact design.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE  this product.  </li>
            <li> I enjoyed this product for a month.</li>
            <li> I think I may have to bite the bullet and save some money for a better quality device.</li>
            <li> and I think that this would work better for thicker hair.</li>
            <li> more than once.</li>
            <li> Works perfect for my those that have short hair.  </li>
            <li> Perfect for short hair.</li>
            <li> Returned for a better iron.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect flat iron for bangs and touch ups.</li>
            <li> It heats up pretty fast but it does not have temperature control, and it is truly mini, which is wonderful for traveling or carrying in a bag.  </li>
            <li> It gets hot quickly and works great.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the best tool to use as a primary flat iron.</li>
            <li> What I love about the case, besides it being super cute, is the fact that its thermal protected.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> If your hair is easy to straighten/curl, then go for it, it may work for you.</li>
            <li> This heats up very quickly and does the job.  </li>
            <li> and I love the case it comes with, great for short trips.</li>
            <li> I got to my roots easily.</li>
            <li> Its okay not as good as my old Conair one/</li>
            <li> I love this mini straightener, it&#x27;s perfect for traveling because it takes up so much less space!</li>
            <li> One is that I would have preferred some kind of a control over how hot I want it to get.</li>
            <li> Product was brand new and in good shape.</li>
            <li> I received my conair ceramic around october september 30th and was working just fine until today when it just died on me...</li>
            <li> The plates are smooth and it slides through hair easily, but didn&#x27;t seem too slippery.   </li>
            <li> Or, if a person&#x27;s hair is extremely fine, she might also find that her hair slips out.   </li>
            <li> Works fine though.</li>
            <li> My hair is about medium length, but I thought I would still be able to straighten it rather quickly.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s teeny, super portable, comes with a travel pouch, and has a two year warranty!</li>
            <li> But with a little practice, it&#x27;s really easy to figure out what works best.     </li>
            <li> This is a perfect little straightener.  </li>
            <li> If you see the &#x27;on&#x27; light blink when you flex the cord, it should be replaced.</li>
            <li> Compact and can fit in my diaper bag or purse for traveling.  </li>
            <li> Works great on my bangs and short hair</li>
            <li> Overall, great item.</li>
            <li> This is great for short hair.</li>
            <li> Leaves the hair silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> I took it to Vegas a few times and it worked perfect!</li>
            <li> This straightener is a great size for those of us with short hair.</li>
            <li> Overall, I greatly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This straightener is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> The first one died after 3 years but this one is still going strong after almost 2!</li>
            <li> This mini flat iron is great, no problems and it straighten like a dream.</li>
            <li> The iron is really small and cute, perfect for travel, fit right into my cosmetics bag.  </li>
            <li> As a quick back-up for the office, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> Magic, I purchased the conair mini and my bangs and layered hair are sleek, shiney, straight, but mostly ironed just right without burning my processed hair.  </li>
            <li> It gets hot fast and it is the perfect tool for my short wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> Great for getting at small areas like bangs and okay for travel</li>
            <li> It worked really well for all the styles I love.</li>
            <li> I also have pretty fine hair</li>
            <li> It heats up quick and straighten&#x27;s my bangs in a snap.  </li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s so small, I was also able to use it successfully to curl the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li> Heats up quick.</li>
            <li> all I had was a devil lock in the front which this worked perfect for, only problem is that it didn&#x27;t seem to clamp all the way shut towards the middle of it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never burned her or myself before, and it&#x27;s quick and easy!&lt;br /</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t get very hot</li>
            <li> Heats fast easy to use and does not pull hair when in use.</li>
            <li> But it works just as well as my regular sized one for straightening, and it works better for curling!</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Gets extremely hot!</li>
            <li> Just the right size, compact, coools quickly, and fits anywhere.</li>
            <li> good but leaves you hair very dry.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s great in a pinch when you just want to get at the few fly-away strands of hair.</li>
            <li> This iron also comes with a really cute thermal pouch that can fit into any purse, makeup bag or overnight bag, which is a definite plus.</li>
            <li> I loved it soooo much that I ordered another one as back up.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll be worth it.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s nice not to have to use a larger straightner.  </li>
            <li> and I like it better than my old one.</li>
            <li> Handled heated for about 30 seconds &amp; knew it wasn&#x27;t worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have so many curling irons and flat irons, but this one is perfect for really flatting your roots and can give a little curl.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s had a pretty easy life just lying in my desk drawer, being used maybe 2-3 times a month, so it really shouldn&#x27;t be dying yet.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who wants a quick easy fix for straight hair.</li>
            <li> The flat iron and cord slide nicely into the heat proof pouch in case you need to put it away in a hurry.   </li>
            <li> Came right away.</li>
            <li> Right heat.</li>
            <li> The heat is just right.</li>
            <li> But, all you have to do to prevent this from happening is to just try to get it right</li>
            <li> Fortunately, I have a case from an older model, so all is well.</li>
            <li> Heats up fairly quickly and is very compact.</li>
            <li> Very fast mail.  </li>
            <li> I waited up to 2 minutes for it to get hot</li>
            <li> but the handle gets pretty hot after using for a while</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get as hot as it says</li>
            <li> This mini was exactly what I needed/looking for.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted--</li>
            <li> I love this tiny curling iron!  </li>
            <li> I took this iron to Orlando, where it was pretty humid</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.    </li>
            <li> My last one lasted me about a year or more before it gave out</li>
            <li> Heats up fast and does the job!</li>
            <li> &gt; The first time I used it, I plugged it in and waited for it to heat up.</li>
            <li> the first time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This mini pro ceramic is better than my Chi flat iron.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t undertand the positive reviews, perhaps I got lemon.  </li>
            <li> I really like this, except that it gets really hot on the tips...</li>
            <li> Also, even though this is rarely used, I&#x27;m on Amazon shopping for a new one today because I got to work and needed to use it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also easy to carry around every day because it&#x27;s tiny.</li>
            <li> easy to use especially for guys with wavy hair.</li>
            <li> So even though it does heat up quickly, it takes a really long time to straighten a full head of hair.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this for short or fine hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty decent for bangs or shorter bits.  </li>
            <li> Great little product for short hair.</li>
            <li> and it would heat up really fast.</li>
            <li> (I wash my hair about twice a week, and my hair would stay straight from the time I ironed it until the time I washed it again), and held up well in humid weather.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast.  </li>
            <li> My larger iron is a BaByliss with tourmaline plates and it works great, wish I could have ordered the mini BaByliss in time for my recent vacation, I&#x27;m ordering it now to have for my next trip.  </li>
            <li> heats up fast.</li>
            <li> It worked really well for about two weeks</li>
            <li> It works well without too much risk of burned fingers.</li>
            <li> This does heat up as fast as promised, however I couldn&#x27;t get the results I wanted.</li>
            <li> The product works well and very convenience.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Gets the hair straight.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t necessarily expect a top of the line product, based on the price, but it would have been nice to get at least six months out of it before it died.</li>
            <li> All in all this works alright for what I need it for, wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for straightening the whole head.</li>
            <li> I have very freezy and curly hair</li>
            <li> really well in my handbag.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> plates are small though, so expect to spend a bit more time straightening your hair than with a full size iron.</li>
            <li> Worked perfect for our daughter who has thin short hair.</li>
            <li> The only thing to be aware of is how hot the mini gets, you should not touch about the designated handles, where your fingers should be placed, while the iron is on, its gets hot.</li>
            <li> Compact, heats up quickly enough to get the job done, and is GREAT for creating small flips or curls in your hair.</li>
            <li> The straightener only has one temperature setting, and a red light which turns off when it has heated up (rather quickly).  </li>
            <li> one!&lt;br /&gt; If someone asked me what kind of flat iron they should get, I would recommend the Conair flat iron!</li>
            <li> Easy to burn fingers &amp; would have to be careful not to damage hair.</li>
            <li> It does take time to get through all of it, but it&#x27;s a decent trade off when traveling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten better results when I apply extra pressure to the plates at the end opposite the hinge -</li>
            <li> I highly recomment this item.</li>
            <li> Luckily, I&#x27;d bought a Conair flat iron!&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I have semi-long straight hair and am a stay home mother of two young children</li>
            <li> A waste of money, glad it was inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, it&#x27;s likely too small to be a good frustration-free tool.</li>
            <li> The iron itself heats up pretty fast, works well, and is definitely something I would recommend.</li>
            <li> and it does not get hot enough to straight the my hair line</li>
            <li> I think it needs to be at least 50% longer to be effective if you are trying to style your hair.  </li>
            <li> Straightens your hair as good if not better than a regular size.</li>
            <li> The MiniYou by Conair is a great product not only for travel purposes but for daily use in small areas (bangs/fringes).</li>
            <li> The heat bag is handy but the &amp;#34;minipro&amp;#34; is mini, very small surface</li>
            <li> Before the new school  year  </li>
            <li> I just love how little time it takes to heat up!</li>
            <li> Some of the reviews state that it didn&#x27;t get hot enough and that the plates didn&#x27;t align.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement order, had the exact same problem; IRON PLATES DO NOT LINE UP OR TOUCH.</li>
            <li> The size of the iron is about slightly thicker than an electric toothbrush, but it fits fine with the cable in the pouch, which is the size of a pencils pouch.</li>
            <li> On more humid days, just the walk from my car in to work can create completely different hair than when I left the house, so I use the iron to repair the damage once I&#x27;m back inside.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed for my short hairstyle!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really SHORT (the hot plat part).  </li>
            <li> This tiny thing heats up fast and can fix frizzy spots on the go!</li>
            <li> You can style younger children&#x27;s hair easily with this flat iron, but if you&#x27;re looking for one to own yourself, I&#x27;d say wait until you&#x27;re at least ten years old before buying</li>
            <li> Be careful when manipulating the iron to style your hair because the material around the plates gets very hot.</li>
            <li> I also like how it doesn&#x27;t make my hair flat, but straight while I&#x27;ve still got my volume!</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how well it straightens hair</li>
            <li> really everything you need if you have short hair or are on the road.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s completely unusable.</li>
            <li> The temperature is fixed.</li>
            <li> I definitely feel I got what I paid for and it works very well, but I wish it turned itself off after a set time.  </li>
            <li> and it takes a little time to stay hot enough, but it works perfectly fine for my purpose (I have a short hair)</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t tangle in my hair or pull my hair out like some of the large flat irons.  </li>
            <li> As opposed to the other mini-flat irons, there&#x27;s no awkward glove to prevent burning; there are round grips on either side that provide comfortable grip and control.   </li>
            <li> Small and easy to take around with you.</li>
            <li> Heats up and cools down quick.</li>
            <li> I love that it is very small.</li>
            <li> I used it on my hair in small pieces and it worked just fine.</li>
            <li> But when I place this back into the bag while its hot, I actually keep the chord out of the bag.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to actually do anything to my hair.</li>
            <li> However, after about a month of using it daily, the left side stopped getting hot.</li>
            <li> About a minute later, I came back to check to on it, and it was ready to style!</li>
            <li> But, for travel, particularly international travel, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this little straightener, Small enough to carry around in an over night bag, heats up really quickly and works like a charm.</li>
            <li> The second is that there is very little plastic around the plates and because of the size, it&#x27;s very easy to put the flat iron too close to your scalp which does hurt just a bit.</li>
            <li> I needed a tiny straightener for my short hair at the front that wouldn&#x27;t burn me or be too large to maneuver around my bangs.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t quite live up to its larger counterpart</li>
            <li> I was really excited when I found a small (0.5) straightening iron on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> The only problem I&#x27;ve had with it, is if I run the iron over the same piece of hair multiple times, it&#x27;ll get a little static in my hair.</li>
            <li> Old one failed by having wires kinked right where they enter the case, so I&#x27;m more careful now.</li>
            <li> Its portable, small, and heats up quickly.</li>
            <li> Lightweight but heats up quickly; can use to straighten or do small flips and curls.</li>
            <li> So far I have only left it once to answer the phone and then forgotten it was on, but I am me and that is something to worry about.</li>
            <li> I keep it short and when my old mini straightener broke I could not find another one in the local stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never had a mini iron before this one, so I wondered if it was just something mini irons did because their plates were so short, but I&#x27;m not seeing it as much in reviews of other mini irons.  </li>
            <li> It is small enough to effectively straighten out the small fly-aways and apply the proper curl.</li>
            <li> The only drawback to this particular model is that it doesn&#x27;t come with an asbestos travel case like other brands do.  </li>
            <li> Although it did not work as well or as quickly as my full size flat iron, it did the job in making my hair look at least presentable.  </li>
            <li> I also have really tight curls around my hairline and the regular sized iron can&#x27;t get them really well</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this iron for anyone who has short hair (shoulder length or shorter) - and someone who has fine or thin hair.</li>
            <li> I am black, so my hair is really an afro, this flat iron gets so close to the root without burning my scalp.  </li>
            <li> Not only was this little flat iron reasonably priced but the seller shipped it to me in one day.  </li>
            <li> When firmly clamped,the inner half of the plates are still a full millimeter apart.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend trying to use this flat iron for daily straightening unless you have very short hair, or if it is to be used for touch ups on the go.</li>
            <li> Just be careful, it gets little too hot on the edge and may burn you.  </li>
            <li> flat ironing my hair, but only because of its size.</li>
            <li> Plus it looks like your usual straightener went and had an adorable little baby straightener if you put them next to each other -</li>
            <li> This little iron did alright for awhile, in that it got hot fast and ironed out the unwelcome curls and tweaks, but I had to be extra careful because it ALWAYS caught on my hair and pulled some of the strands - not comfortable!  </li>
            <li> However, since it was so small, I was only able to take very small sections of hair, therefore it would take about 45 minutes to flat iron all my hair.</li>
            <li> I ordered this flat iron a month ago and have used it every day.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to use at the gym in the mornings and did not want to haul my 2\\&quot; flat iron in my bag.</li>
            <li> I ordered this mini flat iron for upcoming travel.  </li>

            <li> I think the other one died to young because my roommate left it on for other 30min accidentally one time.</li>
            <li> Now, understand, my hair is usually in need of a high heat setting in order to straighten/curl.</li>
            <li> The plates do not meet properly, there is quite space between them, so the hair just slips through without coming in contact with the plates, and there is really not much heat anyway.  </li>
            <li> Also came earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thin and fine.</li>
            <li> I saw a couple other reviewers say the same thing.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not meant to be used for long periods like that!</li>
            <li> I can also style my six year old little sister&#x27;s hair with it!</li>
            <li> The pouch that it comes with fits not only the flat iron but the cord as well, although it takes a little positioning for that.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind this is smaller than the average travel straightener.</li>
            <li> I bought mine in a black color at Big Lots for about two dollars!&lt;br</li>
            <li> &quot; It gets frizzy, curly, and just a big mess.</li>
            <li> so there goes $20 bucks plus shipping down the toilet.</li>
            <li> There is a slight learning curve to using this without burning your scalp, but that can be said of any flat iron.  </li>
            <li> A little bit smaller than expected.  </li>
            <li> I wish it has come with a carrying case like the pink version did.</li>
            <li> So be careful.</li>
            <li> be careful.</li>
            <li> The heat setting is just to low for me and doesnt work well with my thick short curly hair.</li>
            <li> a little flat iron to put in my purse!</li>
            <li> My base hair color is grey and of course salon dyed dark blonde, light brown with highlights.</li>
            <li> It is about the same size as a small make up or pencil pouch.</li>
            <li> It pulls my hair every time I use it because there are places other than the plates that touch, and any flyaway or stray hairs that come off the plates will get caught.</li>
            <li> However, I would not recommend this for day to day use for women who have a lot of hair or long hair,  because it is too small.  </li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> I have a short haircut with bangs, and it worked to straighten my slightly wavy, thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I have hair down to my waist</li>
            <li> after less than 4 months of use.  </li>
            <li> Anyways, its small and if you have short hair and looking for a small hair straightener, I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> It heats up very quickly, less than the promised 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very hot, and you have to work with small segments of hair.  </li>
            <li> I bought this little gem for a business trip to Germany.</li>
            <li> I cut it short and the problem got worse.</li>
            <li> but I use mine almost everyday.</li>
            <li> I think this was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thin, and I need to iron it several times to get a minimally sactisfatpry result.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s really not ideal to use on the entire mane</li>
            <li> Lately it was getting to be impossible to blow dry and manage my soft wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I have relatively thick, slightly wavy hair that is neck length (longer than chin, but not quite shoulder length).  </li>
            <li> Emphasis on little!    </li>
            <li> I had this straightener only for a few weeks, but returned it because it was just too small for me, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> But way too small to use.</li>
            <li> Small, convenient.</li>
            <li> It is indeed small...</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a small straigtener that works, Get it.</li>
            <li> I wanted something small to just straighten the sides of my hair.  </li>
            <li> Small and compact.  </li>
            <li> Too small</li>
            <li> For some, the fact that the iron does not have multiple heat settings might be annoying, but it&#x27;s a mini flat iron, the temperature is \\&quot;just right\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Hard to handle.</li>
            <li> My hair is shoulder length and relatively thick.</li>

            <li> I straighten my hair alot, and due to humidity it turns into a \\&quot;horribly gone</li>
            <li> Really disappointed with this.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Came right away. But way too small to use. Maybe on bangs. I have short hair and it still didn&#x27;t do the job.</li>
            <li> Emphasis on little!    I had this straightener only for a few weeks, but returned it because it was just too small for me, unfortunately. As for the iron itself, it worked great, made my hair completely straight and it would heat up really fast. Using the iron for me was time consuming because of its tiny size, but I am not going to say that was a \\&quot;con\\&quot; necessarily, regarding the actual iron. My hair is about medium length, but I thought I would still be able to straighten it rather quickly. However, since it was so small, I was only able to take very small sections of hair, therefore it would take about 45 minutes to flat iron all my hair. Please keep in mind that&#x27;s not because it didn&#x27;t do a good job flat ironing my hair, but only because of its size. My hair did stay straight for a few days (I wash my hair about twice a week, and my hair would stay straight from the time I ironed it until the time I washed it again), and held up well in humid weather. For some, the fact that the iron does not have multiple heat settings might be annoying, but it&#x27;s a mini flat iron, the temperature is \\&quot;just right\\&quot;. There&#x27;s no need for multiple settings. I would definitely recommend this iron for anyone who has short hair (shoulder length or shorter) - and someone who has fine or thin hair. This iron also comes with a really cute thermal pouch that can fit into any purse, makeup bag or overnight bag, which is a definite plus.</li>
            <li> Small, convenient. Right heat. Old one failed by having wires kinked right where they enter the case, so I&#x27;m more careful now. If you see the &#x27;on&#x27; light blink when you flex the cord, it should be replaced.</li>
            <li> I have semi-long straight hair and am a stay home mother of two young children so I don&#x27;t have a lot of time to style my hair.  I bought this because a friend of mine had a similar one that I used when we were together on vacation.  This is much smaller than hers but I love it!  Heats up fast.  Easy to use.  Doesn&#x27;t tangle in my hair or pull my hair out like some of the large flat irons.  Compact and can fit in my diaper bag or purse for traveling.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants a quick easy fix for straight hair.</li>
            <li> Sturdier than I thought it would be. Works great on my bangs and short hair</li>
            <li> The product is as it is decsribed. It is an efficient miniature hair tool and works well. Be careful when manipulating the iron to style your hair because the material around the plates gets very hot.</li>
            <li> I bought this to keep at the office. I have medium-long hair that is fairly fine, but there&#x27;s a lot of it!  The metal plate is only 2\\&quot; X 1/2\\&quot;.  So even though it does heat up quickly, it takes a really long time to straighten a full head of hair.  It&#x27;s pretty decent for bangs or shorter bits.  I would not recommend this for travel - the size is great, but the performance is lacking.  I would recommend this for short or fine hair.  As a quick back-up for the office, it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> Just be careful, it gets little too hot on the edge and may burn you.  I will give it a 4 star only because it doesn&#x27;t have a heat setting.</li>
            <li> I received my conair ceramic around october september 30th and was working just fine until today when it just died on me...I tried to return it but the \\&quot;return window\\&quot; had expired 10 days ago so there goes $20 bucks plus shipping down the toilet.</li>
            <li> I have so many curling irons and flat irons, but this one is perfect for really flatting your roots and can give a little curl.  I am black, so my hair is really an afro, this flat iron gets so close to the root without burning my scalp.  I love it.  And my hair is straighter than ever!!</li>
            <li> This is one of the worst hairstyling products I have ever purchased.  I don&#x27;t undertand the positive reviews, perhaps I got lemon.  The plates do not meet properly, there is quite space between them, so the hair just slips through without coming in contact with the plates, and there is really not much heat anyway.  The description states it heats up in 30 seconds. I waited up to 2 minutes for it to get hot and it just about got warm.  A waste of money, glad it was inexpensive.  My larger iron is a BaByliss with tourmaline plates and it works great, wish I could have ordered the mini BaByliss in time for my recent vacation, I&#x27;m ordering it now to have for my next trip.  The Conair went in the garbage.</li>
            <li> Bought for my kids.  They loved it, but it went t.u. after less than 4 months of use.  Gets the job done, don&#x27;t expect a lot of uses out of it.</li>
            <li> I adore this product and the seller.  I ordered this flat iron a month ago and have used it every day.  It heats up quick and straighten&#x27;s my bangs in a snap.  I loved it soooo much that I ordered another one as back up.  The seller is \\&quot;wonderful\\&quot;.  Not only was this little flat iron reasonably priced but the seller shipped it to me in one day.  Can&#x27;t get any better then that!!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s small--perfect for travel anywhere. heats up fast. plates are small though, so expect to spend a bit more time straightening your hair than with a full size iron.</li>
            <li> I bought this little gem for a business trip to Germany. Though the description doesn&#x27;t say so, it is dual voltage and automatically switches to the correct voltage. You will need to buy a plug adapter if using it abroad, however, so don&#x27;t overlook that detail.    It is indeed small...thus, the word mini in the title. It is about the same size as a small make up or pencil pouch. The flat iron and cord slide nicely into the heat proof pouch in case you need to put it away in a hurry.   I use it for all of my hair. It does take time to get through all of it, but it&#x27;s a decent trade off when traveling. My hair is shoulder length and relatively thick. I used it on my hair in small pieces and it worked just fine. Because it&#x27;s so small, I was also able to use it successfully to curl the ends of my hair. The plates are smooth and it slides through hair easily, but didn&#x27;t seem too slippery.   Some of the reviews state that it didn&#x27;t get hot enough and that the plates didn&#x27;t align. That wasn&#x27;t my experience and I imagine those might have been manufacturing defects. Or, if a person&#x27;s hair is extremely fine, she might also find that her hair slips out.   I wouldn&#x27;t recommend trying to use this flat iron for daily straightening unless you have very short hair, or if it is to be used for touch ups on the go. Otherwise, it&#x27;s likely too small to be a good frustration-free tool. But, for travel, particularly international travel, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The travel straightener is an adorable size and comes with a beautiful carrying case. I was surprised at how well it straightens hair given it&#x27;s smaller size!</li>
            <li> I was really excited when I found a small (0.5) straightening iron on Amazon.com. I have short hair and that size works well for it. It worked really well for about two weeks and then the connection cord started to short out. Never knew whether it was going to work or not. Needs some work on that problem. Have bought Conair products before and had no problems.</li>
            <li> awesome. it&#x27;s teeny, super portable, comes with a travel pouch, and has a two year warranty! for twenty bucks! really everything you need if you have short hair or are on the road.</li>
            <li> This mini flat iron is great, no problems and it straighten like a dream. I would recommend this iron to anyone.</li>
            <li> Really disappointed with this. This was a replacement order, had the exact same problem; IRON PLATES DO NOT LINE UP OR TOUCH. It&#x27;s completely unusable.</li>
            <li> I bought this for bangs and short layered hair. It works well without too much risk of burned fingers.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast and works great but the handle gets pretty hot after using for a while</li>
            <li> There is a slight learning curve to using this without burning your scalp, but that can be said of any flat iron.  The size makes this perfect for short hair, and for the price, is a great deal. The iron itself heats up pretty fast, works well, and is definitely something I would recommend. Overall, great item.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect flat iron for bangs and touch ups. I keep it at work so the heat resistant pouch comes in handy. Excellent price.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get as hot as it says</li>
            <li> The MiniYou by Conair is a great product not only for travel purposes but for daily use in small areas (bangs/fringes).</li>
            <li> I bought this to use at the gym in the mornings and did not want to haul my 2\\&quot; flat iron in my bag. It heats up pretty fast but it does not have temperature control, and it is truly mini, which is wonderful for traveling or carrying in a bag.  However, I would not recommend this for day to day use for women who have a lot of hair or long hair,  because it is too small.  The size of the iron is about slightly thicker than an electric toothbrush, but it fits fine with the cable in the pouch, which is the size of a pencils pouch.</li>
            <li> This mini was exactly what I needed/looking for. This is great for short hair. The only thing to be aware of is how hot the mini gets, you should not touch about the designated handles, where your fingers should be placed, while the iron is on, its gets hot.</li>
            <li> First off, know that this product is extremely small, smaller than the palm of my hand. I bought this item to actually curl my hair. Not only would my hair not curl, but it wouldn&#x27;t even straighten. Now, understand, my hair is usually in need of a high heat setting in order to straighten/curl. This does heat up as fast as promised, however I couldn&#x27;t get the results I wanted. If your hair is easy to straighten/curl, then go for it, it may work for you. Otherwise, you will probably be as disappointed as I was.</li>
            <li> Maybe I got a dud, but the plates aren&#x27;t parallel-- When firmly clamped,the inner half of the plates are still a full millimeter apart.</li>
            <li> I straighten my hair alot, and due to humidity it turns into a \\&quot;horribly gone wrong perm.\\&quot; It gets frizzy, curly, and just a big mess. This mini hair straightener is a must have in my purse. Its portable, small, and heats up quickly. What I love about the case, besides it being super cute, is the fact that its thermal protected. Which means you can do a touch up, place this back in the bag, and head off toy our destination. But when I place this back into the bag while its hot, I actually keep the chord out of the bag. Since I fear that the chord may melt. Anyways, its small and if you have short hair and looking for a small hair straightener, I would recommend this. You turn it on, heats up almost instantly, hold it by the gel pads, do your hair, and then your off.</li>
            <li> I love this little straightener, Small enough to carry around in an over night bag, heats up really quickly and works like a charm. I have very thick hair that doesn&#x27;t want to do anything i tell it to do so this is my secret weapon. If you&#x27;re looking for a small straigtener that works, Get it. It&#x27;ll be worth it.</li>
            <li> Very fast mail.  I wanted something small to just straighten the sides of my hair.  This heats up very quickly and does the job.  I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Compact, heats up quickly enough to get the job done, and is GREAT for creating small flips or curls in your hair.</li>
            <li> Great price, fast shipping. The product works well and very convenience.  I really like this product. I highly recomment this item. Good choice. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I love this mini straightener, it&#x27;s perfect for traveling because it takes up so much less space! It&#x27;s also easy to carry around every day because it&#x27;s tiny. I keep mine in my purse for the flyaway emergencies! I think it&#x27;s great for the size!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted-- a little flat iron to put in my purse! Perfect for my bangs! I recommend it! :)</li>
            <li> I needed a tiny straightener for my short hair at the front that wouldn&#x27;t burn me or be too large to maneuver around my bangs. This does the trick! It&#x27;s perfect for what I needed. It is TINY. Plus it looks like your usual straightener went and had an adorable little baby straightener if you put them next to each other - it&#x27;s just adorable.</li>
            <li> Gets the hair straight. Very small. Perfect for shorter hair. Leaves the hair silky and smooth. Heats up quick.</li>
            <li> Worked perfect for our daughter who has thin short hair. Nice case for travel is included. Keep in mind this is smaller than the average travel straightener.</li>
            <li> (This is used by Jonathan&#x27;s wife.) Works okay. I&#x27;ve gotten better results when I apply extra pressure to the plates at the end opposite the hinge - but of course this requires two hands to operate the straightener.</li>
            <li> This mini pro ceramic is better than my Chi flat iron. My base hair color is grey and of course salon dyed dark blonde, light brown with highlights. Lately it was getting to be impossible to blow dry and manage my soft wavy hair. I cut it short and the problem got worse. All this until yesterday....Magic, I purchased the conair mini and my bangs and layered hair are sleek, shiney, straight, but mostly ironed just right without burning my processed hair.  I am going to buy one or two more and keep them at home, office, and everywhere. LOVE IT!!! 5 BIG STARS</li>
            <li> I bought this mini iron to keep at work.  On more humid days, just the walk from my car in to work can create completely different hair than when I left the house, so I use the iron to repair the damage once I&#x27;m back inside.  This little iron did alright for awhile, in that it got hot fast and ironed out the unwelcome curls and tweaks, but I had to be extra careful because it ALWAYS caught on my hair and pulled some of the strands - not comfortable!  I saw a couple other reviewers say the same thing.  I&#x27;d never had a mini iron before this one, so I wondered if it was just something mini irons did because their plates were so short, but I&#x27;m not seeing it as much in reviews of other mini irons.  Also, even though this is rarely used, I&#x27;m on Amazon shopping for a new one today because I got to work and needed to use it and it&#x27;s not working.  It turns on and off, like there is a short in the cord or something.  It&#x27;s had a pretty easy life just lying in my desk drawer, being used maybe 2-3 times a month, so it really shouldn&#x27;t be dying yet.  Time to try another brand.</li>
            <li> Heats up fairly quickly and is very compact. I&#x27;ve used ones that get hotter, however. The temperature is fixed.</li>
            <li> A little bit smaller than expected.  Works fine though.</li>
            <li> Small and compact.  Great travel Straightener.  Mother loved this product.</li>
            <li> Not worth it. Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to actually do anything to my hair. Just buy a regular straightener instead.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect little straightener.  Just the right size, compact, coools quickly, and fits anywhere.</li>
            <li> This my angle. I love that it is very small. I can take it to fix my hair on when I travel.</li>
            <li> Perfect for travel.  I would love this size and weight at home, too.  I definitely feel I got what I paid for and it works very well, but I wish it turned itself off after a set time.  So far I have only left it once to answer the phone and then forgotten it was on, but I am me and that is something to worry about.</li>
            <li> awesome, use it every morning at work after the humidity messes up my hair on the walk to work.</li>
            <li> Perfect size, works great and I love the case it comes with, great for short trips. I took it to Vegas a few times and it worked perfect!</li>
            <li> I love this tiny curling iron!  It gets hot fast and it is the perfect tool for my short wavy hair.  It takes almost no space when traveling, but it&#x27;s also my daily iron.  I wish it has come with a carrying case like the pink version did.</li>
            <li> I love the portability and its travel size but it doesn&#x27;t quite live up to its larger counterpart and I didn&#x27;t expect it to. I have hair down to my waist so it&#x27;s really not ideal to use on the entire mane but it&#x27;s great in a pinch when you just want to get at the few fly-away strands of hair.</li>
            <li> I really like this, except that it gets really hot on the tips...didn&#x27;t expect this and have burned my fingers. So be careful.</li>
            <li> I have relatively thick, slightly wavy hair that is neck length (longer than chin, but not quite shoulder length).  I took this iron to Orlando, where it was pretty humid and my hair was all puffy.  The iron is really small and cute, perfect for travel, fit right into my cosmetics bag.  It did not come with its own pouch, even though when I bought it, the description mentioned a pouch.  Although it did not work as well or as quickly as my full size flat iron, it did the job in making my hair look at least presentable.  I had to do smaller sections of hair at a time.  Took me around 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet so this not a product review...yet. As soon as I opened it, I was instantly irritated. This is not a minipro, this is a mini you straightner. be careful. the product # for the minipro is different from the mini you.</li>
            <li> all I had was a devil lock in the front which this worked perfect for, only problem is that it didn&#x27;t seem to clamp all the way shut towards the middle of it so I was using the end of it more</li>
            <li> This straightener is a great size for those of us with short hair. I also travel a lot, so I really enjoyed the pouch it came with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I do NOT suggest that anyone buy this. It pulls my hair every time I use it because there are places other than the plates that touch, and any flyaway or stray hairs that come off the plates will get caught. I have not run into this problem before with a straightener, and hopefully once I buy one (maybe a more expensive one?) it won&#x27;t do the same thing.</li>
            <li> good but leaves you hair very dry. it works well otherwise</li>
            <li> for this price , i would say it serves best.&lt;br /&gt;my wife wanted something to carry while travelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came across this product. It was good choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife says it is working well.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product from Amazon and just got it this week. I absolutely love it and it&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.    It heats up very quickly, less than the promised 30 seconds. The size is perfect for travel and fits in a purse. The pouch that it comes with fits not only the flat iron but the cord as well, although it takes a little positioning for that. As opposed to the other mini-flat irons, there&#x27;s no awkward glove to prevent burning; there are round grips on either side that provide comfortable grip and control.   I bought it so that I could take it in my carry-on for my trip and I&#x27;m sure it will do perfectly. I also have really tight curls around my hairline and the regular sized iron can&#x27;t get them really well but this one is absolutely perfect.    I only have 2 issues with it that prevented me from giving it well-deserved 5 stars. One is that I would have preferred some kind of a control over how hot I want it to get. The second is that there is very little plastic around the plates and because of the size, it&#x27;s very easy to put the flat iron too close to your scalp which does hurt just a bit. But with a little practice, it&#x27;s really easy to figure out what works best.     Overall, I greatly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My wife enjoyed this gift because of its quality construction and compact design.  Storage pouch was included.  Great for travel.</li>
            <li> I LOVE  this product.  I keep it in my bag so wherever I am I can use it.  I would recommend this to everyone !</li>
            <li> I enjoyed this product for a month. It worked really well for all the styles I love. However, after about a month of using it daily, the left side stopped getting hot. I didn&#x27;t necessarily expect a top of the line product, based on the price, but it would have been nice to get at least six months out of it before it died. I think I may have to bite the bullet and save some money for a better quality device.</li>
            <li> works as described -- very handy to use and travel with</li>
            <li> I got this product about 2 months ago and I am not impressed. I bought it for my gym bag because I have wavy hair but I straighten my bangs. I also have pretty fine hair and I think that this would work better for thicker hair. It can pull strands if you don&#x27;t straighten enough at one time.  It also doesn&#x27;t get very hot so you have to go over the pieces more than once. All in all this works alright for what I need it for, wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for straightening the whole head.</li>
            <li> Works perfect for my those that have short hair.  Perfect for travel!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed for my short hairstyle!  Love it!</li>
            <li> Great for getting at small areas like bangs and okay for travel but it doesn&#x27;t seem to glide over hair like my Chi straightener does.</li>
            <li> Works great. Second time purchasing of this item after it got destroyed in luggage going to Europe.</li>
            <li> Heats fast easy to use and does not pull hair when in use. Small and easy to take around with you.</li>
            <li> I love this thing! It&#x27;s much smaller than I was expecting, it&#x27;s only about the size of my hand. But it works just as well as my regular sized one for straightening, and it works better for curling! The heat is just right. The size is perfect for traveling, and it&#x27;s also dual voltage, so it works in the US and in Europe without a voltage converter. Great product and on time shipping. I would definitely reccomend.</li>
            <li> Great for travel but I use mine almost everyday. Lightweight but heats up quickly; can use to straighten or do small flips and curls. Perfect for short hair.</li>
            <li> Perfect size and heat level.</li>
            <li> I think this was a waste of my money. I have very freezy and curly hair and it does not get hot enough to straight the my hair line</li>
            <li> Too small and it takes a little time to stay hot enough, but it works perfectly fine for my purpose (I have a short hair)</li>
            <li> The heat setting is just to low for me and doesnt work well with my thick short curly hair.</li>
            <li> This is my second conair minipro. The first one died after 3 years but this one is still going strong after almost 2! I think the other one died to young because my roommate left it on for other 30min accidentally one time. It&#x27;s not meant to be used for long periods like that! Perfect for guys&#x27; hair!</li>
            <li> Bought for my handlebar mustache.  It is small enough to effectively straighten out the small fly-aways and apply the proper curl.</li>
            <li> Great Conair CS80R MiniPro Ceramic Straightener, 0.5 Inch, Color May Vary&lt;br /&gt;Goes really well in my handbag. perfect for traveling or if u know u ll need to retouch ur roots or bangs.&lt;br /&gt;Works really great for a small straightener&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really SHORT (the hot plat part).  I think it needs to be at least 50% longer to be effective if you are trying to style your hair.  It&#x27;s a good emergency-only-or-just-for-a-few-strands-of-hair or -better-than-nothing iron.  I do wish they have these 0.5 inch width in a regular length, so i can use it to curl as well.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat this for the price! This tiny thing heats up fast and can fix frizzy spots on the go! My last one lasted me about a year or more before it gave out (which is why i gave it 4 out of 5 stars). It doesn&#x27;t last forever but for the price and convenience it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> This straightener is fantastic.  I have short hair so it&#x27;s nice not to have to use a larger straightner.  Additionally, I travel alot, so this is perfect for a \\&quot;girl on the go.\\&quot;  The only drawback to this particular model is that it doesn&#x27;t come with an asbestos travel case like other brands do.  Fortunately, I have a case from an older model, so all is well.</li>
            <li> I ordered this mini flat iron for upcoming travel.  It&#x27;s very tiny, and lightweight. The ceramic iron is about 3 inches by 0.5 inches, and the tool is approx. 6-7 inches. I have a short haircut with bangs, and it worked to straighten my slightly wavy, thick hair.  If I had a longer hair style, it definitely wouldn&#x27;t straighten it. The straightener only has one temperature setting, and a red light which turns off when it has heated up (rather quickly).  It&#x27;s not very hot, and you have to work with small segments of hair.  The size would be perfect to carry in a purse for a quick touch up, or for your suitcase.  This isn&#x27;t the best tool to use as a primary flat iron. Also, the product did not come with a travel case.</li>
            <li> I bought it just for the fringe. My hair is very thin, and I need to iron it several times to get a minimally sactisfatpry result.&lt;br /&gt;Does not come with a case. i wouldn´t buy it again, but I can´t say it´s useless.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thin and fine. I keep it short and when my old mini straightener broke I could not find another one in the local stores. I knew Amazon would have one and I like it better than my old one.</li>
            <li> Love that it fits in my purse!  I have wavy bangs and it&#x27;s great for touch ups!!  Heats up fast and does the job!</li>
            <li> Great Deal!!! Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Product was brand new and in good shape. Also came earlier than expected. The heat bag is handy but the &amp;#34;minipro&amp;#34; is mini, very small surface but it works great!</li>
            <li> I was looking for something portable (and I still am!). It doesn&#x27;t really straighten my hair. I can&#x27;t even return it since UPS screwed up on the return.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. To small &amp; no heat settings caused this to get to hot. Hard to handle. Easy to burn fingers &amp; would have to be careful not to damage hair. Handled heated for about 30 seconds &amp; knew it wasn&#x27;t worth the price. Or going to work for my needs. Returned for a better iron.</li>
            <li> easy to use especially for guys with wavy hair. Heats up and cools down quick. Great little product for short hair.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed. Gets extremely hot!</li>
            <li> Easiest Styling Flat Iron I&#x27;ve Ever Had!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Before the new school  year  began, I got my hair cut above my shoulders. But, I didn&#x27;t like how my hair would flip out instead of in. Luckily, I&#x27;d bought a Conair flat iron!&lt;br /&gt; The first time I used it, I plugged it in and waited for it to heat up. About a minute later, I came back to check to on it, and it was ready to style! I just love how little time it takes to heat up! I also like how it doesn&#x27;t make my hair flat, but straight while I&#x27;ve still got my volume! I bought mine in a black color at Big Lots for about two dollars!&lt;br /&gt; I can also style my six year old little sister&#x27;s hair with it! I&#x27;ve never burned her or myself before, and it&#x27;s quick and easy!&lt;br /&gt; The only problem I&#x27;ve had with it, is if I run the iron over the same piece of hair multiple times, it&#x27;ll get a little static in my hair. But, all you have to do to prevent this from happening is to just try to get it right the first time.&lt;br /&gt; You can style younger children&#x27;s hair easily with this flat iron, but if you&#x27;re looking for one to own yourself, I&#x27;d say wait until you&#x27;re at least ten years old before buying one!&lt;br /&gt; If someone asked me what kind of flat iron they should get, I would recommend the Conair flat iron!</li>
            <li> Perfect to take anywhere. Straightens your hair as good if not better than a regular size. I got to my roots easily.</li>
            <li> Its okay not as good as my old Conair one/</li>
            <li> i bought this as a gift and I am very pleased with it.  It gets hot quickly and works great.</li>
