            <li>Glad to know he&#x27;s promoting a product I&#x27;ve been using and satisfied with for years</li>
            <li>This is the best facial cleanser for the money on the market.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I am glad that my sister told me about this product.  </li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t realize this was more of an exfoliater.</li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>this cleanser clean my face without over drying it also leave my skin nice and  </li>
            <li>That said, by day four my skin was looking great, less oily, no pimples, bright and more even skin tone.  </li>
            <li>Makes my face so soft and it smells great.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, this cleanses your skin, minimizes pores and evens out your skin tone while exfoliating.</li>
            <li>I think this is just a great product for skin in general, no matter the type.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fine as a cream cleanser.</li>
            <li>It has a little exfoliation in it and that;s perfect to use every night.</li>
            <li>Olay Regenerist Advanced Anti-Aging Cleanser, 5 Ounce (Pack of 3)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>smooth</li>
            <li>Got this as a free sample when I purchased the Overnight cream.  </li>
            <li>Olay products are fantastic and this is one of them.</li>
            <li>I use a facial loofa with it and have had great results.</li>
            <li>because it is HypoAllergenic and basically scent free.</li>
            <li>My oily/dry skin as regulated and is now just comfortable.  </li>
            <li>months old and is still in good condition  (doesn&#x27;t need replacement&lt;br /&gt;per</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>This product makes my skin feel so smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li>I originally bought it because I know in your 20s that you are suppose to start a skin care regimen that includes some anti-aging aspects to combat stress and what not.</li>
            <li>The product gets my skin really clean</li>
            <li>However, I can say that it did not make my skin feel clean.</li>
            <li>Leaves my face feeling really clean.</li>
            <li>My skin always feel refreshed and clean.  </li>
            <li>SUPER SMOOTH &amp; CREAMY does what its supposed to do</li>
            <li>so the creamy cleanser doesn&#x27;t make me too happy but for people who have dry skin this will protect and hydrate the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for years and it helps to keep my skin fresh and smooth, and free of breakouts.</li>
            <li>I am 21 and had developed a smile wrinkle that did not look good with or without makeup.</li>
            <li>Good cleaner that does not dry your face.  </li>
            <li>love this product, keeps my face clean without drying it out too much.</li>
            <li>It makes my face bright red after using it and I don&#x27;t like the feel.</li>
            <li>It is true.</li>
            <li>I use this product at night, and in the morning I use Olay&#x27;s Cream Cleansing wash for a more gentle effect with my Olay cleansing brush.</li>
            <li>and I was happy to find the multi-pack as I keep one at home and the other in my gym bag.</li>
            <li>The first one I used was fine.</li>
            <li>Shipment was quick also.</li>
            <li>This cleanser is refreshing and gentle, with the right amount of exfoliating beads.  </li>
            <li>Just the right amount of &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34; to clean your face well without damaging skin.  </li>
            <li>this seems to work better for my normal skin type then the Aveeno soy.</li>
            <li>This product is good if u have dry skin .  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It did take a little longer to get to my house, but getting the 3 bottles at once is great,</li>
            <li>really works for those fine wrinkles or laugh lines.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to find it has these teeny tiny fine exfoliating particles which feel so good as I massage the cleanser on my face.</li>
            <li>I WOULD HAVE LIKED A DIFFERENT AROMA AND THE FEELING</li>
            <li>but I love it so far.</li>
            <li>It is a nice price and something I use daily in the shower.</li>
            <li>The Amazon shopping is far more convenient.</li>
            <li>I had switched to a brand for sensitive skin, but I felt like I needed more make up.</li>
            <li>In just two weeks my skin tone is better and I&#x27;m back to concealer and a light powder.</li>
            <li>I use it right before exiting the shower after my face has sucked in that hot steam and rinse it off with cool water (to close pores)</li>
            <li>I had gotten a sample tube of this with another Olay product and this worked wonders on my skin clearing up my pimples right away.</li>
            <li>but it clean very well</li>
            <li>It invigorates you skin and leaves it super soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>of caution: be care of some of the sellers selling this, I order a 3 pack, and only got one, but thanks to Amazon Amazing Customer service, I was refunded my money after the seller promised to fix it and then refused to follow up on it.</li>
            <li>I decided to give it a try because of the great reviews and because I have a terribly hard time finding a cleanser that works well for my skin.  </li>
            <li>it cleans and leaves her skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I only bough one and did not order a case</li>
            <li>I still won&#x27;t order again just because it&#x27;s my personal preference, but I like most of Olay products.</li>
            <li>Really refreshing and feels reminiscent of my Estee Lauder So Polished Exfoliating Scrub.</li>
            <li>Exactly as shown.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite and only face wash now.</li>
            <li>I use only Olay Regenerist Products and love all of them.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference with the way my skin looks and feels the first week.</li>
            <li>Skin feels soft and smooth after using it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already use the first  pack</li>
            <li>It took me almost 2 month to finish the first pack i used it morning and evening .</li>
            <li>I have recently switched from Neutrogena to Olay and Olay seems to be doing a much better job.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Unlike other products I&#x27;ve used, this cleans off my face nicely without feeling like I&#x27;m cleaning a bunch of sand off my face.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use every day, but several times per week to help keep my skin fresh and smooth.</li>
            <li>I love that it exfoliates yet leaves my skin soft and not tight feeling.</li>
            <li>This product shipped fast and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Amazon shipped it pretty fast</li>
            <li>It washes away my makeup quickly, and leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>This cleanser is fantastic, it does not dry out my skin</li>
            <li>Pure perfection.</li>
            <li>Fresh, supple, and clear!  </li>
            <li>One shopping trip led me to this particular Olay product and it has been three years of consistent use ever since.  </li>
            <li>I have ordered the Olay Regenerist Advanced Anti-Aging Cleanser several times.  </li>
            <li>it looks like I might (not so much since using this daily).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I broke out a lot in the very beginning and my skin seemed very oily because this has moisturizer in it.  </li>
            <li>I really like Olay Regenerist  and</li>
            <li>So it is gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>and it is gentle on my face.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like it because it has no parabens</li>
            <li>I use it each morning and my skin is much softer.</li>
            <li>Olay face cleaner is gentle but cleans my face well.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know of another product that&#x27;s readily available, priced low, and works as well.  </li>
            <li>I like it alot and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Cause it is much cheaper.</li>
            <li>Also added a daily light face lotion too.</li>
            <li>just doesn&#x27;t cost as much.</li>
            <li>after a month you others will really start to notice.</li>
            <li>I love this cream facial body scrub because it makes my face soft.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this, but it left my skin not feeling as clean as I am used to.  </li>
            <li>, it gets my face clean and moisturizes at the same time.  </li>
            <li>Fine microbeads exfoliate my skin without causing redness or dry spots.</li>
            <li>I used it twice a day at first, but found my skin was getting too sensitive.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using this product day and night it dose not leave my&lt;br /&gt;face ffeling dry</li>
            <li>Once a day works well for my older skin (64 years).</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I would jump from cleanser to cleanser - high end $$$ products to cheaper brands off the drug store shelf.  </li>
            <li>P.S. Arrived 2 days early!!</li>
            <li>Love this product and use it everyday.</li>
            <li>If you use it everyday, you may as well purchase more than one.</li>
            <li>This cleanser has little exfoliating beads in it, so my face felt very clean after using.</li>
            <li>I needed a new way to exfoliate, this was on sale</li>
            <li>I live in the dry Nevada high desert which is very drying on the skin, exfoliating is important to get the dry skin cells off.</li>
            <li>It makes my face not only feel clean but also leaves my skin feeling soft and not dry.</li>
            <li>Product exactly the same as in retail stores.  </li>
            <li>This cleanses well and my face just felt clean not extra dry.  </li>
            <li>I am 39 years old and have somewhat oily and sometimes acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin moist but not greasy and soft and plump.  </li>
            <li>it leaves my skin so young looking and youth.</li>
            <li>I used to be 42 years old.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin soft and not drying out, even during the winter.</li>
            <li>Wow is all I can say.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling soft.</li>
            <li>I am nearly 30 and still suffer from a lot of breakouts.</li>
            <li>but Amazon is the cheapest for this product by far.</li>
            <li>I really like this entire line of Olay products and still use them all.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and smooth after using it for a few times.</li>
            <li>Just enough exfoliation power without being harsh or overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful product you can&#x27;t go wrong with Olay products I use them everyday and</li>
            <li>My skin gets clean without feeling dried out.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected having used this product before.  </li>
            <li>Any cleanser can&#x27;t have much benefit since it doesn&#x27;t stay in skin contact for long enough to have a beneficial effect.</li>
            <li>It has lasted over four months so far and still one left.</li>
            <li>I use it daily and it has made my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>After I use it, I feel like I don&#x27;t need to add any daily moisturizer because it already leaves my skin soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Have tried many products over time... tired of those that &amp;#34;dissappear&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>My skin is dry, and this facial cleaner gently scrubs, and efficiently cleans.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t dry the skin and even though my skin is very sensitive</li>
            <li>so I need to be careful with new cleansers.  </li>
            <li>Anyhow, I cannot comment on it&#x27;s anti aging affects, because I have not been using it long enough and am still young.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive and very dry skin</li>
            <li>It has little beads that really exfoliates my T-zone, I now no longer have a T-zone so to speak.</li>
            <li>I wash my face due to the fact that my skin is very sensitive.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is the best facial cleanser for the money on the market.  </li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I am glad that my sister told me about this product.  </li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t realize this was more of an exfoliater.</li>
            <li> I love this product</li>
            <li> this cleanser clean my face without over drying it also leave my skin nice and  </li>
            <li> That said, by day four my skin was looking great, less oily, no pimples, bright and more even skin tone.  </li>
            <li> Makes my face so soft and it smells great.</li>
            <li> Most importantly, this cleanses your skin, minimizes pores and evens out your skin tone while exfoliating.</li>
            <li> I think this is just a great product for skin in general, no matter the type.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fine as a cream cleanser.</li>
            <li> It has a little exfoliation in it and that;s perfect to use every night.</li>
            <li> Olay Regenerist Advanced Anti-Aging Cleanser, 5 Ounce (Pack of 3)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> smooth</li>
            <li> Got this as a free sample when I purchased the Overnight cream.  </li>
            <li> Olay products are fantastic and this is one of them.</li>
            <li> I use a facial loofa with it and have had great results.</li>
            <li> because it is HypoAllergenic and basically scent free.</li>
            <li> My oily/dry skin as regulated and is now just comfortable.  </li>
            <li> months old and is still in good condition  (doesn&#x27;t need replacement&lt;br /&gt;per</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> This product makes my skin feel so smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li> I originally bought it because I know in your 20s that you are suppose to start a skin care regimen that includes some anti-aging aspects to combat stress and what not.</li>
            <li> The product gets my skin really clean</li>
            <li> However, I can say that it did not make my skin feel clean.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling really clean.</li>
            <li> My skin always feel refreshed and clean.  </li>
            <li> SUPER SMOOTH &amp; CREAMY does what its supposed to do</li>
            <li> so the creamy cleanser doesn&#x27;t make me too happy but for people who have dry skin this will protect and hydrate the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and it helps to keep my skin fresh and smooth, and free of breakouts.</li>
            <li> I am 21 and had developed a smile wrinkle that did not look good with or without makeup.</li>
            <li> Good cleaner that does not dry your face.  </li>
            <li> love this product, keeps my face clean without drying it out too much.</li>
            <li> It makes my face bright red after using it and I don&#x27;t like the feel.</li>
            <li> It is true.</li>
            <li> I use this product at night, and in the morning I use Olay&#x27;s Cream Cleansing wash for a more gentle effect with my Olay cleansing brush.</li>
            <li> and I was happy to find the multi-pack as I keep one at home and the other in my gym bag.</li>
            <li> The first one I used was fine.</li>
            <li> Shipment was quick also.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is refreshing and gentle, with the right amount of exfoliating beads.  </li>
            <li> Just the right amount of &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34; to clean your face well without damaging skin.  </li>
            <li> this seems to work better for my normal skin type then the Aveeno soy.</li>
            <li> This product is good if u have dry skin .  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It did take a little longer to get to my house, but getting the 3 bottles at once is great,</li>
            <li> really works for those fine wrinkles or laugh lines.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find it has these teeny tiny fine exfoliating particles which feel so good as I massage the cleanser on my face.</li>
            <li> I WOULD HAVE LIKED A DIFFERENT AROMA AND THE FEELING</li>
            <li> but I love it so far.</li>
            <li> It is a nice price and something I use daily in the shower.</li>
            <li> The Amazon shopping is far more convenient.</li>
            <li> I had switched to a brand for sensitive skin, but I felt like I needed more make up.</li>
            <li> In just two weeks my skin tone is better and I&#x27;m back to concealer and a light powder.</li>
            <li> I use it right before exiting the shower after my face has sucked in that hot steam and rinse it off with cool water (to close pores)</li>
            <li> I had gotten a sample tube of this with another Olay product and this worked wonders on my skin clearing up my pimples right away.</li>
            <li> but it clean very well</li>
            <li> It invigorates you skin and leaves it super soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> of caution: be care of some of the sellers selling this, I order a 3 pack, and only got one, but thanks to Amazon Amazing Customer service, I was refunded my money after the seller promised to fix it and then refused to follow up on it.</li>
            <li> I decided to give it a try because of the great reviews and because I have a terribly hard time finding a cleanser that works well for my skin.  </li>
            <li> it cleans and leaves her skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I am glad I only bough one and did not order a case</li>
            <li> I still won&#x27;t order again just because it&#x27;s my personal preference, but I like most of Olay products.</li>
            <li> Really refreshing and feels reminiscent of my Estee Lauder So Polished Exfoliating Scrub.</li>
            <li> Exactly as shown.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite and only face wash now.</li>
            <li> I use only Olay Regenerist Products and love all of them.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference with the way my skin looks and feels the first week.</li>
            <li> Skin feels soft and smooth after using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already use the first  pack</li>
            <li> It took me almost 2 month to finish the first pack i used it morning and evening .</li>
            <li> I have recently switched from Neutrogena to Olay and Olay seems to be doing a much better job.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Unlike other products I&#x27;ve used, this cleans off my face nicely without feeling like I&#x27;m cleaning a bunch of sand off my face.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use every day, but several times per week to help keep my skin fresh and smooth.</li>
            <li> I love that it exfoliates yet leaves my skin soft and not tight feeling.</li>
            <li> This product shipped fast and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Amazon shipped it pretty fast</li>
            <li> It washes away my makeup quickly, and leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is fantastic, it does not dry out my skin</li>
            <li> Pure perfection.</li>
            <li> Fresh, supple, and clear!  </li>
            <li> One shopping trip led me to this particular Olay product and it has been three years of consistent use ever since.  </li>
            <li> I have ordered the Olay Regenerist Advanced Anti-Aging Cleanser several times.  </li>
            <li> it looks like I might (not so much since using this daily).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I broke out a lot in the very beginning and my skin seemed very oily because this has moisturizer in it.  </li>
            <li> I really like Olay Regenerist  and</li>
            <li> So it is gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> and it is gentle on my face.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like it because it has no parabens</li>
            <li> I use it each morning and my skin is much softer.</li>
            <li> Olay face cleaner is gentle but cleans my face well.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know of another product that&#x27;s readily available, priced low, and works as well.  </li>
            <li> I like it alot and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Cause it is much cheaper.</li>
            <li> Also added a daily light face lotion too.</li>
            <li> just doesn&#x27;t cost as much.</li>
            <li> after a month you others will really start to notice.</li>
            <li> I love this cream facial body scrub because it makes my face soft.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this, but it left my skin not feeling as clean as I am used to.  </li>
            <li> , it gets my face clean and moisturizes at the same time.  </li>
            <li> Fine microbeads exfoliate my skin without causing redness or dry spots.</li>
            <li> I used it twice a day at first, but found my skin was getting too sensitive.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this product day and night it dose not leave my&lt;br /&gt;face ffeling dry</li>
            <li> Once a day works well for my older skin (64 years).</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I would jump from cleanser to cleanser - high end $$$ products to cheaper brands off the drug store shelf.  </li>
            <li> P.S. Arrived 2 days early!!</li>
            <li> Love this product and use it everyday.</li>
            <li> If you use it everyday, you may as well purchase more than one.</li>
            <li> This cleanser has little exfoliating beads in it, so my face felt very clean after using.</li>
            <li> I needed a new way to exfoliate, this was on sale</li>
            <li> I live in the dry Nevada high desert which is very drying on the skin, exfoliating is important to get the dry skin cells off.</li>
            <li> It makes my face not only feel clean but also leaves my skin feeling soft and not dry.</li>
            <li> Product exactly the same as in retail stores.  </li>
            <li> This cleanses well and my face just felt clean not extra dry.  </li>
            <li> I am 39 years old and have somewhat oily and sometimes acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin moist but not greasy and soft and plump.  </li>
            <li> it leaves my skin so young looking and youth.</li>
            <li> I used to be 42 years old.</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin soft and not drying out, even during the winter.</li>
            <li> Wow is all I can say.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling soft.</li>
            <li> I am nearly 30 and still suffer from a lot of breakouts.</li>
            <li> but Amazon is the cheapest for this product by far.</li>
            <li> I really like this entire line of Olay products and still use them all.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and smooth after using it for a few times.</li>
            <li> Just enough exfoliation power without being harsh or overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> Wonderful product you can&#x27;t go wrong with Olay products I use them everyday and</li>
            <li> My skin gets clean without feeling dried out.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected having used this product before.  </li>
            <li> Any cleanser can&#x27;t have much benefit since it doesn&#x27;t stay in skin contact for long enough to have a beneficial effect.</li>
            <li> It has lasted over four months so far and still one left.</li>
            <li> I use it daily and it has made my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> After I use it, I feel like I don&#x27;t need to add any daily moisturizer because it already leaves my skin soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Have tried many products over time... tired of those that &amp;#34;dissappear&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> My skin is dry, and this facial cleaner gently scrubs, and efficiently cleans.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t dry the skin and even though my skin is very sensitive</li>
            <li> so I need to be careful with new cleansers.  </li>
            <li> Anyhow, I cannot comment on it&#x27;s anti aging affects, because I have not been using it long enough and am still young.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive and very dry skin</li>
            <li> It has little beads that really exfoliates my T-zone, I now no longer have a T-zone so to speak.</li>
            <li> I wash my face due to the fact that my skin is very sensitive.  </li>
            <li> and I wanted a cleanser that does not dry out skin and prevents signs of aging (I like the way I currently look and want to stay this way as long as possible).</li>
            <li> I am diabetic and have extreme adult acne and have purchased tons of products only to discover</li>
            <li> My face doesn&#x27;t feel refreshed or clean after washing since a creamy residue is left behind.</li>
            <li> I use a simple, everyday use exfoliate and then this and my skin feels so soft after a shower.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to use it at first since I am young, but I realized it works for my oily skin.</li>
            <li> Keeps minor acne and wrinkles away.</li>
            <li> so I put off using it for a long time.</li>
            <li> Not too rough on my skin, but exfoliating enough.  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t have to wait long between ordering and delivery.</li>
            <li> I am mixed (black and white) and it makes my skin glow.</li>
            <li> normal/normal dry skin types:</li>
            <li> I tend to have dry skin that flakes peels and breaks out.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t feel dry.</li>
            <li> My skin was always too dry, too oily...</li>
            <li> It is less to buy from Amazon and get the 3-pack than go to the local store and purchase singlely.</li>
            <li> so it seems I have to rub on a little longer to get the same effect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very oily</li>
            <li> and if I use any sort of facial cleaner I break out.... that was until a few months ago.  </li>
            <li> I realized that after going through a few bottles only when I got a toner sample to use on my &amp;#34;cleaned&amp;#34; face.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and purchase it via Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe and Save program and purchase it for much less than in my local stores.</li>
            <li> I HAD OTHER EXPECTATIONS ON BEHALF OF THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> It has small granules in it that gives your skin an overall cleansed feeling after use without being abrasive.  </li>
            <li> Erases dark spots.</li>
            <li> I paid way less than $15 ea for this, in a pack of 3 maybe and on sale at Costco.</li>
            <li> I did notice a couple of tubes ago that they changed the formula and put in less exfoliating granules</li>
            <li> Less whiteheads.</li>
            <li> I have slightly oily skin</li>
            <li> The Aveeno made my skin feel really tight</li>
            <li> I have a little acne  on my forehead and little bit oily face .  </li>
            <li> I do feel that my nose feels a little greasy after cleansing and need to repeat, but otherwise I like this product.</li>
            <li> but I can feel the little particles in it that serve to exfoliate.  </li>
            <li> It scratched and irritated my skin, and be careful about getting those microscopic scrubbing particles in your eyes, because it hurts and is hard to rinse them out.</li>
            <li> I wanted to start with that because I think I do not fit the bio for who one would think might use this cleanser.  </li>
            <li> Not too harsh.  </li>
            <li> there is a reason there are few to none on the store shelves.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as heavy as I was expecting.</li>
            <li> This is my everyday face cleanser</li>
            <li> Not your typical cream cleanser!</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure how this would work on oily skin</li>
            <li> My skin has cleared up and my battles and frustrations are no more.  </li>
            <li> I bought this and the lotion and boom, no more wrinkle.</li>
            <li> I fought acne into my late 20&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it prevents it from getting worse.</li>
            <li> Non irritating</li>
            <li> I ordered the wrong thing but am using it anyway</li>
            <li> Maybe I read the description wrong</li>
            <li> The smell is so bad I cannot use them.</li>
            <li> Also the exfoliating scrub in it is terrible.</li>
            <li> I grew up with horrible skin.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I have ordered the Olay Regenerist Advanced Anti-Aging Cleanser several times.  I find it makes your skin look and feel much fresher and more attractive  than before.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Olay Regenerist Advanced Anti-Aging Cleanser, 5 Ounce (Pack of 3)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product, keeps my face clean without drying it out too much. I used it daily and only used my proactive when I break out or it looks like I might (not so much since using this daily).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Word of caution: be care of some of the sellers selling this, I order a 3 pack, and only got one, but thanks to Amazon Amazing Customer service, I was refunded my money after the seller promised to fix it and then refused to follow up on it.</li>
            <li> I am 39 years old and have somewhat oily and sometimes acne prone skin.  I wanted to start with that because I think I do not fit the bio for who one would think might use this cleanser.  I decided to give it a try because of the great reviews and because I have a terribly hard time finding a cleanser that works well for my skin.  This one works great!  It did take a couple days for my face to get used to it.  I broke out a lot in the very beginning and my skin seemed very oily because this has moisturizer in it.  That said, by day four my skin was looking great, less oily, no pimples, bright and more even skin tone.  I think this is just a great product for skin in general, no matter the type.  I have never tried Olay products before but I&#x27;m now a big fan!</li>
            <li> I really like Olay Regenerist  and this cleanser is excellent.</li>
            <li> I like this product. My skin gets clean without feeling dried out. Yet, I don&#x27;t see that it is helping with face concerns, like wrinkles, texture, dullness, etc. I have been using it for a year and as best as I can tell my skin looks the same. Maybe it prevents it from getting worse.</li>
            <li> great cleanser and gently exfoliator , I havent had a breakout since I started using it . It leaves my skin smooth and clean. I love it</li>
            <li> Not too harsh.  Keeps minor acne and wrinkles away.</li>
            <li> Good product and seller!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for several years.  When I try something else, I always come back to this scrub.  It leaves my skin moist but not greasy and soft and plump.  I would recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser. It feels great on my face and does a great job, leaving my face feeling soft.</li>
            <li> top quality ingredients for drug store price. there is a reason there are few to none on the store shelves. save time and money buying online. normal/normal dry skin types: cream cleansers are more beneficial than ones that bubble/are foamy</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t order two  set of 3 at a time - maybe it shows two orders for prior order as well as current</li>
            <li> This cleanser is the best I&#x27;ve found for my face.  My skin is dry, and this facial cleaner gently scrubs, and efficiently cleans. It washes away my makeup quickly, and leaves my skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> My mother was an oil of olay user until she passed at 87. I followrd in her footsteps.  I use this daily and now so does my youngest daughter. I would highly recommend.  I also use their bath products.</li>
            <li> This cream is perfect, buy it for my wife and she loves, has changed the texture of the skin and is more rejuvenated, I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Just the right amount of &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34; to clean your face well without damaging skin.  Twice a day is perfect.</li>
            <li> This cleanser has little exfoliating beads in it, so my face felt very clean after using. I used it twice a day at first, but found my skin was getting too sensitive. Once a day works well for my older skin (64 years). I&#x27;m using this along with the Regenerating Lotion with sunscreen. I like both products a lot.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive and very dry skin so I need to be careful with new cleansers.  This cleanses well and my face just felt clean not extra dry.  So it is gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this cream cleanser.  Very good product.  Any Matador will appreciate the beautiful complection you will display by using this product.  Olay!</li>
            <li> I would definitely use this seller again.  The price was good and being able to purchase this cleanser in a pack of three keeps me stocked up.  The product gets my skin really clean and it is gentle on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for 5+ years. Absolutely love it! I use it along with [[ASIN:B0000CC64W Olay Regenerist Advanced Anti-Aging Regenerating Serum Moisturizer Fragrance-Free 1.7oz]] and it keeps my skin perfectly balanced.</li>
            <li> The only face wash I use and have for over 10 years ad I am in my 60s. I love that it exfoliates yet leaves my skin soft and not tight feeling.</li>
            <li> My wife received this as a gift with a cordless face brush and loves how&lt;br /&gt;well it cleans and leaves her skin soft and smooth.  The brush is now&lt;br /&gt;3 months old and is still in good condition  (doesn&#x27;t need replacement&lt;br /&gt;per mfg&#x27;s suggested 3 month replacement time frame).</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this, but it left my skin not feeling as clean as I am used to.  I think the cream element must still remain.  Since I use a separate moisturizer, I don&#x27;t like my cleanser having moisturizer in it.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like it because it has no parabens and I wanted a cleanser that does not dry out skin and prevents signs of aging (I like the way I currently look and want to stay this way as long as possible). Anyhow, I cannot comment on it&#x27;s anti aging affects, because I have not been using it long enough and am still young. However, I can say that it did not make my skin feel clean. After using it, I still felt like there was an oily film on my face. Also the exfoliating scrub in it is terrible. It scratched and irritated my skin, and be careful about getting those microscopic scrubbing particles in your eyes, because it hurts and is hard to rinse them out. I am glad I only bough one and did not order a case or I would be suck with a lot</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for about a year now, I have combination skin with some dryness in my T-zone area. I&#x27;m not very oily so I&#x27;m not sure how this would work on oily skin but I personally love it. I use it right before exiting the shower after my face has sucked in that hot steam and rinse it off with cool water (to close pores) It&#x27;s definitely helped with my breakouts.</li>
            <li> I am a olay loyal customer and this product is great it leaves my skin so young looking and youth. I like keep buying this products because I love olay products</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase. Leaves my face feeling really clean. Will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I ordered the wrong thing but am using it anyway and it&#x27;s fine as a cream cleanser. It&#x27;s not as heavy as I was expecting. I still won&#x27;t order again just because it&#x27;s my personal preference, but I like most of Olay products.</li>
            <li> This is the best cream cleanser I&#x27;ve ever tried. Admittedly, I mistakenly got this thinking it was a foaming cleanser so I put off using it for a long time. I was surprised to find it has these teeny tiny fine exfoliating particles which feel so good as I massage the cleanser on my face. Really refreshing and feels reminiscent of my Estee Lauder So Polished Exfoliating Scrub. I paid way less than $15 ea for this, in a pack of 3 maybe and on sale at Costco. Not your typical cream cleanser!</li>
            <li> I love oil of olay products this cleanser clean my face without over drying it also leave my skin nice and  smooth I recommend great cleanser!!</li>
            <li> Started using this product about a year ago and love it.  I don&#x27;t use every day, but several times per week to help keep my skin fresh and smooth.</li>
            <li> Product came in a 3-Pack. The first one I used was fine. The second and third smell like they are expired. The smell is so bad I cannot use them.</li>
            <li> Got this as a free sample when I purchased the Overnight cream.  I used it for a month and I love it.  I use it each morning and my skin is much softer.</li>
            <li> Exactly as shown. No problems.</li>
            <li> Too creamy for me. My face doesn&#x27;t feel refreshed or clean after washing since a creamy residue is left behind.</li>
            <li> I used to be 42 years old. I used this for 3 days in a row and woke up the following morning and looked and felt like I was 25 years old.&lt;br /&gt;I checked in the mirror and could not believe my eyes even the birth date on my drivers license mysteriously changed 1988.&lt;br /&gt; It does leave your skin smoother and feeling good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful, creamy cleanser with a lovely, mild scent. Does not clog pores.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected having used this product before.  Not too rough on my skin, but exfoliating enough.  I like getting three at a time so I don&#x27;t have to think about buying it again for awhile!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite and only face wash now. It keeps my skin soft and not drying out, even during the winter. I bought the 3 pack---use it morning and evening. It has lasted over four months so far and still one left.</li>
            <li> This is my everyday face cleanser and I was happy to find the multi-pack as I keep one at home and the other in my gym bag. I&#x27;ve used this for years and like the exfoliating feature. I did notice a couple of tubes ago that they changed the formula and put in less exfoliating granules so it seems I have to rub on a little longer to get the same effect. I live in the dry Nevada high desert which is very drying on the skin, exfoliating is important to get the dry skin cells off. I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I have been blessed with great skin.  Never have to wash it and if I use any sort of facial cleaner I break out.... that was until a few months ago.  I had pimples all over and no end in sight.  I had gotten a sample tube of this with another Olay product and this worked wonders on my skin clearing up my pimples right away. I use it every day and the texture of my skin is improving.  I also use the regenerist lotions.</li>
            <li> I needed a new way to exfoliate, this was on sale so i figured I&#x27;d try it. One use and I was sold! This stuff makes my face look and feel wonderful. I received a compliment after only one day of using it. Wow is all I can say. I tend to have dry skin that flakes peels and breaks out. With this product none of that happens anymore. I can&#x27;t praise this product enough!</li>
            <li> Good cleaner that does not dry your face.  I actually mix it with a more expensive cleanser but use it alone also.</li>
            <li> This is a great cleanser and I love using it! Olay products are fantastic and this is one of them.</li>
            <li> My skin looks so much better since I started using this cleanser!  I will not use anything else on my skin.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this product day and night it dose not leave my&lt;br /&gt;face ffeling dry but it clean very well I recommend</li>
            <li> I HAD OTHER EXPECTATIONS ON BEHALF OF THIS PRODUCT. I WOULD HAVE LIKED A DIFFERENT AROMA AND THE FEELING WHEN YOU APPLY TO YOUR FACE IS VERY LIGHT, HENCE I USE MORE PRODUCT FOR IT TO FEEL WORKING ON MY SKIN.</li>
            <li> Olay face cleaner is gentle but cleans my face well.  I don&#x27;t know of another product that&#x27;s readily available, priced low, and works as well.  Shipment was quick also.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and smooth after using it for a few times.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is a great product. It makes my face not only feel clean but also leaves my skin feeling soft and not dry. However, I am going to purchase another cleanser to use with this product, since I do not always like the feeling of the micro particles each time I wash my face due to the fact that my skin is very sensitive.  I will probably make this my night time cleanser to remove all dirt and make-up from the day.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 5 years.  I highly recommend it.  Amazon has a great price on it and if you utilize their \\&quot;Subscribe and Save\\&quot; it make the price even better!  I love the derma bead formula in this product.  It invigorates you skin and leaves it super soft and smooth. P.S. Arrived 2 days early!! Amazon, you&#x27;re amazing!!</li>
            <li> I have been use this for the last 5 years. I like it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Just enough exfoliation power without being harsh or overwhelming.  Very smooth and creamy.  Feels nice on my skin.</li>
            <li> I love it. Makes my face so soft and it smells great. Just started using it, so don&#x27;t know how well it will work for me,  but I love it so far.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my Dermatologist- I use only Olay Regenerist Products and love all of them. I&#x27;ve been using them for 2 years now.</li>
            <li> Have tried many products over time... tired of those that &amp;#34;dissappear&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;get changed&amp;#34; after getting used to using them so finally decided to switch to several Olay products. Satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> Love what it does for my skin. It looks and feels softer to the touch. Almost sun-kissed in appearance and radiance.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser. Fine microbeads exfoliate my skin without causing redness or dry spots. I use it twice a week and age spots have faded. Less whiteheads.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite cream cleanser, and favorite face wash, aside from the regenerist foaming face wash. It leaves my face feeling soft. I use a facial loofa with it and have had great results.</li>
            <li> Pure perfection. Erases dark spots. My skin feels softer and it evens out my complexion . I noticed a difference with the way my skin looks and feels the first week.</li>
            <li> I am nearly 30 and still suffer from a lot of breakouts. This cleanser is the best I have tried and I have tried many many many. Most importantly, this cleanses your skin, minimizes pores and evens out your skin tone while exfoliating. I am mixed (black and white) and it makes my skin glow.</li>
            <li> Product did a nice job removing make-up from my face.  Skin feels soft and smooth after using it. Didn&#x27;t feel dry.</li>
            <li> this seems to work better for my normal skin type then the Aveeno soy. The Aveeno made my skin feel really tight and I had to get moisturizer on ASAP. This does not do that to me. It is a nice price and something I use daily in the shower. I have not had any breakouts or issues.</li>
            <li> I am still using my Oil of Olay scrub so I haven&#x27;t used this yet. I hope it is all that has been advertised.</li>
            <li> This product is the greatest cleanser. It has little beads that really exfoliates my T-zone, I now no longer have a T-zone so to speak. I use it daily and it has made my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> I realized that after going through a few bottles only when I got a toner sample to use on my &amp;#34;cleaned&amp;#34; face. Make up residue!</li>
            <li> I like it alot and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Excellent experience!  I highly recommend! Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d read several reviews of this skin cleansers effectiveness and I agree.  It has small granules in it that gives your skin an overall cleansed feeling after use without being abrasive.  I use it everyday and purchase it via Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe and Save program and purchase it for much less than in my local stores.</li>
            <li> I ordered the 3 pk. Cause it is much cheaper. I&#x27;ve already use the first  pack and i just opened my second one today . It took me almost 2 month to finish the first pack i used it morning and evening . This product is good if u have dry skin .  It just basically cleanse ur face but the anti aging effect i don&#x27;t see any difference .  I have a little acne  on my forehead and little bit oily face .  Olay pro -x isworking for me better than this one .</li>
            <li> I love this cream facial body scrub because it makes my face soft. After I use it, I feel like I don&#x27;t need to add any daily moisturizer because it already leaves my skin soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> It is true. I use this product nearly constantly because it works (for me)! I am diabetic and have extreme adult acne and have purchased tons of products only to discover somehow somewhere I was allergic to them or that they didn&#x27;t work! This Product OLAY REGENEREST CREAM CLEANSER WORKS (4 Me!) because it is HypoAllergenic and basically scent free. I also use the night cream or moisturizing cream after using the cleanser because the duo work better as a team!</li>
            <li> Nice product....easy to apply and rinse off with no annoying odors to trigger allergies. I would recommend it for anyone with fragile skin.</li>
            <li> I use this every night and I love it. It has a little exfoliation in it and that;s perfect to use every night. Non irritating</li>
            <li> It does wonders for my skin! I was skeptical to use it at first since I am young, but I realized it works for my oily skin. The granules in the cleanser really work to exfoliate and slough away dead skin cells. The more that I use it, I am able to notice a difference. I use this product at night, and in the morning I use Olay&#x27;s Cream Cleansing wash for a more gentle effect with my Olay cleansing brush. I have recently switched from Neutrogena to Olay and Olay seems to be doing a much better job.</li>
            <li> Love this product and use it everyday. It is less to buy from Amazon and get the 3-pack than go to the local store and purchase singlely. If you use it everyday, you may as well purchase more than one. It is a good cleanser!</li>
            <li> I grew up with horrible skin.  I fought acne into my late 20&#x27;s.  I would jump from cleanser to cleanser - high end $$$ products to cheaper brands off the drug store shelf.  Nothing seemed to work.  My skin was always too dry, too oily... it was a nightmare.  One shopping trip led me to this particular Olay product and it has been three years of consistent use ever since.  My skin always feel refreshed and clean.  My oily/dry skin as regulated and is now just comfortable.  My skin has cleared up and my battles and frustrations are no more.  I use the Anti-Aging Cleanser in conjunction with the Thermal Mini-Peel and alternate between the Total Effects and Definity moisturizers.  I love the way my face feels when I head out to face the day now.  Fresh, supple, and clear!  I am an Olay fan for life.</li>
            <li> Love this face cleanser!  My neighbor, who sells Mary Kay, asked me what I use on my face because it looks so good.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t dry the skin and even though my skin is very sensitive and I have many allergies I use it twice a day.</li>
            <li> In a drug store they would have charged this amount for just one tube, but I received three so I think it is an awesome deal.  To me, the product works a lot better at cleansing my face than Mary Kay 3-in-1 cleanser.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years and this is a great deal I found here on Amazon. A friend of mine went to the dermatologist recently and he recommended this same product. Glad to know he&#x27;s promoting a product I&#x27;ve been using and satisfied with for years</li>
            <li> This is the best facial cleanser for the money on the market.  This cleanser is refreshing and gentle, with the right amount of exfoliating beads.  This product shipped fast and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I have the dryest skin possible and would have issues with face cleansers making my skin even dryer. My skin would then freak out and create patches of oil and then break out. This cleanser is fantastic, it does not dry out my skin and i no longer get the patches of break outs. This cleanser is more expensive then i would like to pay but Amazon is the cheapest for this product by far.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Product exactly the same as in retail stores.  The Amazon shopping is far more convenient.</li>
            <li> I had switched to a brand for sensitive skin, but I felt like I needed more make up. In just two weeks my skin tone is better and I&#x27;m back to concealer and a light powder. I do feel that my nose feels a little greasy after cleansing and need to repeat, but otherwise I like this product. Also added a daily light face lotion too.</li>
            <li> SUPER SMOOTH &amp; CREAMY does what its supposed to do I like it a lot. I wish it had exfoliating beads in too</li>
            <li> This product makes my skin feel so smooth and clean.  I am glad that my sister told me about this product.  Amazon shipped it pretty fast and I didn&#x27;t have to wait long between ordering and delivery.</li>
            <li> This in an incredible product, keeps your face very clean and smooth, I have normal to oil type skin and works more than well!! Convine with Olay brushes!</li>
            <li> I really like this entire line of Olay products and still use them all.  This cleanser is creamy but I can feel the little particles in it that serve to exfoliate.  Unlike other products I&#x27;ve used, this cleans off my face nicely without feeling like I&#x27;m cleaning a bunch of sand off my face.</li>
            <li> So the review of this cleanser depends on what you are looking for. I have slightly oily skin so the creamy cleanser doesn&#x27;t make me too happy but for people who have dry skin this will protect and hydrate the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be too impressed with the anti aging properties. Any cleanser can&#x27;t have much benefit since it doesn&#x27;t stay in skin contact for long enough to have a beneficial effect.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product you can&#x27;t go wrong with Olay products I use them everyday and my skin looks great I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and it helps to keep my skin fresh and smooth, and free of breakouts.</li>
            <li> Along with this, I use the Pro-X Age Repair Lotion with sunscreen. I originally bought it because I know in your 20s that you are suppose to start a skin care regimen that includes some anti-aging aspects to combat stress and what not. I am 21 and had developed a smile wrinkle that did not look good with or without makeup. I bought this and the lotion and boom, no more wrinkle. I use a simple, everyday use exfoliate and then this and my skin feels so soft after a shower. I bought 3 and haven&#x27;t even gotten to the second one yet and it has been almost 2 months I believe since I&#x27;ve purchased the stuff.</li>
            <li> It cleanses my face good without drying it out. It is as good as Mary Kay&#x27;s Timewise Cleanser--just doesn&#x27;t cost as much.</li>
            <li> Maybe I read the description wrong but I didn&#x27;t realize this was more of an exfoliater. I thought it was just a cream cleanser. It makes my face bright red after using it and I don&#x27;t like the feel.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I am in my 50&#x27;s, but from looking at my face you could never tell.  I love this product, it gets my face clean and moisturizes at the same time.  It is the best product I have found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did take a little longer to get to my house, but getting the 3 bottles at once is great,</li>
            <li> really works for those fine wrinkles or laugh lines. you will start to notice the difference after one use. after a month you others will really start to notice.</li>
