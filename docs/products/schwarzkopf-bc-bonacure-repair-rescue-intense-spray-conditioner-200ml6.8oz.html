            <li> BEST BEST BEST hair stuff ever. i use this daily and love it. it smells awful, but works so well i don&#x27;t care</li>
            <li> This product is magic! I applied it right before flat ironing and the result was smooth &amp; silky no dryness or flyaways.</li>
            <li> My hair is damaged from dying it to much and i started using this product, it left my hair soft and shiny. It smells great also</li>
            <li> Being familiar with this German brand I expected it to do more than it actually does. It does not seem to do my hair much good in terms of manageability or shine.</li>
            <li> Love Love this stuff! I used to use the same product in the blue bottle until the company changed the formula and made it smell like perfume. It was aweful. I saw this and decided it was worth a try and I made the right decision. This works great for my thin hair. It moisturizes so you can get a comb through your hair, but does not leave it heavy or oily at all! It smells great and I hope the company does not ruin this one like they did their blue product. I stock up for this reason. It seems that when I fiind something I like, the formula changes or it gets discontinued! Buy it now!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t moisturize as well as the blue version.</li>
            <li> Excellent - Item delivered on time, was as described, great customer service</li>
            <li> It smells like alcohol and doesn&#x27;t condition. Bad product bit I bet if aI were to purchase it from a salon, it would be a good product. I would like my money back</li>
            <li> Hair dresser recommended and it does help condition my frizz!  It smells great which is a bonus!  I have thick, frizzy hair and live in the humidity of Florida.  So with color in my hair and humidity anything that helps fight the frizz is my friend! I use this product on my wet hair and to just touch up the ends!</li>
            <li> I got mine earlier than expected&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair crunchy like other people have mentioned (so far)&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like the hairspray smell tho&lt;br /&gt;So far so good tho.</li>

            <li> Excellent leave in conditoner, no heavy residue only product I&#x27;ve used for years. My hair is difficult to comb out after shampoo &amp; conditioning. This is the only product I have found that works. Excellant service, delivered much sooner than expected, best price also!</li>
            <li> Too much alcohol on this product. I have coarse relaxed hair and the alcohol  on this product is too strong.</li>
            <li> Feels more like hairspray than conditioner.  Fast shipping was good. I wasn&#x27;t sure if I could return or not...but I want to.</li>
            <li> My favorite product ever! Love the scent !!</li>
            <li> Love the Bonacure line but this one was not a winner :-( Stick with the Colored Ends!!!</li>
            <li> I had a hairdresser reccomend me this and bought it thinking it might make a difference. I also changed out shampoos and was trying a new hair oil and when it ran out decided that my hair was in good shape and to not buy a new one. However my hair is definitely more brittle and dry compared to how nice it was when i used this product. Can&#x27;t wait to get it and make sure my hair gets back to healthy and happy! I have heard nothing but good things about bonacure in general and also plan on purchasing their other products soon.</li>
            <li> Keeps my static hair in place, love it! It&#x27;s light enough not to flatten my very fine hair.</li>
            <li> On my 2nd bottle now and it doesn&#x27;t seem to moisturize my hair well. Being a hair repairing leave-in conditioner, it doesn&#x27;t really do its job well. I would try other conditioners from this brand.</li>
            <li> makes my hair stiff.  was hoping for a softening of some sort</li>
            <li> Great product very happy good smell. Thank you</li>

            <li> I feel that this spray is as effective as the [[ASIN:B00014J0T2 Bach Rescue Remedy Spray 20 ml]]. It does wonder for hair. As far as I can tell, there are no major effects to the spray. It really is an amazing spray for hair. Highly recommend giving it a try.</li>

            <li> this is the kind of product you need when time is short and your hair i not cooperating. I recommend this seller and this product.</li>
            <li> Everybody has to use products that suit their individual needs. My hair is fine, yet thick, and color treated. This product makes my hair shiny and healthy looking, and reduces frizzies. Great little discovery!</li>
            <li> This stuff is phenomenal! It truly works miracles. My hair was so dry and damaged from bleaching and this spray but life back into it almost immediately!</li>
