            <li> Holds charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> ,I hope the water won&#x27;t damaged it in the long run.</li>
            <li> Of course it was on low, I even tried to put less water in, but still didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> but I can deal with it for a few minutes long enough to use the machine.</li>
            <li> I also found that this flosser, since it is cordless, has a lesser chance of making a mess if I used it during showering.  </li>
            <li> Could be a little easier to fill with water but not a big issue.</li>
            <li> So be careful not to get then wet</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that the water tank is not big enough and I usually have to refill 1 or 2 times to finish my dental flossing.  </li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s just due to not taking care of my teeth the correct way.</li>
            <li> I tend to notice the battery needs a charge when the motor slows down to a point that I can tell it isn’t</li>
            <li> It usually gets wet everytime</li>
            <li> With some practice though, it can be less messy to use.  </li>
            <li> The machine is a little louder than I would like</li>
            <li> The irrigator charges in a few hours</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money or time on this product!</li>
            <li> The hole is too small</li>
            <li> Poor quality!</li>
            <li> Having some experience with using a flosser, I recommend not using really cold water unless you want to be woken up.</li>
            <li> They are very expensive in the stores.</li>
            <li> Not to bad to fill water chamber.</li>
            <li> It will charge it for a moment, and than when you get it to squirt water, the manual feature was really painful.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Great price. Easy to use and does not take up a lot of space in bathroom. Holds charge for a long time. Could be a little easier to fill with water but not a big issue.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to my brother and I sent it to Colombia. He told me it is wonderful for cleaning his teeth. He is very pleased with that. Said that since he is using it, feel more clean and fresh his mouth, and has not more pain for his prosthesis.</li>
            <li> Was a replacement for a Sonicare product that was almost identical, it&#x27;s OK and does the job. price is right is the main thing.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money or time on this product! The set up is fairly easy, which is great; HOWEVER!!!! the product just shoot water all over you and everything else. Of course it was on low, I even tried to put less water in, but still didn&#x27;t work. The only thing it was good for was, spraying water on the mirror and given your face a nice shower! Please fight the urge of getting this one because of the pricr, and find a better product!</li>
            <li> The water flosser works well but I do wish the reservoir was a bit larger.</li>
            <li> Better than anticipated.</li>
            <li> my dentist have been telling me for a while to purchase one of these. They are very expensive in the stores. Glad I checked amazon. Loving it so far, a little hard on my gums but that&#x27;s just due to not taking care of my teeth the correct way.</li>
            <li> So far it works fine.I only wish the reservoid was easier to fill up.The hole is too small so you will waist a lot of water until you mastered the right way to do it,but when I&#x27;m in a rush I avoid to use it.The charger part doesn&#x27;t have a cover when you take the cord out after is charged.It usually gets wet everytime I filled it up,I hope the water won&#x27;t damaged it in the long run.</li>
            <li> So easy to use, great quality.  Thank you</li>
            <li> its pretty good I wish the water tank was a little bigger since it takes 3 times to get a good irrigation</li>
            <li> Has variable settings.  The &#x27;soft&#x27; one is about what Waterpik has and the highest one has more pressure.  Relatively easy to fill.</li>
            <li> Great product good quality.  Only complaint is that the water tank is not big enough and I usually have to refill 1 or 2 times to finish my dental flossing.  But it is portable, so I guess the water tank can&#x27;t be bigger.  Overall, I recommended it</li>
            <li> Perfect amount of power. Good battery life. Not to bad to fill water chamber. ONLY issue so far, is that it DOESN&#x27;T come with a rubber plug to cover charger pins as stated. So be careful not to get then wet or I assume the unit would short circuit. Bit other than that, it&#x27;s an excellent buy for the money</li>
            <li> The unit I received would never charge.  Blue blinking light for over 30 hours plugged in.  Returned to Amazon.</li>
            <li> Mine wont stay charged. The unit will sit there with the blinking light forever, and not actually charge. It will charge it for a moment, and than when you get it to squirt water, the manual feature was really painful. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sample provided</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:78a3b9fa63ae6c05c26aea6b1811ebdd]]This is a good quality oral irrigator. There are a total of 3 operating modes and two color coded, interchangeable tips are included for multiple users that comes with the machine. The machine is a little louder than I would like but I can deal with it for a few minutes long enough to use the machine. The tank is just the right size for a couple of uses. I add just enough water to use one time. We have well water and I don&#x27;t want the rust to ruin the machine. I do like the results of the machine. I would recommend this Oral Irrigator. Sample provided without obligation.</li>
            <li> Good water flosser! I will buy again!  Yes I valued customer will definitely buy it again. Greenco Professional Rechargeable oral flosser is the only one so far that I have purchased from them all, Greenco is the number one best product on the market to use.  I will definitely tell others about Greenco  Professional Rechargeable Oral Flosser.    Thanks Seller God Blessed Always!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, just as described, fast shipping</li>
            <li> 2nd one purchased an they both do not hold a charge.</li>
            <li> LOve this works great</li>
            <li> Included with the flosser are the instructions, power adaptor and cable, 2 flossing heads (with different colors for two users) and the water tank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This flosser is similar in design to my old flosser and appears to be solid quality and made well.  Having some experience with using a flosser, I recommend not using really cold water unless you want to be woken up. I also found that this flosser, since it is cordless, has a lesser chance of making a mess if I used it during showering.  The water in the shower has not affected it.  It can be used in the sink area but with the fast squirting water it can get messy.  With some practice though, it can be less messy to use.  The reservoir is large enough to hold plenty of water for several passes over my teeth.  It can be filled either with the flip open top or the blue container removed and fill.  To me, it is easier to fill the container off of the irrigator.  The irrigator charges in a few hours but you get about 2 to 3 weeks of use out of a battery using once a day.  It has a blinking light that indicates when it needs a charge and stays on when fully charged.  The one thing I wish they would add is a beep to let you know that it needs charging as while you are using it is really hard to notice the flashing light.  I tend to notice the battery needs a charge when the motor slows down to a point that I can tell it isn’t as fast spraying water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This front of the irrigator has the power switch and mode button.  There are three cleaning modes - normal, soft and pulse.  I found the normal to not be too harsh and this is my primary mode when I clean my teeth and gums.  This has a powerful spray and does a good job cleaning.  Using this has made my gums and teeth healthier.  Unlike other brands though which are a bit more expensive, I do not see any warranty information included, leading me to believe it is 90 days or less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon.omise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.

            <li> I ordered this because I wanted to try a water flosser but did not want to spend too much on it. This was a solid price. The first one I ordered I charged it for the full 8 hours that it recommended. I used it for maybe 5 minutes total and it died. I tried charging it again, but it would not hold a charge. I contacted Amazon and they sent me a replacement with a free upgrade to one day shipping, which I was very happy about. The second one came in and it works perfectly so far. The new one does hold the charge and it works well. Happy so far.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:a8f1880cc9112af2570f68f63363c5b8]] I demo it&#x27;s use in the video, and yeah- I&#x27;m a dork.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you found this review or any of my other reviews interesting or helpful, please rate this as \\&quot;helpful\\&quot;.

            <li> This thing is great. Works well and exactly as advertised. Put some mouth wash and water in it an BAM, super clean facehole</li>
            <li> Works great.  Portable and excellent to use if you have braces.</li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to a reasonable cost</li>
            <li> Poor quality! Mode function stopped working after 2 weeks. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Took a minute to get used to but after that it did the job</li>
