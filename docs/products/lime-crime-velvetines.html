            <li>It&#x27;s a good liquid lipstick</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re all gorgeous colors</li>
            <li>See it to believe it, great shade, great staying power, easy application.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly, which is awesome.</li>

            <li>I love limecrime.</li>
            <li>All of their colors are perfect, this review is for red velvet</li>
            <li>But that being said, I have yet to find a brand of velvetines I like more.</li>
            <li>I love how velvety the application is</li>
            <li>Love</li>
            <li>Love the color.</li>
            <li>You also dont have to apply so many times.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied :)</li>
            <li>I love this lipstick and the matte look it gives.</li>
            <li>so i dont have to worry about accidentally wiping it or smearing it or re putting on more lipstick ..</li>
            <li>its not glossy when it dries , thisis just GORG . ! :]</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Awesome lasting color</li>
            <li>I love this brand</li>
            <li>I just wish they had more colors</li>
            <li>So my advise, when applying make sure you always have qtips and makeup remover with you.</li>
            <li>i mix it with another wine color to give it more depth or wear just alone.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lovely packaging but</li>
            <li>I love the texture of the lip gloss.  </li>
            <li>It almost wears like a stain more than a lipstick or  gloss.</li>
            <li>Perfect shade of red!!!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>and I love wearing them.</li>
            <li>Love limecrime love the velvetines.  </li>
            <li>Every thing I thought and more...</li>
            <li>LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>It get worn out butI love the color.</li>
            <li>But stayed great while drinking or just talking and normal wear.</li>
            <li>a long way!&lt;br /&gt;This is easily one of the best lip products I&#x27;ve enjoyed.</li>
            <li>I liked it, but noticed quickly it was drying out my lips.</li>
            <li>: you must apply this color to clean, unchapped lips or it&#x27;ll look yucky!</li>
            <li>Very bright apple red.</li>
            <li>It is of very good quality and it last after I ate pizza, salad, and snacked</li>
            <li>Beautiful, bright, saturated red color although it dries my lips very much.</li>
            <li>Lasts all night, beautiful red color, matte, but you can top off with gloss.</li>
            <li>i love how smooth it go on make my lips pop</li>
            <li>It does pill up if your not careful but for the most part, things like drinking or even kissing isnt a problem lol</li>
            <li>and there is no way to make your mouth more comfortable by applying a emollient topcoat without smearing the stain.  </li>
            <li>I really loved this product is very matte</li>
            <li>oh i loved how much cheaper it is to buy it on here.</li>
            <li>This product makes you look hot and sassy!!:)</li>
            <li>Red velvet is the perfect shade of red, its bright without being overwhelming and has no organge tones to it.</li>
            <li>This is probably my favorite lipstick the color is so rich</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s almost perfect.</li>
            <li>So if you are seeking true longevity, don&#x27;t eat or drink!</li>
            <li>remove it easy unless you use oil like coconut oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy</li>
            <li>Did not smug easy. .</li>
            <li>It applies easily with the doefoot applicator.</li>
            <li>But, then when I decided to wipe it off for the day, it came off fairly easily with just a paper towel dipped in a bit of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>on like a gloss, wears like a stain but looks like a strong matte lipstick.</li>
            <li>This is my second one, and I love it, I&#x27;m able to eat , drink and the color still there !!</li>
            <li>Not shiny, but a nice matte finish that really stays put!</li>
            <li>It has a beautiful red color and stays on almost all day..</li>
            <li>Hands down the best lipstick ever!!!</li>
            <li>Be quick!</li>
            <li>I love how it dries and is super matte.</li>
            <li>It goes matte quickly and it does not leave a sticky feeling!</li>
            <li>I thought it would be really bright, but it is just a lovely, highly-pigmented velvety red.</li>
            <li>Pink Velvet was incredibly bright and the photos I took honestly didn&#x27;t do it justice.</li>
            <li>This fit my needs.</li>
            <li>its well well worth the money :)</li>
            <li>and I hope it has the same great results.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy it.</li>
            <li>Great buy so definitely try it out!</li>
            <li>, color looks great on various skin tones.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m happy about it</li>
            <li>Of course when eating or drinking it will lightly fades.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth like a gloss and then dries like a matte lipstick.</li>
            <li>I have been buying from Lime Crime for a while now and yet another fantastic product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>And I do enjoy the matte finish.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love the matte finish and the fact that it does not rub off or smudge makes it well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many many different brands and different reds, this one is the best!</li>
            <li>The color is fantastic with staying power.</li>
            <li>but I actually use it over another matte lipstick for my own perfect red.</li>
            <li>It really is a beautiful, true red.</li>
            <li>Beautiful matte coverage and long wearing.</li>
            <li>Very pretty and not difficult to apply.. perfect red color</li>
            <li>Need lip liner, then blot, another lipstick, and maybe still another lipstick on top to make it look right.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very easy to work with as far as applying how much or how bright you want it.</li>
            <li>So if it&#x27;s too light try applying a darker shade first then the lipstick on top.</li>
            <li>Looking for more colors because I love the consistency and super long lasting...in love!</li>
            <li>LIKE SUPER BOLD!</li>
            <li>I got this product recommended to me by my cousin because everyone knows I love red lipstick and this is without a doubt my favorite one the color is phenomenal and it stays for</li>
            <li>The pink velvet is also beautiful.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny !</li>
            <li>I bought this off a recommendation from Kandee Johnson, (youtube makeup maven) and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>and I totally recommend it if you are looking for that nice matte finish!</li>
            <li>I love these velvetines sooo much!</li>
            <li>I think it is great it might dry your lips a bit</li>
            <li>You will not be happy if you apply over dry, cracked or peeling lips.</li>
            <li>Most reviews I read or watched were positive and expressed how moisturizing this product is.</li>
            <li>Wow, sure did!  </li>
            <li>This is a liquid lipstick and it is pure magic.</li>
            <li>Nonetheless it was very good, it lasted long but very drying to the lips</li>
            <li>As a deep brown skin girl, I was worried that it would be too bright</li>
            <li>Wicked was a bit browner than I expected, but it still looks great.</li>
            <li>Love it thank you 😊 highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really wish they had more colors.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t worn it out for a full night or day though, so</li>
            <li>It was really sweet</li>
            <li>This is a red that looks good on everyone.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend is not big on lipsticks but he loved this one.</li>
            <li>Like the most intense vanilla cookie taste.  </li>
            <li>Not a bad price 😀😊</li>
            <li>Super good red color.</li>
            <li>However the formula is very unique it really does go on liquidy</li>
            <li>It looks like the perfect red, but when I received it it is a super bright red that looks clownish on my medium deep skin.</li>
            <li>It is very dry, but it looks GREAT when freshly applied...</li>
            <li>recommend if you want an all day/night stay with a striking red. :)</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;ll actually stay on throughout the day, I had been looking for a perfect matte red lip gloss and this is deff the one.</li>
            <li>and you have to work quickly before it dries.</li>
            <li>Drys quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky.</li>
            <li>Working quickly is a must.</li>
            <li>It goes on so lovely, and stays vibrant.</li>
            <li>but i own a few lime crime liquid lipsticks they are amazing  </li>
            <li>so you have to work quick with it.</li>
            <li>Unlike other reviewers, I&#x27;ve found that even with my lips not in perfect shape, the color is pigmented enough that it looks smooth and even.  </li>
            <li>This my new favorite lip gloss.</li>
            <li>I found it easy to apply and it dries fast.</li>
            <li>Big plus, comes off easily unlike many of the 18 Hr lipsticks you can buy at the drugstore which will stay on you mouth for days without a thorough scrubbing.</li>
            <li>I love this lip gloss because it dries matte and its a super gorgeous color, i have ordered at least two of these since i found out about them</li>
            <li>Great liquid lipstick but a little watery.</li>
            <li>Which in all honestly I am definitely fine with because just like a normal lipstick you have to re apply, but with normal lipstick you have to re apply even more.</li>
            <li>The color is super rich and stays on really well.</li>
            <li>Received much faster than expected and product works great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a nice color.</li>
            <li>worth the $20.</li>
            <li>It was worth the money and the wait for it.</li>
            <li>I love LOVE this Lime Crime Wet to matte lip stick.</li>
            <li>I own 7 different colors of limecrime</li>
            <li>I can say waiting for this was totally worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a ceaseless red lipstick wearer, so I&#x27;m always on the lookout for the perfect product.</li>
            <li>You rarely have to reapply, and you never have to worry about lip to teeth color mishaps.</li>
            <li>but it was very much worth the effort.</li>
            <li>Worth the $$</li>
            <li>Last a good length of time, but is very drying.</li>
            <li>Goes on nicely without running into lip lines, because it drys instantly.  </li>
            <li>this looks classy and sophisticated.</li>
            <li>FRESH BOTANICA Would not admit this and refused to accept responsibility in taking advantage of their customer.</li>
            <li>LOVE this product lol its a pretty deep red , very opaque and it is a stain</li>
            <li>The most beautiful red lip stick I own but a little gloss on top makes it even more dramatic.  </li>
            <li>It dries to a beautiful matte red color with blue undertones, making your smile pop without yellowing your teeth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve loved other types like DOSE</li>
            <li>I have been looking for the perfect dark red matte finish</li>
            <li>But I do love the true red!!  </li>
            <li>While this is true, I find that it bleeds, takes much longer to dry than expressed and transfers more easily than I would have hoped.</li>
            <li>When I received it in it&#x27;s beautiful package I ripped it open to test it out except it looked red.</li>
            <li>Will for sure be reorder and get other colors! :)</li>
            <li>The color looks excellent with both my super pale (White) skin and my friend&#x27;s darker (Indian) skin.  </li>
            <li>Stays on super well and has a lovely red color.</li>
            <li>Love this product, its long lasting, it doesn&#x27;t dry your lips and it goes perfectly with my caramel skin</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t stay on as long as suedeberry does but its so nice when it&#x27;s matte that you probably need to touch it up once.</li>
            <li>It is long lasting and the colors are gorgeously saturated!</li>
            <li>Man, oh, man does it dry to an amazing matte finish.</li>
            <li>great red color with blue undertones.</li>
            <li>Also was kind of dissapointed about the dry feeling after a couple hours.</li>
            <li>When I do I go right for my red lime crime :)</li>
            <li>and when it&#x27;s dry you have a beautiful matte red lip.  </li>
            <li>very nice red lipstick last all day  </li>
            <li>It is also very economic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just sayin ;)</li>
            <li>it was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>other than that... LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I love the fact that you can use it by itself to give it the velvet look, or add some gloss for an extra OOMPH!!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize it was a matte gloss, and it has the same consistency as the NYX matte lipgloss, but is definitely a better quality.</li>
            <li>First time I wore this I didn&#x27;t have to retouch my lips.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS RED!!</li>
            <li>so i don&#x27;t have to constantly run to the mirror to check my lipstick :)</li>
            <li>The product is pretty legit and smells exactly like cake batter.</li>
            <li>I will say it takes a lot for it to come off willingly.</li>
            <li>It has a matte finish, very velvety type texture!</li>
            <li>I love the lip gloss its exactly what I was looking for, but the customer service is what will keep me coming back.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more of this brand</li>
            <li>it doesnt rub off, it dries matte but keeps your lips smooth not dried out or powdery feeling</li>
            <li>But sadly it is not.</li>
            <li>you love red</li>
            <li>My first limecrime product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been watching lime crime products since they first appeared and always wanted to try them</li>
            <li>I only wish it came on more shades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>This product was not as good as i thought it would be, the lipsick dried out my lips</li>
            <li>It is a beautiful red that can be layered with glosses and other lipsticks.</li>
            <li>It last so long and dries really nicely !</li>
            <li>But with confidence also very fast shipping and reasonably priced too.</li>
            <li>Its a very true red!</li>
            <li>It lasts a long time:) got lots of compliments wearing it:)♥</li>
            <li>Love this product could wear it all night long</li>
            <li>I gave it 5 stars because the pigment is lovely and long wearing.</li>
            <li>The color is pretty, but it&#x27;s really drying, and the color transfers from my lips to EVERYTHING.</li>
            <li>The color is so bright and vibrant and it is not goopy, or heavy.</li>
            <li>It looks gorgeous on pale skin and on tan skin!</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s normal right?</li>
            <li>and it stays on, not cakey nor dry, though I like to put lip gloss on top sometimes.</li>
            <li>the NYX Matte Lip Creams are much more foregiving on dry lips than this product is.</li>
            <li>Also, if your lips are dry, peeling or cracked, make sure you exfoliate and hydrate them before using this gloss.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>If bright red dry lips are your thing I highly recommend, but if not buyer beware!</li>
            <li>I put on a darker red liner and it works fine.</li>
            <li>i really like the matte finish</li>
            <li>Absolutely a fan.</li>
            <li>The application goes on well, just need to work fast before it dries</li>
            <li>Fast shipping item as described.</li>
            <li>I am very thankful for this product.</li>
            <li>haha...</li>
            <li>I paired it with an NYX lip liner and it has worked very well for me.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really matter</li>
            <li>It goes on like a lip gloss and dries off like a high quality matte lipstick!</li>
            <li>I have been looking for this product my whole makeup wearing life.</li>
            <li>and it was very well-received.</li>
            <li>my go too and dries up very velvety</li>
            <li>and it really looks &amp;#34;retro&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>but I really go like the look.</li>
            <li>but this one stays so much longer.</li>
            <li>Absolute must have.</li>
            <li>Haha..</li>
            <li>I loved the red and I had ordered the pink one also.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered red velvet before and the color was as expected and I loved it.</li>
            <li>really like these, a little to dry for my liking but the color is beautiful.</li>
            <li>Amazing I have searched high and low for this shade of red it</li>
            <li>The color is a true red and is very classic.</li>
            <li>now  thinking to purchase the other shades of lime crime :)</li>
            <li>Excited for the red velvet that I now ordered on here</li>
            <li>I received this product on time, and was so excited to try it out because I had done massive amounts of research for months on youtube, instagram, tumblr, even yahoo/google pages.</li>
            <li>Amazing, a must buy, long lasting</li>
            <li>Soft and velvety, fun to dress up with a bold red lip.</li>
            <li>Also, the applicator is small enough to be precise (if you have a steady hand), which is so handy for on-the-go touch-ups.</li>
            <li>This lipstick goes on smooth and lasts long without transferring onto the cups you drink out of.</li>
            <li>I finally found the true &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; color of lipstick in Lime Crime Velvetines.....however.</li>
            <li>The red is a little bright, I wish it was darker</li>
            <li>I just received Black Velvet, and I am in love.</li>
            <li>This product stays on until your significant other takes it off ;)</li>
            <li>Quite a decent lip stain.</li>
            <li>and I will definitely be purchasing more in the future!</li>
            <li>Becareful when applying tho don&#x27;t add to much or it will look very loud.</li>
            <li>It definitely has a matte finish and the color is very pretty.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>This product was high on my &amp;#34;to-buy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone that loves liquid to matte lipsticks.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It is a matte, rich, old Hollywood style blue-toned red.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to apply, though the brush it comes with is not exact.</li>
            <li>Doesnt dry out and rarely needs reapplication!</li>
            <li>However, I seem to have the same problem with most long wearing lipsticks.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s normal because I never wear lipstick.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricey, but worth it for such a quality product.</li>
            <li>It dries down in about 30 seconds to a lovely soft matte finish.</li>
            <li>Pretty upset since I spent $20 especially since the formula is super drying!</li>
            <li>you are looking for a matte, non-shimmer, flat color that looks like it came off the silver screen in Hollywood&#x27;s Golden Age?</li>
            <li>and I doubt I will ever use another red lipstick again because this is the holy grail of that pure red bold lip color.</li>
            <li>these are brand new, never been used.</li>
            <li>live in Brasil.</li>
            <li>my new fav go to aside from macs ruby</li>
            <li>Just after applying this color it sets to a fabulous deep red matte.</li>
            <li>It does dry quick</li>
            <li>only good things about this product are the cute packaging, and it does smell like cookies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that it drys out your lips, doesn&#x27;t stay on nearly as long as it&#x27;s intended to, it does transfer, it crumbles, and it is incredibly difficult to take off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, you gonna love this particular shade especially if you dark of complexion.</li>
            <li>Also, apply carefully to lip line because its very runny right out of the tube.</li>
            <li>The only thing is that it takes a little practice to apply, since it is so very pigmented, you could end up painting more then you had wished.</li>
            <li>This is my first *Lime Crime purchase ever...&amp; it wont be my last.</li>
            <li>Yet it&#x27;s a little drying for my lips and kinda wears off easily..</li>
            <li>be warned, if your lips are dry or peeling- exfoliate first!</li>
            <li>The lip gloss lasted the entire meal, plus in my exhaustion I forgot to clean it off (and figured it had worn off while I brushed my teeth before bed)</li>
            <li>I love this product, I have the Red Velvet and it is hands down my favorite red, my MAC Ruby Woo and Russian Red</li>
            <li>(I am kind of eager to try out the lighter red color, as a side note) but, the only con about this product is that if you want it to stay that deep red all day you have to apply it once or twice.</li>
            <li>So with out all that this is great color very dramatic which I like to keep the drama to my lips and no</li>
            <li>I love this product, but I found one similar for half the price.</li>
            <li>If I try to add lip balm because my lips are dry it all just smears right off.</li>
            <li>This was less expensive and seems to be just as good as what she originally hoped for.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin &amp; don&#x27;t wear makeup a lot.</li>
            <li>Really liquidy, and not the prettiest shade of red,  </li>
            <li>Wow...</li>
            <li>And the perrrrfect shade of red -- and i would think for any skin shade, really.</li>
            <li>This is for 12-15 years old girls I swear.</li>
            <li>My lips naturally have a lot of creases in them.</li>
            <li>I wanted so much for this to finally be my go to stay shade.</li>
            <li>soft feels like it isn&#x27;t on.</li>
            <li>product completely sucked all the moisture out of my lips.</li>
            <li>/&gt;And removing this lip stain is a complete pain in the neck.</li>
            <li>my lips became complete chapped and</li>
            <li>would not recommend this product to anyone, please do not waste your money on this like I did.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t see what the big deal is about this lip stain, it&#x27;s exspensive and it dries out your lips</li>
            <li>But I got it as a gift for my adult daughter who raves over it</li>
            <li>It dries naturally and mixes well.</li>
            <li>Gives you a very pretty flat velvet red!</li>
            <li>Long wear and true red color.</li>
            <li>but if you put one layer of black lipstick under or add some dark eyeshadow before you put it on, it looks amazing.</li>
            <li>Super matte and long lasting!</li>
            <li>very much a beauty essential, especially if you are into the 1950s vintage burlesque pinup and hollywood look.</li>
            <li>on three different occasions I ordered 3 different shades my first was wicked</li>
            <li>Hope they keep it around forever, since classic matte red will never go out of style.</li>
            <li>You do have to have decent hand eye coordination to apply, because it is a liquid, and it will stain instantly.  </li>
            <li>Was looking for a particular name brand of a similar product.</li>
            <li>I bought the pink velvet color from another seller before this red velvet and all I can say is this is much better than the pink velvet cause</li>
            <li>It gets 5 stars because it lives up to the picture the deepest red velvet, long lasting, I can eat a full dinner &amp; dont have to take out my mirror  at the table to fix my lips...</li>
            <li>95% of the reviews were good, and then other obviously not so good.</li>
            <li>My new fav RED lip.  </li>
            <li>It is slightly drying, but worth it.</li>
            <li>First of all it lasts pretty much all day, I usually will reapply if I eat something like a sandwich but other than that it stays put.  </li>
            <li>But other than that this has won my heart and I am sure I have broken some hearts with it ;)</li>
            <li>ITS A MUST HAVE LONG LASTING, NO LIP LINER NEEDED, QUICK DRY</li>
            <li>Barely any product in the tube.</li>
            <li>This is my second bottle so far</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a smidgen darker than Sephora&#x27;s Always Red, and doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out my lips as much.</li>
            <li>Dried my lips out quite a bit and looked less velvetty and more powdery flaky.</li>
            <li>I cannot think of any situation where I would wear this other than in a hot humid climate where I won&#x27;t be eating or drinking for several hours, so</li>
            <li>I stopped wearing it and for the last month have been trying everything possible to get my lips back to normal - no luck.</li>
            <li>or you may not know what being good is anymore if you don&#x27;t have some bad food and a lazy night once in a while that you spend all evening getting ready for!!!</li>
            <li>Liked it not loved, definitely dried my lips and had to reapply a couple of times.</li>
            <li>Red velvet is the only lipstick I reorder as soon as it comes out because I know I dont like any other similar product as much.</li>
            <li>but I guess its my prediction, I just got it, but definitely worth half or 1/3 of what I spent.</li>
            <li>The red is so purely pigmented, that a little goes</li>

            <li> Also, you have to use a lip liner or a good primer because color runs.</li>

            <li> Great color and nice smell</li>

            <li> But, the good news is you can layer it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good liquid lipstick</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re all gorgeous colors</li>
            <li> See it to believe it, great shade, great staying power, easy application.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly, which is awesome.</li>

            <li> The best red lip gloss that I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> I love limecrime.</li>
            <li> All of their colors are perfect, this review is for red velvet</li>
            <li> But that being said, I have yet to find a brand of velvetines I like more.</li>
            <li> I love how velvety the application is</li>
            <li> Love</li>
            <li> Love the color.</li>
            <li> You also dont have to apply so many times.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied :)</li>
            <li> I love this lipstick and the matte look it gives.</li>
            <li> so i dont have to worry about accidentally wiping it or smearing it or re putting on more lipstick ..</li>
            <li> its not glossy when it dries , thisis just GORG . ! :]</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Awesome lasting color</li>
            <li> I love this brand</li>
            <li> I just wish they had more colors</li>
            <li> So my advise, when applying make sure you always have qtips and makeup remover with you.</li>
            <li> i mix it with another wine color to give it more depth or wear just alone.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lovely packaging but</li>
            <li> I love the texture of the lip gloss.  </li>
            <li> It almost wears like a stain more than a lipstick or  gloss.</li>
            <li> Perfect shade of red!!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> and I love wearing them.</li>
            <li> Love limecrime love the velvetines.  </li>
            <li> Every thing I thought and more...</li>
            <li> LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> It get worn out butI love the color.</li>
            <li> But stayed great while drinking or just talking and normal wear.</li>
            <li> a long way!&lt;br /&gt;This is easily one of the best lip products I&#x27;ve enjoyed.</li>
            <li> I liked it, but noticed quickly it was drying out my lips.</li>
            <li> : you must apply this color to clean, unchapped lips or it&#x27;ll look yucky!</li>
            <li> Very bright apple red.</li>
            <li> It is of very good quality and it last after I ate pizza, salad, and snacked</li>
            <li> Beautiful, bright, saturated red color although it dries my lips very much.</li>
            <li> Lasts all night, beautiful red color, matte, but you can top off with gloss.</li>
            <li> i love how smooth it go on make my lips pop</li>
            <li> It does pill up if your not careful but for the most part, things like drinking or even kissing isnt a problem lol</li>
            <li> and there is no way to make your mouth more comfortable by applying a emollient topcoat without smearing the stain.  </li>
            <li> I really loved this product is very matte</li>
            <li> oh i loved how much cheaper it is to buy it on here.</li>
            <li> This product makes you look hot and sassy!!:)</li>
            <li> Red velvet is the perfect shade of red, its bright without being overwhelming and has no organge tones to it.</li>
            <li> This is probably my favorite lipstick the color is so rich</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s almost perfect.</li>
            <li> So if you are seeking true longevity, don&#x27;t eat or drink!</li>
            <li> remove it easy unless you use oil like coconut oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy</li>
            <li> Did not smug easy. .</li>
            <li> It applies easily with the doefoot applicator.</li>
            <li> But, then when I decided to wipe it off for the day, it came off fairly easily with just a paper towel dipped in a bit of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> on like a gloss, wears like a stain but looks like a strong matte lipstick.</li>
            <li> This is my second one, and I love it, I&#x27;m able to eat , drink and the color still there !!</li>
            <li> Not shiny, but a nice matte finish that really stays put!</li>
            <li> It has a beautiful red color and stays on almost all day..</li>
            <li> Hands down the best lipstick ever!!!</li>
            <li> Be quick!</li>
            <li> I love how it dries and is super matte.</li>
            <li> It goes matte quickly and it does not leave a sticky feeling!</li>
            <li> I thought it would be really bright, but it is just a lovely, highly-pigmented velvety red.</li>
            <li> Pink Velvet was incredibly bright and the photos I took honestly didn&#x27;t do it justice.</li>
            <li> This fit my needs.</li>
            <li> its well well worth the money :)</li>
            <li> and I hope it has the same great results.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Great buy so definitely try it out!</li>
            <li> , color looks great on various skin tones.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m happy about it</li>
            <li> Of course when eating or drinking it will lightly fades.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth like a gloss and then dries like a matte lipstick.</li>
            <li> I have been buying from Lime Crime for a while now and yet another fantastic product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> And I do enjoy the matte finish.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love the matte finish and the fact that it does not rub off or smudge makes it well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many many different brands and different reds, this one is the best!</li>
            <li> The color is fantastic with staying power.</li>
            <li> but I actually use it over another matte lipstick for my own perfect red.</li>
            <li> It really is a beautiful, true red.</li>
            <li> Beautiful matte coverage and long wearing.</li>
            <li> Very pretty and not difficult to apply.. perfect red color</li>
            <li> Need lip liner, then blot, another lipstick, and maybe still another lipstick on top to make it look right.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very easy to work with as far as applying how much or how bright you want it.</li>
            <li> So if it&#x27;s too light try applying a darker shade first then the lipstick on top.</li>
            <li> Looking for more colors because I love the consistency and super long lasting...in love!</li>
            <li> LIKE SUPER BOLD!</li>
            <li> I got this product recommended to me by my cousin because everyone knows I love red lipstick and this is without a doubt my favorite one the color is phenomenal and it stays for</li>
            <li> The pink velvet is also beautiful.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny !</li>
            <li> I bought this off a recommendation from Kandee Johnson, (youtube makeup maven) and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I totally recommend it if you are looking for that nice matte finish!</li>
            <li> I love these velvetines sooo much!</li>
            <li> I think it is great it might dry your lips a bit</li>
            <li> You will not be happy if you apply over dry, cracked or peeling lips.</li>
            <li> Most reviews I read or watched were positive and expressed how moisturizing this product is.</li>
            <li> Wow, sure did!  </li>
            <li> This is a liquid lipstick and it is pure magic.</li>
            <li> Nonetheless it was very good, it lasted long but very drying to the lips</li>
            <li> As a deep brown skin girl, I was worried that it would be too bright</li>
            <li> Wicked was a bit browner than I expected, but it still looks great.</li>
            <li> Love it thank you 😊 highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really wish they had more colors.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t worn it out for a full night or day though, so</li>
            <li> It was really sweet</li>
            <li> This is a red that looks good on everyone.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend is not big on lipsticks but he loved this one.</li>
            <li> Like the most intense vanilla cookie taste.  </li>
            <li> Not a bad price 😀😊</li>
            <li> Super good red color.</li>
            <li> However the formula is very unique it really does go on liquidy</li>
            <li> It looks like the perfect red, but when I received it it is a super bright red that looks clownish on my medium deep skin.</li>
            <li> It is very dry, but it looks GREAT when freshly applied...</li>
            <li> recommend if you want an all day/night stay with a striking red. :)</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;ll actually stay on throughout the day, I had been looking for a perfect matte red lip gloss and this is deff the one.</li>
            <li> and you have to work quickly before it dries.</li>
            <li> Drys quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky.</li>
            <li> Working quickly is a must.</li>
            <li> It goes on so lovely, and stays vibrant.</li>
            <li> but i own a few lime crime liquid lipsticks they are amazing  </li>
            <li> so you have to work quick with it.</li>
            <li> Unlike other reviewers, I&#x27;ve found that even with my lips not in perfect shape, the color is pigmented enough that it looks smooth and even.  </li>
            <li> This my new favorite lip gloss.</li>
            <li> I found it easy to apply and it dries fast.</li>
            <li> Big plus, comes off easily unlike many of the 18 Hr lipsticks you can buy at the drugstore which will stay on you mouth for days without a thorough scrubbing.</li>
            <li> I love this lip gloss because it dries matte and its a super gorgeous color, i have ordered at least two of these since i found out about them</li>
            <li> Great liquid lipstick but a little watery.</li>
            <li> Which in all honestly I am definitely fine with because just like a normal lipstick you have to re apply, but with normal lipstick you have to re apply even more.</li>
            <li> The color is super rich and stays on really well.</li>
            <li> Received much faster than expected and product works great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a nice color.</li>
            <li> worth the $20.</li>
            <li> It was worth the money and the wait for it.</li>
            <li> I love LOVE this Lime Crime Wet to matte lip stick.</li>
            <li> I own 7 different colors of limecrime</li>
            <li> I can say waiting for this was totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a ceaseless red lipstick wearer, so I&#x27;m always on the lookout for the perfect product.</li>
            <li> You rarely have to reapply, and you never have to worry about lip to teeth color mishaps.</li>
            <li> but it was very much worth the effort.</li>
            <li> Worth the $$</li>
            <li> Last a good length of time, but is very drying.</li>
            <li> Goes on nicely without running into lip lines, because it drys instantly.  </li>
            <li> this looks classy and sophisticated.</li>
            <li> FRESH BOTANICA Would not admit this and refused to accept responsibility in taking advantage of their customer.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product lol its a pretty deep red , very opaque and it is a stain</li>
            <li> The most beautiful red lip stick I own but a little gloss on top makes it even more dramatic.  </li>
            <li> It dries to a beautiful matte red color with blue undertones, making your smile pop without yellowing your teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved other types like DOSE</li>
            <li> I have been looking for the perfect dark red matte finish</li>
            <li> But I do love the true red!!  </li>
            <li> While this is true, I find that it bleeds, takes much longer to dry than expressed and transfers more easily than I would have hoped.</li>
            <li> When I received it in it&#x27;s beautiful package I ripped it open to test it out except it looked red.</li>
            <li> Will for sure be reorder and get other colors! :)</li>
            <li> The color looks excellent with both my super pale (White) skin and my friend&#x27;s darker (Indian) skin.  </li>
            <li> Stays on super well and has a lovely red color.</li>
            <li> Love this product, its long lasting, it doesn&#x27;t dry your lips and it goes perfectly with my caramel skin</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay on as long as suedeberry does but its so nice when it&#x27;s matte that you probably need to touch it up once.</li>
            <li> It is long lasting and the colors are gorgeously saturated!</li>
            <li> Man, oh, man does it dry to an amazing matte finish.</li>
            <li> great red color with blue undertones.</li>
            <li> Also was kind of dissapointed about the dry feeling after a couple hours.</li>
            <li> When I do I go right for my red lime crime :)</li>
            <li> and when it&#x27;s dry you have a beautiful matte red lip.  </li>
            <li> very nice red lipstick last all day  </li>
            <li> It is also very economic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just sayin ;)</li>
            <li> it was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> other than that... LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I love the fact that you can use it by itself to give it the velvet look, or add some gloss for an extra OOMPH!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize it was a matte gloss, and it has the same consistency as the NYX matte lipgloss, but is definitely a better quality.</li>
            <li> First time I wore this I didn&#x27;t have to retouch my lips.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS RED!!</li>
            <li> so i don&#x27;t have to constantly run to the mirror to check my lipstick :)</li>
            <li> The product is pretty legit and smells exactly like cake batter.</li>
            <li> I will say it takes a lot for it to come off willingly.</li>
            <li> It has a matte finish, very velvety type texture!</li>
            <li> I love the lip gloss its exactly what I was looking for, but the customer service is what will keep me coming back.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more of this brand</li>
            <li> it doesnt rub off, it dries matte but keeps your lips smooth not dried out or powdery feeling</li>
            <li> But sadly it is not.</li>
            <li> you love red</li>
            <li> My first limecrime product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been watching lime crime products since they first appeared and always wanted to try them</li>
            <li> I only wish it came on more shades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> This product was not as good as i thought it would be, the lipsick dried out my lips</li>
            <li> It is a beautiful red that can be layered with glosses and other lipsticks.</li>
            <li> It last so long and dries really nicely !</li>
            <li> But with confidence also very fast shipping and reasonably priced too.</li>
            <li> Its a very true red!</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time:) got lots of compliments wearing it:)♥</li>
            <li> Love this product could wear it all night long</li>
            <li> I gave it 5 stars because the pigment is lovely and long wearing.</li>
            <li> The color is pretty, but it&#x27;s really drying, and the color transfers from my lips to EVERYTHING.</li>
            <li> The color is so bright and vibrant and it is not goopy, or heavy.</li>
            <li> It looks gorgeous on pale skin and on tan skin!</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s normal right?</li>
            <li> and it stays on, not cakey nor dry, though I like to put lip gloss on top sometimes.</li>
            <li> the NYX Matte Lip Creams are much more foregiving on dry lips than this product is.</li>
            <li> Also, if your lips are dry, peeling or cracked, make sure you exfoliate and hydrate them before using this gloss.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> If bright red dry lips are your thing I highly recommend, but if not buyer beware!</li>
            <li> I put on a darker red liner and it works fine.</li>
            <li> i really like the matte finish</li>
            <li> Absolutely a fan.</li>
            <li> The application goes on well, just need to work fast before it dries</li>
            <li> Fast shipping item as described.</li>
            <li> I am very thankful for this product.</li>
            <li> haha...</li>
            <li> I paired it with an NYX lip liner and it has worked very well for me.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really matter</li>
            <li> It goes on like a lip gloss and dries off like a high quality matte lipstick!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this product my whole makeup wearing life.</li>
            <li> and it was very well-received.</li>
            <li> my go too and dries up very velvety</li>
            <li> and it really looks &amp;#34;retro&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> but I really go like the look.</li>
            <li> but this one stays so much longer.</li>
            <li> Absolute must have.</li>
            <li> Haha..</li>
            <li> I loved the red and I had ordered the pink one also.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered red velvet before and the color was as expected and I loved it.</li>
            <li> really like these, a little to dry for my liking but the color is beautiful.</li>
            <li> Amazing I have searched high and low for this shade of red it</li>
            <li> The color is a true red and is very classic.</li>
            <li> now  thinking to purchase the other shades of lime crime :)</li>
            <li> Excited for the red velvet that I now ordered on here</li>
            <li> I received this product on time, and was so excited to try it out because I had done massive amounts of research for months on youtube, instagram, tumblr, even yahoo/google pages.</li>
            <li> Amazing, a must buy, long lasting</li>
            <li> Soft and velvety, fun to dress up with a bold red lip.</li>
            <li> Also, the applicator is small enough to be precise (if you have a steady hand), which is so handy for on-the-go touch-ups.</li>
            <li> This lipstick goes on smooth and lasts long without transferring onto the cups you drink out of.</li>
            <li> I finally found the true &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; color of lipstick in Lime Crime Velvetines.....however.</li>
            <li> The red is a little bright, I wish it was darker</li>
            <li> I just received Black Velvet, and I am in love.</li>
            <li> This product stays on until your significant other takes it off ;)</li>
            <li> Quite a decent lip stain.</li>
            <li> and I will definitely be purchasing more in the future!</li>
            <li> Becareful when applying tho don&#x27;t add to much or it will look very loud.</li>
            <li> It definitely has a matte finish and the color is very pretty.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This product was high on my &amp;#34;to-buy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone that loves liquid to matte lipsticks.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It is a matte, rich, old Hollywood style blue-toned red.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to apply, though the brush it comes with is not exact.</li>
            <li> Doesnt dry out and rarely needs reapplication!</li>
            <li> However, I seem to have the same problem with most long wearing lipsticks.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s normal because I never wear lipstick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricey, but worth it for such a quality product.</li>
            <li> It dries down in about 30 seconds to a lovely soft matte finish.</li>
            <li> Pretty upset since I spent $20 especially since the formula is super drying!</li>
            <li> you are looking for a matte, non-shimmer, flat color that looks like it came off the silver screen in Hollywood&#x27;s Golden Age?</li>
            <li> and I doubt I will ever use another red lipstick again because this is the holy grail of that pure red bold lip color.</li>
            <li> these are brand new, never been used.</li>
            <li> live in Brasil.</li>
            <li> my new fav go to aside from macs ruby</li>
            <li> Just after applying this color it sets to a fabulous deep red matte.</li>
            <li> It does dry quick</li>
            <li> only good things about this product are the cute packaging, and it does smell like cookies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that it drys out your lips, doesn&#x27;t stay on nearly as long as it&#x27;s intended to, it does transfer, it crumbles, and it is incredibly difficult to take off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , you gonna love this particular shade especially if you dark of complexion.</li>
            <li> Also, apply carefully to lip line because its very runny right out of the tube.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that it takes a little practice to apply, since it is so very pigmented, you could end up painting more then you had wished.</li>
            <li> This is my first *Lime Crime purchase ever...&amp; it wont be my last.</li>
            <li> Yet it&#x27;s a little drying for my lips and kinda wears off easily..</li>
            <li> be warned, if your lips are dry or peeling- exfoliate first!</li>
            <li> The lip gloss lasted the entire meal, plus in my exhaustion I forgot to clean it off (and figured it had worn off while I brushed my teeth before bed)</li>
            <li> I love this product, I have the Red Velvet and it is hands down my favorite red, my MAC Ruby Woo and Russian Red</li>
            <li> (I am kind of eager to try out the lighter red color, as a side note) but, the only con about this product is that if you want it to stay that deep red all day you have to apply it once or twice.</li>
            <li> So with out all that this is great color very dramatic which I like to keep the drama to my lips and no</li>
            <li> I love this product, but I found one similar for half the price.</li>
            <li> If I try to add lip balm because my lips are dry it all just smears right off.</li>
            <li> This was less expensive and seems to be just as good as what she originally hoped for.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin &amp; don&#x27;t wear makeup a lot.</li>
            <li> Really liquidy, and not the prettiest shade of red,  </li>
            <li> Wow...</li>
            <li> And the perrrrfect shade of red -- and i would think for any skin shade, really.</li>
            <li> This is for 12-15 years old girls I swear.</li>
            <li> My lips naturally have a lot of creases in them.</li>
            <li> I wanted so much for this to finally be my go to stay shade.</li>
            <li> soft feels like it isn&#x27;t on.</li>
            <li> product completely sucked all the moisture out of my lips.</li>
            <li> /&gt;And removing this lip stain is a complete pain in the neck.</li>
            <li> my lips became complete chapped and</li>
            <li> would not recommend this product to anyone, please do not waste your money on this like I did.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t see what the big deal is about this lip stain, it&#x27;s exspensive and it dries out your lips</li>
            <li> But I got it as a gift for my adult daughter who raves over it</li>
            <li> It dries naturally and mixes well.</li>
            <li> Gives you a very pretty flat velvet red!</li>
            <li> Long wear and true red color.</li>
            <li> but if you put one layer of black lipstick under or add some dark eyeshadow before you put it on, it looks amazing.</li>
            <li> Super matte and long lasting!</li>
            <li> very much a beauty essential, especially if you are into the 1950s vintage burlesque pinup and hollywood look.</li>
            <li> on three different occasions I ordered 3 different shades my first was wicked</li>
            <li> Hope they keep it around forever, since classic matte red will never go out of style.</li>
            <li> You do have to have decent hand eye coordination to apply, because it is a liquid, and it will stain instantly.  </li>
            <li> Was looking for a particular name brand of a similar product.</li>
            <li> I bought the pink velvet color from another seller before this red velvet and all I can say is this is much better than the pink velvet cause</li>
            <li> It gets 5 stars because it lives up to the picture the deepest red velvet, long lasting, I can eat a full dinner &amp; dont have to take out my mirror  at the table to fix my lips...</li>
            <li> 95% of the reviews were good, and then other obviously not so good.</li>
            <li> My new fav RED lip.  </li>
            <li> It is slightly drying, but worth it.</li>
            <li> First of all it lasts pretty much all day, I usually will reapply if I eat something like a sandwich but other than that it stays put.  </li>
            <li> But other than that this has won my heart and I am sure I have broken some hearts with it ;)</li>
            <li> ITS A MUST HAVE LONG LASTING, NO LIP LINER NEEDED, QUICK DRY</li>
            <li> Barely any product in the tube.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle so far</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a smidgen darker than Sephora&#x27;s Always Red, and doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out my lips as much.</li>
            <li> Dried my lips out quite a bit and looked less velvetty and more powdery flaky.</li>
            <li> I cannot think of any situation where I would wear this other than in a hot humid climate where I won&#x27;t be eating or drinking for several hours, so</li>
            <li> I stopped wearing it and for the last month have been trying everything possible to get my lips back to normal - no luck.</li>
            <li> or you may not know what being good is anymore if you don&#x27;t have some bad food and a lazy night once in a while that you spend all evening getting ready for!!!</li>
            <li> Liked it not loved, definitely dried my lips and had to reapply a couple of times.</li>
            <li> Red velvet is the only lipstick I reorder as soon as it comes out because I know I dont like any other similar product as much.</li>
            <li> but I guess its my prediction, I just got it, but definitely worth half or 1/3 of what I spent.</li>
            <li> The red is so purely pigmented, that a little goes</li>
            <li> Also very hard to clean up.</li>
            <li> I like the vibrant color of this red; however it still makes my lips a little dryer than I prefer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s opaque like non-other, transfer resistant without feeling heavy like all the liquid lipsticks I&#x27;ve used in the past, in fact it&#x27;s so light</li>
            <li> The product seemed to last long but others have said different</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a long lasting lipstick/stain this is definitely the one I bought all 3 colors after trying it it lasts for hours and hours no need for touch ups</li>
            <li> This product sat awkwardly on my lips and creased very easily on my lips.</li>
            <li> After 4 or 5 times my lips were so dry, even the outside of my mouth was red.</li>
            <li> but it is infallible and long lasting.</li>
            <li> Not as long lasting as I hoped.</li>
            <li> It does not last as long as I had hoped</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s long lasting.</li>
            <li> I noticed that it wears down a little around the inner part of the lip during the day, but that&#x27;s really the only place you need to reapply.</li>
            <li> No other product can compare In therms of durability and not tranfering to other surfaces.</li>
            <li> /&gt;this does tend to be dry so using a lip balm prior to use is recommended.</li>
            <li> Purchased the product because of Lime Crime&#x27;s animal rights activism but not happy with FRESH BOTANICA misrepresenting what the product actually was.</li>
            <li> With the craze going on surrounding a certain music artist doing a makeup collaboration with one of the hottest brands around, I decided to do some research and try a few other retro matte reds...</li>
            <li> I like how it is red red and it stays longer than my other lipsticks</li>
            <li> as long as it doesn&#x27;t make me fat</li>
            <li> and even then, you&#x27;ll have pink lips left over.</li>
            <li> long like 8 hrs</li>
            <li> I waited a long time for the price to drop and then ordered.  </li>
            <li> all I see is red and pink</li>
            <li> so long I get compliments all the time whenever I wear it</li>
            <li> so you have to be careful with the application, especially because it is a lip stain.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;lip stain for a long time.</li>
            <li> I want to buy the pink shade next, once I have the money.</li>
            <li> It does dry your lips a bit, but I haven&#x27;t found a long wearing lipstick that doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> After the product was passed it&#x27;s due arrival date I emailed the seller and promptly got an email back and return postage.</li>
            <li> You can even kiss without staining the other person red!</li>
            <li> I really love this Matte Red Lippies too bad though its lost</li>
            <li> You have to let it dry for 30 seconds, but after that it&#x27;ll stay on until you scrub--</li>
            <li> It does dry your lips out</li>
            <li> Just add a balm if your lips get dry</li>
            <li> I do not have dry lips</li>
            <li> It just seemed dry inside...</li>
            <li> Even though it has a mate finish, it doesn&#x27;t leave that dry feeling on your lips.</li>
            <li> Any who I ended up buying the Red Velvet shade hoping that it would be old Hollywood glamor,at least that&#x27;s how it looked in the photos...</li>
            <li> the Red Velvet one is extremely toxic and contains harmful ingredients, please do research online before purchasing!</li>
            <li> This is not a moisturizing product, so you will just be left with dry peeling red lips- which is not lovely at all.</li>
            <li> I fell asleep with it in after a long day and night at a concert and it hardly smudged my pillowcase and it was completely intact on my lips</li>
            <li> I bought black velvet from the actual website because they had a sale going on for select colors.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as drying as some other brands, and lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li> I came back and bought Wicked, Pink Velvet, and Black Velvet.</li>
            <li> Applies like a gloss, wears like a stain (as long as it doesn&#x27;t get very wet), and looks like a stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The only thing with limecrime velvetines is they need a little moisturizer applied to the sides of your lip because they begin to chip on the sides after some hours.  </li>
            <li> These Lip Velvetines are a great matte lipstick, but they arr the worst drying matte product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> So despite the small package, it will probably last a long time.</li>
            <li> So be careful it dripping on clothes when applying.</li>
            <li> This goes on wet</li>
            <li> The center of my lips always fades away</li>
            <li> The day after wearing this my lips are still pink even with face wash and makeup remover.</li>
            <li> It goes on semi wet then dries to a velvet finish.</li>
            <li> Its not as matte as I expected.</li>
            <li> However, after a couple of hours I noticed that the color was wearing off in the center of my lips.</li>
            <li> but I also have pink velvet and suede berry.</li>
            <li> I bought an eyeshadow from them a few years back</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT, I bought Salem which was a dark brown which totally works on all complexions, my only complaint is that it has such a small amount of product in it.</li>
            <li> A little product on the applicator goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The only negative I would say is that it makes my lips feel dry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard to just use makeup remover or coconut oil, but even using those the lip stain was not coming off, and due to all the rubbing and dryness</li>
            <li> Other than, dont have a meal with that color of lip gloss.</li>
            <li> and I will be purchasing other colors.</li>
            <li> I will be buying this product in some of the other colors.</li>
            <li> I felt like my lip was a little dry after I applied it</li>
            <li> Two things I don&#x27;t like, there isn&#x27;t a lot of product and the packaging even though cute, the wand applicator makes it difficult to apply a defined lip unless you use a thin lip brush.</li>
            <li> The item arrived at least 16 days earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> but now I am writing this review to warn everyone that you might be paying full price for a fake product!</li>
            <li> the color was so rich and bloody red.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too red, not too dull.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have with this is when it stains, it is so hard to take off.</li>
            <li> The color is way more bloody than I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Only reason it got 1 star is I was forced to select an option since I could not choose zero</li>
            <li> it went wet n dried matte.  </li>
            <li> and it comes off to easy :(</li>
            <li> I ordered the red velvet and was very disappointed, it was labelled &amp;#34;red velvet&amp;#34; but looked more like salem or wicked.</li>
            <li> Guess I can&#x27;t rock black.</li>
            <li> Like it but not a true stain.  </li>
            <li> The lipstick slowly starts to ball up on the dry patches and just looks aloppy and blotchy as the day goes by.</li>
            <li> It needs a little improvement..</li>
            <li> A little pricey but makeup is that way I&#x27;m finding out.</li>
            <li> It will stay on all day may need to touch up a little after eating</li>
            <li> kinda drying on fuller lips like mine due to excessive application requirement.  </li>
            <li> but nothing a little lip balm couldn&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> It also bleeds a little bit around.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little brighter than the photo.</li>
            <li> but I do like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t dry out my lips as bad as MAC&#x27;s Russian Red Matte.</li>
            <li> I brought this for a friend that she wanted so bad I told her that I get it for her when she got it early before next day</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very drying and stains my lips like crazy.</li>
            <li> It will not be a waste.</li>
            <li> Also...its an all year round color.</li>
            <li> Messy.</li>
            <li> , I wear it everyday</li>
            <li> I would not reccomend it for thin or wrinkled lips as it will only emphasize the wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> I could (and do) wear this lipstick everyday.</li>
            <li> I bought this product over a month ago and used it for a few days.</li>
            <li> Tried anti-fungal for a few days, just to cover my bases.</li>
            <li> Product was too messy when u apply it.</li>
            <li> I like to refresh it a little in the day after a few hours have past</li>
            <li> One bad thing I would have to say is it did cause my lips to be a little dry the next day</li>
            <li> because It wasn&#x27;t in her control, the post office was running a little late.</li>
            <li> Small dislike</li>
            <li> The matte texture its unbelievable and stays for hours</li>
            <li> Was not sure what this item was.</li>
            <li> In sum, not impressed, 8 hour lip color is a myth, I&#x27;ve tried everything from drugstore brands to this designer brand and they are all the same, save your money.</li>
            <li> but what can you really ask for I only do that nasty thing about once every 3 months</li>
            <li> But was disappointed as it does not last that long maybe about 4 hours</li>
            <li> Not very good.</li>
            <li> Hard to wear.</li>
            <li> Its hard to explain.</li>
            <li> I am now officially a Lime Crime fanatic.</li>
            <li> I am slowly adding to my collection.</li>
            <li> See for yourselves, the jars are practically empty!!!!!</li>
            <li> Not very happy with this item..</li>
            <li> And honestly (not to sound dramatic)</li>
            <li> but this is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> If I layer another lipstick over the center of this I don&#x27;t have that problem, but if I don&#x27;t it looks really stupid after a little while.</li>
            <li> if you use lipstick, you know how hard that is to find!</li>
            <li> does not stay on when you eat a very cheesy bad processed 7-leven hot dog</li>
            <li> Pretty much awful.</li>
            <li> get home play some game on a Saturday night cause you gotta give in to something sometimes</li>
            <li> I never received the pink one.  :-(</li>
            <li> Not Awesome.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be difficult to remove</li>
            <li> I am beyond obsessed with  this gloss.</li>
            <li> Weird color.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately after repeated attempts to make this work.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> idk i think it&#x27;s a fake.</li>
            <li> The texture out of the tube is very thin and liquid.</li>
            <li> Once I opened it I was very disappointed because the bottle seemed so dry and empty.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Two other ones are probably fake!!!</li>
            <li> Everybody went crazy over Macs RiRi woo</li>
            <li> When it claims not to, that was a DISAPPOINTMENT..</li>
            <li> , its crazy like maybe it would serve 5 uses and then run out</li>
            <li> matte lip colors usually have a nasty tough drying feel however this is not the case with Lime Crime!!</li>
            <li> I have to admit I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> Was really disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> Sorry Lime Crime!!</li>
            <li> Worst line of products that I have ever buyed...</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s devastating.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> very nice red lipstick last all day  i really like the matte finish</li>
            <li> The title is self explanatory - I had my item within a week and it was lovely. No damaging in it&#x27;s lovely purple packaging.</li>
            <li> Great product! Love it thank you 😊 highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Everybody went crazy over Macs RiRi woo but this Velvetines beats them out , it is the most amazing lipgloss(lipstick) I&#x27;ve everrrrr used. People say its to drying but it goes on better with a primer or lip balm.</li>
            <li> Best lip stain/matte EVER! The only thing... they need to make it in ALL COLORS not just in the reds.&lt;br /&gt;Once they do, I WILL BE BUYING them.&lt;br /&gt;Deff recommend if you want an all day/night stay with a striking red. :)</li>
            <li> on three different occasions I ordered 3 different shades my first was wicked and it appears to be authentic. Two other ones are probably fake!!! I got red velvet and Salem. They were runny and Salem smelled rancid! I got a refund on the Salem but now I am writing this review to warn everyone that you might be paying full price for a fake product! See how each of my packing is different for my three colors! I don&#x27;t mind replicas just don&#x27;t sell them as authentic! In the garbage with all these because I was ripped of and they smell aweful!</li>
            <li> It gets 5 stars because it lives up to the picture the deepest red velvet, long lasting, I can eat a full dinner &amp; dont have to take out my mirror  at the table to fix my lips...love  love  love  it!!</li>
            <li> LOVEEE the color and vibrancy of this product!! Yet it&#x27;s a little drying for my lips and kinda wears off easily.. When it claims not to, that was a DISAPPOINTMENT.. But I probably would get it again just because it&#x27;s such a FAB color!! Oh and I gave it 4 stars for the color.. As for the wear and drying I would say 2 stars!! It needs a little improvement.. Sorry Lime Crime!! I&#x27;m just sayin ;)</li>
            <li> I loved the red and I had ordered the pink one also.  I never received the pink one.  :-(</li>
            <li> This is probably my favorite lipstick the color is so rich it was exactly what I was looking for. I&#x27;ve had it for a couple weeks now and I wear it every time I get a chance. I received it in the mail 2 days after I ordered it so I was very happy!</li>
            <li> Very pretty and not difficult to apply.. perfect red color</li>
            <li> Love these getting some more they stay matte they stay on I like to refresh it a little in the day after a few hours have past does not stay on when you eat a very cheesy bad processed 7-leven hot dog but what can you really ask for I only do that nasty thing about once every 3 months and so it takes my lime crime off but no one knows what is in that cheese s,. as long as it doesn&#x27;t make me fat let my lipstick leave it&#x27;s mark across my bun go catch a movie get home play some game on a Saturday night cause you gotta give in to something sometimes or you may not know what being good is anymore if you don&#x27;t have some bad food and a lazy night once in a while that you spend all evening getting ready for!!! So with out all that this is great color very dramatic which I like to keep the drama to my lips and no where else. I am sure everyone will love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this lip gloss because it dries matte and its a super gorgeous color, i have ordered at least two of these since i found out about them and i am IN LOVE.</li>
            <li> Too drying on lips. Need to prime lips before wear.</li>
            <li> I really loved this product is very matte so just make sure ur lips are moisturized. It lasts a long time:) got lots of compliments wearing it:)♥</li>
            <li> Received much faster than expected and product works great. Best blue-red ever. Perfect for poolside during summer as it doesn&#x27;t rub off!</li>
            <li> With the craze going on surrounding a certain music artist doing a makeup collaboration with one of the hottest brands around, I decided to do some research and try a few other retro matte reds...this lime crime is perfect. It&#x27;s not as drying as some other brands, and lasts a really long time. No lipliner is required to prevent it from feathering and it also stays put while eating and drinking. Love this!! Hope they keep it around forever, since classic matte red will never go out of style.</li>
            <li> This lipstick is great it lasts all day even after brushing your teeth, eating, or drinking. It&#x27;s such a nice color.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Mine dried quite fast after application. Today, it lasted a solid 4 1/2 hours with eating and drinking throughout. It really is a beautiful, true red. I thought it would be really bright, but it is just a lovely, highly-pigmented velvety red. It&#x27;s absolutely beautiful. This color would work with all skin tones. Also, the applicator is small enough to be precise (if you have a steady hand), which is so handy for on-the-go touch-ups. I think this is such a beautiful, awesome product. If you want that matte, true-red, Beyonce lip, buy this. It will not be a waste.</li>
            <li> this is the PERFECT red! love it. the only thing is... you do have to exfoliate before you apply. otherwise you&#x27;ll see every crack, crease, crevice in your lips. other than that... LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Like it but not a true stain.  If I try to add lip balm because my lips are dry it all just smears right off.</li>
            <li> Very nice matte lipstick and it stays on, not cakey nor dry, though I like to put lip gloss on top sometimes.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the Velvetines collection! This color was perfect for my skin tone, and the velvet look was perfect! I have never received so many compliments just on my lipstick alone! I love the fact that you can use it by itself to give it the velvet look, or add some gloss for an extra OOMPH!!</li>
            <li> The color is way more bloody than I was expecting. I gave two stars because it does stay on your lips amazingly well and the matte finish is lovely. I just wish the color was better.</li>
            <li> I also bought the Suedeberry color, which is lighter than this. I am now officially a Lime Crime fanatic. It goes on evenly with a brush applicator. You have to let it dry for 30 seconds, but after that it&#x27;ll stay on until you scrub-- and even then, you&#x27;ll have pink lips left over. I didn&#x27;t realize it was a matte gloss, and it has the same consistency as the NYX matte lipgloss, but is definitely a better quality.</li>
            <li> I recently ordered 2 shades-pink velvet and red velvet....note these are brand new, never been used. See for yourselves, the jars are practically empty!!!!! Only reason it got 1 star is I was forced to select an option since I could not choose zero</li>
            <li> I love how it stays on all day and all night. First time I wore this I didn&#x27;t have to retouch my lips. I kept checking in the mirror and couldn&#x27;t believe it was still on. I love it! This my new favorite lip gloss. I really wish they had more colors.</li>
            <li> I just loved It. M now  thinking to purchase the other shades of lime crime :)</li>
            <li> Exellent! The best lipstick ever</li>
            <li> I love this product, but I found one similar for half the price. All in all it&#x27;s a great matte lipstick.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  Looking for more colors because I love the consistency and super long lasting...in love!</li>
            <li> Beautiful, bright, saturated red color although it dries my lips very much. Also, you have to use a lip liner or a good primer because color runs.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I have the Red Velvet and it is hands down my favorite red, my MAC Ruby Woo and Russian Red have gone unused since I bought this.  First of all it lasts pretty much all day, I usually will reapply if I eat something like a sandwich but other than that it stays put.  It does dry your lips out but that&#x27;s not a terrible trade off for me, I absoultely love the color and the matte look.</li>
            <li> Given as a gift! The person simply loves this color and ease of application.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS RED!! I always get compliments when I wear this color. Absolutely a fan.</li>
            <li> This lipstick is great! It stays on all day and looks awesome!</li>
            <li> I would deff. recommend this Lip gloss! It&#x27;s matte! and it&#x27;ll actually stay on throughout the day, I had been looking for a perfect matte red lip gloss and this is deff the one. I&#x27;ve tried a good amount of lip glosses and this one right here is the winner! deff. worth the $20.</li>
            <li> I love this lip gloss! Gives you a very pretty flat velvet red! Becareful when applying tho don&#x27;t add to much or it will look very loud.</li>
            <li> Liked it not loved, definitely dried my lips and had to reapply a couple of times.The application goes on well, just need to work fast before it dries</li>
            <li> Fast shipping item as described.</li>
            <li> I love this product! The color is super rich and stays on really well. It was worth the money and the wait for it.</li>
            <li> Way to drying  and it comes off to easy :(</li>
            <li> Great color and staying power. Just add a balm if your lips get dry</li>
            <li> This fit my needs. Perfect red. Not shiny. I am very thankful for this product. A little pricey but makeup is that way I&#x27;m finding out. I have sensitive skin &amp; don&#x27;t wear makeup a lot. When I do I go right for my red lime crime :)</li>
            <li> Barely any product in the tube. Possibly would buy again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is SO CUTE!! The color looks great even though i have zero melanin in me haha...the best part is its a stain so i don&#x27;t have to constantly run to the mirror to check my lipstick :) i love it and its well well worth the money :)</li>
            <li> I really love this Matte Red Lippies too bad though its lost I cant find it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;It is very easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;last long like 8 hrs but it kinda smear if you eat something with oil.&lt;br /&gt;Cant remove it easy unless you use oil like coconut oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy with my purchased.</li>
            <li> I love LOVE this Lime Crime Wet to matte lip stick. It is amazing. I received so many compliments on this color. It wears all day. I paired it with an NYX lip liner and it has worked very well for me.</li>
            <li> I love it...it arrived just on time</li>
            <li> SO RED!! Very Bright It will stay on all day may need to touch up a little after eating but that&#x27;s all. It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> Great liquid lipstick but a little watery. So be careful it dripping on clothes when applying.</li>
            <li> One of the best liquid lipsticks I&#x27;ve ever owned! Great quality! Red Velvet color is very universal. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Best lip product ever! Super matte and long lasting! I own 7 different colors of limecrime and I love them all!  I do wish that the amazon prices were reflective when Limecrime has sales.</li>
            <li> kinda drying on fuller lips like mine due to excessive application requirement.  Best suited for thinner lips/less application/layers for coverage.</li>
            <li> Really liquidy, and not the prettiest shade of red,  but it is infallible and long lasting.</li>
            <li> Lime Crime wasn&#x27;t very good color for woman of color. I think the quality could be a lot better. But not for woman of color.</li>
            <li> Honestly...I FREAKIN LOVE THIS PRODUCT, I bought Salem which was a dark brown which totally works on all complexions, my only complaint is that it has such a small amount of product in it. I look inside the tube and I literally just see anything, its crazy like maybe it would serve 5 uses and then run out but I guess its my prediction, I just got it, but definitely worth half or 1/3 of what I spent. Nonetheless it was very good, it lasted long but very drying to the lips so I suggest you hydrate your lips before or after applying it. The product seemed to last long but others have said different so I guess its just me. As for wiping it off I used olive oil but any type of oil works too I guess</li>
            <li> Best lip stick on planet earth. Dries matte and lasts 8+hrs. I&#x27;ve bought 3 now. I will never stop using this.</li>
            <li> LOVE THE PIGMENTATION.</li>
            <li> I JUST LOVE THIS. ITS A MUST HAVE LONG LASTING, NO LIP LINER NEEDED, QUICK DRY NOT NOT STICKY.</li>
            <li> I bought black velvet from the actual website because they had a sale going on for select colors. So I got it for $10. The product is pretty legit and smells exactly like cake batter. I haven&#x27;t worn it out for a full night or day though, so I don&#x27;t know how good the staying power is. I will say it takes a lot for it to come off willingly. I always end up having to use my lip scrub. The color is beautiful, but just not for me. Guess I can&#x27;t rock black. Excited for the red velvet that I now ordered on here and I hope it has the same great results.</li>
            <li> It has a matte finish, very velvety type texture! I am an NC50 in MAC so for the darker skin gals, just wear a lip liner so that it doesn&#x27;t wash your face out or seem like something was taped on your face.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this lip stain. I love everything about it and I get so many compliments. I will be ordering every color in this. I&#x27;m a fan for life. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best lipstick ever!!! Lasts all night, beautiful red color, matte, but you can top off with gloss.</li>
            <li> Purchased this as a Valentine&#x27;s gift for my wife. She absolutely loved it! ...and I loved seeing her with it!</li>
            <li> I like the vibrant color of this red; however it still makes my lips a little dryer than I prefer. However it stays on no matter what you do. I ate a salad with vinegar and  oil and had 2 drinks  and the lipstick was still on!!! Wow...</li>
            <li> Stays on all day, even when I eat.  My new fav RED lip.  This goes on wet and when it&#x27;s dry you have a beautiful matte red lip.  I wear with Vino lipliner by MAC.</li>
            <li> The color of this product is gorgeous and perfect. It is a beautiful red that can be layered with glosses and other lipsticks. However, I seem to have the same problem with most long wearing lipsticks. The center of my lips always fades away and I end up looking like I forgot to fill in all my lip. If I layer another lipstick over the center of this I don&#x27;t have that problem, but if I don&#x27;t it looks really stupid after a little while. It&#x27;s also very drying and stains my lips like crazy. The day after wearing this my lips are still pink even with face wash and makeup remover.</li>
            <li> Beautiful!  I waited a long time for the price to drop and then ordered.  It was a wonderful added surprise that it smells and taste like red velvet cake,  The most beautiful red lip stick I own but a little gloss on top makes it even more dramatic.  I plan to order again so I won&#x27;t ever run out.</li>
            <li> What can I say??? I love this product and I doubt I will ever use another red lipstick again because this is the holy grail of that pure red bold lip color. This product stays on until your significant other takes it off ;) Its a very true red! LIKE SUPER BOLD! Stays on even with food and drink. Two things I don&#x27;t like, there isn&#x27;t a lot of product and the packaging even though cute, the wand applicator makes it difficult to apply a defined lip unless you use a thin lip brush. But other than that this has won my heart and I am sure I have broken some hearts with it ;)</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. A little product on the applicator goes a long way. It&#x27;ll take some getting used to when applying it. Man, oh, man does it dry to an amazing matte finish. It&#x27;s beautiful. It&#x27;s definitely a must have in your collection.</li>
            <li> This is great! I can say waiting for this was totally worth it. Beautiful color, and the fact it goes on matte was even better. I recommend it</li>
            <li> This stuff is a lipstick lovers dream. Stays on for hours and hours and hours! Matte like a porcelain doll! And the perrrrfect shade of red -- and i would think for any skin shade, really. Which if you use lipstick, you know how hard that is to find! This is the end of the search for me for the perfect shake of red. An exceptional feat!</li>
            <li> I love the lip gloss its exactly what I was looking for, but the customer service is what will keep me coming back. After the product was passed it&#x27;s due arrival date I emailed the seller and promptly got an email back and return postage. It was really sweet because It wasn&#x27;t in her control, the post office was running a little late. So not only do I recommend the product but also the seller.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lipstick. It is of very good quality and it last after I ate pizza, salad, and snacked it&#x27;s just amazing and incredible. I also love the color it is vibrant and beautiful. I think it is great it might dry your lips a bit but it&#x27;s nothing chapstick can&#x27;t take care of. I will definitely be buying more of this brand and I just wish lime crime had more colors of the velvetiness all I see is red and pink but I am definitely a satisfied customer. I LOOOOVVEE IT!!!!</li>
            <li> The lime crime is so not for me. This is for 12-15 years old girls I swear. Worst line of products that I have ever buyed...</li>
            <li> Amazing, a must buy, long lasting</li>
            <li> This is my second one, and I love it, I&#x27;m able to eat , drink and the color still there !!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Stays on super well and has a lovely red color. Plus, it smells nice! Doesn&#x27;t really matter but it doesn&#x27;t hurt either. I really enjoy it. Great buy so definitely try it out!</li>
            <li> This is my first *Lime Crime purchase ever...&amp; it wont be my last. This is the Ultimate red lip color. It&#x27;s sooo sexy &amp; exotic when you wear it. I am hooked on matte lip colors because of this Red lippie. It goes on semi wet then dries to a velvet finish. You do not need any type of lip liner or top coat. It speaks for itself if worn alone. Also...its an all year round color. Luv it!!!</li>
            <li> Beautiful matte coverage and long wearing. It does dry your lips a bit, but I haven&#x27;t found a long wearing lipstick that doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best lipstick i have ever purchased! I would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> Best lipstick  ever! Love the pigment. ..it stays on forever</li>
            <li> This lip gloss is so amazing. It goes on like a lip gloss and dries off like a high quality matte lipstick! And it is MATTE ! It makes your lips look plush and to die for ! As a deep brown skin girl, I was worried that it would be too bright and it was but if you put one layer of black lipstick under or add some dark eyeshadow before you put it on, it looks amazing. It honestly is better, in my opinion, than Ruby Woo by Mac. I absolutely love this lip gloss and I&#x27;ve already purchased two!</li>
            <li> Its not as matte as I expected. It is tricky to put on. Be quick!</li>
            <li> I like the matte color it has. But was disappointed as it does not last that long maybe about 4 hours and then it jus leaves your lips with and outline.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t put on well.  Doesn&#x27;t wear well.  Need lip liner, then blot, another lipstick, and maybe still another lipstick on top to make it look right.</li>
            <li> I brought this for a friend that she wanted so bad I told her that I get it for her when she got it early before next day she was very happy. Not a bad price 😀😊</li>
            <li> I got this product recommended to me by my cousin because everyone knows I love red lipstick and this is without a doubt my favorite one the color is phenomenal and it stays for so long I get compliments all the time whenever I wear it (: I looooooove it (:</li>
            <li> oh i loved how much cheaper it is to buy it on here. and this lip gloss of magic is amazing i love how smooth it go on make my lips pop i just love it!!</li>
            <li> I read all of the great reviews on this product and decided to try it out. My lips naturally have a lot of creases in them. This product sat awkwardly on my lips and creased very easily on my lips.</li>
            <li> It is very dry, but it looks GREAT when freshly applied... you may want to take time to exfoliate between applications.</li>
            <li> This lipstick goes on smooth and lasts long without transferring onto the cups you drink out of. It goes on like a liquid so you have to be careful with the application, especially because it is a lip stain. It might help to outline your lips with lip liner before filling it in with this stain.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot darker red than what it appears to be in pictures</li>
            <li> This product is deceiving. It looks like the perfect red, but when I received it it is a super bright red that looks clownish on my medium deep skin. Pretty upset since I spent $20 especially since the formula is super drying! If bright red dry lips are your thing I highly recommend, but if not buyer beware!</li>
            <li> I love it but I will say it&#x27;s not bulletproof. Oily food and kisses are susceptible to smudging but otherwise it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a ceaseless red lipstick wearer, so I&#x27;m always on the lookout for the perfect product. And honestly (not to sound dramatic) I have been looking for this product my whole makeup wearing life. It&#x27;s opaque like non-other, transfer resistant without feeling heavy like all the liquid lipsticks I&#x27;ve used in the past, in fact it&#x27;s so light I forget its on. Perfectly matte without being drying. The most perfect shade of red. And a yummy cupcake smell. I&#x27;ve never found a product that was this perfect for me and truly a holy grail product.</li>
            <li> Love that it stays for a good amount of time. But does not look as velvety as shown. Over all... Still liked it a lot!!</li>
            <li> I ordered red velvet and got Salem with a sticker saying red velvet. Not Awesome.</li>
            <li> Love it. I thought it would be difficult to remove once i wanted it off it wasn&#x27;t. Did not smug easy. .</li>
            <li> This \\&quot;gloss\\&quot; is amazing! I say gloss in quotations as there isn&#x27;t anything glossy about it. Just after applying this color it sets to a fabulous deep red matte. Stunning color and the staying power was a pleasant surprise. My &#x27;go to&#x27; red from now on. Small dislike: you must apply this color to clean, unchapped lips or it&#x27;ll look yucky! Also, apply carefully to lip line because its very runny right out of the tube.</li>
            <li> Love this product could wear it all night long</li>
            <li> I am beyond obsessed with  this gloss. It does pill up if your not careful but for the most part, things like drinking or even kissing isnt a problem lol and it doesnt get everywhere once it dries.</li>
            <li> I love this lipstick! It is a perfect matte red it stays on without drying the lips! Will buy again!</li>
            <li> This is a red that looks good on everyone. It&#x27;s not too red, not too dull. Not shiny, but a nice matte finish that really stays put! Apply once and it stays all day, except after eating. Other than that, it&#x27;s almost perfect. The pink velvet is also beautiful.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift and it was very well-received. I even borrow it from them.. So I might buy another one for myself!</li>
            <li> Long wear and true red color.People must have it after I wear this lip over 8 hrs.Then it still on my lip. Loveeee it</li>
            <li> After watching a youtube video on it I decided to give it a try. I put it on as soon as I received it in the mail and the color was so rich and bloody red. One suggestion do not apply lip balm or chapstick over it instead apply it before you use it. I felt like my lip was a little dry after I applied it so I put my EOS lip balm so the lip stick did not stick too well on my lips. When I dabbed my lips with tissue it came off. However the formula is very unique it really does go on liquidy and you have to work quickly before it dries. Once it dries it looks wonderful. One bad thing I would have to say is it did cause my lips to be a little dry the next day but nothing a little lip balm couldn&#x27;t fix. My boyfriend is not big on lipsticks but he loved this one. I hope to purchase more soon.</li>
            <li> I am in a charity pin up group where we have a kissing booth. This stain is the perfect red for all skin tones and stays put! It dries to a beautiful matte red color with blue undertones, making your smile pop without yellowing your teeth. I was also very impressed with the promptness I received it after ordering. A favorite for sure!</li>
            <li> it doesnt rub off, it dries matte but keeps your lips smooth not dried out or powdery feeling, color looks great on various skin tones. I love it</li>
            <li> Not very good. Messy. Weird color. Hard to wear. Pretty much awful.</li>
            <li> I buy the Red Velvet and received the Salem.&lt;br /&gt;I live in Brasil.</li>
            <li> Perfect matte red lipstick, applies like a lip gloss and dries like cover-up. It&#x27;s fairly wearable but does come off a bit when eating, drinking (and kissing! ;P ). Overall I&#x27;m happy about it, I wear it everyday and it&#x27;s not oily and won&#x27;t melt off my mouth in the heat. Big plus, comes off easily unlike many of the 18 Hr lipsticks you can buy at the drugstore which will stay on you mouth for days without a thorough scrubbing.</li>
            <li> This product was not as good as i thought it would be, the lipsick dried out my lips and i had to use lots of lipgloss to counteract that effect, which then led to the lipstick getting on everything and did not stay like a lipstain should.</li>
            <li> Great excellent lipstick works just like it says!</li>
            <li> the Red Velvet one is extremely toxic and contains harmful ingredients, please do research online before purchasing!</li>
            <li> Stays great and looks amazing! Drys quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel sticky. It does have a tendency to smudge or wipe off while eating. But stayed great while drinking or just talking and normal wear.</li>
            <li> This is the best red lipstick I have ever used. You rarely have to reapply, and you never have to worry about lip to teeth color mishaps. Beautiful color.</li>
            <li> I completely love it! The matte texture its unbelievable and stays for hours, the smell is delicious, I highly recommend it if you are looking for the perfect red lips look.</li>
            <li> Love it. It&#x27;s brighter than my ruby and riri woo.</li>
            <li> I love this nude/pink color.  I have gotten plenty of compliments on the color.  The only thing with limecrime velvetines is they need a little moisturizer applied to the sides of your lip because they begin to chip on the sides after some hours.  I love how it dries and is super matte. Just remember bring some eos or lip balm just to apply on the sides of your lips to avoid crusty like residue.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately after repeated attempts to make this work. It just was not what it says it is. After even 20 minutes it bleeds &amp; cracks &amp; rubs off. I wanted so much for this to finally be my go to stay shade. But sadly it is not. Maybe it is just me. Because I know for a lot I people they love it. I guess it&#x27;s just something you have to try to see if it works for you. The shade is gorgeous! Just won&#x27;t stay for me.</li>
            <li> I love this! It stays on so well and lasts all day. It applies easily with the doefoot applicator. The color is a true red and is very classic.</li>
            <li> Great color and nice smell however, it began to peel/flake within one hour.  Not impressed.</li>
            <li> Good seller, great product!</li>
            <li> The red is a little bright, I wish it was darker but I do like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t dry out my lips as bad as MAC&#x27;s Russian Red Matte. I put on a darker red liner and it works fine.</li>
            <li> Love this color and texture. I&#x27;ve loved other types like DOSE and it can be so drying and crack. This LIME CRIME is amazingggggg and soft feels like it isn&#x27;t on. Of course when eating or drinking it will lightly fades. But stays on great otherwise. Will for sure be reorder and get other colors! :)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand all the hype about this product.  I received this product on time, and was so excited to try it out because I had done massive amounts of research for months on youtube, instagram, tumblr, even yahoo/google pages. 95% of the reviews were good, and then other obviously not so good. I am the 5%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product completely sucked all the moisture out of my lips. I do not have dry lips (I take care of them, lip balm, lip scrubs, etc.) but within five minutes of having this product on I could feel my lips tightening and drying. Within twenty or thirty minutes of having it on it started to crumble and my lips looked awful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And removing this lip stain is a complete pain in the neck. I&#x27;ve heard to just use makeup remover or coconut oil, but even using those the lip stain was not coming off, and due to all the rubbing and dryness my lips became complete chapped and bled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only good things about this product are the cute packaging, and it does smell like cookies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that it drys out your lips, doesn&#x27;t stay on nearly as long as it&#x27;s intended to, it does transfer, it crumbles, and it is incredibly difficult to take off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product to anyone, please do not waste your money on this like I did.</li>
            <li> Love love love my Lime Crime Velvetine lipstick ! It last so long and dries really nicely ! Worth every penny !</li>
            <li> This product is not a lip gloss, as stated in the product name. This is a liquid lipstick and it is pure magic. I have worn this lipstick from 6:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. without having to reapply once. It is a matte, rich, old Hollywood style blue-toned red. It doesn&#x27;t bleed or smear, even through eating and drinking. Because it is matte, it is necessary to exfoliate and moisturize before using it, or every flaw will show. I will definitely be buying this again!</li>
            <li> Love it it&#x27;s my new fav go to aside from macs ruby woo my go too and dries up very velvety</li>
            <li> I had to save and wait and wait for this to get back in stock but it was very much worth the effort. I love it &amp;lt;3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can see my review of it on Youtube here: [...]</li>
            <li> Was not sure what this item was. Thought it was a gloss or liquid lipstick. But its a lipstain. But it also is like a lipstick. Its hard to explain. I gave it 5 stars because the pigment is lovely and long wearing. I ordered the red velvet. Hopefully lim crime will come out with more colors. Lime crime is vegan and made in the United States. So that&#x27;s good to know also.</li>
            <li> Amazing I have searched high and low for this shade of red it awesome stays put ! All day ! Kiss ,drink what have you it&#x27;s going no ware !</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t see what the big deal is about this lip stain, it&#x27;s exspensive and it dries out your lips and there is no way to make your mouth more comfortable by applying a emollient topcoat without smearing the stain.  if you eat or drink ANYTHING it will fade in the inner lip and need to be reapplied.  because it is so drying I would not reccomend it for thin or wrinkled lips as it will only emphasize the wrinkles.  I cannot think of any situation where I would wear this other than in a hot humid climate where I won&#x27;t be eating or drinking for several hours, so maybe Florida :P. In sum, not impressed, 8 hour lip color is a myth, I&#x27;ve tried everything from drugstore brands to this designer brand and they are all the same, save your money.</li>
            <li> It definitely has a matte finish and the color is very pretty. I found it easy to apply and it dries fast. However, after a couple of hours I noticed that the color was wearing off in the center of my lips. It also bleeds a little bit around. For me this does not last all day..couple of hours max. It smell good though..but I am not going to buy this again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got staying power, highly pigmented and a great value! I bought this off a recommendation from Kandee Johnson, (youtube makeup maven) and was not disappointed. Love love love!</li>
            <li> The price shows the quality of the lip gloss. It stays on for hours on end and it doesn&#x27;t leave lip stains. The best red lip gloss that I&#x27;ve ever used! Its a lip gloss with a lipstick look.</li>
            <li> Love this product, its long lasting, it doesn&#x27;t dry your lips and it goes perfectly with my caramel skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy and stock girls!!:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you love red, you gonna love this particular shade especially if you dark of complexion. This product makes you look hot and sassy!!:)</li>
            <li> This product was high on my &amp;#34;to-buy&amp;#34; list - and I have to admit I&#x27;m disappointed. The color is pretty, but it&#x27;s really drying, and the color transfers from my lips to EVERYTHING.</li>
            <li> IT LOOKS AMAZING ON !!!!!!! GREAT PRODUCT WOULD RECOMMEND TO A FRIEND! LIME CRIME HAS THE MOST AMAZING COLORS AND CUTE LIPSTICKS.</li>
            <li> Red Velvet is a color that anyone can pull off. It looks gorgeous on pale skin and on tan skin! Works beautifully for deeper tones too! The red is so purely pigmented, that a little goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;This is easily one of the best lip products I&#x27;ve enjoyed.</li>
            <li> I love limecrime. I would be a spokesman for them if that was an actual job. I could (and do) wear this lipstick everyday. All of their colors are perfect, this review is for red velvet but I also have pink velvet and suede berry. They are all perfect. Red velvet is the perfect shade of red, its bright without being overwhelming and has no organge tones to it. It goes on smooth like a gloss and then dries like a matte lipstick. I only need to reapply depending on what I am eating. Red velvet is the only lipstick I reorder as soon as it comes out because I know I dont like any other similar product as much.</li>
            <li> Its not a lipstick you put on in the car. You must be stable! Once its on, its ON! But that being said, I have yet to find a brand of velvetines I like more. NYX has a line that is supposed to compare but its garbage. Doesn&#x27;t apply well at all. Lime Crime looks nearly flawless all day and smells nice and tastes nice (girls, you all know that you&#x27;ve tasted your lipstick whether its on purpose or not!) Love this stuff! I am slowly adding to my collection. Worth the $$</li>
            <li> Amazing product! The color is beautiful.</li>
            <li> http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/EnforcementActions/WarningLetters/2015/ucm456525.htm</li>
            <li> Not as long lasting as I hoped. Bleeds even with lip liner. Color is awesome!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little brighter than the photo. it&#x27;s easy to apply, though the brush it comes with is not exact. it stays on all day and only requires touch ups if you eat something oily. i love it!</li>
            <li> I love this! It lasts ALL day, gorgeous color, gorgeous finish, exactly what I wanted. It&#x27;s the perfect lip stain</li>
            <li> I love how velvety the application is matte lip colors usually have a nasty tough drying feel however this is not the case with Lime Crime!!</li>
            <li> Quite a decent lip stain. Last a good length of time, but is very drying.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear this! But I got it as a gift for my adult daughter who raves over it and it really looks &amp;#34;retro&amp;#34; great on her.</li>
            <li> Dried my lips out quite a bit and looked less velvetty and more powdery flaky. Was really disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> Ultimate Red lip of all time last forever</li>
            <li> I bought this on a recommondation, hoping that I too could get that look.  Wow, sure did!  Goes on nicely without running into lip lines, because it drys instantly.  Its now my go to Red!</li>
            <li> Love love this lipstick!!!</li>
            <li> I have been buying from Lime Crime for a while now and yet another fantastic product.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this lip stain because it has a matte finish! I have been looking for the perfect dark red matte finish&lt;br /&gt;lip stain for a long time. (I am kind of eager to try out the lighter red color, as a side note) but, the only con about this product is that if you want it to stay that deep red all day you have to apply it once or twice. Which in all honestly I am definitely fine with because just like a normal lipstick you have to re apply, but with normal lipstick you have to re apply even more. This product stays in place on your lips, does not move around at all and I totally recommend it if you are looking for that nice matte finish!</li>
            <li> My first limecrime product. I was very impressed! Love it went wet n dried matte.  Color stayed forever. Love the color. You also dont have to apply so many times.</li>
            <li> really like these, a little to dry for my liking but the color is beautiful. Good staying power. I&#x27;m satisfied :)</li>
            <li> Kinda drying so you need to have your lips moisturized prior to wearing it. Otherwise I love that it&#x27;s warm and the color is just awesome. Oh and it does last, a lot.</li>
            <li> I finally found the true &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; color of lipstick in Lime Crime Velvetines.....however. After a meal, it begins to &amp;#34;bleed&amp;#34; around the outer side of your lips. I am trying to figure out for that not to happen, but no results yet. Other than, dont have a meal with that color of lip gloss. But I do love the true red!!  Thanks.</li>
            <li> GREAT color, GREAT staying power.  You do have to have decent hand eye coordination to apply, because it is a liquid, and it will stain instantly.  The color looks excellent with both my super pale (White) skin and my friend&#x27;s darker (Indian) skin.  I&#x27;ll be buying this again when it runs out, and she&#x27;s planning to buy some for herself as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also-- this stuff smells amazing.  Like the most intense vanilla cookie taste.  Its so great.  And once it dries, you can kiss your partner without any fear of smudging, which is ALSO so great.  Unlike other reviewers, I&#x27;ve found that even with my lips not in perfect shape, the color is pigmented enough that it looks smooth and even.  And I do enjoy the matte finish.  It is slightly drying, but worth it.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to learn about this product and was very excited to try my own. Most reviews I read or watched were positive and expressed how moisturizing this product is. While this is true, I find that it bleeds, takes much longer to dry than expressed and transfers more easily than I would have hoped. Over all a good product but I will not repurchase!</li>
            <li> I love this lipstick and the matte look it gives. The only negative I would say is that it makes my lips feel dry and it can still rub off. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s normal because I never wear lipstick. But I love it!!</li>
            <li> LOVE this product lol its a pretty deep red , very opaque and it is a stain so i dont have to worry about accidentally wiping it or smearing it or re putting on more lipstick .. its not glossy when it dries , thisis just GORG . ! :]</li>
            <li> I bought this product over a month ago and used it for a few days. I liked it, but noticed quickly it was drying out my lips. I&#x27;ve been wearing MAC Ruby Woo for years without any dryness problems, so I just stepped up my lip preparation and care and kept wearing it. After 4 or 5 times my lips were so dry, even the outside of my mouth was red. I stopped wearing it and for the last month have been trying everything possible to get my lips back to normal - no luck. It&#x27;s possible I was allergic to an ingredient - I&#x27;ve heard LimeCrime uses unsafe ingredients - but this is ridiculous. I&#x27;m constantly coating my lips in aquaphor, constantly drinking water. I tried a regimen of neosporin, which helped. Tried anti-fungal for a few days, just to cover my bases. I have no idea what this did to my lips, but it&#x27;s devastating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been watching lime crime products since they first appeared and always wanted to try them but they&#x27;re on the pricey side so I was always worried about buying them. I bought an eyeshadow from them a few years back and I&#x27;ve been scratched the surface. It looks beautiful and lasts forever. So after seeing a bunch of ladies test it out on Instagram I finally decided to try it. That and it was an emotional impulse purchase but I digress. Any who I ended up buying the Red Velvet shade hoping that it would be old Hollywood glamor,at least that&#x27;s how it looked in the photos... When I received it in it&#x27;s beautiful package I ripped it open to test it out except it looked red. Very bright apple red. It didn&#x27;t looked back on my skintone(I&#x27;m brown with hints of red) but, it wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for. But, the good news is you can layer it. So if it&#x27;s too light try applying a darker shade first then the lipstick on top. It dries naturally and mixes well. Oh and it lasts forever! I slept in it after a party and woke up with my lipstick still on perfectly. I love it.</li>
            <li> Awesome lasting color</li>
            <li> Love, love, love it!, I&#x27;m a customer for life. It&#x27;s as discribed and it&#x27;s very easy to work with as far as applying how much or how bright you want it. I love this brand and I will be purchasing other colors.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good liquid lipstick</li>
            <li> I fell asleep with it in after a long day and night at a concert and it hardly smudged my pillowcase and it was completely intact on my lips</li>
            <li> Teenage daughter loves it. Was looking for a particular name brand of a similar product. This was less expensive and seems to be just as good as what she originally hoped for.</li>
            <li> It dries to a matte finish. It does not last as long as I had hoped but I really go like the look.</li>
            <li> Applies like a gloss, wears like a stain (as long as it doesn&#x27;t get very wet), and looks like a stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put this on last night to a fancy dinner with my partner&#x27;s parents. We had sushi, so it&#x27;s something that rubs against your lips a lot unless you want to cut/bite the pieces into smaller ones. The lip gloss lasted the entire meal, plus in my exhaustion I forgot to clean it off (and figured it had worn off while I brushed my teeth before bed), it lasted beautifully overnight, And through me brushing my teeth this morning. But, then when I decided to wipe it off for the day, it came off fairly easily with just a paper towel dipped in a bit of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended and beautiful.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay on as long as suedeberry does but its so nice when it&#x27;s matte that you probably need to touch it up once.</li>
            <li> I love these velvetines sooo much! This is my second bottle so far and I will definitely be purchasing more in the future!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a long lasting lipstick/stain this is definitely the one I bought all 3 colors after trying it it lasts for hours and hours no need for touch ups I just wish they had more colors</li>
            <li> The item arrived at least 16 days earlier than expected. I bought the pink velvet color from another seller before this red velvet and all I can say is this is much better than the pink velvet cause this looks classy and sophisticated. I like how it is red red and it stays longer than my other lipsticks/gloss, maybe because it is matte,  though I have a Revlon matte finish too but this one stays so much longer. The only problem I have with this is when it stains, it is so hard to take off. So my advise, when applying make sure you always have qtips and makeup remover with you.</li>
            <li> Holy smokes this stuff is awesome! See it to believe it, great shade, great staying power, easy application. Wish Amazon carried more through prime!</li>
            <li> Was honestly expecting this to be a dupe or a rip off (no offense) but it&#x27;s not! But with confidence also very fast shipping and reasonably priced too. Cheers!!</li>
            <li> The product title was misleading. FRESH BOTANICA Would not admit this and refused to accept responsibility in taking advantage of their customer. Product was titled a lip gloss and is in fact a stain. SO BEWARE!! Purchased the product because of Lime Crime&#x27;s animal rights activism but not happy with FRESH BOTANICA misrepresenting what the product actually was.</li>
            <li> great red color with blue undertones. it&#x27;s long lasting. matte finish. i mix it with another wine color to give it more depth or wear just alone.&lt;br /&gt;this does tend to be dry so using a lip balm prior to use is recommended. you need makeup remover to take this off.</li>
            <li> AWESOME!!! I absolutely love the matte finish and the fact that it does not rub off or smudge makes it well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Dries my lips my search continues</li>
            <li> The color is so bright and vibrant and it is not goopy, or heavy. I love this! I even bought a second color.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lipstick!! It has a beautiful red color and stays on almost all day.. You may have to reapply for a tad bit of touch up but that&#x27;s normal right? I highly recommend this product to anyone that loves liquid to matte lipsticks.</li>
            <li> These Lip Velvetines are a great matte lipstick, but they arr the worst drying matte product I have ever used. The lipstick slowly starts to ball up on the dry patches and just looks aloppy and blotchy as the day goes by. Lovely packaging but the NYX Matte Lip Creams are much more foregiving on dry lips than this product is.</li>
            <li> Absolute must have. I&#x27;ve tried many many different brands and different reds, this one is the best! Save your time and money! Must have</li>
            <li> The color payoff and longevity are excellent.  I love the texture of the lip gloss.  It almost wears like a stain more than a lipstick or  gloss.</li>
            <li> Not very happy with this item.. Once I opened it I was very disappointed because the bottle seemed so dry and empty.&lt;br /&gt;It bearly had any liquid inside. It just seemed dry inside...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand what all the fuss is about with this product. I like the color and it indeed smells like cake.. But if you eat or drink ANYTHING it comes off. Just like my not matte lipstick.. So if you are seeking true longevity, don&#x27;t eat or drink! Haha.. Also was kind of dissapointed about the dry feeling after a couple hours. Eh, I&#x27;ll stick with MAC.</li>
            <li> Perfect shade of red!!! If looks great and it feels great! It goes matte quickly and it does not leave a sticky feeling!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best bright blue-red lip long-lasting product I&#x27;ve ever tried. The texture out of the tube is very thin and liquid. Working quickly is a must. Also, if your lips are dry, peeling or cracked, make sure you exfoliate and hydrate them before using this gloss.&lt;br /&gt;The color saturation is massive. This is no sheer lip! It dries down in about 30 seconds to a lovely soft matte finish. So if you&#x27;re looking for that glassy-glossy texture, this is NOT what you want.&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a matte, non-shimmer, flat color that looks like it came off the silver screen in Hollywood&#x27;s Golden Age? Then buy this gloss!&lt;br /&gt;Goes on like a gloss, wears like a stain but looks like a strong matte lipstick.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product. The color is fantastic with staying power. It can be used alone but I actually use it over another matte lipstick for my own perfect red. I would highly recommend this product. I will be buying this product in some of the other colors.</li>
            <li> This product is everything it promises. Goes on like a gloss, dries to a beautiful matte. This is the best &amp;#34;lipstick&amp;#34; I have ever used. It goes on so lovely, and stays vibrant. You can even kiss without staining the other person red! This would be perfect for a wedding day (or every day.) It&#x27;s pricey, but worth it for such a quality product. I only wish it came on more shades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be warned, if your lips are dry or peeling- exfoliate first! You will not be happy if you apply over dry, cracked or peeling lips. This is not a moisturizing product, so you will just be left with dry peeling red lips- which is not lovely at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered red velvet before and the color was as expected and I loved it. I was running out and the seller I purchased from before did not have any in stock, so I had to purchase from another seller, thinking it would be the same. I ordered the red velvet and was very disappointed, it was labelled &amp;#34;red velvet&amp;#34; but looked more like salem or wicked. I sent it back.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It smells wonderful, and it&#x27;s really creamy going on to your lips. It dries quickly, which is awesome. There is some transfer while eating and drinking, especially if you&#x27;ve been wearing it for a while. The color is very pigmented and rich and compliments my skin tone perfectly. It&#x27;s a smidgen darker than Sephora&#x27;s Always Red, and doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out my lips as much. I noticed that it wears down a little around the inner part of the lip during the day, but that&#x27;s really the only place you need to reapply. I want to buy the pink shade next, once I have the money. EDIT: I came back and bought Wicked, Pink Velvet, and Black Velvet. Wicked was a bit browner than I expected, but it still looks great. Pink Velvet was incredibly bright and the photos I took honestly didn&#x27;t do it justice. It&#x27;s a beautiful, bold color. I just received Black Velvet, and I am in love. They&#x27;re all gorgeous colors and I love wearing them.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of this lippie. It is perfect! Doesnt dry out and rarely needs reapplication!</li>
            <li> Super good red color. Love limecrime love the velvetines.  Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> very much a beauty essential, especially if you are into the 1950s vintage burlesque pinup and hollywood look. photographs nicely as well</li>
            <li> This product came to solve all lipstick problems. Even though it has a mate finish, it doesn&#x27;t leave that dry feeling on your lips. No other product can compare In therms of durability and not tranfering to other surfaces. It is also very economic. With 1-2 brushes you get the job done. So despite the small package, it will probably last a long time. The only thing is that it takes a little practice to apply, since it is so very pigmented, you could end up painting more then you had wished.</li>
            <li> Soft and velvety, fun to dress up with a bold red lip. Very pleased with this item.</li>
            <li> Idk about this one but i own a few lime crime liquid lipsticks they are amazing  n they never let my lips feel semi sticky like this one feels idk i think it&#x27;s a fake.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST makeup I have ever used. It is long lasting and the colors are gorgeously saturated!</li>
            <li> Every thing I thought and more...</li>
            <li> LOVE IT. I also have and have used wicked.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my cousin in brazil, and she loved it!!  It does dry quick so you have to work quick with it.</li>
            <li> It get worn out butI love the color.So just have to reapply it time after time.Especially after eating or drinking.</li>
            <li> Product was too messy when u apply it. Also very hard to clean up.</li>
