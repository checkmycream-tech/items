            <li>think it works perfectly awesome if you know how to use to it .i</li>
            <li>That being said, this is actually a really great eye lash curler, probably the one with the greatest effects that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very impressed, another great purchase from e.l.f.</li>

            <li>The good:  </li>
            <li>It seems to be fairly well-made</li>
            <li>I have an ancient Shu Uemura lash curler, and though it may not be fair to compare the e.l.f.</li>
            <li>After playing with it for a while, it did do a good job of curling my lashes.</li>
            <li>You get a good elf bootie and it can stay curled up for quite awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this because of the good ratings.  </li>
            <li>This product is good.</li>
            <li>i recommend you to buy this if you want your eyelashes to look good and longg .</li>
            <li>but it is a good eyelash curler</li>
            <li>So I looked online and was happy to see it here and pay more than I would in the store.  </li>
            <li>read instructions before using it its great product and one thing more</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect size, it&#x27;s shaped just right to grab my lashes, and the effect is noticeable.</li>
            <li>(can&#x27;t believe the price listed here is over the top!)  </li>
            <li>and I love the fact that a replacement for the eye piece is included!</li>
            <li>The quality of the product is great, appears strong and well made for sure!</li>
            <li>The curler cut off my eyelashes the first 2 uses!!!!</li>
            <li>It,s good to use,fit my eyes,but it is very cheap</li>
            <li>They are great quality and cheap</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll pump it on my top lashes for a good 20 seconds, and my eyelashes stay put.  </li>
            <li>i really liked this eyelash curler</li>
            <li>this s a really nice affordable curler for lashes</li>
            <li>Great eyelash curler!&lt;br /&gt;Works fine and is easy to use .</li>
            <li>So I have found my own way which works a lot better.</li>
            <li>They are very comfortable in my hand and curl the lashes without any pulling or pinching.</li>
            <li>Beware, it may seem like a great cheap item at first, but it could turn on you too!</li>
            <li>Great product, but doesn&#x27;t curl eyelashes as much as i&#x27;d like it to. .</li>
            <li>I got it only after 2-3 days and it was working perfectly.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s one in each bathroom, plus most of my purses and travel kits.)  </li>
            <li>You know spreading  their magic  medic elf dust and causing all kinds a mischief.&lt;br</li>
            <li>For MANY years I used Maybelline(sp.)</li>
            <li>But i&#x27;m not 100% sure.</li>
            <li>I also bought this for a dollar, since I didn&#x27;t feel like shelling out more for a higher-end brand.  </li>
            <li>and they worked WAY better than this does.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My eye lashes curled up more so than my hair on a rainy day.  </li>
            <li>love this curler.  </li>
            <li>I can confidently recommend this to others.</li>
            <li>I only put it for like  5 seconds and the effects it has are so awesome.</li>
            <li>Made my $1 return to Target and went on my merry way :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s an OK product.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Hi I love this product I used to buy the MAC eyelash curler but its a bit pricey.</li>
            <li>and I have to say I love ALL elf products.</li>
            <li>Instead of curling and lifting, it more just crimps them upward.</li>
            <li>i heard many raves about this product</li>
            <li>and I love that fact that it comes withthe replacement plastic pad.</li>
            <li>i love this eyelash curler</li>
            <li>I love my e.l.f. eyelash curler.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I love this eyelash curler.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so comfortable, too!</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;d say if you just want a cheap eyelash curler and are willing to work with it a bit to get the effect you want, this one is a great bargain.  </li>
            <li>-- it&#x27;s as good as the much higher priced curlers.</li>
            <li>It really does a nice job of curing my eyelashes and doesn&#x27;t pull off my mascara with it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good, even though sometimes it doesn&#x27;t always curl.</li>
            <li>and I love the fact you can buy replacement pads for really cheap</li>
            <li>Its easy to use</li>
            <li>the price, I think its something good to use on a daily basis, just to get that neutral kind of look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This may be perfect for Uma Thurman but as a normal person with normal eyes</li>
            <li>lash curlers and they seemed fine.  </li>
            <li>Since I found this I rather save $$ and does curl my eyelashes perfectly just like MAC&#x27;s just a lot less.</li>
            <li>I love elf cosmetics because they are so cheap and work tremendously well.</li>
            <li>I got this little eye lash curler for a dollar, which is really awesome.  </li>
            <li>The grip/handles are comfortable and it does curl your lashes well.</li>
            <li>They work well and fit comfortably into my hand.</li>
            <li>I bought this because it was cheap</li>
            <li>But it may fit Americans well.</li>
            <li>cheap and not handles</li>
            <li>Totally worth it :)</li>
            <li>Cheap.</li>
            <li>I fabulously recommend it.</li>
            <li>So far, it doesn&#x27;t seem to have any tendency to pinch (a hazard with all eyelash curlers)and does a good job curling.  </li>
            <li>it works really good better than all of the ones i had , my eyelashes look verry long</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d had good experience with the elf tweezers and lip glosses -- and amazingly this one, even with its silicon pad, worked far better than the \\&quot;name brand\\&quot; ones I&#x27;d tried in recent years.  </li>
            <li>I have had two of these curlers over the last several years and love them - best curler</li>
            <li>and i was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>But if you want a sturdy reliable tool that works great, spend a few bucks more and get the Shu Uemura one.</li>
            <li>I have boughten most of the e.l.f makeup brushes and they are wonderful, so I expected this eyelash curler to be the same.</li>
            <li>I am throwing it out a paying more for a reasonable one</li>
            <li>They were easy to use and helped make my eyes look pretty</li>
            <li>This eyelash curler is seriously the best thing ever.</li>
            <li>It shipped amazingly quick.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several different eyelash curlers over the years and this one is the best one yet.</li>
            <li>The size fits my eye shape perfectly and doesn&#x27;t pinch or pull out any of my lashes, the handle is very comfortable to hold and the little rubber pads on the inside seem like they will last for awhile.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ironic as this claims to have a special design that &amp;#34;suits all eye shapes&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li>and ships super duper fast!!</li>
            <li>Makes my lashes look great, its not like any other!</li>
            <li>So, I bought a new one on Amazon for marginally more than at the store.</li>
            <li>This ELF eyelash curler is quite cheaply made and doesn&#x27;t really hold a curl well.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>I have never gotten such amazing results.  </li>
            <li>Worth the price, if you are looking for a quality eyelash curler</li>
            <li>They are worth it for the price.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money and then some.</li>
            <li>This is so worth what I paid for it.  </li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite eyelash curler.</li>
            <li>Other than that is a good curler</li>
            <li>RIGHT</li>
            <li>Very professional and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I LOVE e.l.f products in general and</li>
            <li>I have tried it against my face every which way, and watched multiple youtube videos to make sure that I&#x27;m holding it the right way...</li>
            <li>Although, I have owned this twice in the past two years because it breaks kind of easily.</li>
            <li>but it works very very well.</li>
            <li>The way that this curler is made doesn&#x27;t allow me to get a good angle up close to my eye, the plastic finger grips get in the way a little.</li>
            <li>I use this eyelash curler daily and love it for the ease of use.</li>
            <li>I finally can have my eyelashes be seen :)</li>
            <li>This thing seems well made for the price, and does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li>THANKS ELF!</li>
            <li>This wasn&#x27;t the first time i purchased an eyelash curler</li>
            <li>Yes you may pinch your eyelid occasionally if your not paying attention but that happens with most eyelash curlers.</li>
            <li>then I test it on the back of my hand to be sure I can handle the heat before curling my lashes with it followed by mascara.</li>
            <li>I have never used any lashes curler before it&#x27;s my first time that i ordered it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all you&#x27;d want from an eyelash curler: a firm grip, a good curl without damaging or pulling out lashes and an affordable price.</li>
            <li>I have been using eyelash curlers pretty much since the Dawn of Man. &#x27;</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, if you are looking for an eyelash curler to hold a curl pretty much all day, this will not do it for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Got it at a decent price!</li>
            <li>and I like the extra little finger rest on the handle which gives great control.</li>
            <li>She really likes it....</li>
            <li>I started being more careful on why I had no lashes there</li>
            <li>This eyelash curler went straight to the trash since now</li>
            <li>It really makes you wonder about the profit margin for cosmetic companies.</li>
            <li>and it came in mail verry fast</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>and I was very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;the</li>
            <li>The curler itself is much cheaper there as well.</li>
            <li>This curler is much smaller than my old one--and I love that it doesn&#x27;t require as much storage space in my cosmetics pouch.  </li>
            <li>It gets the job done, smoothly, and came with extra cushion.</li>
            <li>i really do.</li>
            <li>Aside from that it curls very well</li>
            <li>It fits very well  </li>
            <li>but it doesint really curl my lashes</li>
            <li>and I thought it was reasonable.</li>
            <li>The rubber piece stays much longer.</li>
            <li>I tried  it and it worked very well on my lashes without pinching my eyelid .i</li>
            <li>Its been over a few months and my eyelashes are still short and I look goofy now when I put mascara on the eyelashes that weren&#x27;t chopped off!!</li>
            <li>So, it&#x27;s worth it to order one if you have a coupon for free shipping, or you&#x27;re already getting a bunch of other stuff as well.</li>
            <li>and i highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I, too, am a new member of the stubby eyelash club.  </li>
            <li>New experience for me.  </li>
            <li>Curls good enough until about the 20th use when I noticed the black cushion thing had a crack in it which led to my eyelashes being pulled out.</li>
            <li>The incorrect pictures of products is getting really old on Amazon!</li>
            <li>Anyway, REVLON lash curler worked like a charm for 10+ yrs may hv to return to my old stand by!?  </li>
            <li>Maybe because of I am a Asian and me eyes are not that long, the camber of this curler doesn&#x27;t fit me well.</li>
            <li>so you dont constantly have to buy a whole new curler.</li>
            <li>The pads aren&#x27;t as hard of a material as they should be they feel more like sponges</li>
            <li>Unlike so many of the cheaply-made models on the market, this one feels sturdy and curls lashes without squeezing it so hard.  </li>
            <li>The metal parts don&#x27;t feel flimsy and the rubber part that actually touches your lashes is very good--nice and squishy.</li>
            <li>one to it, the Shu completely outclasses the e.l.f.</li>
            <li>I only bought them for one occasion, and I haven&#x27;t used them much sense (</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s by elf which can just turn a lot of  people off but let me tell you, this thing is so springy, it actually curls your lashes and it curls really really really fast.</li>
            <li>I am completely horrified that someone would sell this.</li>
            <li>but WOW.</li>
            <li>It curls very well, but it&#x27;s only one dollar on elf.com.</li>
            <li>Where I come from the eyelash curler was priced at $1.00 (1.25 with tax) and I could completely believe that</li>
            <li>Maybe it is the shape of my eye but the curler couldn&#x27;t even reach all my lashes, and the lashes it did curl created a complete unnatural curl, too angled and did not look natural.</li>
            <li>then some to the point where I went back and bought a few more as stocking stuffers for my girlfriends.</li>
            <li>It hit my sorta high cheek bones or something and then eye was to deeply set (I guess) to reach the lashes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve recently purchased a new eyelash curler and have come to the realization that you don&#x27;t need to be in pain for curly eyelashes.</li>
            <li>My first one had a piece that became dislodged and the second time I can&#x27;t even remember what happened, but i basically decided that the good weighed out the bad</li>
            <li>Never have trouble with the handles getting stuck, rubber piece stays in and helps curl eyelashes way more than other products.</li>
            <li>I gave the curler a try because it was at a great price, sadly it still was not worth it.</li>
            <li>I guess my eyelashes just don&#x27;t come out far enough to reach the curling part of it?</li>
            <li>barely even wiggle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It gives a much better curl that other brands I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>The handle is white, not black like in the picture.</li>
            <li>The black handle (the one your thumb goes in) and silver rod leading up to the curling mechanism is mashed right up against my face trying to get it close enough to my eye.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes were clipped right in half!</li>
            <li>I realize that this is going to make me sound like an idiot, since clearly it worked for so many other people - but this eyelash curler does NOT reach my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>But when I went to my local store to get a new one I could not find this version - only the &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; looking version - no black grips, no spring-tension - just your average cheapie curler like all of the others.  </li>
            <li>Oddly, the part where you hold the curler is white and not black, unlike in the picture and also unlike my old one.</li>

            <li> So I have found my own way which works a lot better.</li>
            <li> They are very comfortable in my hand and curl the lashes without any pulling or pinching.</li>
            <li> Beware, it may seem like a great cheap item at first, but it could turn on you too!</li>
            <li> Great product, but doesn&#x27;t curl eyelashes as much as i&#x27;d like it to. .</li>
            <li> I got it only after 2-3 days and it was working perfectly.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s one in each bathroom, plus most of my purses and travel kits.)  </li>
            <li> You know spreading  their magic  medic elf dust and causing all kinds a mischief.&lt;br</li>
            <li> For MANY years I used Maybelline(sp.)</li>
            <li> But i&#x27;m not 100% sure.</li>
            <li> I also bought this for a dollar, since I didn&#x27;t feel like shelling out more for a higher-end brand.  </li>
            <li> and they worked WAY better than this does.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My eye lashes curled up more so than my hair on a rainy day.  </li>
            <li> love this curler.  </li>
            <li> I can confidently recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> I only put it for like  5 seconds and the effects it has are so awesome.</li>
            <li> Made my $1 return to Target and went on my merry way :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s an OK product.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Hi I love this product I used to buy the MAC eyelash curler but its a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> and I have to say I love ALL elf products.</li>
            <li> Instead of curling and lifting, it more just crimps them upward.</li>
            <li> i heard many raves about this product</li>
            <li> and I love that fact that it comes withthe replacement plastic pad.</li>
            <li> i love this eyelash curler</li>
            <li> I love my e.l.f. eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I love this eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so comfortable, too!</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;d say if you just want a cheap eyelash curler and are willing to work with it a bit to get the effect you want, this one is a great bargain.  </li>
            <li> -- it&#x27;s as good as the much higher priced curlers.</li>
            <li> It really does a nice job of curing my eyelashes and doesn&#x27;t pull off my mascara with it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good, even though sometimes it doesn&#x27;t always curl.</li>
            <li> and I love the fact you can buy replacement pads for really cheap</li>
            <li> Its easy to use</li>
            <li> the price, I think its something good to use on a daily basis, just to get that neutral kind of look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This may be perfect for Uma Thurman but as a normal person with normal eyes</li>
            <li> lash curlers and they seemed fine.  </li>
            <li> Since I found this I rather save $$ and does curl my eyelashes perfectly just like MAC&#x27;s just a lot less.</li>
            <li> I love elf cosmetics because they are so cheap and work tremendously well.</li>
            <li> I got this little eye lash curler for a dollar, which is really awesome.  </li>
            <li> The grip/handles are comfortable and it does curl your lashes well.</li>
            <li> They work well and fit comfortably into my hand.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was cheap</li>
            <li> But it may fit Americans well.</li>
            <li> cheap and not handles</li>
            <li> Totally worth it :)</li>
            <li> Cheap.</li>
            <li> I fabulously recommend it.</li>
            <li> So far, it doesn&#x27;t seem to have any tendency to pinch (a hazard with all eyelash curlers)and does a good job curling.  </li>
            <li> it works really good better than all of the ones i had , my eyelashes look verry long</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d had good experience with the elf tweezers and lip glosses -- and amazingly this one, even with its silicon pad, worked far better than the \\&quot;name brand\\&quot; ones I&#x27;d tried in recent years.  </li>
            <li> I have had two of these curlers over the last several years and love them - best curler</li>
            <li> and i was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> But if you want a sturdy reliable tool that works great, spend a few bucks more and get the Shu Uemura one.</li>
            <li> I have boughten most of the e.l.f makeup brushes and they are wonderful, so I expected this eyelash curler to be the same.</li>
            <li> I am throwing it out a paying more for a reasonable one</li>
            <li> They were easy to use and helped make my eyes look pretty</li>
            <li> This eyelash curler is seriously the best thing ever.</li>
            <li> It shipped amazingly quick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several different eyelash curlers over the years and this one is the best one yet.</li>
            <li> The size fits my eye shape perfectly and doesn&#x27;t pinch or pull out any of my lashes, the handle is very comfortable to hold and the little rubber pads on the inside seem like they will last for awhile.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ironic as this claims to have a special design that &amp;#34;suits all eye shapes&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> and ships super duper fast!!</li>
            <li> Makes my lashes look great, its not like any other!</li>
            <li> So, I bought a new one on Amazon for marginally more than at the store.</li>
            <li> This ELF eyelash curler is quite cheaply made and doesn&#x27;t really hold a curl well.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> I have never gotten such amazing results.  </li>
            <li> Worth the price, if you are looking for a quality eyelash curler</li>
            <li> They are worth it for the price.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money and then some.</li>
            <li> This is so worth what I paid for it.  </li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> Other than that is a good curler</li>
            <li> RIGHT</li>
            <li> Very professional and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I LOVE e.l.f products in general and</li>
            <li> I have tried it against my face every which way, and watched multiple youtube videos to make sure that I&#x27;m holding it the right way...</li>
            <li> Although, I have owned this twice in the past two years because it breaks kind of easily.</li>
            <li> but it works very very well.</li>
            <li> The way that this curler is made doesn&#x27;t allow me to get a good angle up close to my eye, the plastic finger grips get in the way a little.</li>
            <li> I use this eyelash curler daily and love it for the ease of use.</li>
            <li> I finally can have my eyelashes be seen :)</li>
            <li> This thing seems well made for the price, and does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> THANKS ELF!</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t the first time i purchased an eyelash curler</li>
            <li> Yes you may pinch your eyelid occasionally if your not paying attention but that happens with most eyelash curlers.</li>
            <li> then I test it on the back of my hand to be sure I can handle the heat before curling my lashes with it followed by mascara.</li>
            <li> I have never used any lashes curler before it&#x27;s my first time that i ordered it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all you&#x27;d want from an eyelash curler: a firm grip, a good curl without damaging or pulling out lashes and an affordable price.</li>
            <li> I have been using eyelash curlers pretty much since the Dawn of Man. &#x27;</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, if you are looking for an eyelash curler to hold a curl pretty much all day, this will not do it for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Got it at a decent price!</li>
            <li> and I like the extra little finger rest on the handle which gives great control.</li>
            <li> She really likes it....</li>
            <li> I started being more careful on why I had no lashes there</li>
            <li> This eyelash curler went straight to the trash since now</li>
            <li> It really makes you wonder about the profit margin for cosmetic companies.</li>
            <li> and it came in mail verry fast</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> and I was very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;the</li>
            <li> The curler itself is much cheaper there as well.</li>
            <li> This curler is much smaller than my old one--and I love that it doesn&#x27;t require as much storage space in my cosmetics pouch.  </li>
            <li> It gets the job done, smoothly, and came with extra cushion.</li>
            <li> i really do.</li>
            <li> Aside from that it curls very well</li>
            <li> It fits very well  </li>
            <li> but it doesint really curl my lashes</li>
            <li> and I thought it was reasonable.</li>
            <li> The rubber piece stays much longer.</li>
            <li> I tried  it and it worked very well on my lashes without pinching my eyelid .i</li>
            <li> Its been over a few months and my eyelashes are still short and I look goofy now when I put mascara on the eyelashes that weren&#x27;t chopped off!!</li>
            <li> So, it&#x27;s worth it to order one if you have a coupon for free shipping, or you&#x27;re already getting a bunch of other stuff as well.</li>
            <li> and i highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I, too, am a new member of the stubby eyelash club.  </li>
            <li> New experience for me.  </li>
            <li> Curls good enough until about the 20th use when I noticed the black cushion thing had a crack in it which led to my eyelashes being pulled out.</li>
            <li> The incorrect pictures of products is getting really old on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Anyway, REVLON lash curler worked like a charm for 10+ yrs may hv to return to my old stand by!?  </li>
            <li> Maybe because of I am a Asian and me eyes are not that long, the camber of this curler doesn&#x27;t fit me well.</li>
            <li> so you dont constantly have to buy a whole new curler.</li>
            <li> The pads aren&#x27;t as hard of a material as they should be they feel more like sponges</li>
            <li> Unlike so many of the cheaply-made models on the market, this one feels sturdy and curls lashes without squeezing it so hard.  </li>
            <li> The metal parts don&#x27;t feel flimsy and the rubber part that actually touches your lashes is very good--nice and squishy.</li>
            <li> one to it, the Shu completely outclasses the e.l.f.</li>
            <li> I only bought them for one occasion, and I haven&#x27;t used them much sense (</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s by elf which can just turn a lot of  people off but let me tell you, this thing is so springy, it actually curls your lashes and it curls really really really fast.</li>
            <li> I am completely horrified that someone would sell this.</li>
            <li> but WOW.</li>
            <li> It curls very well, but it&#x27;s only one dollar on elf.com.</li>
            <li> Where I come from the eyelash curler was priced at $1.00 (1.25 with tax) and I could completely believe that</li>
            <li> Maybe it is the shape of my eye but the curler couldn&#x27;t even reach all my lashes, and the lashes it did curl created a complete unnatural curl, too angled and did not look natural.</li>
            <li> then some to the point where I went back and bought a few more as stocking stuffers for my girlfriends.</li>
            <li> It hit my sorta high cheek bones or something and then eye was to deeply set (I guess) to reach the lashes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve recently purchased a new eyelash curler and have come to the realization that you don&#x27;t need to be in pain for curly eyelashes.</li>
            <li> My first one had a piece that became dislodged and the second time I can&#x27;t even remember what happened, but i basically decided that the good weighed out the bad</li>
            <li> Never have trouble with the handles getting stuck, rubber piece stays in and helps curl eyelashes way more than other products.</li>
            <li> I gave the curler a try because it was at a great price, sadly it still was not worth it.</li>
            <li> I guess my eyelashes just don&#x27;t come out far enough to reach the curling part of it?</li>
            <li> barely even wiggle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It gives a much better curl that other brands I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> The handle is white, not black like in the picture.</li>
            <li> The black handle (the one your thumb goes in) and silver rod leading up to the curling mechanism is mashed right up against my face trying to get it close enough to my eye.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes were clipped right in half!</li>
            <li> I realize that this is going to make me sound like an idiot, since clearly it worked for so many other people - but this eyelash curler does NOT reach my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> But when I went to my local store to get a new one I could not find this version - only the &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; looking version - no black grips, no spring-tension - just your average cheapie curler like all of the others.  </li>
            <li> Oddly, the part where you hold the curler is white and not black, unlike in the picture and also unlike my old one.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say if this tool will last long, but for an occasional user it&#x27;s like finding gold.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m mixed Asian, so I don&#x27;t have a lot of eyelashes, but they are long.  </li>
            <li> The Shu is almost flat to my face, and the curl I get from it is noticeably better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The part about it that sucks is that you can only really get it online.</li>
            <li> It just sucks because it breaks too fast, but then again its only 2 bucks.</li>
            <li> Sadly it didn&#x27;t fit my face, well not the orbit of the eye.</li>
            <li> This eyelash curler is &amp;#34;OK&amp;#34; but the center cushion that curls your lashes constantly falls out.</li>
            <li> Them long tapered gold bootie slippers.  </li>
            <li> I had this for a year and used the living daylights out of it, and it lasted that long, so</li>
            <li> but I accidentally stepped on it and warped the metal, and it never really curled properly after that.</li>
            <li> this is way too wide and flat.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve heard some people complain that it \\&quot;doesn&#x27;t give them enough curl\\&quot;, I run my lash curler under warmer water in the sink and under my blow dryer on the \\&quot;warm\\&quot; setting (never hot)</li>
            <li> I can NOT live without this thing.</li>
            <li> (I inherited long but thin and straight eyelashes, so I am a long-time dependant of eyelash curlers.</li>
            <li> But I received it today and it&#x27;s the same as the one in the store - not the one pictured with the black grips or the spring-tension.  </li>
            <li> I think I could have bought it at a big box store for less.</li>
            <li> curler sent was the same as one I already have for a lot less money.</li>
            <li> But like I said, the center cushion could and may come out before, during and after you curl your eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disabled and that would have helped me out big time.</li>
            <li> I have two of these as I managed to break one after some rough air traveling.</li>
            <li> Im walking around with short uneven hideous stumps.</li>
            <li> Well, needless to say, as soon as that happened I through it right away.</li>
            <li> Given that it came with a refill, too, that makes it cheaper than even just buying the silicon refills from the other brands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worked with other drugstore brand curlers before</li>
            <li> It cut a big gap in my lashes and now I have to look dumb and wait for them to grow back.</li>
            <li> but there&#x27;s this sharp edge</li>
            <li> I do like their other products</li>
            <li> I was just reading reviews on it, and saw that it had clipped some of the other users eyelashes in half.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth it to just order the eye lash curler.</li>
            <li> So, in desperation one recent trip where I couldn&#x27;t find the one in my makeup kit, I bought this one for a mere $1 at the local target.  </li>
            <li> Cut in half&#x27; is a previously inconceivable consequence of curling my lashes.</li>
            <li> Half my eyelashes are gone.</li>
            <li> The eyelash curler is sturdy and came with additional black cushion grip strips for the bottom part of the curler where the under side of your lashes sit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> cut down to little stumps.  </li>
            <li> When I removed the little rubber inside</li>
            <li> I now have a chunk of eyelashes missing.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, it works as expected and no better or worse than any other curler I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Does its job.&lt;br /&gt;Comes with two of the black things (not sure the name)&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> But this product made me so mad that I had to, for the sake of anyone else considering spending a whole $1 on it.  </li>
            <li> and it hurt me pretty bad while using it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews as I never have time.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, like everyone else who had this same experience, these have gone into the trash.</li>
            <li> Those expensive curlers are totally over rated.</li>
            <li> Hard to describe in words, but hopefully that makes at least a little bit of sense.</li>
            <li> one of these new fangled black silicon pads did a horrible non-job, as did the silicon replacement pads I got for my Revlon &amp; other models.  </li>
            <li> so when you press to curl if you do it to hard</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought at least 5 eyelash curlers in my lifetime, used them once and then let them rot in my Caboodle till they just somehow vanished--</li>
            <li> I still can&#x27;t figure out how these cost so much, don&#x27;t come with a ton of rubber replacements and how every other brand is awful.</li>
            <li> I mean it&#x27;s a dollar</li>
            <li> sad to think that this ended up making my eyelashes look even worse in the long run.</li>
            <li> Not good.  </li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s a big deal for me. &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> 2 people asked me if I was wearing false eyelashes tonight.  </li>
            <li> I never ever curl my lashes with mascara or false lashes on at risk of damaging them.</li>
            <li> The weird spring mechanism is a tad annoying, but no big deal.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t look horrible, but not as natural as others.</li>
            <li> No need to buy a really expensive one unless your into makeup</li>
            <li> Dont buy it, it is such an awful product, it cut off my lashes.</li>
            <li> Otherwise there is nothing functionally wrong with the curler.  </li>
            <li> MY EYELASHES ARE VERY THIN</li>
            <li> and it was because the curler was cutting the lashes out.</li>
            <li> A lot of people stated these curlers were cutting off their lashes?</li>
            <li> But I want the really expensive one!</li>
            <li> I was VERY sad to see it wasn&#x27;t what I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;The bad:  </li>
            <li> The eyelash curler isn&#x27;t so bad for the price though.</li>
            <li> and it hurt so bad</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still shocked writing this.</li>
            <li> SO DISAPPOINTING!  </li>
            <li> I found around 20 eyelashes in there :(</li>
            <li> I hate this product.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS HORRIBLE!  </li>
            <li> I AM TOTALLY DISGUSTED BY THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> Over all Im not saying its a horrible product, it just did not work for me.</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>

            <li> Great product, but doesn&#x27;t curl eyelashes as much as i&#x27;d like it to. .</li>
            <li> I use this eyelash curler daily and love it for the ease of use. Worth the price, if you are looking for a quality eyelash curler</li>
            <li> I got it only after 2-3 days and it was working perfectly. I finally can have my eyelashes be seen :)</li>
            <li> Sent this as a gift to a friend. She really likes it.... you also cant beat the price.</li>
            <li> I still can&#x27;t figure out how these cost so much, don&#x27;t come with a ton of rubber replacements and how every other brand is awful. So, given the options, this one is the best choice.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews as I never have time.  But this product made me so mad that I had to, for the sake of anyone else considering spending a whole $1 on it.  Don&#x27;t buy the e.l.f. Eyelash Curler if you want to keep your eyelashes.  After only 3 uses, I noticed this morning that the eyelashes on my left eye are GONE...cut down to little stumps.  Needless to say, like everyone else who had this same experience, these have gone into the trash.</li>
            <li> I too am lamenting the disappearance of the traditional rubber eyelash curler pads.  The recent maybelline model I bought that came with one of these new fangled black silicon pads did a horrible non-job, as did the silicon replacement pads I got for my Revlon &amp; other models.  (I inherited long but thin and straight eyelashes, so I am a long-time dependant of eyelash curlers. There&#x27;s one in each bathroom, plus most of my purses and travel kits.)  So, in desperation one recent trip where I couldn&#x27;t find the one in my makeup kit, I bought this one for a mere $1 at the local target.  I&#x27;d had good experience with the elf tweezers and lip glosses -- and amazingly this one, even with its silicon pad, worked far better than the \\&quot;name brand\\&quot; ones I&#x27;d tried in recent years.  So far, it doesn&#x27;t seem to have any tendency to pinch (a hazard with all eyelash curlers)and does a good job curling.  The weird spring mechanism is a tad annoying, but no big deal.  Given that it came with a refill, too, that makes it cheaper than even just buying the silicon refills from the other brands.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS HORRIBLE!  DO NOT BUY THIS!  I JUST NOTICED TODAY THAT MY EYE LASHES ARE BEING CUT BUY THIS CURLER.  IF YOU USE THIS PRODUCT CHECK THE RUBBER PIECE AND LOOK INSIDE WHERE THE GROOVE IS.  I FOUND A TON OF MY EYELASHES IN THERE.  MY EYELASHES ARE VERY THIN AND SOME ARE CUT SHORT!  I AM TOTALLY DISGUSTED BY THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> The good:  I got this little eye lash curler for a dollar, which is really awesome.  It seems to be fairly well-made and I like the extra little finger rest on the handle which gives great control. The metal parts don&#x27;t feel flimsy and the rubber part that actually touches your lashes is very good--nice and squishy. It doesn&#x27;t pinch either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad:  It doesn&#x27;t curl my lashes well. I have an ancient Shu Uemura lash curler, and though it may not be fair to compare the e.l.f. one to it, the Shu completely outclasses the e.l.f. when it comes to actually curling my lashes.  There is a big big difference. The way that this curler is made doesn&#x27;t allow me to get a good angle up close to my eye, the plastic finger grips get in the way a little. The Shu is almost flat to my face, and the curl I get from it is noticeably better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I&#x27;d say if you just want a cheap eyelash curler and are willing to work with it a bit to get the effect you want, this one is a great bargain.  But if you want a sturdy reliable tool that works great, spend a few bucks more and get the Shu Uemura one.</li>
            <li> I realize that this is going to make me sound like an idiot, since clearly it worked for so many other people - but this eyelash curler does NOT reach my eyelashes. I have tried it against my face every which way, and watched multiple youtube videos to make sure that I&#x27;m holding it the right way... no dice. I guess my eyelashes just don&#x27;t come out far enough to reach the curling part of it? The black handle (the one your thumb goes in) and silver rod leading up to the curling mechanism is mashed right up against my face trying to get it close enough to my eye. It seems like the curling part of the tool would need to be farther out from the handles and at an angle for it to work. Hard to describe in words, but hopefully that makes at least a little bit of sense. It&#x27;s ironic as this claims to have a special design that &amp;#34;suits all eye shapes&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> I also bought this eyelash curler for a dollar... I have boughten most of the e.l.f makeup brushes and they are wonderful, so I expected this eyelash curler to be the same. It does curl my lashed but I started noticing that the lashes from the end of my eyes were disappearing. I started being more careful on why I had no lashes there and it was because the curler was cutting the lashes out. This eyelash curler went straight to the trash since now I have to wait for my lashes to regrow. Over all Im not saying its a horrible product, it just did not work for me.</li>
            <li> This eyelash curler is &amp;#34;OK&amp;#34; but the center cushion that curls your lashes constantly falls out. The grip/handles are comfortable and it does curl your lashes well. But like I said, the center cushion could and may come out before, during and after you curl your eyelashes. LOL I don&#x27;t recommend this buying it.</li>
            <li> Great eyelash curler!&lt;br /&gt;Works fine and is easy to use . Makes my lashes look great, its not like any other!</li>
            <li> Works perfectly. I have no complaints. They are worth it for the price. They work well and fit comfortably into my hand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using an eyelash curler off and on for years. I recently purchased the e.l.f. Cosmetics Eye Lash Curler and what a surprise -- it&#x27;s as good as the much higher priced curlers. After playing with it for a while, it did do a good job of curling my lashes. I can&#x27;t say if this tool will last long, but for an occasional user it&#x27;s like finding gold. It really makes you wonder about the profit margin for cosmetic companies. Thank you, e.l.f.!</li>
            <li> Did you ever wonder how elves curl those slippers upward.  You know the ones.  Them long tapered gold bootie slippers.  They curl up and around about 280 degrees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not their toes, cause them lil rascals have short stubby red toes that barely even wiggle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well it&#x27;s this elf bootie curling device.  they just grab and pinch the end of their boot and kinda iron it in place.  You get a good elf bootie and it can stay curled up for quite awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then their boots don&#x27;t flop around when they a go scamperin around under the ferns and lilies.  You know spreading  their magic  medic elf dust and causing all kinds a mischief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now you know.</li>
            <li> For MANY years I used Maybelline(sp.) lash curlers and they seemed fine.  Then they started to pinch and pull at my lashes, and it hurt!  I decided to try these.  They are just what I wanted.  They are very comfortable in my hand and curl the lashes without any pulling or pinching.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was cheap and I didn&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money on something that I probably won&#x27;t use every day. I believe this came with an extra rubber grip thing for when you need to replace it. But i&#x27;m not 100% sure. I also didn&#x27;t like the instructions that came with it, it made my eyelashes come out crinkled. So I have found my own way which works a lot better.</li>
            <li> Does its job.&lt;br /&gt;Comes with two of the black things (not sure the name)&lt;br /&gt;Good buy. No need to buy a really expensive one unless your into makeup</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the good ratings.  Dont buy it, it is such an awful product, it cut off my lashes. I used it correctly and with the rubber guard on. It cut off all my lashes and it is now in the trash. Don&#x27;t invest in this product!!</li>
            <li> I also bought this for a dollar, since I didn&#x27;t feel like shelling out more for a higher-end brand.  Well, you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rubbery part on the curler fell off after a couple of weeks.  Otherwise there is nothing functionally wrong with the curler.  However, it will not curl my lashes no matter what.  I&#x27;ll pump it on my top lashes for a good 20 seconds, and my eyelashes stay put.  Not good.  I&#x27;m mixed Asian, so I don&#x27;t have a lot of eyelashes, but they are long.  I&#x27;ve worked with other drugstore brand curlers before and they worked WAY better than this does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: You get what you pay for.  Consider investing in something more expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the curler for about 2 months and it just cut some of my eyelashes off. I now have a chunk of eyelashes missing.  I threw curler in the trash this morning!!!</li>
            <li> I have had two of these curlers over the last several years and love them - best curler I&#x27;ve ever used!  But when I went to my local store to get a new one I could not find this version - only the &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; looking version - no black grips, no spring-tension - just your average cheapie curler like all of the others.  So I looked online and was happy to see it here and pay more than I would in the store.  But I received it today and it&#x27;s the same as the one in the store - not the one pictured with the black grips or the spring-tension.  I will be returning it ASAP.  SO DISAPPOINTING!  The incorrect pictures of products is getting really old on Amazon!</li>
            <li> They worked. My eye lashes curled up more so than my hair on a rainy day.  I only bought them for one occasion, and I haven&#x27;t used them much sense (though I have used a smaller one designed for the corners).  That&#x27;s just a personal thing though. They were easy to use and helped make my eyes look pretty</li>
            <li> The pads aren&#x27;t as hard of a material as they should be they feel more like sponges so when you press to curl if you do it to hard the curler will break them so you&#x27;ll need alot of replacement pads. Other than that is a good curler</li>
            <li> love this curler.  It really does a nice job of curing my eyelashes and doesn&#x27;t pull off my mascara with it!</li>
            <li> Maybe because of I am a Asian and me eyes are not that long, the camber of this curler doesn&#x27;t fit me well. But it may fit Americans well.</li>
            <li> Works great and the price is great too.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money and then some. I didn&#x27;t have an issues with it tearing our my lashes, so I give it a thumbs up.&lt;br /&gt;It gives a much better curl that other brands I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I was VERY sad to see it wasn&#x27;t what I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted this one because of the finger grips..I&#x27;m disabled and that would have helped me out big time.</li>
            <li> This product is good. Never have trouble with the handles getting stuck, rubber piece stays in and helps curl eyelashes way more than other products.</li>
            <li> This is a good quality eyelash curler!  Unlike so many of the cheaply-made models on the market, this one feels sturdy and curls lashes without squeezing it so hard.  It even comes with a replacement rubber part.  This is so worth what I paid for it.  I can confidently recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> This eyelash curler is seriously the best thing ever. I mean it&#x27;s a dollar ninety five, and it&#x27;s by elf which can just turn a lot of  people off but let me tell you, this thing is so springy, it actually curls your lashes and it curls really really really fast. I only put it for like  5 seconds and the effects it has are so awesome. Although, I have owned this twice in the past two years because it breaks kind of easily. My first one had a piece that became dislodged and the second time I can&#x27;t even remember what happened, but i basically decided that the good weighed out the bad so i still use it. The part about it that sucks is that you can only really get it online. Here, or on the elf store. So, it&#x27;s worth it to order one if you have a coupon for free shipping, or you&#x27;re already getting a bunch of other stuff as well. It&#x27;s not worth it to just order the eye lash curler. That being said, this is actually a really great eye lash curler, probably the one with the greatest effects that I have ever used. It just sucks because it breaks too fast, but then again its only 2 bucks.</li>
            <li> This thing seems well made for the price, and does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I, too, am a new member of the stubby eyelash club.  I have been using eyelash curlers pretty much since the Dawn of Man. &#x27;Cut in half&#x27; is a previously inconceivable consequence of curling my lashes. It&#x27;s like a tiny guillotine! My lashes look like they didn&#x27;t survive the French Revolution! I am completely horrified that someone would sell this.</li>
            <li> i really liked this eyelash curler it works really good better than all of the ones i had , my eyelashes look verry long and it came in mail verry fast i recommend you to buy this if you want your eyelashes to look good and longg . its a great price too .</li>
            <li> The item pictured has the thicker handles which are easier to hold. The one I received had regular wired handles. I think I could have bought it at a big box store for less.</li>
            <li> I had bought this product in the store, and I had used it several times, no problems, worked well (So I thought). I was just reading reviews on it, and saw that it had clipped some of the other users eyelashes in half. I have never realized this before. But as I was using it today... it happened! My eyelashes were clipped right in half! RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF MY EYE!! SO NOTICEABLE!! Well, needless to say, as soon as that happened I through it right away. Beware, it may seem like a great cheap item at first, but it could turn on you too!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t express how happy I am with this product! I&#x27;ve used products 10x the price of this curler that haven&#x27;t work as well. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> what I got was not as pictured.....and I was very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;the curler sent was the same as one I already have for a lot less money.</li>
            <li> I had this for a year and used the living daylights out of it, and it lasted that long, so 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;However; not 5 stars because it hurt my eyelids (which I got used to).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve recently purchased a new eyelash curler and have come to the realization that you don&#x27;t need to be in pain for curly eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Yeah this piece of junk is in the trash. It cut a big gap in my lashes and now I have to look dumb and wait for them to grow back. I have tiny lashes to begin with and NOW even mascara won&#x27;t help. THANKS ELF!</li>
            <li> I was soo happy when i found this for $1 at Target! (can&#x27;t believe the price listed here is over the top!)  The quality of the product is great, appears strong and well made for sure! But, that was not my problem.  Sadly it didn&#x27;t fit my face, well not the orbit of the eye. It hit my sorta high cheek bones or something and then eye was to deeply set (I guess) to reach the lashes. Anyway, REVLON lash curler worked like a charm for 10+ yrs may hv to return to my old stand by!?  New experience for me.  Made my $1 return to Target and went on my merry way :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had faith in e.l.f. products as they often get the job done and come at a lower price, but because of this eyelash curler I&#x27;m never buying anything e.l.f. again. I cannot believe the curler cut them. I&#x27;m still shocked writing this. WHAT THE HECK. Half my eyelashes are gone. I know they&#x27;ll grow back but WOW.</li>
            <li> This ELF eyelash curler is quite cheaply made and doesn&#x27;t really hold a curl well.&lt;br /&gt;For the price, I think its something good to use on a daily basis, just to get that neutral kind of look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if you are looking for an eyelash curler to hold a curl pretty much all day, this will not do it for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an OK product.</li>
            <li> This may be perfect for Uma Thurman but as a normal person with normal eyes this is way too wide and flat. I am throwing it out a paying more for a reasonable one</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought at least 5 eyelash curlers in my lifetime, used them once and then let them rot in my Caboodle till they just somehow vanished--THIS curler is different.  I have never gotten such amazing results.  2 people asked me if I was wearing false eyelashes tonight.  BEST.  EVER.</li>
            <li> I have two of these as I managed to break one after some rough air traveling. It&#x27;s all you&#x27;d want from an eyelash curler: a firm grip, a good curl without damaging or pulling out lashes and an affordable price. It comes with an extra band and you can get a set of additional bands from the ELF website. The curler itself is much cheaper there as well. You won&#x27;t regret buying this!</li>
            <li> I love this product. It shipped amazingly quick. The only downside was that I could not track this product. The handle is white, not black like in the picture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several different eyelash curlers over the years and this one is the best one yet. The size fits my eye shape perfectly and doesn&#x27;t pinch or pull out any of my lashes, the handle is very comfortable to hold and the little rubber pads on the inside seem like they will last for awhile. I&#x27;m very impressed, another great purchase from e.l.f.</li>
            <li> This curler is much smaller than my old one--and I love that it doesn&#x27;t require as much storage space in my cosmetics pouch.  It gets the job done, smoothly, and came with extra cushion.</li>
            <li> I got it for $1.99 I believe! It does the job! But I want the really expensive one! But this will do for now!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ended up clipping my eyelid a couple of times though. I read the reviews and saw that it cuts eyelashes for some people, but not for me. It&#x27;s pretty good, even though sometimes it doesn&#x27;t always curl. The eyelash curler isn&#x27;t so bad for the price though.</li>
            <li> I love elf cosmetics because they are so cheap and work tremendously well.This wasn&#x27;t the first time i purchased an eyelash curler and i was not disappointed. The product works well and does a great job at curling the lashed perfectly. Yes you may pinch your eyelid occasionally if your not paying attention but that happens with most eyelash curlers. I think this is a great product and i highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Hi I love this product I used to buy the MAC eyelash curler but its a bit pricey. Since I found this I rather save $$ and does curl my eyelashes perfectly just like MAC&#x27;s just a lot less. I buy this at target for only $1 its cheaper than amazon but if you don&#x27;t have a target neat you I would say to order here.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite eyelash curler. I have been playing around with make-up for year and I have to say I love ALL elf products. They are great quality and cheap</li>
            <li> The one I received doesnt have nothing to do with the picture .So cheap and not handles</li>
            <li> The curler cut off my eyelashes the first 2 uses!!!! Im walking around with short uneven hideous stumps. Do not buy!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great curler and I love the fact you can buy replacement pads for really cheap so you dont constantly have to buy a whole new curler. Those expensive curlers are totally over rated. this is JUST as good!</li>
            <li> This eyelash curler is just alright. Instead of curling and lifting, it more just crimps them upward. Doesn&#x27;t look horrible, but not as natural as others. Would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> i want to like the eyelash curler. i really do. but it pokes the upper inner cornor of my eye when i try to get close with it. but it works very very well. and this seller is awesome. and ships super duper fast!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using an ELF lash curler for a looong time now but I accidentally stepped on it and warped the metal, and it never really curled properly after that. So, I bought a new one on Amazon for marginally more than at the store. Oddly, the part where you hold the curler is white and not black, unlike in the picture and also unlike my old one. Other than that, it works as expected and no better or worse than any other curler I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> i heard many raves about this product and i wanted to try it. I hate this product. maybe it&#x27;s just my eye shape but there&#x27;s this sharp edge and it hurt me pretty bad while using it. it doesn&#x27;t curl my lashes at all.  i think this product was made for people with big creases. i truly dislike this product, but you get what you get with a dollar.</li>
            <li> this s a really nice affordable curler for lashes i think like 3 bucks yea but its a four because unless you can keep up with the squishy extras your out of luck man and all ur product gets caked on</li>
            <li> It curls very well, but it&#x27;s only one dollar on elf.com. Aside from that it curls very well and I love that fact that it comes withthe replacement plastic pad. It fits very well  In My fingers</li>
            <li> Very professional and easy to use. The gripped handles make it easier to hold and use. I do recommend this</li>
            <li> i love this eyelash curler but it doesint really curl my lashes and i put on mascara and curled my lashes and it hurt so bad but it is a good eyelash curler just dont put on mascara and curl you lashes or it will hurt and your lashes will get stuck to the eyelash curler but i still use it to curl my lashes before i put my mascara on.</li>
            <li> I love my e.l.f. eyelash curler. It&#x27;s the perfect size, it&#x27;s shaped just right to grab my lashes, and the effect is noticeable. And at just $1 at target? Totally worth it :)</li>
            <li> Curls good enough until about the 20th use when I noticed the black cushion thing had a crack in it which led to my eyelashes being pulled out. I replaced it with the replacement cushion and the same thing happened to that one &#x3D; piece of junk</li>
            <li> It did curl my lashes but I noticed after a while that it was pulling my eyelashes out. Lots of them. When I removed the little rubber inside I found around 20 eyelashes in there :( sad to think that this ended up making my eyelashes look even worse in the long run.</li>
            <li> Seems to be well built and I love the fact that a replacement for the eye piece is included!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on this item, and decided to try it... A lot of people stated these curlers were cutting off their lashes? Well it did not cut off my lashes, and it curled them just like it was supposed to! :) Got it at a decent price! I would recommend this curler!</li>
            <li> Where I come from the eyelash curler was priced at $1.00 (1.25 with tax) and I could completely believe that and I thought it was reasonable. I definitely got what I paid for and then some to the point where I went back and bought a few more as stocking stuffers for my girlfriends. The eyelash curler is sturdy and came with additional black cushion grip strips for the bottom part of the curler where the under side of your lashes sit.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve heard some people complain that it \\&quot;doesn&#x27;t give them enough curl\\&quot;, I run my lash curler under warmer water in the sink and under my blow dryer on the \\&quot;warm\\&quot; setting (never hot) then I test it on the back of my hand to be sure I can handle the heat before curling my lashes with it followed by mascara. I never ever curl my lashes with mascara or false lashes on at risk of damaging them.</li>
            <li> I LOVE e.l.f products in general and I love this eyelash curler. Its easy to use (what eyelash curler isnt) but this one doesnt cost a ton of money and does the same thing all the others do. I would buy it for price alone</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a eyelash curler chop off.my eyelashes!! Literally I have no eyelashes on the sides and in the middle this curler basicly cut them instead of curl. Cheap. Horrible. Its been over a few months and my eyelashes are still short and I look goofy now when I put mascara on the eyelashes that weren&#x27;t chopped off!!</li>
            <li> I can NOT live without this thing. Seriously, Best eyelashes curler EVERRR. I fabulously recommend it. The rubber piece stays much longer. It&#x27;s so comfortable, too!</li>
            <li> Although I like the design of this eyelash curler, it pulls out your eyelashes and that&#x27;s a big deal for me. &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> I have never used any lashes curler before it&#x27;s my first time that i ordered it and it came in time.I tried  it and it worked very well on my lashes without pinching my eyelid .i think it works perfectly awesome if you know how to use to it .i read instructions before using it its great product and one thing more i got one extra rubber in its box i am happy  with my choice.</li>
            <li> It,s good to use,fit my eyes,but it is very cheap,I have not any pressure to buy it.I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Maybe it is the shape of my eye but the curler couldn&#x27;t even reach all my lashes, and the lashes it did curl created a complete unnatural curl, too angled and did not look natural. I gave the curler a try because it was at a great price, sadly it still was not worth it. I do like their other products but this curler didn&#x27;t do its job.</li>
