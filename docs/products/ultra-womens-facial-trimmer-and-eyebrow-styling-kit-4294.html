    <ol>
            <li>This was best of my selections.</li>
            <li>IT WORKS GREAT.</li>
            <li>The eyebrow trimmer is great.  </li>
            <li>it is good for use with peach fuzz on the face.</li>
            <li>It does a good job.  </li>
            <li>Received it promptly and a good value.</li>
            <li>This is not even a fair trimmer.</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>She stated that she really liked this product.  </li>
            <li>I need a trimmer to keep the fine hair (peach fuzz) off my face and this does the trick!</li>
            <li>What more else to say?  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost identical to another brand which I used for many years, but, when it wore out, I could no longer find that brand to re-order.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking forward to many years of using this product, and I recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li>VERY LIGHT AND EASY TO USE.</li>
            <li>The trimmer works just fine.</li>
            <li>In the end, I find this trimmer as a life saver that gets rid of the those pesky fine hairs that lay on my face.</li>
            <li>She has use one similar to this one many times and is quite satisfied.</li>
            <li>Simple to use and handy</li>
            <li>What I also liked was that the seller added 2 batteries to the product even though you only need one.</li>
            <li>Though I&#x27;ve only used this product for a few weeks, I&#x27;m very happy with the results of using it.</li>
            <li>It broke the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I found a much better product in my local pharmacy.</li>
            <li>This is very well made.  </li>
            <li>After light use over the course of 3 weeks the battery is starting to fade.  </li>
            <li>It seems to have a lot of power but not too much.</li>
            <li>Works very well for the price and its so compact</li>
            <li>Better than more expensive ones I have purchased.</li>
            <li>It seemed to go through batteries quickly, and this last time it died a new battery</li>
            <li>Love this little trimmer.  </li>
            <li>So far this product works well.  </li>
            <li>It is very lightweight and sort of fragile feeling</li>
            <li>But once I got over the scare of how hard and quick it clipped the hairs, I guess those are positive things.</li>
            <li>It seemed a little more agressive than other ones.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer works very well for minor facial hair.  </li>
            <li>Not totally what I wanted in replacing my old one.  </li>
            <li>If you go very very slow and the hair is fine</li>
            <li>This product does not have enough reviews, and that is unfortunate because this small trimmer works amazingly!</li>

            <li> so I do wonder how long it will last.</li>
            <li> THOUGH IS THAT IT IS A LITTLE LOUD.</li>
            <li> I looked for a long time, purchased a few others.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t abuse or over-use it and only ran it for a couple of minutes once a week, so this is pretty bad.  </li>
            <li> However, I did not find it cut as close as a previous brand.</li>
            <li> It is a little underpowered.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t help - the thing is dead.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Simple to use and handy</li>
            <li> I use it for my face. it is good for use with peach fuzz on the face. I have another one that I have had for years.</li>
            <li> This ULTRA trimmer did not work but I noticed that it came with a lifetime guarantee so I sent it back and received a different trimmer and that also has a lifetime guarantee and that I do like. The trimmer works just fine.</li>
            <li> So far this product works well.  I need a trimmer to keep the fine hair (peach fuzz) off my face and this does the trick!</li>
            <li> This is very well made.  However, I did not find it cut as close as a previous brand.</li>
            <li> I bought this item 5 months ago.  It seemed to go through batteries quickly, and this last time it died a new battery didn&#x27;t help - the thing is dead.  I didn&#x27;t abuse or over-use it and only ran it for a couple of minutes once a week, so this is pretty bad.  It&#x27;s now in the garbage can and I&#x27;m out the money.  I would suggest you keep looking if you want a trimmer that&#x27;s going to last.</li>
            <li> Item was as advertised. I looked at reviews before I&lt;br /&gt;bought.  Got one for me &amp;  one for my husband.  Works well for sideburns &amp; eye brows.&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again.</li>
            <li> It is a little underpowered.  After light use over the course of 3 weeks the battery is starting to fade.  It works well though.  It is very lightweight and sort of fragile feeling so I do wonder how long it will last.</li>
            <li> It does a good job.  Not totally what I wanted in replacing my old one.  I looked for a long time, purchased a few others. This was best of my selections.</li>
            <li> IT WORKS GREAT. SAVES ME TIME AND MONEY FROM GOING TO THE SALON. VERY LIGHT AND EASY TO USE. THE ONLY THING THOUGH IS THAT IT IS A LITTLE LOUD.</li>
            <li> It broke the first time I used it. What more else to say?  I found a much better product in my local pharmacy.</li>
            <li> I am posting this for my wife for I do all the ordering.  She stated that she really liked this product.  She has use one similar to this one many times and is quite satisfied.</li>
            <li> This product does not have enough reviews, and that is unfortunate because this small trimmer works amazingly! I&#x27;ve heard about similar products on how they break easily or don&#x27;t last enough, but with this trimmer, its built to last. What I also liked was that the seller added 2 batteries to the product even though you only need one. In the end, I find this trimmer as a life saver that gets rid of the those pesky fine hairs that lay on my face.</li>
            <li> It seemed a little more agressive than other ones.  But once I got over the scare of how hard and quick it clipped the hairs, I guess those are positive things.</li>
            <li> Though I&#x27;ve only used this product for a few weeks, I&#x27;m very happy with the results of using it. It&#x27;s almost identical to another brand which I used for many years, but, when it wore out, I could no longer find that brand to re-order. I&#x27;m looking forward to many years of using this product, and I recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works very well for minor facial hair.  The eyebrow trimmer is great.  Also works well on my husbands neck for between hair cut trims.</li>
            <li> Received it promptly and a good value. It is slim and works well. It seems to have a lot of power but not too much. It is made well. Better than more expensive ones I have purchased. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> This is not even a fair trimmer. It does not cut the hair it just pulls it. If you go very very slow and the hair is fine you might stand a chance of getting it cut. Very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> Love this little trimmer.  Works very well for the price and its so compact you can take it anywhere with you.</li>
