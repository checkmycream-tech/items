            <li>So anyway ABOUT THIS BODY WASH: like I said the smell is amazingly yummy</li>

            <li>Its been amazing, no itching, no flaking, no pain or infection or weeping.</li>
            <li>The exfoliating sea salt provides a nice texture...</li>
            <li>but this one gets it done and leaves a nice after smell too</li>
            <li>Great scent, nice texture - light and creamy.</li>
            <li>I choose five stars for this product review as I really liked the value of the item here.</li>
            <li>My husband used it and commented he really liked it.</li>
            <li>Used it before,  liked it.</li>
            <li>My husband liked the smell and tried it and he liked it a lot too.</li>
            <li>Amazing, skin feels clean and you smell great.</li>
            <li>Awesome new product!  </li>
            <li>Gets you clean, smells great and inexpensive.</li>
            <li>and I have been super happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>The smell of this is so lovely -- it reminds me of being at a lovely spa!  </li>
            <li>I have never been one to like the &amp;#34;fruity or flowery&amp;#34; scents and this is just a very clean, refreshing scent!  </li>
            <li>Best body wash I have ever tried so far</li>
            <li>This is by far the best body wash I have ever used!</li>
            <li>The scrub smells so good and makes my skin incredibly smooth.</li>
            <li>Love the scent of this body wash, I was using the coconut kind by St. Ives</li>
            <li>The particles in the scrub are very fine and do the job.</li>
            <li>This wasn&#x27;t exactly what I was expecting, although it is a great body wash.</li>
            <li>Pack Skin Care Tool For Men and Women - Durable and Easy To Use - 100% Natural Luffa - Excellent Body Scrubber and Exfoliator.]</li>
            <li>Exfoliating helps my moisturizer absorb more easily and effectively too.</li>
            <li>love the smell and feel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been through many</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not going to say that this is the ONLY thing to ever work but for the price and convenience it is the best thing to have worked.</li>
            <li>not?\\&quot; I&#x27;m SO glad</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>The best part, is it actually clings to your body and stays there</li>
            <li>I love the smell of it too</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so refreshing</li>
            <li>I LOVE the moisturization I get from this product</li>
            <li>They changed the formula for the better.  </li>
            <li>My skin has never felt better using St. Ives Body Wash Purifying Sea Salt Exfoliating Body Wash and the body scrub exfoliating gloves.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love the sea salt texture</li>
            <li>Lovely item.</li>
            <li>But it needs more publicity.</li>
            <li>If I had any problem with this stuff, it&#x27;s that I wished their were more crystals in it.</li>
            <li>and it feels wonderful (especially on my feet).</li>
            <li>My skin is so smooth!</li>
            <li>I love St.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m glad I got the pack of 2.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT</li>
            <li>Honestly,&lt;br /&gt;I ended up taking off the cap and added more sea salt to it</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>&amp; you&#x27;ve got a refreshing, relaxing spa treatment in a snap.  </li>
            <li>I love this body wash.</li>
            <li>Love this body wash.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff</li>
            <li>It has a nice light fragrance and moisturizes well.</li>
            <li>This body wash starts out as more of a scrub than a body wash.</li>
            <li>So, make sure the salt has all dissolved before you start shaving</li>
            <li>I break out in hives in reaction to many perfumes, plus I am prone to eczema.</li>
            <li>but it was not a scent that i cared for, plus this is an exfoliant which I love, leaves by skin silky and refreshed</li>
            <li>I love St. Ives body washes.</li>
            <li>One of our favorite shower gels.</li>
            <li>I love this body wash.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a refreshing, clean linen kind of smell.</li>
            <li>The range in pricing for this product from the various vendors was surprising, but I&#x27;m very satisfied and confident that I got the best price, and will definitely purchase again from this seller.</li>
            <li>product has a good lather and a mild, clean scent that even my boyfriend loves</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin very soft and smells great.</li>
            <li>large container, good value.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know about the sea salt exfoliating my body or doing anything more, but I like this body wash for a couple of reasons: it&#x27;s cheap, and it&#x27;s on auto-delivery every 6 months through amazon&#x27;s subscribe and save.</li>
            <li>It works great in the shower, though, and makes my skin feel so soft afterward.</li>
            <li>Out of all the body washes that claim superior exfoliating, they have absolutely nothing on this body wash.</li>
            <li>smelled great, had just the right amount of grittiness, and was only like $10 + free shipping (each order includes 2 24 oz bottles with good packaging and bottle design).</li>
            <li>Very nice product is does not require too much  and leaves my skin so soft and smooth and good price.</li>
            <li>and it is so easy to keep in the shower.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent exfoliating skin wash; the Sea Salt works as a gentle, natural exfoliator AND</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have any strong scent.</li>
            <li>It smells fine</li>
            <li>So I must say, after just using this for the very first time, I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
            <li>It is rich and creamy and the salts do a really great job at exfoliating my skin to make it super soft!</li>
            <li>Nice large bottle to keep from shopping too often.  </li>
            <li>However this plus a moisturizer leaves your body feeling smooth &amp; silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works very well and smells nice.</li>
            <li>Love this product, it smell fresh  </li>
            <li>I especially appreciated the promptness of the order and delivery.</li>
            <li>It does in fact exfoliate well and leave your skin feeling light but after about 2 hours I&#x27;d be itchy vs the Dove which kept my skin refreshed</li>
            <li>Such a great buy</li>
            <li>This is great to alternate with Energizing Citrus, another St. Ives body wash.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a smell that men and women would enjoy and it doesn&#x27;t stay on your skin after your shower.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using this body wash.</li>
            <li>The beads do not exfoliate as much as I would like, but this smells really nice</li>
            <li>My body felt as smooth as my face.</li>
            <li>While it smells nice and lathers really well, I can&#x27;t feel any &#x27;grit&#x27; in it as an exfoliant.  </li>
            <li>somehow I discovered using old plastic shopping bags makes a good scrubber on the dogs and the tub.  </li>
            <li>Light scent, not too fine or course scrub, doesn&#x27;t take a lot, feel clean, doesn&#x27;t leave residue.</li>
            <li>I originally started using it because it was the grittiest soap out there.  </li>
            <li>This is much better than the higher priced brands.</li>
            <li>So just be aware you may need to scrub out the shower more often if you want to take a bath.  </li>
            <li>Some products still leaves you feeling not that clean</li>
            <li>but I bought so much of it that I began to enjoy the fragrance and texture more.  </li>
            <li>and I feel CLEAN.</li>
            <li>B00GMP5VW4 Clean Logic Exfoliating Bath Gloves (3 Pack)]] or a loofah sponge</li>
            <li>and I do feel clean when I come out of the shower</li>
            <li>To me, this is just as good, the price is awesome for TWO bottles and a little goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li>Other reviews list this as one of the best exfoliating washes on the marker, but I don&#x27;t really agree.  </li>
            <li>This was the right one to go to!</li>
            <li>Love this body wash - gentle and not drying but does the job - skin feels clean.</li>
            <li>It lathers nicely, smells great (fresh and clean), and is reasonably priced...comes in a two pack of large bottles that seem to last forever.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin so most of the &amp;#34;exfoliating&amp;#34; body washed out there include so many moisturizers that they don&#x27;t clean very well.  </li>
            <li>I liked the old version because it was like having a salt scrub and body soap all in one.  </li>
            <li>I am completely satisfied with my purchase and would recommend this to anyone who likes a gentle exfoliant in their body wash.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always liked products containing sea salt because it helps clear acne.</li>
            <li>The picture of this bottle shows the old version that I liked which is called \\&quot;Purified\\</li>
            <li>Very nice light scent and has a slight pumice (the salts?)</li>
            <li>I feel so clean and fresh afterwards.</li>
            <li>and it made my skin feel smooth after my first wash</li>
            <li>And the best part about it is the fact that it&#x27;s 100% natural and is free of harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>There is NO SEA SALT, unlike the original version that was gritty and smelled amazing.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fresh sweet scent.</li>
            <li>This body wash makes your skin smoothly and soft, when it mix water and it become rich foam, it makes your skin clean and Fresh!</li>
            <li>The size of the salt beads is perfect, not too large, but not too small where you don&#x27;t even know</li>
            <li>Let me say, first off, that TWO bottles (containers?) arrived!</li>
            <li>I use it with a nylon bath poof, which makes it even more effective at sloughing off dead skin cells.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin silky smooth and very soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin so soft and smooth, especially when I follow it up with a good body lotion after the shower.</li>
            <li>This leaves my dogs soft and silky, better than any dog shampoo I&#x27;ve ever tried...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d prefer a more masculine fresh scent.</li>
            <li>and I love how it leaves my skin so soft</li>
            <li>I love the exfoliants and the fact that it is made from natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>St. Ives is a quality brand, this is one of my favorite body washes it exfoliates very well and leaves the skin very soft and super smooth, the scent is also very tolerable.</li>
            <li>I got such a great deal and really love St. Ives products, but if you&#x27;re looking for a really deep cleaning exfoliant, I&#x27;d go with the classic apricot scrub.</li>
            <li>This is a decent product, this is a big bottle and the price was good.</li>
            <li>It gently exfoliated my skin while leaving it feeling clean.</li>
            <li>With the bars of soap, they all left a gross film on my body which did more harm than good for my large pores.</li>
            <li>I ordered this body wash because it was the best there is (or was), but instead of sending me the Purify wash they sent the new version that sucks.</li>
            <li>This is a SUPER great value, at least at the time it was a 2 pack.</li>
            <li>St.Ives makes a GREAT exfoliating body wash I&#x27;ve used in the past (not the face scrub).</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve always gotten every new scrub/lotion/treatment available.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin nicely hydrated, even in the dry winter weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It definitely makes you feel super clean!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I was recommended by my skin specialist to use St. Ives Body Purifying Sea Salt Exfoliating Body Wash to keep me skin, clear, shiny, healthy, and vibrant.  </li>
            <li>This is not ever in or they quit selling it at our local stores and it is the favorite of my son.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I used this for the first time at my parents house in their guest bathroom.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I had been looking for in a body wash</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t like it..</li>
            <li>I love this product and have been using it for the last year.  </li>
            <li>First of all this is Katrina, Kyle is my boyfriend and the one who bought this for me.</li>
            <li>the saint ives body wash with sea salt was very excxellerationing !</li>
            <li>This Exfoliating body wash keeps my skin smooth, soft, and glowing.</li>
            <li>I was nervous at first</li>
            <li>I use it with a loofah and scrub the spots that need exfoliation first before the salt dissolves.</li>
            <li>Love the bits of salt for extra skin exfoliation!</li>
            <li>, this one definitely is awesome!I switch with them on and off with each shower everyday to give my skin a nice balance followed with an after lotion and my skin is as soft as it gets(which is amazing since i&#x27;m pregnant).</li>
            <li>The original bottle says natural exfoliants</li>
            <li>Your skin will feel incredibly soft, clean and refreshed afterwards.</li>
            <li>Soft, clean scent.</li>
            <li>Leaves the skin soft, clean, hydrated and alllergy-free after wash.</li>
            <li>The result is nice and smooth, clean smelling skin that isn&#x27;t left dried out.</li>
            <li>The competition is easily 3x MORE expensive and isn&#x27;t NEARLY as good.</li>
            <li>I love the scent of this scrub, and is a decent exfoliant, better than a lot of the more expensive brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty much all we use now.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin..</li>
            <li>Gets you real clean, I mean clean.</li>
            <li>so you can really work it into your skin.</li>
            <li>and I like to feel like I&#x27;m really exfoliating...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon fro selling this because I can&#x27;t find it in any of the stores.</li>
            <li>Looking forward to gentle scrubs in the shower.</li>
            <li>I am a real fan of St. Ives products.</li>
            <li>and I hope you like it as much as me.</li>
            <li>This St. Ives exfoliating purify body wash is soothing, fresh, and natural.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I really like that</li>
            <li>Very bummed about not getting what they advertised.</li>
            <li>and it smells good and not overwhelming!</li>
            <li>The exfoliating grains are also nice and small, you can really work it into your skin to buff it into softness.  </li>
            <li>Bubbles up nicely and last a long time</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is also very gentle; I&#x27;ve been using it every day, and it doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin at all.  </li>
            <li>Foams and lathers better than previous formula and really exfoliates.  </li>
            <li>far as body washes, this is my favorite so far, definitely give it a try.</li>
            <li>The body was now says \\&quot;NEW!</li>
            <li>The product arrived quickly and packaged in a plastic bag to prevent any possible leaks.</li>
            <li>Ives does decent products.</li>
            <li>Noticeably better looking skin on chest and back in just two short weeks.  </li>
            <li>I have mild acne on my back and shoulders.</li>
            <li>I use it in conjunction with a back brush to treat my back acne in my latest attempt.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this mainly because of the reviews I was reading on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>This product completely cleared it up!!</li>
            <li>This product works and doesn&#x27;t smell too strong so it can be used with other products.</li>
            <li>The soap has a faint scent to it and feels great to use.</li>
            <li>item - Dove Fresh Body Wash. The differences are vast and made this St Ives just not for me.</li>
            <li>It will take your skin right off if you rub enough.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recommended it to other eczema sufferers and they also saw huge improvements.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now, but even after my first use, I noticed a difference on my chest area; the skin there (which is usually a bit coarser) was remarkably softer after just one use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>got a new version that is not as good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Amazon now pictures the correct new \\&quot;watered down\\&quot; version.&lt;br /&gt;Fool</li>
            <li>&quot; but what I got was the new version that I don&#x27;t like.  </li>
            <li>I just received a new order today March 11th 2013.</li>
            <li>It left my skin really smooth which I usually only get from moisturizing.</li>
            <li>and wow!</li>
            <li>The mineral salt is very fine and the wash is very thick and the smell is very \\&quot;spa\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, it&#x27;s not crazy expensive.</li>
            <li>The acne I had didn&#x27;t clear up fully</li>
            <li>I like to buy what they like and am so glad at least Amazon has what the stores quit selling.  </li>
            <li>This product states it&#x27;s 100% natural</li>
            <li>The fragrance, isn&#x27;t too overpowering, and it leaves your skin soft and silky.</li>
            <li>If this can make my 49-year-old saggy skin look young and vital again, it will work for you.  </li>
            <li>The product exfoliates well but is gentle enough that it doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried Dove, Axe, Old Spice, Neutrogena, and nothing has ever come close to St. Ives body washes.</li>
            <li>anti-bacterial that won&#x27;t drastically alter your skin&#x27;s natural pH.  </li>
            <li>makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>It does leave your skin feeling soft and I like the fact that it uses natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Natural</li>
            <li>&quot; I didn&#x27;t know the exfoliants weren&#x27;t natural before?</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even want to think about how much probably went straight down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a body scrub for a long time and this really did the job.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, it did not clear up my skin as much as I had hoped.  </li>
            <li>a little bit goes a long way ,..then I put a dash in the tub to clean it and it leaves my tub literally sparkling! ...</li>
            <li>The new version looks almost identical in bottle but goes by the name, &amp;#34;Purifying Sea Salt&amp;#34;  but is so different.</li>
            <li>It lathers up nicely and nothing is left behind.</li>
            <li>fine enough so that it just feels like a gentle, cleansing scrub...not hard and gritty as some exfoliators are.</li>
            <li>I use it everyday in the shower since I stop using soap my skin feels so much better, no more dry skin and for sure a lot better than all the others I tried so much expensive totally a keeper.</li>
            <li>(I still use the tea tree for my face as well as Cetaphil liquid soap), every bar soap you can think of (Irish Spring, Dove moisturizing, Ivory, etc), Old Spice High Endurance body wash, and the last product I tried before this was Olay Daily Exfoliating with sea salts.</li>
            <li>I always exfoliate my face every other day and my face is always so smooth, so I wanted to start exfoliating my body every other day as well.</li>
            <li>The Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps were too harsh for my skin to use daily, and every other \\&quot;body wash\\&quot; would run off my body before I could actually build up enough suds to get a nice lather going</li>
            <li>But had a little skin irritation at first, but it&#x27;s amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li>it up turned it upside down and after 3 days deemed it was ready.</li>
            <li>This is a nice exfoliating body wash, its 90% salt, not sure why its so expensive for something that is almost pure salt.</li>
            <li>The new version is just like the other reviewer wrote it as.  </li>

            <li> So anyway ABOUT THIS BODY WASH: like I said the smell is amazingly yummy</li>

            <li> Its been amazing, no itching, no flaking, no pain or infection or weeping.</li>
            <li> The exfoliating sea salt provides a nice texture...</li>
            <li> but this one gets it done and leaves a nice after smell too</li>
            <li> Great scent, nice texture - light and creamy.</li>
            <li> I choose five stars for this product review as I really liked the value of the item here.</li>
            <li> My husband used it and commented he really liked it.</li>
            <li> Used it before,  liked it.</li>

            <li> Amazing, skin feels clean and you smell great.</li>
            <li> Awesome new product!  </li>
            <li> Gets you clean, smells great and inexpensive.</li>
            <li> and I have been super happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> The smell of this is so lovely -- it reminds me of being at a lovely spa!  </li>
            <li> I have never been one to like the &amp;#34;fruity or flowery&amp;#34; scents and this is just a very clean, refreshing scent!  </li>
            <li> Best body wash I have ever tried so far</li>
            <li> This is by far the best body wash I have ever used!</li>
            <li> The scrub smells so good and makes my skin incredibly smooth.</li>
            <li> Love the scent of this body wash, I was using the coconut kind by St. Ives</li>
            <li> The particles in the scrub are very fine and do the job.</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t exactly what I was expecting, although it is a great body wash.</li>

            <li> Exfoliating helps my moisturizer absorb more easily and effectively too.</li>
            <li> love the smell and feel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through many</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not going to say that this is the ONLY thing to ever work but for the price and convenience it is the best thing to have worked.</li>
            <li> not?\\&quot; I&#x27;m SO glad</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> The best part, is it actually clings to your body and stays there</li>
            <li> I love the smell of it too</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so refreshing</li>
            <li> I LOVE the moisturization I get from this product</li>
            <li> They changed the formula for the better.  </li>
            <li> My skin has never felt better using St. Ives Body Wash Purifying Sea Salt Exfoliating Body Wash and the body scrub exfoliating gloves.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love the sea salt texture</li>
            <li> Lovely item.</li>
            <li> But it needs more publicity.</li>
            <li> If I had any problem with this stuff, it&#x27;s that I wished their were more crystals in it.</li>
            <li> and it feels wonderful (especially on my feet).</li>
            <li> My skin is so smooth!</li>
            <li> I love St.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m glad I got the pack of 2.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT</li>
            <li> Honestly,&lt;br /&gt;I ended up taking off the cap and added more sea salt to it</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> &amp; you&#x27;ve got a refreshing, relaxing spa treatment in a snap.  </li>
            <li> I love this body wash.</li>
            <li> Love this body wash.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff</li>
            <li> It has a nice light fragrance and moisturizes well.</li>
            <li> This body wash starts out as more of a scrub than a body wash.</li>
            <li> So, make sure the salt has all dissolved before you start shaving</li>
            <li> I break out in hives in reaction to many perfumes, plus I am prone to eczema.</li>
            <li> but it was not a scent that i cared for, plus this is an exfoliant which I love, leaves by skin silky and refreshed</li>
            <li> I love St. Ives body washes.</li>
            <li> One of our favorite shower gels.</li>
            <li> I love this body wash.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a refreshing, clean linen kind of smell.</li>
            <li> The range in pricing for this product from the various vendors was surprising, but I&#x27;m very satisfied and confident that I got the best price, and will definitely purchase again from this seller.</li>
            <li> product has a good lather and a mild, clean scent that even my boyfriend loves</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin very soft and smells great.</li>
            <li> large container, good value.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about the sea salt exfoliating my body or doing anything more, but I like this body wash for a couple of reasons: it&#x27;s cheap, and it&#x27;s on auto-delivery every 6 months through amazon&#x27;s subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> It works great in the shower, though, and makes my skin feel so soft afterward.</li>
            <li> Out of all the body washes that claim superior exfoliating, they have absolutely nothing on this body wash.</li>
            <li> smelled great, had just the right amount of grittiness, and was only like $10 + free shipping (each order includes 2 24 oz bottles with good packaging and bottle design).</li>
            <li> Very nice product is does not require too much  and leaves my skin so soft and smooth and good price.</li>
            <li> and it is so easy to keep in the shower.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent exfoliating skin wash; the Sea Salt works as a gentle, natural exfoliator AND</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have any strong scent.</li>
            <li> It smells fine</li>
            <li> So I must say, after just using this for the very first time, I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
            <li> It is rich and creamy and the salts do a really great job at exfoliating my skin to make it super soft!</li>
            <li> Nice large bottle to keep from shopping too often.  </li>
            <li> However this plus a moisturizer leaves your body feeling smooth &amp; silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works very well and smells nice.</li>
            <li> Love this product, it smell fresh  </li>
            <li> I especially appreciated the promptness of the order and delivery.</li>
            <li> It does in fact exfoliate well and leave your skin feeling light but after about 2 hours I&#x27;d be itchy vs the Dove which kept my skin refreshed</li>
            <li> Such a great buy</li>
            <li> This is great to alternate with Energizing Citrus, another St. Ives body wash.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a smell that men and women would enjoy and it doesn&#x27;t stay on your skin after your shower.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this body wash.</li>
            <li> The beads do not exfoliate as much as I would like, but this smells really nice</li>
            <li> My body felt as smooth as my face.</li>
            <li> While it smells nice and lathers really well, I can&#x27;t feel any &#x27;grit&#x27; in it as an exfoliant.  </li>
            <li> somehow I discovered using old plastic shopping bags makes a good scrubber on the dogs and the tub.  </li>
            <li> Light scent, not too fine or course scrub, doesn&#x27;t take a lot, feel clean, doesn&#x27;t leave residue.</li>
            <li> I originally started using it because it was the grittiest soap out there.  </li>
            <li> This is much better than the higher priced brands.</li>
            <li> So just be aware you may need to scrub out the shower more often if you want to take a bath.  </li>
            <li> Some products still leaves you feeling not that clean</li>
            <li> but I bought so much of it that I began to enjoy the fragrance and texture more.  </li>
            <li> and I feel CLEAN.</li>
            <li> B00GMP5VW4 Clean Logic Exfoliating Bath Gloves (3 Pack)]] or a loofah sponge</li>
            <li> and I do feel clean when I come out of the shower</li>
            <li> To me, this is just as good, the price is awesome for TWO bottles and a little goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> Other reviews list this as one of the best exfoliating washes on the marker, but I don&#x27;t really agree.  </li>
            <li> This was the right one to go to!</li>
            <li> Love this body wash - gentle and not drying but does the job - skin feels clean.</li>
            <li> It lathers nicely, smells great (fresh and clean), and is reasonably priced...comes in a two pack of large bottles that seem to last forever.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin so most of the &amp;#34;exfoliating&amp;#34; body washed out there include so many moisturizers that they don&#x27;t clean very well.  </li>
            <li> I liked the old version because it was like having a salt scrub and body soap all in one.  </li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied with my purchase and would recommend this to anyone who likes a gentle exfoliant in their body wash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked products containing sea salt because it helps clear acne.</li>
            <li> The picture of this bottle shows the old version that I liked which is called \\&quot;Purified\\</li>
            <li> Very nice light scent and has a slight pumice (the salts?)</li>
            <li> I feel so clean and fresh afterwards.</li>
            <li> and it made my skin feel smooth after my first wash</li>
            <li> And the best part about it is the fact that it&#x27;s 100% natural and is free of harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> There is NO SEA SALT, unlike the original version that was gritty and smelled amazing.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fresh sweet scent.</li>
            <li> This body wash makes your skin smoothly and soft, when it mix water and it become rich foam, it makes your skin clean and Fresh!</li>
            <li> The size of the salt beads is perfect, not too large, but not too small where you don&#x27;t even know</li>
            <li> Let me say, first off, that TWO bottles (containers?) arrived!</li>
            <li> I use it with a nylon bath poof, which makes it even more effective at sloughing off dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin silky smooth and very soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin so soft and smooth, especially when I follow it up with a good body lotion after the shower.</li>
            <li> This leaves my dogs soft and silky, better than any dog shampoo I&#x27;ve ever tried...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d prefer a more masculine fresh scent.</li>
            <li> and I love how it leaves my skin so soft</li>
            <li> I love the exfoliants and the fact that it is made from natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> St. Ives is a quality brand, this is one of my favorite body washes it exfoliates very well and leaves the skin very soft and super smooth, the scent is also very tolerable.</li>
            <li> I got such a great deal and really love St. Ives products, but if you&#x27;re looking for a really deep cleaning exfoliant, I&#x27;d go with the classic apricot scrub.</li>
            <li> This is a decent product, this is a big bottle and the price was good.</li>
            <li> It gently exfoliated my skin while leaving it feeling clean.</li>
            <li> With the bars of soap, they all left a gross film on my body which did more harm than good for my large pores.</li>
            <li> I ordered this body wash because it was the best there is (or was), but instead of sending me the Purify wash they sent the new version that sucks.</li>
            <li> This is a SUPER great value, at least at the time it was a 2 pack.</li>
            <li> St.Ives makes a GREAT exfoliating body wash I&#x27;ve used in the past (not the face scrub).</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve always gotten every new scrub/lotion/treatment available.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin nicely hydrated, even in the dry winter weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It definitely makes you feel super clean!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I was recommended by my skin specialist to use St. Ives Body Purifying Sea Salt Exfoliating Body Wash to keep me skin, clear, shiny, healthy, and vibrant.  </li>
            <li> This is not ever in or they quit selling it at our local stores and it is the favorite of my son.  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time at my parents house in their guest bathroom.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I had been looking for in a body wash</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t like it..</li>
            <li> I love this product and have been using it for the last year.  </li>
            <li> First of all this is Katrina, Kyle is my boyfriend and the one who bought this for me.</li>
            <li> the saint ives body wash with sea salt was very excxellerationing !</li>
            <li> This Exfoliating body wash keeps my skin smooth, soft, and glowing.</li>
            <li> I was nervous at first</li>
            <li> I use it with a loofah and scrub the spots that need exfoliation first before the salt dissolves.</li>
            <li> Love the bits of salt for extra skin exfoliation!</li>
            <li> , this one definitely is awesome!I switch with them on and off with each shower everyday to give my skin a nice balance followed with an after lotion and my skin is as soft as it gets(which is amazing since i&#x27;m pregnant).</li>
            <li> The original bottle says natural exfoliants</li>
            <li> Your skin will feel incredibly soft, clean and refreshed afterwards.</li>
            <li> Soft, clean scent.</li>
            <li> Leaves the skin soft, clean, hydrated and alllergy-free after wash.</li>
            <li> The result is nice and smooth, clean smelling skin that isn&#x27;t left dried out.</li>
            <li> The competition is easily 3x MORE expensive and isn&#x27;t NEARLY as good.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this scrub, and is a decent exfoliant, better than a lot of the more expensive brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty much all we use now.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin..</li>
            <li> Gets you real clean, I mean clean.</li>
            <li> so you can really work it into your skin.</li>
            <li> and I like to feel like I&#x27;m really exfoliating...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon fro selling this because I can&#x27;t find it in any of the stores.</li>
            <li> Looking forward to gentle scrubs in the shower.</li>
            <li> I am a real fan of St. Ives products.</li>
            <li> and I hope you like it as much as me.</li>
            <li> This St. Ives exfoliating purify body wash is soothing, fresh, and natural.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I really like that</li>
            <li> Very bummed about not getting what they advertised.</li>
            <li> and it smells good and not overwhelming!</li>
            <li> The exfoliating grains are also nice and small, you can really work it into your skin to buff it into softness.  </li>
            <li> Bubbles up nicely and last a long time</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is also very gentle; I&#x27;ve been using it every day, and it doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin at all.  </li>
            <li> Foams and lathers better than previous formula and really exfoliates.  </li>
            <li> far as body washes, this is my favorite so far, definitely give it a try.</li>
            <li> The body was now says \\&quot;NEW!</li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly and packaged in a plastic bag to prevent any possible leaks.</li>
            <li> Ives does decent products.</li>
            <li> Noticeably better looking skin on chest and back in just two short weeks.  </li>
            <li> I have mild acne on my back and shoulders.</li>
            <li> I use it in conjunction with a back brush to treat my back acne in my latest attempt.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this mainly because of the reviews I was reading on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This product completely cleared it up!!</li>
            <li> This product works and doesn&#x27;t smell too strong so it can be used with other products.</li>
            <li> The soap has a faint scent to it and feels great to use.</li>
            <li> item - Dove Fresh Body Wash. The differences are vast and made this St Ives just not for me.</li>
            <li> It will take your skin right off if you rub enough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recommended it to other eczema sufferers and they also saw huge improvements.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now, but even after my first use, I noticed a difference on my chest area; the skin there (which is usually a bit coarser) was remarkably softer after just one use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> got a new version that is not as good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Amazon now pictures the correct new \\&quot;watered down\\&quot; version.&lt;br /&gt;Fool</li>
            <li> &quot; but what I got was the new version that I don&#x27;t like.  </li>
            <li> I just received a new order today March 11th 2013.</li>
            <li> It left my skin really smooth which I usually only get from moisturizing.</li>
            <li> and wow!</li>
            <li> The mineral salt is very fine and the wash is very thick and the smell is very \\&quot;spa\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Most importantly, it&#x27;s not crazy expensive.</li>
            <li> The acne I had didn&#x27;t clear up fully</li>
            <li> I like to buy what they like and am so glad at least Amazon has what the stores quit selling.  </li>
            <li> This product states it&#x27;s 100% natural</li>
            <li> The fragrance, isn&#x27;t too overpowering, and it leaves your skin soft and silky.</li>
            <li> If this can make my 49-year-old saggy skin look young and vital again, it will work for you.  </li>
            <li> The product exfoliates well but is gentle enough that it doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried Dove, Axe, Old Spice, Neutrogena, and nothing has ever come close to St. Ives body washes.</li>
            <li> anti-bacterial that won&#x27;t drastically alter your skin&#x27;s natural pH.  </li>
            <li> makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> It does leave your skin feeling soft and I like the fact that it uses natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Natural</li>
            <li> &quot; I didn&#x27;t know the exfoliants weren&#x27;t natural before?</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even want to think about how much probably went straight down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a body scrub for a long time and this really did the job.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, it did not clear up my skin as much as I had hoped.  </li>
            <li> a little bit goes a long way ,..then I put a dash in the tub to clean it and it leaves my tub literally sparkling! ...</li>
            <li> The new version looks almost identical in bottle but goes by the name, &amp;#34;Purifying Sea Salt&amp;#34;  but is so different.</li>
            <li> It lathers up nicely and nothing is left behind.</li>
            <li> fine enough so that it just feels like a gentle, cleansing scrub...not hard and gritty as some exfoliators are.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday in the shower since I stop using soap my skin feels so much better, no more dry skin and for sure a lot better than all the others I tried so much expensive totally a keeper.</li>
            <li> (I still use the tea tree for my face as well as Cetaphil liquid soap), every bar soap you can think of (Irish Spring, Dove moisturizing, Ivory, etc), Old Spice High Endurance body wash, and the last product I tried before this was Olay Daily Exfoliating with sea salts.</li>
            <li> I always exfoliate my face every other day and my face is always so smooth, so I wanted to start exfoliating my body every other day as well.</li>
            <li> The Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps were too harsh for my skin to use daily, and every other \\&quot;body wash\\&quot; would run off my body before I could actually build up enough suds to get a nice lather going</li>
            <li> But had a little skin irritation at first, but it&#x27;s amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> it up turned it upside down and after 3 days deemed it was ready.</li>
            <li> This is a nice exfoliating body wash, its 90% salt, not sure why its so expensive for something that is almost pure salt.</li>
            <li> The new version is just like the other reviewer wrote it as.  </li>
            <li> The only reason why I&#x27;m rating at 4 stars is it was placed in a box with a vacuum and one busted open and got all over everything.</li>
            <li> Second, the texture is similar to Fast Orange hand soap (if you&#x27;ve ever used it), so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> , it exfoliates sooo nicely, a little goes a long way, it really evens out skin tone and softens so</li>
            <li> While I appreciate the fact it cleans my body, I am not happy with the fact I do not smell like I am squeaky clean...</li>
            <li> I use every other shower/wash, the other time I use something very moisturizing, schedule seems to work for my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff is gold, it especially helps in areas with hard water, the salt somehow helps keep your skin from drying out too much.</li>
            <li> I will be using this for a long time.</li>
            <li> (Other skin-care products can cause me to break out in red marks/bumps or a rash, but this doesn&#x27;t do that.)</li>
            <li> I used to love one of their &amp;#34;pore&amp;#34; focused face washes and when they discontinued it I was so sad!</li>
            <li> First, it&#x27;s all natural (which I hope everyone can get behind); harsh and abrasive detergents belong in the washer machine, not in your shower.</li>
            <li> The St Ives leaves you feeling filmy and dry skinned.</li>
            <li> but it also gets dry..</li>
            <li> It is just abrasive enough to truly slough off those dead skin cells but the foundation of the body wash is creamy enough to offset any &#x27;roughness&#x27; that could occur.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d prefer a not fresh scent but the scent is pleasing enough.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price although I purchased it at my local pharmacy for much less per bottle.</li>
            <li> Normally use the green tea scrub, but tried this when I could not find the green tea.  </li>
            <li> It can leave your back a little dry.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to the consumers for their serious consideration when deciding to purchase a body wash.</li>
            <li> The smell is weak and the soap feels ilke lotion that somone threw a handful of sand in thanks to the pumice they use instead of sea salt.</li>
            <li> but I won&#x27;t buy it again, especially for heavy exfoliating.</li>
            <li> The sea salt aren&#x27;t big, in my opinion, where it may rub on the skin harshly.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not really complaining.</li>
            <li> It is not much like sea salt.</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Quite a bargain compared to other salt scrubs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used lots of others and other then my moisturizing body wash,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking into other soaps that contain sea salt.</li>
            <li> I feel pretty lame reviewing this</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t think it exfoliates as well as other products have.</li>
            <li> If you have dry, flaky skin, this will help remove the dead skin.  </li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t bad (definitely not as bad as a lot of the other body washes on the market today with that awful medicinal smell), but it also isn&#x27;t great.</li>
            <li> No more rough dry feet for me!  </li>
            <li> its to gritty, hard to wash off</li>
            <li> Hands down.</li>
            <li> Also the body wash has less exfoliants than before and looks like ranch dressing.</li>
            <li> I started using this body wash a little over a year ago.</li>
            <li> I bought this wanting something to remove dead skin off my body.</li>
            <li> After using this body was just a few times-</li>
            <li> It exfoliates my skin without being too harsh.</li>
            <li> I use this every time i need to get some dead skin off.</li>
            <li> I used to use Ivory and that was so plain, I wanted a change.</li>
            <li> I suffer from folliculitis and am always getting small little bumps all over my body.</li>
            <li> However, it somewhat stopped working for me in the past 6 months.</li>
            <li> Since I purchased it online, I was not able to pre-smell it like I would if I purchased at a store.</li>
            <li> usually can count on St. Ives.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s going on.  </li>
            <li> As an added bonus, this product appears to be less expensive than every other body wash gimmick out</li>
            <li> I had (past tense) eczema on my arms, stomach, legs, hands,</li>
            <li> I use it at least once a week</li>
            <li> Like the thick, creamy consistency too</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that the &amp;#34;sea salt&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t dissolve in the water, so you can&#x27;t use this in the tub unless you&#x27;d like some grainy particles in some very sensitive places.</li>
            <li> It does not have the gritty texture and am very sad that they changed it.  </li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re just looking to exfoliate a couple times a week this isn&#x27;t a bad buy, BUT I can&#x27;t recommend it for clarifying the skin or for daily use regarding the smell.  </li>
            <li> i like the itty bitty little bits that make this exfoliating, but the fragrance leaves me cold.  </li>
            <li> I am addicted to seaweed wraps</li>
            <li> that it hasn&#x27;t made my condition worse.  </li>
            <li> I usually hate &amp;#34;textured&amp;#34; body washes with the little &amp;#34;microbeads&amp;#34; in them, but this is not like that at all.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it does it job</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please tell me if I&#x27;m wrong.</li>
            <li> I am OBSESSED with this body wash, I use it every evening</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m bored....</li>
            <li> I was going to buy a $70 body exfoliating wash from a well known TV shopping channel, but could not justify the expensive price.</li>
            <li> , I use this with my Beechwood dry brush in the shower, Try these together, you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> it was so bad that my skin would often weep and become infected.</li>
            <li> you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have very bad eczema</li>
            <li> I am disappointed by that!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> and this broke my skin out terribly.</li>
            <li> This product is not what I was expecting, it dries my skin and the worst part is that if I leave some of the product out it hardness and it looks like glue - it makes me wonder what is the soap made of</li>
            <li> or you will be in for a nasty surprise!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> You can buy this or, you can get a seaweed wrap at a day spa. I am addicted to seaweed wraps and this is the closest thing to it. It you use this with a bath brush, you will feel amazing.</li>
            <li> I thought I bought the good soap I always used.&lt;br /&gt;I got a new version that is not as good.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon now pictures the correct new \\&quot;watered down\\&quot; version.&lt;br /&gt;Fool me twice, shame on me.</li>
            <li> This is not ever in or they quit selling it at our local stores and it is the favorite of my son.  I like to buy what they like and am so glad at least Amazon has what the stores quit selling.  These stores should take a hint, if it keeps selling out then they should keep getting it because that means people like it.</li>
            <li> Smell is perfume like and I am a bit allergic to it</li>
            <li> I have very bad eczema and this broke my skin out terribly. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it does it job and it made my skin feel smooth after my first wash but after 3 days of used, I was covered from head to toe in eczema.</li>
            <li> love the smell and feel. One may say that it&#x27;s not manly like oldspice, but who cares if I use deodorant anyway? I like that they try to avoid harmful chemicals. Most importantly, it&#x27;s not crazy expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for years.  I originally started using it because it was the grittiest soap out there.  Since then, St. Ives has changed the formula and it uses pumice instead of all salt.  I liked the old version because it was like having a salt scrub and body soap all in one.  I have very oily skin so most of the &amp;#34;exfoliating&amp;#34; body washed out there include so many moisturizers that they don&#x27;t clean very well.  I continue to buy this soap because cause it&#x27;s te best I can find for my skin type.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday in the shower since I stop using soap my skin feels so much better, no more dry skin and for sure a lot better than all the others I tried so much expensive totally a keeper.</li>
            <li> This product states it&#x27;s 100% natural BUT it has Sodium Laureth Sulfate (SLES). Do a Bing or Google search on SLES.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please tell me if I&#x27;m wrong.</li>
            <li> It lathers nicely, smells great (fresh and clean), and is reasonably priced...comes in a two pack of large bottles that seem to last forever. The exfoliating sea salt provides a nice texture...fine enough so that it just feels like a gentle, cleansing scrub...not hard and gritty as some exfoliators are. Great product! :)</li>
            <li> I suffer from folliculitis and am always getting small little bumps all over my body. It&#x27;s always been embarrassing for me growing up so I&#x27;ve always gotten every new scrub/lotion/treatment available. I&#x27;ve been through many and I&#x27;m not going to say that this is the ONLY thing to ever work but for the price and convenience it is the best thing to have worked. When I saw this at Wal-Mart, I grabbed it because it had a coupon for a discount on one of the face washes I needed and I had never tried it before so I figured \\&quot;Why not?\\&quot; I&#x27;m SO glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;As far as body washes, this is my favorite so far, definitely give it a try.</li>
            <li> St.Ives makes a GREAT exfoliating body wash I&#x27;ve used in the past (not the face scrub). I cannot find it anywhere and was hoping this was an updated product...It&#x27;s okay but I won&#x27;t buy it again, especially for heavy exfoliating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every soap product on the market to help battle my oily skin: Cuticura, Dr. Bronners peppermint and tea tree liquid soap (I still use the tea tree for my face as well as Cetaphil liquid soap), every bar soap you can think of (Irish Spring, Dove moisturizing, Ivory, etc), Old Spice High Endurance body wash, and the last product I tried before this was Olay Daily Exfoliating with sea salts. With the bars of soap, they all left a gross film on my body which did more harm than good for my large pores. The Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps were too harsh for my skin to use daily, and every other \\&quot;body wash\\&quot; would run off my body before I could actually build up enough suds to get a nice lather going (I don&#x27;t use any loofahs or facecloths). I don&#x27;t even want to think about how much probably went straight down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap is different. First, it&#x27;s all natural (which I hope everyone can get behind); harsh and abrasive detergents belong in the washer machine, not in your shower. Second, the texture is similar to Fast Orange hand soap (if you&#x27;ve ever used it), so a little goes a long way. The best part, is it actually clings to your body and stays there so you can really work it into your skin. Out of all the body washes that claim superior exfoliating, they have absolutely nothing on this body wash. Your skin will feel incredibly soft, clean and refreshed afterwards. As an added bonus, this product appears to be less expensive than every other body wash gimmick out there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It appears that my almost decade-long hunt for the perfect body wash I can use on a daily basis is finally over. Thank you St. Ives!</li>
            <li> Best body wash I have ever tried so far I love the smell of it too it&#x27;s so refreshing and my skin feels so good after using it.</li>
            <li> This product works and doesn&#x27;t smell too strong so it can be used with other products. The only reason why I&#x27;m rating at 4 stars is it was placed in a box with a vacuum and one busted open and got all over everything.</li>
            <li> Very nice light scent and has a slight pumice (the salts?) feeling for extra scrubbing power.  Nice large bottle to keep from shopping too often.  Good size for the price.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a body scrub for a long time and this really did the job.  It smells fantastic and works great on the skin.  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the moisturization I get from this product but I thought it would be grittier...I am disappointed by that! Their just tiny specs of salt and I like to feel like I&#x27;m really exfoliating...not with this product!</li>
            <li> I bought this wanting something to remove dead skin off my body. My god did this thing work. It left my skin really smooth which I usually only get from moisturizing. However this plus a moisturizer leaves your body feeling smooth &amp; silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It definitely makes you feel super clean! ;)</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time at my parents house in their guest bathroom. It was exactly what I had been looking for in a body wash so I bought this as soon as I got home. It is wonderful. The consistency of the exfoliant is perfect. The size of the salt beads is perfect, not too large, but not too small where you don&#x27;t even know it&#x27;s in there. I use this daily. It feels great on my skin. I will be using this for a long time. I am completely satisfied with my purchase and would recommend this to anyone who likes a gentle exfoliant in their body wash. LOVE IT!!!!!</li>
            <li> They changed the formula for the better.  Foams and lathers better than previous formula and really exfoliates.  Love it!! Will definitely buy again and again.</li>
            <li> My skin has never felt better using St. Ives Body Wash Purifying Sea Salt Exfoliating Body Wash and the body scrub exfoliating gloves.  It works very well and smells nice.</li>
            <li> St. Ives Body Wash is affordable, it smells good, and it is a good body exfoliator. I would definitely purchase again. The product arrived quickly and packaged in a plastic bag to prevent any possible leaks.</li>
            <li> This stuff is gold, it especially helps in areas with hard water, the salt somehow helps keep your skin from drying out too much.</li>
            <li> This is a nice exfoliating body wash, its 90% salt, not sure why its so expensive for something that is almost pure salt. I like this product without preservatives, just wish it didn&#x27;t have any SLS. We are just trading one hormone disrupter for another...&lt;br /&gt;It does a good job of exfoliating.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to wash with it. It is great on my feet. I feel so clean and fresh afterwards.</li>
            <li> I use this product all the time, and it is cheaper to use prime than buy it in the store!</li>
            <li> No more rough dry feet for me!  It&#x27;s like getting your skin polished!  I use it every day,&lt;br /&gt;even my husband uses it.</li>
            <li> This inexpensive body wash blows the roof off the competition. The competition is easily 3x MORE expensive and isn&#x27;t NEARLY as good. The mineral salt is very fine and the wash is very thick and the smell is very \\&quot;spa\\&quot;. Love it.</li>
            <li> Love this product, it smell fresh  I love the sea salt texture just feels like I get an extra scrub . Some products still leaves you feeling not that clean but this one gets it done and leaves a nice after smell too</li>
            <li> Purchased a bottle of this body wash.  The lather is good and I have no doubt it removes dirt.  My issue is that as soon as I am through drying off the smell is gone.  It does not linger at all.  While I appreciate the fact it cleans my body, I am not happy with the fact I do not smell like I am squeaky clean...</li>
            <li> Great scent, nice texture - light and creamy. Skin looks and feels great after using it even if I don&#x27;t apply a body lotion. Defenitely recomend.</li>
            <li> If you have dry, flaky skin, this will help remove the dead skin.  The fragrance, isn&#x27;t too overpowering, and it leaves your skin soft and silky.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent exfoliating body wash. This is much better than the higher priced brands. I keep this on hand at all times!  I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> It smells absolutely great. It&#x27;s a refreshing, clean linen kind of smell. The sea salt aren&#x27;t big, in my opinion, where it may rub on the skin harshly.</li>
            <li> If this can make my 49-year-old saggy skin look young and vital again, it will work for you.  Quite a bargain compared to other salt scrubs.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about the sea salt exfoliating my body or doing anything more, but I like this body wash for a couple of reasons: it&#x27;s cheap, and it&#x27;s on auto-delivery every 6 months through amazon&#x27;s subscribe and save. It doesn&#x27;t have any strong scent.</li>
            <li> Awesome new product!  I had been using the cocoa butter one but this one is great because it exfoliates as well!  I have never been one to like the &amp;#34;fruity or flowery&amp;#34; scents and this is just a very clean, refreshing scent!  Great job St. Ives!</li>
            <li> smells great and makes your skin feel wonderful.  combine with loofah and you will be so happy!</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t like it.. but I bought so much of it that I began to enjoy the fragrance and texture more.  I might purchase again, but for now switched to a different body wash.  I do like St. Ives brand though.  This wasn&#x27;t exactly what I was expecting, although it is a great body wash.</li>
            <li> Good item. I appreciate this.  Lovely item. works superb. But it needs more publicity. so try and give it the best it requires. But had a little skin irritation at first, but it&#x27;s amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
            <li> So I must say, after just using this for the very first time, I&#x27;m pleased with it. My skin is noticeably softer. I can tell by touch and the way my clothes feel on my skin. If I had any problem with this stuff, it&#x27;s that I wished their were more crystals in it. I will definitely be buying when I run out, though I don&#x27;t think that will be for a while!</li>
            <li> Very nice product is does not require too much  and leaves my skin so soft and smooth and good price.</li>
            <li> I just bought this last week and I have been super happy with my purchase. The soap has a faint scent to it and feels great to use. So with the price the scent and the feeling after using makes this a great buy</li>
            <li> I choose five stars for this product review as I really liked the value of the item here. I especially appreciated the promptness of the order and delivery. I would highly recommend this product to the consumers for their serious consideration when deciding to purchase a body wash.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  Not enough salt feeling in the product.  I will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that the &amp;#34;sea salt&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t dissolve in the water, so you can&#x27;t use this in the tub unless you&#x27;d like some grainy particles in some very sensitive places. It works great in the shower, though, and makes my skin feel so soft afterward.</li>
            <li> Great product. The exfoliation is amazing!</li>
            <li> I was recommended by my skin specialist to use St. Ives Body Purifying Sea Salt Exfoliating Body Wash to keep me skin, clear, shiny, healthy, and vibrant.  Guess what? It does all of those things.  My body looks awesome.  Thanks Amazon fro selling this because I can&#x27;t find it in any of the stores.</li>
            <li> Does indeed seem to remove/exfoliate a layer of skin so does what it says on the tin! St.Ives does decent products.</li>
            <li> This product is probably the best body scrub I&#x27;ve come across. I use it in the shower several times a week and it feels wonderful (especially on my feet). It leaves my skin so soft and smooth, especially when I follow it up with a good body lotion after the shower. The particles in the scrub are very fine and do the job.</li>
            <li> This leaves my dogs soft and silky, better than any dog shampoo I&#x27;ve ever tried... a little bit goes a long way ,..then I put a dash in the tub to clean it and it leaves my tub literally sparkling! ... somehow I discovered using old plastic shopping bags makes a good scrubber on the dogs and the tub.  Recycle, give it a try!</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace a cancelled subscribe and save item - Dove Fresh Body Wash. The differences are vast and made this St Ives just not for me. The St Ives leaves you feeling filmy and dry skinned. It does in fact exfoliate well and leave your skin feeling light but after about 2 hours I&#x27;d be itchy vs the Dove which kept my skin refreshed all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose this is for some people and not others.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have been using it for the last year.  I&#x27;ll definitely continue to use it in the future!</li>
            <li> First of all this is Katrina, Kyle is my boyfriend and the one who bought this for me. We went body wash shopping and he absolutely loved the smell. I&#x27;ve used lots of others and other then my moisturizing body wash, Olay ribbons, this one definitely is awesome!I switch with them on and off with each shower everyday to give my skin a nice balance followed with an after lotion and my skin is as soft as it gets(which is amazing since i&#x27;m pregnant). So anyway ABOUT THIS BODY WASH: like I said the smell is amazingly yummy, it exfoliates sooo nicely, a little goes a long way, it really evens out skin tone and softens so I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Love the feeling of the fine salt in the wash and the scent is wonderful.</li>
            <li> the saint ives body wash with sea salt was very excxellerationing ! It was de4livered on time, and the quality was great as always!</li>
            <li> Great - skin feels good after showering with it. I use it at least once a week and it is so easy to keep in the shower.</li>
            <li> This body wash is the best! You can&#x27;t beat the price although I purchased it at my local pharmacy for much less per bottle. I&#x27;ve been searching for a soapy exfoliating body wash for some time now. I don&#x27;t like using oily body scrubs and Most exfoliating washes have these silly microbeads that do nothing. This wash has the perfect consistency and is a fantastic exfoliator. I&#x27;d prefer a not fresh scent but the scent is pleasing enough. It&#x27;s a fresh sweet scent. I&#x27;d prefer a more masculine fresh scent. My skin is so smooth! I hope this never goes out of production.</li>
            <li> I am OBSESSED with this body wash, I use it every evening and I dread thinking about my shower routine without it. It is just abrasive enough to truly slough off those dead skin cells but the foundation of the body wash is creamy enough to offset any &#x27;roughness&#x27; that could occur. I believe in exfoliating the skin on a daily basis and this product makes my life a lot easier in that department. Not tested on animals.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best body wash I have ever used! It is rich and creamy and the salts do a really great job at exfoliating my skin to make it super soft!</li>
            <li> its to gritty, hard to wash off</li>
            <li> I love St.Ives products, so I decided to try this out. I&#x27;m very happy I did. It leaves my skin very soft and smells great. The acne I had didn&#x27;t clear up fully but it did get rid of some of it. Such a great buy, I&#x27;m glad I got the pack of 2.</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely wonderful.  I love the smell and the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> Great product.  It works as intended. Noticeably better looking skin on chest and back in just two short weeks.  Just lather up and scrub all over your body.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a sea salt body scrub to prep for sunless tanning. This is a SUPER great value, at least at the time it was a 2 pack. The scrub smells so good and makes my skin incredibly smooth. My husband used it and commented he really liked it.</li>
            <li> St. Ives makes a great product. Gets you clean, smells great and inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I started using this body wash a little over a year ago. I&#x27;ve always liked products containing sea salt because it helps clear acne. I have mild acne on my back and shoulders. This product completely cleared it up!! I thought it was a God send. However, it somewhat stopped working for me in the past 6 months. I&#x27;m looking into other soaps that contain sea salt. However, I would say to try it. It&#x27;s very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Used it before,  liked it. Looking forward to gentle scrubs in the shower.</li>
            <li> Amazing, skin feels clean and you smell great. Bubbles up nicely and last a long time plus you cannot beat the great value.</li>
            <li> I purchased two bottled of this product to use as a daily body wash.  The product doesn&#x27;t have a noticeable scent so it is great to use if you have mixed-matched sets of let over scented body sprays or lotions.  The product exfoliates well but is gentle enough that it doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one caution is that the particles that exfoliate leave a gritty feel along the bottom of my shower.  So just be aware you may need to scrub out the shower more often if you want to take a bath.  If you don&#x27;t, you&#x27;ll have to recline on a bed of gritty exfoliating particles.</li>
            <li> This is great to alternate with Energizing Citrus, another St. Ives body wash. Gets you real clean, I mean clean. It will take your skin right off if you rub enough. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I am a real fan of St. Ives products. This Exfoliating body wash keeps my skin smooth, soft, and glowing.</li>
            <li> This product is not what I was expecting, it dries my skin and the worst part is that if I leave some of the product out it hardness and it looks like glue - it makes me wonder what is the soap made of</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin.. but it also gets dry.. I was nervous at first but this is my 3rd order of this. LOVE IT and it smells good and not overwhelming!</li>
            <li> smelled great, had just the right amount of grittiness, and was only like $10 + free shipping (each order includes 2 24 oz bottles with good packaging and bottle design). I think this will be my body/face wash for a while. Also good at exfoliating which I REAAALLY needed.</li>
            <li> I feel pretty lame reviewing this but I&#x27;m bored....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best body wash on the market. Hands down. I tried it, loved it, and wife agrees. It&#x27;s pretty much all we use now.</li>
            <li> Honestly,&lt;br /&gt;I ended up taking off the cap and added more sea salt to it&lt;br /&gt;shook it up turned it upside down and after 3 days deemed it was ready.</li>
            <li> This is amazing body wash. I&#x27;m not a doctor, or anything like that, but I do have severe eczema and this is the only thing I have ever used that has gotten rid of it. I had (past tense) eczema on my arms, stomach, legs, hands, fingers- it was so bad that my skin would often weep and become infected. After using this body was just a few times- its gone. I&#x27;ve recommended it to other eczema sufferers and they also saw huge improvements. Its been amazing, no itching, no flaking, no pain or infection or weeping. I even put it in my hand soap to help with the eczema on my hands. I will forever be grateful to St. Ives.</li>
            <li> i like the itty bitty little bits that make this exfoliating, but the fragrance leaves me cold.  i&#x27;ll probably try a different scent and give this to hubby.</li>
            <li> I love this body wash! I smells awesome and I love how it leaves my skin so soft and I feel CLEAN. I used to use Ivory and that was so plain, I wanted a change. This was the right one to go to! I was going to buy a $70 body exfoliating wash from a well known TV shopping channel, but could not justify the expensive price. To me, this is just as good, the price is awesome for TWO bottles and a little goes a LONG way. Try it and I hope you like it as much as me. It&#x27;s a smell that men and women would enjoy and it doesn&#x27;t stay on your skin after your shower. My husband liked the smell and tried it and he liked it a lot too.</li>
            <li> This is the best body scrub I have ever used. I actually purchased this body wash at my local Walgreens and the scent just blew me away.</li>
            <li> This is a decent product, this is a big bottle and the price was good. I just don&#x27;t think it exfoliates as well as other products have. But this smells good and isn&#x27;t sticky.</li>
            <li> I have tried Dove, Axe, Old Spice, Neutrogena, and nothing has ever come close to St. Ives body washes. Along with their facewashes, their body washes have been very kind to my skin. This St. Ives exfoliating purify body wash is soothing, fresh, and natural. It also is a plus that St. Ives is eco minded, even giving you instructions on how to properly recycle the bottle when finished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The amount we get and that it&#x27;s a 2 pack is of great value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve got nothing but good things to say about this body wash. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> St. Ives is a quality brand, this is one of my favorite body washes it exfoliates very well and leaves the skin very soft and super smooth, the scent is also very tolerable.</li>
            <li> Soft, clean scent. Just enough scrub and texture. We buy this product all the time. Love it.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this body wash. Since I purchased it online, I was not able to pre-smell it like I would if I purchased at a store. The smell is wonderful and great for a refreshing shower. I love the exfoliants and the fact that it is made from natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent exfoliating skin wash; the Sea Salt works as a gentle, natural exfoliator AND anti-bacterial that won&#x27;t drastically alter your skin&#x27;s natural pH.  Occasionally pair this with a pair of exfoliating gloves like these [[ASIN:B00GMP5VW4 Clean Logic Exfoliating Bath Gloves (3 Pack)]] or a loofah sponge [[ASIN:B00OEDENGQ Exfoliating Loofah Sponge For Skin Care in Bath, Spa or Shower - 3 Pack Skin Care Tool For Men and Women - Durable and Easy To Use - 100% Natural Luffa - Excellent Body Scrubber and Exfoliator.]] &amp; you&#x27;ve got a refreshing, relaxing spa treatment in a snap.  This has a soothing feel and isn&#x27;t over-drying to the skin; a favorite--so glad to find it at Amazon!</li>
            <li> Eh, I was really looking forward to getting this 2 pack in the mail, but the results are not really what I expected.  Other reviews list this as one of the best exfoliating washes on the marker, but I don&#x27;t really agree.  I really like that I got such a great deal and really love St. Ives products, but if you&#x27;re looking for a really deep cleaning exfoliant, I&#x27;d go with the classic apricot scrub.</li>
            <li> The new version is just like the other reviewer wrote it as.  It does not have the gritty texture and am very sad that they changed it.  I was seriously not sure whether it was lotion or not the first time I opened it, and thought it was a mistake.</li>
            <li> I love this body wash! It exfoliates my skin without being too harsh. St. Ives always had the best products. I will be purchasing this again when mine runs out.</li>
            <li> I love this body wash. It does what it says it does. Exfoliates. I use this every time i need to get some dead skin off. I soak in the tub with it and also use it in the shower. Its also moisturizing which is good. Like the thick, creamy consistency too</li>
            <li> Leaves the skin soft, clean, hydrated and alllergy-free after wash.</li>
            <li> The beads do not exfoliate as much as I would like, but this smells really nice and I do feel clean when I come out of the shower so I&#x27;m not really complaining.</li>
            <li> Love this body wash.  Great scent, very refreshing.</li>
            <li> The picture of this bottle shows the old version that I liked which is called \\&quot;Purified\\&quot; but what I got was the new version that I don&#x27;t like.  Do not purchase this if you think you will be getting the one that is pictured...you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this scrub, and is a decent exfoliant, better than a lot of the more expensive brands I&#x27;ve tried. I use it with a nylon bath poof, which makes it even more effective at sloughing off dead skin cells. The result is nice and smooth, clean smelling skin that isn&#x27;t left dried out. Exfoliating helps my moisturizer absorb more easily and effectively too. The range in pricing for this product from the various vendors was surprising, but I&#x27;m very satisfied and confident that I got the best price, and will definitely purchase again from this seller.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff *-* makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I expected. It is not much like sea salt. It is just body wash so it&#x27;s not what I wanted.</li>
            <li> It can leave your back a little dry.  I use it in conjunction with a back brush to treat my back acne in my latest attempt.  It&#x27;s really good.  I like the way it feels when it goes on and I like that it hasn&#x27;t made my condition worse.  Hopefully it will improve my condition.</li>
            <li> Normally use the green tea scrub, but tried this when I could not find the green tea.  It has a nice light fragrance and moisturizes well.</li>
            <li> I always exfoliate my face every other day and my face is always so smooth, so I wanted to start exfoliating my body every other day as well. So I came across this at Target and bought it. So I tried it the next morning and wow! My body felt as smooth as my face. It gently exfoliated my skin while leaving it feeling clean. And the best part about it is the fact that it&#x27;s 100% natural and is free of harsh chemicals. I&#x27;ve always loved St. Ives and will continue to love it forever! :)</li>
            <li> I ordered this body wash because it was the best there is (or was), but instead of sending me the Purify wash they sent the new version that sucks. The new version looks almost identical in bottle but goes by the name, &amp;#34;Purifying Sea Salt&amp;#34;  but is so different. The smell is weak and the soap feels ilke lotion that somone threw a handful of sand in thanks to the pumice they use instead of sea salt. There is NO SEA SALT, unlike the original version that was gritty and smelled amazing. Very bummed about not getting what they advertised.</li>
            <li> Product is described as sea salt exfoliator.  While it smells nice and lathers really well, I can&#x27;t feel any &#x27;grit&#x27; in it as an exfoliant.  I use it in conjuction with a exfoliating towel.  While skin does feel smother, I can&#x27;t tell if that&#x27;s a function of the towel or the body wash.</li>
            <li> This body wash starts out as more of a scrub than a body wash. I use it with a loofah and scrub the spots that need exfoliation first before the salt dissolves. I don&#x27;t use shaving creme on my legs - I just use the body wash. So, make sure the salt has all dissolved before you start shaving or you will be in for a nasty surprise!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product has a good lather and a mild, clean scent that even my boyfriend loves (He took my second bottle!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of all, it&#x27;s hypoallergenic. I break out in hives in reaction to many perfumes, plus I am prone to eczema. I have no reaction to this product and while I use body lotion, this product isn&#x27;t too drying and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue.</li>
            <li> The smell of this is so lovely -- it reminds me of being at a lovely spa!  The exfoliating grains are also nice and small, you can really work it into your skin to buff it into softness.  It leaves your skin silky smooth and very soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now, but even after my first use, I noticed a difference on my chest area; the skin there (which is usually a bit coarser) was remarkably softer after just one use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also very gentle; I&#x27;ve been using it every day, and it doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin at all.  (Other skin-care products can cause me to break out in red marks/bumps or a rash, but this doesn&#x27;t do that.) It leaves your skin nicely hydrated, even in the dry winter weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a really nice wash, and the price on the two-pack is great.</li>
            <li> Love the scent of this body wash, I was using the coconut kind by St. Ives but it was not a scent that i cared for, plus this is an exfoliant which I love, leaves by skin silky and refreshed, I use this with my Beechwood dry brush in the shower, Try these together, you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Light scent, not too fine or course scrub, doesn&#x27;t take a lot, feel clean, doesn&#x27;t leave residue. I use every other shower/wash, the other time I use something very moisturizing, schedule seems to work for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually can count on St. Ives. I used to love one of their &amp;#34;pore&amp;#34; focused face washes and when they discontinued it I was so sad!</li>
            <li> This body wash makes your skin smoothly and soft, when it mix water and it become rich foam, it makes your skin clean and Fresh! In a word, I love it!</li>
            <li> This is a great exfoliating product.</li>
            <li> large container, good value.  just what I wanted.  I would recommend this to everyone who is looking for great exfoliation.</li>
            <li> Let me say, first off, that TWO bottles (containers?) arrived! I guess I should have read the entire description... oh well, I got a nice surprise! The product itself smells AMAZING! I love the smell, and it feels so good on my skin! It&#x27;s similar to a scrub, but the salts a smaller (if that makes sense). Overall, I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I love St. Ives body washes. They smells great, and this one has some sea salt in it for exfoliating. But it doesn&#x27;t hurt or anything. I usually hate &amp;#34;textured&amp;#34; body washes with the little &amp;#34;microbeads&amp;#34; in them, but this is not like that at all. It lathers up nicely and nothing is left behind. Will be buying again.</li>
            <li> One of our favorite shower gels. Love the bits of salt for extra skin exfoliation!</li>
            <li> Love this body wash - gentle and not drying but does the job - skin feels clean. Wish it was in a pump&lt;br /&gt;container though.</li>
            <li> What a value!  Smells great, feels good, lathers nicely, and a huge amount.</li>
            <li> I purchased this mainly because of the reviews I was reading on Amazon.  I&#x27;ve always had a problem with body acne.  I would not say it&#x27;s severe, but moderate.  I was looking for a body wash that would exfoliate and hopefully aid in clearing up my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it did not clear up my skin as much as I had hoped.  I realize of course that it is not a product targeted for acne-prone skin specifically.  With that said, it is a good exfoliating body wash.  The texture of my skin did improve and my acne has not worsened with use of this product.  It does leave your skin feeling soft and I like the fact that it uses natural ingredients.  The smell isn&#x27;t bad (definitely not as bad as a lot of the other body washes on the market today with that awful medicinal smell), but it also isn&#x27;t great. So if you&#x27;re just looking to exfoliate a couple times a week this isn&#x27;t a bad buy, BUT I can&#x27;t recommend it for clarifying the skin or for daily use regarding the smell.  Hope this was helpful!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the product and it arrived in the specified time, so I recommend it to anyone who knows what they are buying.&lt;br /&gt;thanks God bless</li>
            <li> I love this body wash. I have been using it along time. I just received a new order today March 11th 2013. The body was now says \\&quot;NEW! Natural Exfoliant\\&quot; I didn&#x27;t know the exfoliants weren&#x27;t natural before? The original bottle says natural exfoliants so I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s going on.  Also the label now says \\&quot;Purifying Sea Salt\\&quot; not \\&quot;Purify Exfoliating\\&quot; as it did before and as it is currently listed here and on St Ives website. Also the body wash has less exfoliants than before and looks like ranch dressing. It smells fine but I don&#x27;t like the change. Please change it back so I can order this again....</li>
