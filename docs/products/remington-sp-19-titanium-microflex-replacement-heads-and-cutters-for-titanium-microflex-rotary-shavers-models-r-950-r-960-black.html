            <li>So I assume every thing is working ok</li>

            <li>The Remington heads and cutters came in great shape and the service was fast.</li>
            <li>These helped my razor start giving me a much better shave.  </li>

            <li>This has been the best shaver I&#x27;ve owned, shaves very close, easy to clean, love it.</li>
            <li>perfect fit for my old R 860</li>
            <li>the Remington R-835 and it&#x27;s been one of the most reliable and best money saving purchases i&#x27;ve made in the last 15 years!</li>
            <li>much better shave .Well</li>

            <li>Works fine, nice clean cut.  </li>
            <li>Shipment and arrival was right on time, good product for replacement of original blades that lasted for years ,.</li>
            <li>Glad they where available for replacement..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad the blades are still available.</li>
            <li>I feel the quality of the way this is made is strong but the design did not take to much consideration into the process and requirements of a good shaving head</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re still sharp and work great!</li>
            <li>The SP 19 replacement heads and cutters were easy to put into my razor.  </li>
            <li>Easy transaction and saved about 15%.</li>
            <li>Easy to replace on razor.</li>
            <li>Easy..  </li>
            <li>Price ok but does not cut cleanly - lots of pulling</li>
            <li>I strongly suggest not to buy from the seller.</li>
            <li>and the damn thing was still going strong.</li>
            <li>Product comes as shown, easy to install, and assuming its the same quality as the original ones that came with the shaver, very good durability.</li>
            <li>Because it is from original manufacturer I&#x27;m sure it will fit and work correctly.</li>
            <li>These blades fit right into my Remington 850, providing a nice, smooth, and close shave.</li>
            <li>I got him the replacement cutters and it is as good as new.</li>
            <li>But for the first month I get a nice smooth shave.</li>
            <li>They were easy to change out on the shaver and give a smooth close shave every time.  </li>
            <li>The Remington SP 19 Titanium MicroFlex Replacement Heads work fine for my shaver.  </li>
            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>but they work just fine.</li>
            <li>A little pricey but easy drop in fits perfectly extends my cordless shaver life for another 2 yrs!</li>
            <li>This replacement head fit and works just fine.</li>
            <li>This purchase represented a good value, the parts were new, in their original packaging and have worked just fine.  </li>
            <li>Ordered this, supposed to fit my Remington R-450.  </li>
            <li>These heads work great, after my Dad passed last year</li>
            <li>The description was accurate and it fit my razor without issue.</li>
            <li>so I went online and ordered him up the set that fit his unit</li>
            <li>This one fit with my price preference and fit the razor as designed.</li>
            <li>This razor replacement fit my Remington R842, even though that model was not listed in the description.  </li>
            <li>I bought these because they were supposed to fit my remington r950 shaver.</li>
            <li>Fit perfectly into my old Remington which was so old</li>
            <li>So far, it is doing a good job.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t this any where else near this good of a price.  </li>
            <li>I got them replaced this week and am very satisfied with the new blades.  </li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t sure that it would be the right one.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what was advertised!!</li>
            <li>Probably would fit, except that the original had a plastic screw or stud that retained the cutters, and this turned out to be non removable.  </li>
            <li>Sure, a new shaver would work better</li>
            <li>Also, the replacement blades do not even compare to the sharpness of the original blades they replaced.</li>
            <li>Even after 4 years, the original out-cuts this design.</li>
            <li>Bought as replacement for an original.  </li>
            <li>It works but not as well as the original.</li>
            <li>made my SP 19 shaver work like new - maybe new blades after 6 years really was a good idea !?!?!?</li>
            <li>Clean shave no nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li>The shave is close and clean again.</li>
            <li>But the screw-in head doesn&#x27;t fully engage and the cutters drop out when you clean the head.</li>
            <li>I love the Remington razor it cuts twice as fast as my Norelco.</li>
            <li>It used the SP16 and the SP19 fit right in.  </li>
            <li>These heads were easy to install and were an exact match.</li>
            <li>worked great, but my electric razor are not working good, apparently it worn out, ,, giving up the old electric razor, and got new one thanks any way!</li>
            <li>Got a very reasonable price,  and the blades are working just fine.</li>
            <li>I keep this purchase saved, as it always ships quickly and without a problem.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly and arrived on time.</li>
            <li>The replacement heads and cutters arrived quickly in the factory sealed packaging.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li>it gives a great shave,not hard to put together, easy to clean .</li>
            <li>Exact fit to R-950 shaver.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and is exactly what I ordered!</li>
            <li>The SP19 installed perfectly on my old razor and shaves a smoothly and comfortably as the original.</li>
            <li>it helped my hubby get a better shave and not have to buy a new shaver or try to search for them in stores</li>
            <li>Give it a try before you spring for a new razor at more than twice the price.</li>
            <li>glad i was able to find it since i have had the shaver for a long time.</li>
            <li>Fit my older shaver like the original.</li>
            <li>It came in an original Remington package and was first rate quality.  </li>
            <li>Makes old razor work almost as good as new.</li>
            <li>Fit right the first time and rejuvenated my razor.  </li>
            <li>I really like the quick and comfortable shaves</li>
            <li>I like the ability to run it under hot water to clean it.</li>
            <li>A little tricky to install but once on worked great.</li>
            <li>Sharp, no fuss replacement, good price, quick shipping.</li>
            <li>Super sharp which make for a good close shave, I would get this again if I ever needed one.</li>
            <li>Great cuts in a few minutes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They could have smooth everything out and this would  be a 5 star review for the replacement items are all made very well</li>
            <li>My old set lasted many years.</li>
            <li>Worth the cost.</li>
            <li>worth the price.</li>
            <li>The replacement parts fit just right and were easy to install but don&#x27;t seem to have the sharp, smooth results of the original shaver.</li>
            <li>Actually works better and is quieter than the original.</li>
            <li>The replacement blades make my shaver run much slower than the original blades.  </li>
            <li>I found the shave much rougher than the original</li>
            <li>Went to Walmart, brought what I thought was the right one home</li>
            <li>The price was right</li>
            <li>This Remington replacement electric shave heads were brand new, as we wanted, and have been going strong since we got them.  </li>
            <li>They fit snugly and provide a decent shave.  </li>
            <li>The razor is fine, but you have to decide if you should purchase a new and compare the cost.</li>
            <li>Bought as a replacement for my R-835.  Fits easily and works like a charm, its like having a new razor but much cheaper!</li>
            <li>I received quickly and was able to change out the old heads for the new ones.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>This heads work fine on my 20 year old shaver.</li>
            <li>Have had that problem with irritation since it was new, was hoping the new heads would be better.</li>
            <li>Overall I am glad I made this purchase.</li>
            <li>This replacement was exactly what we needed for my husbands razer.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what i was looking for.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t but - buy another brand of shaver first.</li>
            <li>Replacement blades works, only wish I would have been able to receive the shaver head for the Remington R-875 razor.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>Exact replacement.  </li>
            <li>I went back to my old blades and it was much more comfortable than these.</li>
            <li>Also, I am glad I bought the same style razor.</li>
            <li>It now works as well as it did the day I used it for the first time and leaves me with a close shave.</li>
            <li>I have had this razor for many years and the blades finally wore out.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is an exact replacement for an item that had worn out</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>exactly what we needed and delivered on time</li>
            <li>These work just as good as the originals in my humble opinion.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are titanium-coated, unlike the older SP-16 heads.&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the R-950, R-960, and R-970, this will fit the older R-830, R835, R842, R843,</li>
            <li>I was happier with the original shaving heads that came with my 3 year old shaver.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for a ~4 year old Remington R-950 originally equipped with rotating knife-edged cutters.</li>
            <li>Best deal especially because it is hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li>Mine actually came with the SP 16 blades, I was a little skeptic at first before ordering the SP-19 replacement model, just because the original ones were so good, but at this price I had to give it a try.</li>
            <li>They work fine and the old razor is like new.</li>
            <li>While it shaved my stubbled facial hair with ease and fairly quickly, it also made my face look as if I&#x27;d run it through a wood chipper!</li>
            <li>Now my older Remington850 electric shaver performs like it did when I first purchased it 11 years ago.</li>
            <li>Arrived in a timely manner and is working very well in my husbands shaver.    </li>
            <li>The price was reasonable.  </li>
            <li>Arrived in a very timely fashion and was well packaged.</li>
            <li>Thanks to amazon</li>
            <li>These cutting heads are perfect.  </li>
            <li>So much easier to buy from home and know they</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who wants to save some money.</li>
            <li>I mention fit, because there is a multitude of different heads for rotary shavers and they all look alike.</li>
            <li>Replacing the whole shaver is $130.00</li>
            <li>The replacement head arrived fast.  </li>
            <li>I was about ready to throw this razor in the trash.  </li>
            <li>Fast Delivery</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Really fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li>I went a whole lot longer before I replaced them than Remington recommends.  </li>
            <li>I thought the price was reasonable.  </li>
            <li>my Mom gave me his razor rather than toss it out love using it keeps him alive even if only in my mind</li>
            <li>I thought my husband needed a new electric razor, but decided to try this first.  </li>
            <li>I could tell the difference right away after I replaced my old, worn out shaving head.  </li>
            <li>This replacement head is equal to the original head.</li>
            <li>remington means verygood quality product, I am very satisfyed and highly recommend</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s like new and really improves the shave.</li>
            <li>Total junk - with a 2 day old growth, shaving is as comfortable as pulling each whisker with a tweezers.</li>
            <li>It was for an older electric shaver</li>
            <li>They are high quality and are like the&lt;br /&gt;orginal heads.  </li>
            <li>It seems the stores are always out, or priced too high.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Remington SP 19.</li>
            <li>The blade is sharp, accurate and does not make too much noise.</li>
            <li>The standard replacement heads get dull pretty quick, these are much better.</li>
            <li>Titanium replacement is rough on skin, compared to stainless steel original.</li>
            <li>Saved me over $100 on buying a new one, because now it&#x27;s just like it IS a new one!</li>
            <li>Overly surprised how fast it was delivered, too.</li>
            <li>Renew your shaver because these last very long and go through many replacement cutters.</li>
            <li>Finally got the right size for my husbands shaver.  </li>
            <li>My husband loves the new blades I purchased through Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>new unit worked well.  </li>
            <li>I purchased new blades at Amazon.com and this razor is like new again.</li>
            <li>I now have  a Brand New razor again.  </li>
            <li>my shaver is like new again...</li>
            <li>Ordered the new heads and got</li>
            <li>I would recommend this instead of buying a new shaver</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t make your electric brand new</li>
            <li>Works like new.</li>
            <li>With the new blades, I am getting a quicker and closer shave.</li>
            <li>Like having a new shaver.</li>
            <li>I now have a new shaver with this replacement head.</li>
            <li>Shaver works like new.</li>
            <li>These made my 2+ year old razor work like new!</li>
            <li>Wow, what a difference a new set of blades can do!</li>
            <li>I spent about a hour online searching and reading reviews before finding the right one thanks to someone&#x27;s comments that steered me to the one I needed.</li>
            <li>I have the yellow razor and it isn&#x27;t quite the same as the original.</li>
            <li>blades were sharp and it shaves clean.</li>
            <li>Made my old shaver just like new.</li>
            <li>The razor is quite old, so finding new blades was an issue.  </li>
            <li>Bought this for my husbands electric razor, the blades don&#x27;t last as long as the ones that originally came with the razor, but they work.</li>
            <li>Just takes a little longer to get the smooth shave.</li>
            <li>I have used these blades for the last few months and am still getting a very close shave, almost as good as conventional razor!  </li>
            <li>The old blades lasted 5 years.</li>
            <li>Complete package.</li>
            <li>I ordered this item as the shaving heads for my old electric razor were worn out.</li>
            <li>The old heads just didn&#x27;t &amp;</li>
            <li>They replaced the old heads on my ancient Remi shaver.</li>
            <li>I bought this for an old corded razor I&#x27;ve had for quite a while.  </li>
            <li>These are just what I needed to spruce up the old razor.</li>
            <li>I had to use needle nose pliers to get the old housing out.  </li>
            <li>, I get the closer shave and gets the job done in 3-5 minutes, no cuts no mess.</li>
            <li>Much more economical than replacing the entire shaver due to dull blades.</li>
            <li>It takes me twice as long to shave because the replacement blades make my razor run much slower.  </li>
            <li>This new set of blades brought my razor back to life.</li>
            <li>No regrets.</li>
            <li>This is a first class replacement for my Remington shaver and cuts shaving time in half with cleaner shaves.</li>
            <li>but I had red streaks, razor burn, and general itchiness.</li>
            <li>The old ones was taking too long to take off the whiskers.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been searching for replacement blades for my old razor for a long time.  </li>
            <li>When the cutters got dull we tried numerous other razors but none satisfied.</li>
            <li>I realized how dull my old blades were after the first shave ...</li>

            <li> Shipment and arrival was right on time, good product for replacement of original blades that lasted for years ,.</li>
            <li> Glad they where available for replacement..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad the blades are still available.</li>
            <li> I feel the quality of the way this is made is strong but the design did not take to much consideration into the process and requirements of a good shaving head</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re still sharp and work great!</li>
            <li> The SP 19 replacement heads and cutters were easy to put into my razor.  </li>
            <li> Easy transaction and saved about 15%.</li>
            <li> Easy to replace on razor.</li>
            <li> Easy..  </li>
            <li> Price ok but does not cut cleanly - lots of pulling</li>
            <li> I strongly suggest not to buy from the seller.</li>
            <li> and the damn thing was still going strong.</li>
            <li> Product comes as shown, easy to install, and assuming its the same quality as the original ones that came with the shaver, very good durability.</li>
            <li> Because it is from original manufacturer I&#x27;m sure it will fit and work correctly.</li>
            <li> These blades fit right into my Remington 850, providing a nice, smooth, and close shave.</li>
            <li> I got him the replacement cutters and it is as good as new.</li>
            <li> But for the first month I get a nice smooth shave.</li>
            <li> They were easy to change out on the shaver and give a smooth close shave every time.  </li>
            <li> The Remington SP 19 Titanium MicroFlex Replacement Heads work fine for my shaver.  </li>
            <li> Works fine.</li>
            <li> but they work just fine.</li>
            <li> A little pricey but easy drop in fits perfectly extends my cordless shaver life for another 2 yrs!</li>
            <li> This replacement head fit and works just fine.</li>
            <li> This purchase represented a good value, the parts were new, in their original packaging and have worked just fine.  </li>
            <li> Ordered this, supposed to fit my Remington R-450.  </li>
            <li> These heads work great, after my Dad passed last year</li>
            <li> The description was accurate and it fit my razor without issue.</li>
            <li> so I went online and ordered him up the set that fit his unit</li>
            <li> This one fit with my price preference and fit the razor as designed.</li>
            <li> This razor replacement fit my Remington R842, even though that model was not listed in the description.  </li>
            <li> I bought these because they were supposed to fit my remington r950 shaver.</li>
            <li> Fit perfectly into my old Remington which was so old</li>
            <li> So far, it is doing a good job.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t this any where else near this good of a price.  </li>
            <li> I got them replaced this week and am very satisfied with the new blades.  </li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t sure that it would be the right one.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what was advertised!!</li>
            <li> Probably would fit, except that the original had a plastic screw or stud that retained the cutters, and this turned out to be non removable.  </li>
            <li> Sure, a new shaver would work better</li>
            <li> Also, the replacement blades do not even compare to the sharpness of the original blades they replaced.</li>
            <li> Even after 4 years, the original out-cuts this design.</li>
            <li> Bought as replacement for an original.  </li>
            <li> It works but not as well as the original.</li>
            <li> made my SP 19 shaver work like new - maybe new blades after 6 years really was a good idea !?!?!?</li>
            <li> Clean shave no nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li> The shave is close and clean again.</li>
            <li> But the screw-in head doesn&#x27;t fully engage and the cutters drop out when you clean the head.</li>
            <li> I love the Remington razor it cuts twice as fast as my Norelco.</li>
            <li> It used the SP16 and the SP19 fit right in.  </li>
            <li> These heads were easy to install and were an exact match.</li>
            <li> worked great, but my electric razor are not working good, apparently it worn out, ,, giving up the old electric razor, and got new one thanks any way!</li>
            <li> Got a very reasonable price,  and the blades are working just fine.</li>
            <li> I keep this purchase saved, as it always ships quickly and without a problem.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads and cutters arrived quickly in the factory sealed packaging.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li> it gives a great shave,not hard to put together, easy to clean .</li>
            <li> Exact fit to R-950 shaver.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and is exactly what I ordered!</li>
            <li> The SP19 installed perfectly on my old razor and shaves a smoothly and comfortably as the original.</li>
            <li> it helped my hubby get a better shave and not have to buy a new shaver or try to search for them in stores</li>
            <li> Give it a try before you spring for a new razor at more than twice the price.</li>
            <li> glad i was able to find it since i have had the shaver for a long time.</li>
            <li> Fit my older shaver like the original.</li>
            <li> It came in an original Remington package and was first rate quality.  </li>
            <li> Makes old razor work almost as good as new.</li>
            <li> Fit right the first time and rejuvenated my razor.  </li>
            <li> I really like the quick and comfortable shaves</li>
            <li> I like the ability to run it under hot water to clean it.</li>
            <li> A little tricky to install but once on worked great.</li>
            <li> Sharp, no fuss replacement, good price, quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Super sharp which make for a good close shave, I would get this again if I ever needed one.</li>
            <li> Great cuts in a few minutes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They could have smooth everything out and this would  be a 5 star review for the replacement items are all made very well</li>
            <li> My old set lasted many years.</li>
            <li> Worth the cost.</li>
            <li> worth the price.</li>
            <li> The replacement parts fit just right and were easy to install but don&#x27;t seem to have the sharp, smooth results of the original shaver.</li>
            <li> Actually works better and is quieter than the original.</li>
            <li> The replacement blades make my shaver run much slower than the original blades.  </li>
            <li> I found the shave much rougher than the original</li>
            <li> Went to Walmart, brought what I thought was the right one home</li>
            <li> The price was right</li>
            <li> This Remington replacement electric shave heads were brand new, as we wanted, and have been going strong since we got them.  </li>
            <li> They fit snugly and provide a decent shave.  </li>
            <li> The razor is fine, but you have to decide if you should purchase a new and compare the cost.</li>
            <li> Bought as a replacement for my R-835.  Fits easily and works like a charm, its like having a new razor but much cheaper!</li>
            <li> I received quickly and was able to change out the old heads for the new ones.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This heads work fine on my 20 year old shaver.</li>
            <li> Have had that problem with irritation since it was new, was hoping the new heads would be better.</li>
            <li> Overall I am glad I made this purchase.</li>
            <li> This replacement was exactly what we needed for my husbands razer.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what i was looking for.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t but - buy another brand of shaver first.</li>
            <li> Replacement blades works, only wish I would have been able to receive the shaver head for the Remington R-875 razor.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> Exact replacement.  </li>
            <li> I went back to my old blades and it was much more comfortable than these.</li>
            <li> Also, I am glad I bought the same style razor.</li>
            <li> It now works as well as it did the day I used it for the first time and leaves me with a close shave.</li>
            <li> I have had this razor for many years and the blades finally wore out.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is an exact replacement for an item that had worn out</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> exactly what we needed and delivered on time</li>
            <li> These work just as good as the originals in my humble opinion.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are titanium-coated, unlike the older SP-16 heads.&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the R-950, R-960, and R-970, this will fit the older R-830, R835, R842, R843,</li>
            <li> I was happier with the original shaving heads that came with my 3 year old shaver.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a ~4 year old Remington R-950 originally equipped with rotating knife-edged cutters.</li>
            <li> Best deal especially because it is hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Mine actually came with the SP 16 blades, I was a little skeptic at first before ordering the SP-19 replacement model, just because the original ones were so good, but at this price I had to give it a try.</li>
            <li> They work fine and the old razor is like new.</li>
            <li> While it shaved my stubbled facial hair with ease and fairly quickly, it also made my face look as if I&#x27;d run it through a wood chipper!</li>
            <li> Now my older Remington850 electric shaver performs like it did when I first purchased it 11 years ago.</li>
            <li> Arrived in a timely manner and is working very well in my husbands shaver.    </li>
            <li> The price was reasonable.  </li>
            <li> Arrived in a very timely fashion and was well packaged.</li>
            <li> Thanks to amazon</li>
            <li> These cutting heads are perfect.  </li>
            <li> So much easier to buy from home and know they</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who wants to save some money.</li>
            <li> I mention fit, because there is a multitude of different heads for rotary shavers and they all look alike.</li>
            <li> Replacing the whole shaver is $130.00</li>
            <li> The replacement head arrived fast.  </li>
            <li> I was about ready to throw this razor in the trash.  </li>
            <li> Fast Delivery</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> Really fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> I went a whole lot longer before I replaced them than Remington recommends.  </li>
            <li> I thought the price was reasonable.  </li>
            <li> my Mom gave me his razor rather than toss it out love using it keeps him alive even if only in my mind</li>
            <li> I thought my husband needed a new electric razor, but decided to try this first.  </li>
            <li> I could tell the difference right away after I replaced my old, worn out shaving head.  </li>
            <li> This replacement head is equal to the original head.</li>
            <li> remington means verygood quality product, I am very satisfyed and highly recommend</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s like new and really improves the shave.</li>
            <li> Total junk - with a 2 day old growth, shaving is as comfortable as pulling each whisker with a tweezers.</li>
            <li> It was for an older electric shaver</li>
            <li> They are high quality and are like the&lt;br /&gt;orginal heads.  </li>
            <li> It seems the stores are always out, or priced too high.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Remington SP 19.</li>
            <li> The blade is sharp, accurate and does not make too much noise.</li>
            <li> The standard replacement heads get dull pretty quick, these are much better.</li>
            <li> Titanium replacement is rough on skin, compared to stainless steel original.</li>
            <li> Saved me over $100 on buying a new one, because now it&#x27;s just like it IS a new one!</li>
            <li> Overly surprised how fast it was delivered, too.</li>
            <li> Renew your shaver because these last very long and go through many replacement cutters.</li>
            <li> Finally got the right size for my husbands shaver.  </li>
            <li> My husband loves the new blades I purchased through Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> new unit worked well.  </li>
            <li> I purchased new blades at Amazon.com and this razor is like new again.</li>
            <li> I now have  a Brand New razor again.  </li>
            <li> my shaver is like new again...</li>
            <li> Ordered the new heads and got</li>
            <li> I would recommend this instead of buying a new shaver</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t make your electric brand new</li>
            <li> Works like new.</li>
            <li> With the new blades, I am getting a quicker and closer shave.</li>
            <li> Like having a new shaver.</li>
            <li> I now have a new shaver with this replacement head.</li>
            <li> Shaver works like new.</li>
            <li> These made my 2+ year old razor work like new!</li>
            <li> Wow, what a difference a new set of blades can do!</li>
            <li> I spent about a hour online searching and reading reviews before finding the right one thanks to someone&#x27;s comments that steered me to the one I needed.</li>
            <li> I have the yellow razor and it isn&#x27;t quite the same as the original.</li>
            <li> blades were sharp and it shaves clean.</li>
            <li> Made my old shaver just like new.</li>
            <li> The razor is quite old, so finding new blades was an issue.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for my husbands electric razor, the blades don&#x27;t last as long as the ones that originally came with the razor, but they work.</li>
            <li> Just takes a little longer to get the smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I have used these blades for the last few months and am still getting a very close shave, almost as good as conventional razor!  </li>
            <li> The old blades lasted 5 years.</li>
            <li> Complete package.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item as the shaving heads for my old electric razor were worn out.</li>
            <li> The old heads just didn&#x27;t &amp;</li>
            <li> They replaced the old heads on my ancient Remi shaver.</li>
            <li> I bought this for an old corded razor I&#x27;ve had for quite a while.  </li>
            <li> These are just what I needed to spruce up the old razor.</li>
            <li> I had to use needle nose pliers to get the old housing out.  </li>
            <li> , I get the closer shave and gets the job done in 3-5 minutes, no cuts no mess.</li>
            <li> Much more economical than replacing the entire shaver due to dull blades.</li>
            <li> It takes me twice as long to shave because the replacement blades make my razor run much slower.  </li>
            <li> This new set of blades brought my razor back to life.</li>
            <li> No regrets.</li>
            <li> This is a first class replacement for my Remington shaver and cuts shaving time in half with cleaner shaves.</li>
            <li> but I had red streaks, razor burn, and general itchiness.</li>
            <li> The old ones was taking too long to take off the whiskers.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been searching for replacement blades for my old razor for a long time.  </li>
            <li> When the cutters got dull we tried numerous other razors but none satisfied.</li>
            <li> I realized how dull my old blades were after the first shave ...</li>
            <li> There it was, got it in a few days and works like a new shaver!  </li>
            <li> So far, he has been using it for at least a year, he has not complained.</li>
            <li> PS: the old blades never did get even slightly dull, just replaced them when I had to get new head holder.</li>
            <li> these suckers make my old Remington work like new</li>
            <li> Shipping was a little slow, but it was FREE.</li>
            <li> IMHO,these replacement blades won&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> If you have a hard time finding these locally like me I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I was wary because the model number of my heads and cutters for my R845 were no longer available.  </li>
            <li> It was difficult to tell from the photos how it fit to the shaver.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hence, it takes me twice as long to shave.</li>
            <li> Taking a long time to settle in.</li>
            <li> As most things, it could be less expensive, but.....</li>
            <li> Its hard to find older shaver heads.</li>
            <li> Obviously very well made, and titanium makes old blade materials useless in comparison.  </li>
            <li> Furthermore, I never knew how dull my old blades were until I got this set!!</li>
            <li> Long lasting and sharp!  </li>
            <li> After i recieved it and find out it is to small for my razor, there is a phone number in the back, i can call, next time I feel you need mark the models of the razor</li>
            <li> Just wish it would last a little longer.  </li>
            <li> Okay, maybe not THAT bad,</li>
            <li> They have been in use for a while now and are performing as expected.</li>
            <li> My son has trouble with snagging on the neck if he doesn&#x27;t shave daily with this.</li>
            <li> product is what I expected.</li>
            <li> Delivered when expected,  meets my expectations</li>
            <li> I would use this replacement shaving head again as long as it doesn&#x27;t break down prematurely.</li>
            <li> and now I don&#x27;t have to worry about getting redness due to a ruff shave from the old dull blades.</li>
            <li> The heads are so expensive I could have bought a new shaver for the same price.</li>
            <li> Lot cheeper than the store, and the blades are sharp.</li>
            <li> used these for another six months, then my razor died however they remained sharp with no problems.</li>
            <li> The blades on my shaver needed to be changed due to a lot of use.  </li>
            <li> Replacement was in a tight package I had to destroy to open.</li>
            <li> Less expensive than a new shaver with the same results -</li>
            <li> , these are the least expensive replacement blades after searching around and comparing prices over the exact same product.</li>
            <li> He did not want another one, but the cutters had gotten dull (he&#x27;s been using the same one for 4 years).</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve had a few, I&#x27;ve been using it for 7 years, it&#x27;s the one I stick with,  why else would I replace the broken parts &amp; get new blades?</li>
            <li> The problem with it was the heads were too tight in their sockets to travel up and down.  </li>
            <li> shaver you are missing something.</li>
            <li> My shaver is getting a few years on it</li>
            <li> this item was  ordered wrong since i had never done this before and got mixed up on the one i needed.</li>
            <li> No more pulling hairs.</li>
            <li> usually rake my face with a Mach 3 and some lye soap...</li>
            <li> No more pulls when I shave.</li>
            <li> popped this bad boy in and it felt like new.</li>
            <li> This was a hard spare part to find.  </li>
            <li> My grandfather was complaining about how dull his shaver was</li>
            <li> Replacement heads are sometimes hard to find.  </li>
            <li> my blades had little bits that had broken off and were nicking me when i shaved.</li>
            <li> Less expensive, too.</li>
            <li> You cannot find replacement heads hardly anywhere and the price cannot be beat!  </li>
            <li> The replacement head pulls the hairs without cutting them causing excruciating pain in areas that were missed on previous day&#x27;s shave.</li>
            <li> One thing that is not great about these is that they don&#x27;t seem to cut well if the beard has a 2 day growth.  </li>
            <li> Close shave, but irritating to the skin.</li>
            <li> but alas.....</li>
            <li> Was tired of the nicks from my razor.</li>
            <li> worst than my old one</li>
            <li> The cutters do work, it&#x27;s just unfortunate</li>
            <li> I and very disappointed with their performance.  </li>
            <li> This is a terrible product.</li>
            <li> These pulled on my neck beard HORRIBLY.  </li>
            <li> These are terrible.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Works great! Best blades I&#x27;ve found in years.</li>
            <li> Ordered this, supposed to fit my Remington R-450.  Probably would fit, except that the original had a plastic screw or stud that retained the cutters, and this turned out to be non removable.  Replacement was in a tight package I had to destroy to open.</li>
            <li> this was a perfect fit for my older razor. blades were sharp and it shaves clean. when you need replacements just check teh site to get teh corrrect ones. this worked well, recommended.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the OEM product, but does work. Just takes a little longer to get the smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Gives me a nice and smooth shave.  Just wish it would last a little longer.  But for the first month I get a nice smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I keep this purchase saved, as it always ships quickly and without a problem. It fits perfectly as a replacement and is cheaper than in the store.</li>
            <li> Arrived in a timely manner and is working very well in my husbands shaver.    Thank you and would buy again from them.</li>
            <li> These heads work great, after my Dad passed last year my Mom gave me his razor rather than toss it out love using it keeps him alive even if only in my mind</li>
            <li> The seller stated that he shipped it to me on June 15. It never arrived. Seller insinuated several times that I had recieved it which was not the case. On July 7 he suggested sending me the product, presumably to maintain his sales record. I agreed but on the next day Amazon returned my payment and  that was the last I from the seller.</li>
            <li> bought three at once. Got a great deal and free shipping</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think quality is there anymore...worst than my old one</li>
            <li> The SP 19 replacement heads and cutters were easy to put into my razor.  They fit snugly and provide a decent shave.  They do not provide as good a shave as the original set that came with the razor.  The price was reasonable.  Overall I am glad I made this purchase.</li>
            <li> My husband loves the new blades I purchased through Amazon.com. It was easy to exchange &amp; he&#x27;s very happy about the close shave it gives him. He&#x27;s happy so I&#x27;m happy!</li>
            <li> This is a terrible product. I was happier with the original shaving heads that came with my 3 year old shaver. The replacement head pulls the hairs without cutting them causing excruciating pain in areas that were missed on previous day&#x27;s shave. You cannot hope to use the shaver unless shaving is done daily.</li>
            <li> This replacement was exactly what we needed for my husbands razer.  The old blades lasted 5 years.</li>
            <li> I felt it was time to change blades.  The old ones was taking too long to take off the whiskers.  So far, it is doing a good job.  The razor is fine, but you have to decide if you should purchase a new and compare the cost.</li>
            <li> Delivered as promised.  The heads are so expensive I could have bought a new shaver for the same price.</li>
            <li> Made my old shaver just like new. Clean shave no nicks or cuts. Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> My husband will only use these blades.I am so glad that I can order them on line.</li>
            <li> I purchased these on Amazon and have been using them for about two weeks.  I and very disappointed with their performance.  The replacement blades make my shaver run much slower than the original blades.  It takes me twice as long to shave because the replacement blades make my razor run much slower.  Also, the replacement blades do not even compare to the sharpness of the original blades they replaced. Hence, it takes me twice as long to shave. I strongly suggest not to buy from the seller.</li>
            <li> My husband loves his Remington shaver. He did not want another one, but the cutters had gotten dull (he&#x27;s been using the same one for 4 years). I got him the replacement cutters and it is as good as new.</li>
            <li> My husband was very pleased that he found these replacements, he is very happy with the product.  Arrived in a very timely fashion and was well packaged. Thank you for the great work.</li>
            <li> fits just like OEM and works great.</li>
            <li> These blades are a great replacement. If you have a hard time finding these locally like me I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Exactly what i was looking for. Its hard to find older shaver heads. My husband will not give this shaver up.</li>
            <li> A nice replacement, it works well. Overly surprised how fast it was delivered, too.</li>
            <li> The Remington blades are as advertised.  A very fine product.  Arrived timely.  As most things, it could be less expensive, but.....</li>
            <li> My elderly father has a Remington 842 electric razor which he loves. When the cutters got dull we tried numerous other razors but none satisfied. I ordrered these which replaced the SP 16 and made my father happy again. These were a perfect replacement and are the Titanium heads. Shipping was a little slow, but it was FREE.</li>
            <li> As advertized, as promised - and at a savings!  (Better pricing c/w - Walmart, Target and online.</li>
            <li> The razor is quite old, so finding new blades was an issue.  Thanks to amazon-no problemo.  They work fine and the old razor is like new.</li>
            <li> Great value!  The parts were just what I wanted and the price and service were great.  I would use this vendow again.  Amazon is great!</li>
            <li> I thought my husband needed a new electric razor, but decided to try this first.  Saved me over $100 on buying a new one, because now it&#x27;s just like it IS a new one! Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Good value for what you can buy these for in the store.  They have been in use for a while now and are performing as expected.</li>
            <li> These made my 2+ year old razor work like new! I couldn&#x27;t find them in the store. Oh well, I found them here! I recommend them!</li>
            <li> This was a hard spare part to find.  Went to Walmart, brought what I thought was the right one home and it didn&#x27;t work.  Thank heavens they took it back.  Went to Amazon and voila!  There it was, got it in a few days and works like a new shaver!  Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> exactly what I ordered &amp; at a good price.</li>
            <li> Shipment and arrival was right on time, good product for replacement of original blades that lasted for years ,. Glad they where available for replacement..</li>
            <li> These extend the life of my electric razor to which I have had for over twenty years.</li>
            <li> this item was  ordered wrong since i had never done this before and got mixed up on the one i needed. so could not use it</li>
            <li> These cutting heads are perfect.  So much easier to buy from home and know they I&#x27;ll work.  Less expensive, too.</li>
            <li> They fit correctly, cut nice and close. Less expensive than a new shaver with the same results - a close shave. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who wants to save some money.</li>
            <li> great product highly recomend it</li>
            <li> This part is very good and it was shipped promptly. I will recommend it to anybody with the same model or rasor.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> I get a much better shave</li>
            <li> This new set of blades brought my razor back to life. What a difference the blades made. No more pulling hairs.</li>
            <li> Total junk - with a 2 day old growth, shaving is as comfortable as pulling each whisker with a tweezers. I purchased this for a ~4 year old Remington R-950 originally equipped with rotating knife-edged cutters. Even after 4 years, the original out-cuts this design. Don&#x27;t but - buy another brand of shaver first.</li>
            <li> stores don&#x27;t seem to carry these anymore. price was in line with what they used to be. this was just easier than running around trying to find them.</li>
            <li> This replacement head is equal to the original head. No complaints.</li>
            <li> Product comes as shown, easy to install, and assuming its the same quality as the original ones that came with the shaver, very good durability.</li>
            <li> Replacement blades works, only wish I would have been able to receive the shaver head for the Remington R-875 razor.</li>
            <li> Great replacement heads for older model Remington electric razors. Sharp, no fuss replacement, good price, quick shipping. Be sure to check for the correct model.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> This Remington replacement electric shave heads were brand new, as we wanted, and have been going strong since we got them.  They were easy to change out on the shaver and give a smooth close shave every time.  Much more economical than replacing the entire shaver due to dull blades.</li>
            <li> Order was fulfilled and received as advertised.  Bought the replacement heads for a Remington R 835 cordless razor my hubby has had forever.  You cannot find replacement heads hardly anywhere and the price cannot be beat!  Razor works great now and hubby is happy!  I definitely recommend this seller and product.</li>
            <li> Long lasting and sharp!  Obviously very well made, and titanium makes old blade materials useless in comparison.  My old set lasted many years.</li>
            <li> Fit my razor perfectly.  Works fine, nice clean cut.  Exact replacement.  Shipped quickly and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think these are well made.  I bought them because my &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; O.E.M. blades seemed to pull on my beard a bit, especially around my neck.  These pulled on my neck beard HORRIBLY.  I went back to my old blades and it was much more comfortable than these.</li>
            <li> Wow, what a difference a new set of blades can do! The description was accurate and it fit my razor without issue. Furthermore, I never knew how dull my old blades were until I got this set!!</li>
            <li> These replacement heads are great.This is the second set of heads I&#x27;ve purchased for this razor.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend these to everyone looking to improve their electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Fit my razor perfectly.</li>
            <li> new unit worked well.  good fit.</li>
            <li> This replacement head fit and works just fine. I mention fit, because there is a multitude of different heads for rotary shavers and they all look alike. I spent about a hour online searching and reading reviews before finding the right one thanks to someone&#x27;s comments that steered me to the one I needed. Prices vary a lot too.</li>
            <li> my blades had little bits that had broken off and were nicking me when i shaved. popped this bad boy in and it felt like new.</li>
            <li> These are terrible. They do not even work. If had not thrown out the package I would have returned them.</li>
            <li> should make sharper and longer lasting...</li>
            <li> Exactly what was advertised!!</li>
            <li> I bought it this &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; style Remington triple head, non-floating razor to replace my one Remington of the same model. I read the review on the newer triple heads and decided to stick with the same razor - if I could find it. Amazon came through and the seller had it in stock. Also, I am glad I bought the same style razor. Great cuts in a few minutes. More than happy with it.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have titanium blades on your elect. shaver you are missing something. My shaver was always the titanium, it gives the best results I&#x27;ve had with elect., trust me i&#x27;ve had a few, I&#x27;ve been using it for 7 years, it&#x27;s the one I stick with,  why else would I replace the broken parts &amp; get new blades? Replacing the whole shaver is $130.00 that&#x27;s why...PS: the old blades never did get even slightly dull, just replaced them when I had to get new head holder.</li>
            <li> The Remington SP 19 Titanium MicroFlex Replacement Heads work fine for my shaver.  They are high quality and are like the&lt;br /&gt;orginal heads.  I have purchased these before, and really satisfied with these blades.</li>
            <li> The replacement head arrived fast.  It was for an older electric shaver so I wasn&#x27;t sure that it would be the right one.  My dad says it does a great job.</li>
            <li> I found the shave much rougher than the original and I have started to use a razor again for comfort reasons.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t this any where else near this good of a price.  It is just what I needed.</li>
            <li> Finally got the right size for my husbands shaver.  They are doing a good job.</li>
            <li> I was about ready to throw this razor in the trash.  It was noisy and wouldn&#x27;t cut at all.  I purchased new blades at Amazon.com and this razor is like new again. Easy transaction and saved about 15%. I bought the razor at Walmart, but they don&#x27;t carry the replacement blades.</li>
            <li> Brought it for my grandson, who wore out the originals. So far, he has been using it for at least a year, he has not complained. So I assume every thing is working ok</li>
            <li> Renew your shaver because these last very long and go through many replacement cutters. I am going to have to wait forever to try out their rechargeable foil shaver. :-) D</li>
            <li> Excellent purchase.  I now have  a Brand New razor again.  I&#x27;m really glad the blades are still available.</li>
            <li> just what i needed. glad i was able to find it since i have had the shaver for a long time.</li>
            <li> Excellent ...I realized how dull my old blades were after the first shave ...my shaver is like new again...Fast Delivery</li>
            <li> One thing that is not great about these is that they don&#x27;t seem to cut well if the beard has a 2 day growth.  My son has trouble with snagging on the neck if he doesn&#x27;t shave daily with this.</li>
            <li> The Remington heads and cutters came in great shape and the service was fast. I was also please with the price. Great company to do business with. I rate them a five star.</li>
            <li> I love the Remington razor it cuts twice as fast as my Norelco.</li>
            <li> Lot cheeper than the store, and the blades are sharp.</li>
            <li> Great product. Fits perfect and works well! Arrived quickly and is exactly what I ordered!</li>
            <li> The replacement parts fit just right and were easy to install but don&#x27;t seem to have the sharp, smooth results of the original shaver.</li>
            <li> good price and product was as advertised, shipped in a timely manner</li>
            <li> Took the pull out of shaving. Fit my older shaver like the original.</li>
            <li> Works fine. Complete package.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item as the shaving heads for my old electric razor were worn out. I received quickly and was able to change out the old heads for the new ones. It now works as well as it did the day I used it for the first time and leaves me with a close shave.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s so happy with his new blades. Keeps rubbing his face. I&#x27;m so happy with the autoship so I don&#x27;t have to keep remembering to order, finding it on the site, etc.</li>
            <li> These work just as good as the originals in my humble opinion. Sure, a new shaver would work better I am sure, however, saved some money and became a happy camper.</li>
            <li> Bought as replacement for an original.  Actually works better and is quieter than the original.</li>
            <li> Fit perfectly and works great!</li>
            <li> A great help on the model and made sure it worked and great communications thanks</li>
            <li> These helped my razor start giving me a much better shave.  The old heads just didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;cut it&amp;#34; any more.</li>
            <li> The replacement heads and cutters arrived quickly in the factory sealed packaging. Exact fit to R-950 shaver. The shave is close and clean again.</li>
            <li> Bought as a replacement for my R-835.  Fits easily and works like a charm, its like having a new razor but much cheaper!</li>
            <li> works great. Really fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Remington no longer makes the SP-16 heads, the SP-19 heads are the replacement.&lt;br /&gt;These are titanium-coated, unlike the older SP-16 heads.&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the R-950, R-960, and R-970, this will fit the older R-830, R835, R842, R843, R-845, R-850, R-860, R-870, R-872, R-875, R-890 &amp; R200s.&lt;br /&gt;The R-200 uses the SP-25 heads.</li>
            <li> Excellent fo change the olod heads of my remington R-845, now i can use for another year and that is great</li>
            <li> worked great very fast</li>
            <li> I was wary because the model number of my heads and cutters for my R845 were no longer available.  The SP19 installed perfectly on my old razor and shaves a smoothly and comfortably as the original.</li>
            <li> I have had this razor for many years and the blades finally wore out.  These heads were easy to install and were an exact match.</li>
            <li> They replaced the old heads on my ancient Remi shaver. Close shave, but irritating to the skin. Have had that problem with irritation since it was new, was hoping the new heads would be better.</li>
            <li> This heads work fine on my 20 year old shaver.</li>
            <li> Bought these to replace in my father&#x27;s electric shaver.  Worked great and he is still using it and loves it.  Worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I have used these blades for the last few months and am still getting a very close shave, almost as good as conventional razor!  The standard replacement heads get dull pretty quick, these are much better.</li>
            <li> made my SP 19 shaver work like new - maybe new blades after 6 years really was a good idea !?!?!?</li>
            <li> I have the yellow razor and it isn&#x27;t quite the same as the original. It works but not as well as the original.</li>
            <li> I use it to shave, what else would I use it for&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is an exact replacement for an item that had worn out</li>
            <li> This has been the best shaver I&#x27;ve owned, shaves very close, easy to clean, love it. Wish they made a razor like this but alas.....</li>
            <li> It was difficult to tell from the photos how it fit to the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;It was very easy to install.</li>
            <li> this is the best place to get these blades. It seems the stores are always out, or priced too high. great buy even with shipping.</li>
            <li> perfect fit for my old R 860</li>
            <li> Have been using it for about a month and it works well. I like the ability to run it under hot water to clean it.</li>
            <li> I love my razor, I own the Remington R-835 and it&#x27;s been one of the most reliable and best money saving purchases i&#x27;ve made in the last 15 years! Mine actually came with the SP 16 blades, I was a little skeptic at first before ordering the SP-19 replacement model, just because the original ones were so good, but at this price I had to give it a try. FYI, I shave my head and I use the Remington instead of regular disposable razor blades and it&#x27;s been a wonderful idea, have done it all this time now. I use a Norelco for my face because I like how the heads mold to the face lines, but my R-835 Remington worked best to shave my head, I get the closer shave and gets the job done in 3-5 minutes, no cuts no mess. I actually only replaced the heads/blades ONCE in 14 years! and the damn thing was still going strong. Only reason why I am buying blades now it&#x27;s because it finally chipped in one of the heads-blades.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these razor replacements for a couple of years now...and they&#x27;re still sharp and work great! I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> this was the cheapest source I could find for these replacement shaver cutter heads, which seem to be more generally expensive than justifiable based on their time on the market.  This purchase represented a good value, the parts were new, in their original packaging and have worked just fine.  No regrets.</li>
            <li> My grandfather was complaining about how dull his shaver was so I went online and ordered him up the set that fit his unit, these are the least expensive replacement blades after searching around and comparing prices over the exact same product.</li>
            <li> used these for another six months, then my razor died however they remained sharp with no problems. would buy again</li>
            <li> Was tired of the nicks from my razor. Ordered the new heads and got much better shave .Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Works OK but not the quality I was expecting. IMHO,these replacement blades won&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> I bought this replacement cutter for my Remington shaver. It met and exceeded my expectations. The blade is sharp, accurate and does not make too much noise. I highly recommend the Remington SP 19.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for replacement heads for my discontinued remington titanium R 950. I was happy to find OEM replacement heads for it here on Amazon. The price was right and now I don&#x27;t have to worry about getting redness due to a ruff shave from the old dull blades.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> This is a first class replacement for my Remington shaver and cuts shaving time in half with cleaner shaves. Shipping  was very fast and the cost the best available for this product!</li>
            <li> Replacement heads are sometimes hard to find.  This one fit with my price preference and fit the razor as designed.</li>
            <li> A little tricky to install but once on worked great.</li>
            <li> Easy to replace on razor. Works well.</li>
            <li> it helped my hubby get a better shave and not have to buy a new shaver or try to search for them in stores</li>
            <li> A little pricey but easy drop in fits perfectly extends my cordless shaver life for another 2 yrs! I would recommend this instead of buying a new shaver</li>
            <li> Replacement heads that work!  This is my second order.  Great product that works with my 2 Remington&#x27;s. I love subscribe and save!</li>
            <li> Best deal especially because it is hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Rather than throw an older electric razor out when the motor and mounts still work perfectly well I order these replacement blades and keep on truckin&#x27;.  It won&#x27;t make your electric brand new but it&#x27;s like new and really improves the shave. Give it a try before you spring for a new razor at more than twice the price.</li>
            <li> these suckers make my old Remington work like new</li>
            <li> as advertised works well</li>
            <li> This razor replacement fit my Remington R842, even though that model was not listed in the description.  It came in an original Remington package and was first rate quality.  I will purchase again because of the lower price for the same product elsewhere.</li>
            <li> maybe it&#x27;s just me...&lt;br /&gt;I usually rake my face with a Mach 3 and some lye soap... my doctor recommended I try going back to electric shaver, so I got these to replace the heads and blades that have been sitting for years. While it shaved my stubbled facial hair with ease and fairly quickly, it also made my face look as if I&#x27;d run it through a wood chipper! Okay, maybe not THAT bad, but I had red streaks, razor burn, and general itchiness. I cleaned the blades and heads, tried again... kept trying for about a week... it&#x27;s back in the back of the cabinet where it will likely stay forever.</li>
            <li> it gives a great shave,not hard to put together, easy to clean . I would recomend it to any person.</li>
            <li> Fit right the first time and rejuvenated my razor.  Make sure your razor is on the list that they work with and you are all set.</li>
            <li> I feel the quality of the way this is made is strong but the design did not take to much consideration into the process and requirements of a good shaving head cutters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cutter blades slotted covers that glide across your face, those three heads have a similar softness to low grit sandpaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They could have smooth everything out and this would  be a 5 star review for the replacement items are all made very well they just did not get the final polish that would have finished the product.</li>
            <li> Shaver keeps on working.. I have had to buy these maybe 4 things for the last 10 years... Easy..  Great product.. Keep them clean and they work great!</li>
            <li> I bought this for an old corded razor I&#x27;ve had for quite a while.  It used the SP16 and the SP19 fit right in.  Works like new.</li>
            <li> These blades fit right into my Remington 850, providing a nice, smooth, and close shave. Now my older Remington850 electric shaver performs like it did when I first purchased it 11 years ago.</li>
            <li> product is what I expected. Works great</li>
            <li> works good just what I ordered</li>
            <li> I needed to replace the blades on my Remington Titanium shaver.  I ordered these online.  I got them replaced this week and am very satisfied with the new blades.  They were very easy to replace.  I went a whole lot longer before I replaced them than Remington recommends.  I thought the price was reasonable.  My shaver is getting a few years on it and I&#x27;m thinking about ordering another set before they become unavailable.  If you need this replacement for your shaver I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to get this one</li>
            <li> worked great, but my electric razor are not working good, apparently it worn out, ,, giving up the old electric razor, and got new one thanks any way!</li>
            <li> I bought these because they were supposed to fit my remington r950 shaver. But the screw-in head doesn&#x27;t fully engage and the cutters drop out when you clean the head. They should be held in by the screw all the time. The cutters do work, it&#x27;s just unfortunate they don&#x27;t fully connect to the shaver head</li>
            <li> Fits perfectly, saved me from buying a new razor.  With the new blades, I am getting a quicker and closer shave.</li>
            <li> I found this product very useful and just what I wanted and just what I ordered, and in great time too.</li>
            <li> exactly what we needed and delivered on time</li>
            <li> No more pulls when I shave. Like having a new shaver. What else can I saw about a shaver part? (But now i have the required number of words)</li>
            <li> These are just what I needed to spruce up the old razor. I love my remington, and didn&#x27;t want to have to find another one. These are a perfect fit.</li>
            <li> A very good product. I purchase once annually for my husband (which is great as the blade lasts through that many shaves).</li>
            <li> The blades on my shaver needed to be changed due to a lot of use.  I now have a new shaver with this replacement head.</li>
            <li> I could tell the difference right away after I replaced my old, worn out shaving head.  I would use this replacement shaving head again as long as it doesn&#x27;t break down prematurely.</li>
            <li> Got a very reasonable price,  and the blades are working just fine. Not as close as a razor,  but they work just fine.</li>
            <li> Super sharp which make for a good close shave, I would get this again if I ever needed one.</li>
            <li> The price was good and the head and cutters perform to my expectations, the unit was very easy to replace</li>
            <li> After i recieved it and find out it is to small for my razor, there is a phone number in the back, i can call, next time I feel you need mark the models of the razor</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husbands electric razor, the blades don&#x27;t last as long as the ones that originally came with the razor, but they work.</li>
            <li> Delivered when expected,  meets my expectations</li>
            <li> Shaver works like new.</li>
            <li> Titanium replacement is rough on skin, compared to stainless steel original. 2 weeks use. Taking a long time to settle in.</li>
            <li> it fit perfectly, and was deliverd on time. remington means verygood quality product, I am very satisfyed and highly recommend</li>
            <li> it serves it purpose.</li>
            <li> Received just what we ordered.  Shipped quickly.  Because it is from original manufacturer I&#x27;m sure it will fit and work correctly.</li>
            <li> My husband needed to replace the head on his razor.  He loves his razor.</li>
            <li> Marginal quality control on the manufacture of this product.  I considered sending it back.  However, it worked well enough to get me by.  The problem with it was the heads were too tight in their sockets to travel up and down.  This did not effect the blades or combs.</li>
            <li> Good replacement.  Makes old razor work almost as good as new.</li>
            <li> Price ok but does not cut cleanly - lots of pulling</li>
            <li> Fit perfectly into my old Remington which was so old I had to use needle nose pliers to get the old housing out.  I really like the quick and comfortable shaves I am getting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been searching for replacement blades for my old razor for a long time.  These fit perfectly.  Very pleased with the product.</li>
