            <li>It had just the right amount of sparkle for a nice glow, and a great smell to it.</li>
            <li>Love this lotion smells amazing</li>
            <li>Even if I liked the way it was scented I still would not be able to wear it.</li>
            <li>Love this lotion, scent is nice, Snooki&#x27;s lotion has a better scent, but that is just my opinion.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff.</li>

            <li>and I love the shimmer.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>I love the scent and</li>
            <li>love her lotion.</li>
            <li>Perhaps if I did have a tan, it would look better.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and that it&#x27;s shimmery</li>
            <li>it could of used some more shimmer or glitter...</li>
            <li>Good glow not too much at all :)</li>
            <li>I love the smell of the lotion, but it wasn&#x27;t very shimmery at all, and that&#x27;s what I was mostly looking forward too, but it smells great and leaves your skin soft!</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite!</li>
            <li>But using a moisturizer or tan extender truly makes a huge difference in the life of your tan.</li>
            <li>and i hope you keep it cheap</li>
            <li>Smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li>It helped a lot with that and made my skin smooth and smelling awesome.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>On a good note it did leave my skin feeling soft and silky.</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite lotion.</li>
            <li>Besides, it&#x27;s soft and nice.</li>
            <li>I really loved the scent of this lotion just wished it was actually shimmery</li>
            <li>i will be ordering more soon thanks again</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li>Just a hint of the glitter glow, very pretty and classy :)</li>
            <li>Makes my skin smooth without needing a whole lot.</li>
            <li>Worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion, I&#x27;m a frequent tanner and spray tanner.</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing and the lotion adds a nice subtle glow.</li>
            <li>I use it right after tanning in the beds.  </li>
            <li>, the shimmer is just right</li>
            <li>only good thing was I got it a day early.</li>
            <li>Nice lotion, not much shimmer.</li>
            <li>but it is better to get it on Amazon than pay almost double at the salon.</li>
            <li>This is the second time I ordered this and will purchase more.</li>
            <li>This is actually my first Amazon review.</li>
            <li>it did make me pretty itchy.</li>
            <li>Have used everyday for over a year and still get comments on how good it smells all the time.</li>
            <li>I mean you wont find this cheaper ever lol.</li>
            <li>the bottle is pretty haha</li>
            <li>The lotion shimmers slightly, but the scent is really nice.</li>
            <li>Not enough shimmer comes off easy</li>
            <li>I really wanted to believe in your product.  </li>
            <li>and she really loves how it feels on her skin</li>
            <li>It really isn&#x27;t shimmering like I thought.</li>
            <li>It does not shimmer as much as I thought it would.</li>
            <li>thank you for having it at a reasonable price</li>
            <li>Not greasy and not too much sparkle ..</li>
            <li>I bought this at Suntan City on sale ($25, much cheaper on Amazon).</li>
            <li>which is very appealing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After reading the online reviews most had stated a slight shimmer is seen, but I see nothing.</li>
            <li>I love the smell - it&#x27;s the same scent as Wedding White.</li>
            <li>The lotion seems to provide a decent amount of moisturize but there is no shimmer whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>and I love to put it on before going out because it definitely gives my tan an extra boost and glow.</li>
            <li>one of the main reasons I bought it.</li>
            <li>I enjoy both and swap up every other time.</li>
            <li>And the shimmer that it leaves on my skin is subtle, but nice.</li>
            <li>I smelled just as nice as the other reviews had stated, it wasn&#x27;t sticky like some of the other lotions out there, BUT...</li>
            <li>I gave it to a friend who is not as scent sensitive and she loves it.</li>
            <li>However, it does leave my skin soft.</li>
            <li>So if your a tanner bed or spray, using an after tan moisturizer really makes a big difference.</li>
            <li>but omfg this smells like old ladies</li>
            <li>I tested it by putting a small amount on my arm and it was so strongly scented that it overpowered my perfume.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it does smell nice, but the reason I bought this was for the shimmer, so that&#x27;s why I am giving only 2 stars..</li>
            <li>Perfume is a little over powering at first.</li>
            <li>The scent is a little over whelming at first.</li>
            <li>This particular Shimmer lotion has a gentle smell (Not to Fu-Fu) and gives a subtle shimmer..</li>
            <li>This is super sparkly and nice but after applying it the perfumey fragrance made me feel a little sick.  </li>

            <li> This is super sparkly and nice but after applying it the perfumey fragrance made me feel a little sick.  </li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and only slight shimmer, not really noticeable at all.  </li>
            <li> The shimmer it gives you is subtle, which is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> , there is a tiny shimmer to it, but not really noticeable when you rub it on your skin..</li>
            <li> Glitter in very &amp;#34;fine&amp;#34; and subtle in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Its not a very noticeable shimmer, just enough to make this lotion have a little something extra!</li>
            <li> Also noo tann tint too it which i expected..</li>
            <li> waste of part of my mothers day gift card which pissed me off.....should have returned it...but didn&#x27;t care enough to take the time or money to do so.</li>
            <li> but this is just a minimal shimmer and to my surprise</li>
            <li> Not at all what I expected, I wanted it to be shimmer, at its not anything close</li>
            <li> Really no glimmer at all.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely no shimmer!</li>
            <li> Beats other products on market.</li>
            <li> It says &amp;#34;shimmer&amp;#34; but don&#x27;t worry you are not loaded down with glitter.</li>
            <li> To me, it was a waste of money, but then again, I don&#x27;t have a tan due to melanoma.</li>
            <li> Based only on the fact it was ridiculously scripted.</li>
            <li> not sparkly... smells a little off...</li>
            <li> I think it may be a little pricey for the amount</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste money on it again.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this lotion smells amazing</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite lotion. Have used everyday for over a year and still get comments on how good it smells all the time.</li>
            <li> Very nice and a light shimmer and smells really nice.</li>
            <li> not sparkly... smells a little off... just not what I was looking for or expecting. Maybe people use or like this as an after tanning lotion for the salon - but I found no sparkles, glitter - nothing.</li>
            <li> Nice lotion, not much shimmer.</li>
            <li> I smelled just as nice as the other reviews had stated, it wasn&#x27;t sticky like some of the other lotions out there, BUT... There was no shimmer.. I rubbed it on thinking that there would be almost like a bronzing effect shimmer, no..  I shook it up, thinking that the shimmer wasn&#x27;t mixed in, that didn&#x27;t work..  I put some in my hand, looked at it closely, there is a tiny shimmer to it, but not really noticeable when you rub it on your skin.. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it does smell nice, but the reason I bought this was for the shimmer, so that&#x27;s why I am giving only 2 stars..</li>
            <li> This lotion does not shimmer at all and It is a very strong fragrance. I did not care for it at all.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. I use it right after tanning in the beds.  Very moisturizing and only slight shimmer, not really noticeable at all.  I use it and go back to work.  It has a pleasant smell too -- nothing too strong.  I think it may be a little pricey for the amount but it is better to get it on Amazon than pay almost double at the salon.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion, scent is nice, Snooki&#x27;s lotion has a better scent, but that is just my opinion. I enjoy both and swap up every other time. Worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Good glow not too much at all :)</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff. Smells amazing.</li>
            <li> It has very heavy fragrance. Even if I liked the way it was scented I still would not be able to wear it. I tested it by putting a small amount on my arm and it was so strongly scented that it overpowered my perfume. It was all I could smell until I washed it off. On a good note it did leave my skin feeling soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Not what I thought it would be.  Disappointed in this purchase will not purchase again !! I want shimmer!!!! dissatisfied</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion because I love sparkles.  This is super sparkly and nice but after applying it the perfumey fragrance made me feel a little sick.  I gave it to a friend who is not as scent sensitive and she loves it.</li>
            <li> My wife uses it when spa tanning. She loves it. Besides, it&#x27;s soft and nice. She rubs her body for moisture and softness.</li>
            <li> Sparkles not as  sparkly as intended! Also noo tann tint too it which i expected..</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite! I love the smell - it&#x27;s the same scent as Wedding White. The shimmer isn&#x27;t obnoxious - it just gives your skin a nice glow. Makes my skin smooth without needing a whole lot.</li>
            <li> JWOWW&#x27;s Shimmering Body Lotion is perfect for me. The lotion shimmers slightly, but the scent is really nice. You don&#x27;t need to wear perfume while wearing it. I would recommend to women who are not looking for a lot of shimmer.</li>
            <li> The lotion seems to provide a decent amount of moisturize but there is no shimmer whatsoever.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It adds shine to your body but NO SHIMMER.  I used the product for the shine factor but to me it was false advertisement to say it is SHIMMERING....there is no shimmer.  I will not purchase again.  Sorry JWoww.....I really wanted to believe in your product.  but if you say it has shimmer put some damn shimmer in it.  Its not that hard.  waste of part of my mothers day gift card which pissed me off.....should have returned it...but didn&#x27;t care enough to take the time or money to do so.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion! The smell is amazing and the lotion adds a nice subtle glow. I was so worried that this was going to be a glitter lotion and I&#x27;d look like Edward from Twilight. It&#x27;s definitely not that.</li>
            <li> Smells really good. Works really good.</li>
            <li> Loved this lotion! It had just the right amount of sparkle for a nice glow, and a great smell to it. I definately will repurchase</li>
            <li> Glitter in very &amp;#34;fine&amp;#34; and subtle in my opinion. Which makes it perfect! Just a hint of the glitter glow, very pretty and classy :)</li>
            <li> I really loved the scent of this lotion just wished it was actually shimmery</li>
            <li> The smell is great. And the shimmer is not a lot. Love it...</li>
            <li> Not enough shimmer comes off easy</li>
            <li> Love, love, love the smell. It is nice, but not over powering. And the shimmer that it leaves on my skin is subtle, but nice. I used it as an after tanning lotion to help keep me moisturized after using a tanning bed/booth. It worked well for that. It was not greasy and had a nice, light feel.</li>
            <li> I just received my JWOWW Shimmering Body Lotion. I just applied some on my arm only to be so disappointed that there is no shimmer whats so ever. NONE!! The shimmer was the sole reason I bought this product. After reading the online reviews most had stated a slight shimmer is seen, but I see nothing. I would never recommend this product to my fellow tanners.</li>
            <li> Bday gift for the wife and she really loves how it feels on her skin and it got the job done</li>
            <li> Absolutely no shimmer! Smells just like like jwoww tanning lotion.&lt;br /&gt;The only good thing was I got it a day early.</li>
            <li> Love everything about this body lotion. This is the second time I ordered this and will purchase more. The smell is amazing. It says &amp;#34;shimmer&amp;#34; but don&#x27;t worry you are not loaded down with glitter. To sum it up.....LOVE this !!!</li>
            <li> my best friend loves it!! got it for her smell dope!!</li>
            <li> Perfume is a little over powering at first.</li>
            <li> It really isn&#x27;t shimmering like I thought.</li>
            <li> The scent is a little over whelming at first. It does not shimmer as much as I thought it would. However, it does leave my skin soft.</li>
            <li> i love this product and i am very happy to have gotten more i have ordered this from you all before and i am very satisfied with the price thank you for having it at a reasonable price thank you and i hope you keep it cheap i will be ordering more soon thanks again</li>
            <li> Smooth and creamy. Great fragrance. Recommend to anyone who cares about their skin. Beats other products on market. Buy this stuff!</li>
            <li> This is actually my first Amazon review. I dislike Jersey Shore immensely. Based only on the fact it was ridiculously scripted. With that being said, I love this shimmer Body lotion. I manage a Spa and deal with a lot of different Body Lotions (Hemp, Scrubs, Bronzers, etc) .. This particular Shimmer lotion has a gentle smell (Not to Fu-Fu) and gives a subtle shimmer.. So don&#x27;t let the bottle derail you from buying. I thought I was going to look like Octopussy covered in gold. In reality it&#x27;s an Australian Gold product (always legit) and it just happens to be branded with JWOWW&#x27;s celebrity face. I give it an A .. I wish there were bigger bottles.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion, I&#x27;m a frequent tanner and spray tanner. This has a great smell, and it enhances the look of your tan and body kind of like a more flawless effect. I was worried about the shimmer, I hate any lotions with shimmer, glitter, etc. but this is just a minimal shimmer and to my surprise that&#x27;s what makes it look so good! So if your a tanner bed or spray, using an after tan moisturizer really makes a big difference. I am an ex tanning salon employee so I know the truths and sales &amp;#34;Truths&amp;#34; well lol. But using a moisturizer or tan extender truly makes a huge difference in the life of your tan. The price compared to in salon price is insane and by that I mean you wont find this cheaper ever lol. Anyway purchase with no worries its a great product as I have noticed with mostly all jwow branded tanning products. If you love a tan you will love this and checkout her lotions, must say my favorites! You get so much color from them and this lotion makes you look great, benefits of the ingredients needed to prolong tan life but best part is the shimmer! Its not a very noticeable shimmer, just enough to make this lotion have a little something extra! Buy!!</li>
            <li> Not greasy and not too much sparkle ..very subtle. Smells nice and not overbearing. Great after tan lotion. I like this so well I bought another one.</li>
            <li> Came as described but omfg this smells like old ladies, the shimmer is just right but again the smell is awful!</li>
            <li> My wife actually bought this so I&#x27;ll let her type it up:&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;I LOVE THIS LOTION!! I bought this at Suntan City on sale ($25, much cheaper on Amazon). It makes my skin feel like silk, and smells amazing. It is a great tan extender and I love the shimmer.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this and I love to put it on before going out because it definitely gives my tan an extra boost and glow. Love it! :)</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. Smells great and makes my skin feel great. I highly recommend it!!! Vendor is great as well!</li>
            <li> I love the scent and the bottle is pretty haha which is very appealing.&lt;br /&gt;I used this after I used the matching tanning bc it did make me pretty itchy. It helped a lot with that and made my skin smooth and smelling awesome.&lt;br /&gt;I love her lotion.</li>
            <li> When I started using the JWOWW One and Done, I wasn&#x27;t exactly crazy about the scent the lotion had coming out of the bottle. However, this tan extender smells great! The shimmer it gives you is subtle, which is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Not at all what I expected, I wanted it to be shimmer, at its not anything close</li>
            <li> Really no glimmer at all.  Just cream.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to use after you get out of the tanning bed.  I purchased the tanning bed lotion after using this product.</li>
            <li> I just got my lotion today and it doesn&#x27;t smell the best, it kinda smells like a cheap tanning lotion and theres no shimmer to it. deff not what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> Not quite as shimmery as the product claims. To me, it was a waste of money, but then again, I don&#x27;t have a tan due to melanoma. Perhaps if I did have a tan, it would look better. The smell is horrendous. But I like musky, sandalwood type fragrances. This is definitely not that.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and that it&#x27;s shimmery BUT it leaves a sticky coating on your skin and does not intensify your tan at all. I wouldn&#x27;t waste money on it again.</li>
            <li> GREAT SHIPPEMENT TIME</li>
            <li> it is a ok lotion great smell just lack shimmer. it could of used some more shimmer or glitter... but the smell was awesome I probally wouldnt buy again if I wsnted a shimmer lotion but  I would just for a plain lotion tp have</li>
            <li> I love the smell of the lotion, but it wasn&#x27;t very shimmery at all, and that&#x27;s what I was mostly looking forward too, but it smells great and leaves your skin soft! Don&#x27;t buy it for shimmer!</li>
            <li> I hate this product....it does NOT glimmer!!!</li>
            <li> Smells good, great tan extender, however there is no shimmer at all... one of the main reasons I bought it. Won&#x27;t be buying again</li>
            <li> jwow.. has no, absolutly no shimmers in the lotion! the bottle is shiney and it smells great , but nooooo shimmers!! sad ..</li>
            <li> Like lotion it smells good and makes u feel pretty.it makes you&#x27;re. Tan glow,shine,shimmer. As for moisture. It dose not.</li>
