    <ol>
            <li>Awesome product!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s helpful anytime of day, but bedtime gives the best results.  </li>
            <li>Very good for my chapped hands.</li>
            <li>This stuff is incredible.  </li>
            <li>It works great for any skin it seems.</li>
            <li>Amazing product!  </li>
            <li>really good stuff ...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best available hand cream that I have found.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many, many products and this one is the best.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena has a nice, flowery scent.</li>
            <li>Goes on nicely, absorbs well and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t leave my hands greasy, and it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell (and thankfully no floral smell!).</li>
            <li>I was given an older tube by my niece and loved it!</li>
            <li>I find it to be an excellent moisturizing and nourishing skin care product when used regularly over time.  </li>
            <li>Gotta have some more.</li>
            <li>FOR ME it is a top of the line healing product.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like it, but thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  </li>
            <li>I love this cream.</li>
            <li>, I have had this problem for many years.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite hand creams.  </li>
            <li>This is a phenomenal product.  </li>
            <li>This lotion is the best for dry hands.</li>
            <li>This &#x27;No.1012 Chapped Hands Remedy&#x27; works OK, but is nothing special.</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best hand cream out there.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheaper, far more effective, and I don&#x27;t have to wake up smelling like a medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many over the years, and most leave my hands feeling greasy, and don&#x27;t do much to heal the dryness.</li>
            <li>It is too greasy for me to use during the day, but for consistent overnight care I have found nothing better.</li>
            <li>I have used this on my dry heels, elbows, and hands with great results.  </li>
            <li>I have some pretty good lotions with tea tree oil etc &amp; although they helped, they didn&#x27;t completely repair/heal my elbows.  </li>
            <li>It is possibly still good because it was an unopened tube when I found it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even tried sweet almond oil, butter</li>
            <li>The definition of Remedy is &amp;#34;something that cures or relieves a disease or bodily disorder; a healing medicine, application, or treatment.&amp;#34; Bigelow chose the word wisely and correctly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never found anything more effective for treating dry hands.</li>
            <li>The smell is strong but it goes away fast</li>
            <li>/&gt;P.S. Hands still stay soft even after you wash them :)</li>
            <li>well worth the price ...</li>
            <li>I type on my keyboard right afterwards.</li>
            <li>While the cream is effective in softening dry, chapped hands, the smell got on my nerves.</li>
            <li>My hand still didn&#x27;t feel like normal, but there was no mistaking the significant improvement.</li>
            <li>The most recent area has been my elbows.  </li>
            <li>I can use it repeatedly for many months during the winter and my hand will never turn red or itch afterwards.</li>
            <li>This cream is really something!  </li>
            <li>I deal with the remaining greasy feel just because it really does work!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t  give a 5 stars because I don&#x27;t like to use the world love loosely.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like it and didn&#x27;t think it had much to deliver for the price.</li>
            <li>Alas, my quest for a great hand moisturizer continues.</li>
            <li>It goes on very greasy, and feels this way afterwards as well.</li>
            <li>If you use too much - yes greasy.  </li>
            <li>Within two days his skin was smooth with the fissures starting to heal.  </li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing, but not too greasy or slimy.</li>
            <li>This works great, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I am buying a few more for myself.</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin and obsess over lotion, this is the only one that a truly love.</li>
            <li>It likes to try to crop up in new areas.  </li>
            <li>I always get super dry hands in the winter.</li>
            <li>So, hopefully this product is wonderful for the price, but I was extremely disappointed in the packaging/shipping...</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;ve been applying this for 3 days straight, my hands are back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>If you want to relieve your chapped hands, old No 1012 is the medicine to use.</li>
            <li>Has a slight &amp;#34;medicated&amp;#34; smell, but not a bad smell.</li>
            <li>The back of my hands get super dry in the winter months.</li>
            <li>Continued use cleared up all problems and brought my hands back to normal.  </li>
            <li>Not a lot of other products work to moisturize my boyfriend&#x27;s hands, they get very dry and split open, but he uses this and his hands are smooth and no longer sore!</li>
            <li>The 40% glycerin in this cream really helped a nagging dry skin/cracking condition on my husband&#x27;s palms.  </li>
            <li>In just 3-4 days, I began to notice a major improvement on my hands.  </li>
            <li>Why ruin an otherwise great hand cream by adding painful fragrance chemicals?  </li>
            <li>Too bad because I really liked it before!</li>
            <li>During the winter I have never had a hand cream make my dry skin feel soft again with just one application.  </li>
            <li>As previous commenters noted, you don&#x27;t need a lot, apply just a small amount to avoid a greasy feeling, but that is easy to manage.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have an issue with dry, chapped and peeling hands, particularly in the winter time, but sometimes in other seasons as well.  </li>
            <li> They are always dry, especially in the winter.</li>
            <li> ;  Once I discovered how long it lasted I no longer minded what it costs.</li>
            <li> I have dry hands from gardening, cooking or working on the lawn.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for about 4 years when my wife gave it to me for my extremely dry fingertips and hands.  </li>
            <li> It has all night to attract moisture to the dry areas and It won&#x27;t be washed off because I&#x27;m sleeping.  </li>
            <li> Over the years, I&#x27;ve tried just about every single brand of lotion on the market with so-so results.  </li>
            <li> But the first night I applied this stuff as per instructions, I was shocked at how much damage had been repaired overnight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an avid book reader, and it&#x27;s weird, but reading an actual book with pages dries my hands out.  </li>
            <li> I recommend using generously at night before going to bed, and going with a tiny amount (black peppercorn) of cream during day after soap-washing your hands.</li>
            <li> My hands get very dry as I use them a lot throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> I also crochet a lot, and having yarn rub all over my hands makes them very dry as well.  </li>
            <li> A little too greasy for my hands, especially at night.</li>
            <li> And for 14$ a tube, it was a little pricey, especially for someone on a budget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I purchased it, used it at home and a few days later...</li>
            <li> My hands felt moist for about half an hour, but then started feeling dry again.</li>
            <li> Overdoing at day time will make your hands greasy and unable to handle things.&lt;br /&gt;It practically has no smell, but a very faint &#x27;medicated&#x27;-ish smell to it, which is awesome, because I always assumed anything bought at Bath &amp; Body works would have a violent, sweet smell.</li>
            <li> The skin gets very rough, almost like as if I&#x27;ve rubbed them against sand paper.</li>
            <li> And somehow my hands felt dry right after applying the cream, not to mention it&#x27;s painful if your hands are chapped and bleeding.</li>
            <li> I found a the tube of Bigelow hidden away in my stock pile</li>
            <li> some previous reviewer mentioned, it has a gel-like consistency and appearance, and if you overdo the cream, your hands do feel greasy.</li>
            <li> I purchased this at my local mall for about 14$ and while it did the same job as my regular hand cream, I was slightly disappointed.</li>
            <li> But a little goes along way</li>
            <li> A little is all it takes</li>
            <li> Frankly, I will not be buying this very average hand cream again.</li>
            <li> I wash my hands tons of times everyday.</li>
            <li> Tried quite a few hand creams with very little results.</li>
            <li> and I would recommend this for hands that hurt and need a little TLC!  </li>
            <li> (because of the fragrances or the alcohol usually in them).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now on my 4th tube of this stuff, but I&#x27;ve found that BBW can&#x27;t keep in on the shelves and it is usually on back-order, so I come to Amazon now to buy it</li>
            <li> I am a physician and I wash my hands excessively.</li>
            <li> Not sure I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> I also see it&#x27;s less expensive on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Duh!</li>
            <li> well slap me silly and call me Sally, no more SPLIT FINGER</li>
            <li> I am not impressed.</li>
            <li> When I stumbled upon C.O. Bigelow&#x27;s Chapped Hands Remedy at a Bath &amp; Bodyworks shop, I gave it a try, despite how expensive it was.  </li>
            <li> (yeah, that desperate)</li>
            <li> When I ran out of this, I bought an expired tube on Ebay and boy, was I sorry!</li>
            <li> but my hands start itching really bad...</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very good for my chapped hands.</li>
            <li> I ran out of my trusty Neutrogena and had to find a substitute as my hands were starting to suffer. I purchased this at my local mall for about 14$ and while it did the same job as my regular hand cream, I was slightly disappointed. When I ran out of this, I bought an expired tube on Ebay and boy, was I sorry! Turns out, expired cream doesn&#x27;t do the same job. Duh! Well, on to the review. While the cream is effective in softening dry, chapped hands, the smell got on my nerves. Neutrogena has a nice, flowery scent. This cream smells like Bengay! Yes, probably from the eucalyptus and menthol. I didn&#x27;t like it and didn&#x27;t think it had much to deliver for the price. the texture was off as well. A little too greasy for my hands, especially at night. And somehow my hands felt dry right after applying the cream, not to mention it&#x27;s painful if your hands are chapped and bleeding. OUCH!!! And for 14$ a tube, it was a little pricey, especially for someone on a budget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, would I buy again? I don&#x27;t think so. I&#x27;ll stick with my trusty Neutrogena Norwegian Formula. It&#x27;s cheaper, far more effective, and I don&#x27;t have to wake up smelling like a medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> Alas, my quest for a great hand moisturizer continues. I&#x27;ve tried so many over the years, and most leave my hands feeling greasy, and don&#x27;t do much to heal the dryness. This &#x27;No.1012 Chapped Hands Remedy&#x27; works OK, but is nothing special. It goes on very greasy, and feels this way afterwards as well. My hands felt moist for about half an hour, but then started feeling dry again. Frankly, I will not be buying this very average hand cream again. I am not impressed.</li>
            <li> It works almost instantly and keeps working for hours. I&#x27;ve never found anything more effective for treating dry hands.</li>
            <li> I keep buying this. It works great for any skin it seems.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from eczema all my life.  It likes to try to crop up in new areas.  The most recent area has been my elbows.  I have some pretty good lotions with tea tree oil etc &amp; although they helped, they didn&#x27;t completely repair/heal my elbows.  I found a the tube of Bigelow hidden away in my stock pile so I started using it.  It has worked wonders.  Then I saw the expiration date was 5 years ago.  Oh well, it is still working so I am using it. It is possibly still good because it was an unopened tube when I found it.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and obsess over lotion, this is the only one that a truly love. Goes on nicely, absorbs well and isn&#x27;t greasy. The smell is strong but it goes away fast and I don&#x27;t mind it for a lotion that truly works.</li>
            <li> I have been using Bigelow&#x27;s Chapped Hands Remedy for years, rubbing generous amounts of it on my hands nightly (then wearing inexpensive cotton gloves overnight to aid absorption).  I find it to be an excellent moisturizing and nourishing skin care product when used regularly over time.  It is too greasy for me to use during the day, but for consistent overnight care I have found nothing better.</li>
            <li> We paid 27.53 per item including freight.  Amazaon sent me to a sight that&#x27;s called Two for One so I thought I would be getting two tems for the price of 19.00 plus frieth.  I feel that I was ripped off.  Bath and Body work sells the item for 14.00.  And if you look at the picture there are two items, however one is the box.</li>
            <li> During the winter I have never had a hand cream make my dry skin feel soft again with just one application.  LaLaLove it.  Gotta have some more. As previous commenters noted, you don&#x27;t need a lot, apply just a small amount to avoid a greasy feeling, but that is easy to manage. I type on my keyboard right afterwards.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product at a different outlet when I happened to be there with a friend.  I asked the clerk what I could use to help heal my hands as I work in an industrial field and do a lot of tool work on my off time.  She recommended this product and of course, one doesn&#x27;t know what it does until you try it. FOR ME it is a top of the line healing product.  If you use too much - yes greasy.  But a little goes along way and I would recommend this for hands that hurt and need a little TLC!  I also see it&#x27;s less expensive on Amazon.  So I&#x27;ll be purchasing my next tube here.</li>
            <li> I always get super dry hands in the winter. I tried using every day lotions and they work... but my hands start itching really bad... (because of the fragrances or the alcohol usually in them). This works great, and a little goes a long way. I can use it repeatedly for many months during the winter and my hand will never turn red or itch afterwards.</li>
            <li> Why ruin an otherwise great hand cream by adding painful fragrance chemicals?  That&#x27;s what I want to ask the manufacturers of this product.</li>
            <li> I got this from another vendor in a gift basket.  I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like it, but thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  My hands get very dry as I use them a lot throughout the day.  I&#x27;m an avid book reader, and it&#x27;s weird, but reading an actual book with pages dries my hands out.  I also crochet a lot, and having yarn rub all over my hands makes them very dry as well.  Add to all of that, I&#x27;m allergic to my daughter&#x27;s cat, so I&#x27;m constantly washing my hands!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not ever found a product that literally heals my hands from being chapped aside from this one.  It says it is a non-greasy formula.  I would beg to differ with that, however, I can feel it healing the chapped parts of my hands.  This cream is really something!  I deal with the remaining greasy feel just because it really does work!</li>
            <li> Amazing product!  The 40% glycerin in this cream really helped a nagging dry skin/cracking condition on my husband&#x27;s palms.  Within two days his skin was smooth with the fissures starting to heal.  I have used this on my dry heels, elbows, and hands with great results.  I love this cream.</li>
            <li> My fingers tips used to split open at the corner by my nails in the Winter time, I have had this problem for many years. Tried quite a few hand creams with very little results. Walked into Bath &amp; Body Works, told the sales person my problem and she recommended C.O. Bigelow # 1012, tried a sample on my hands and I could tell a difference. So I purchased it, used it at home and a few days later...well slap me silly and call me Sally, no more SPLIT FINGER TIPS!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; BillyRay&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Hands still stay soft even after you wash them :)</li>
            <li> I thought it was a bit pricey!!</li>
            <li> Not a lot of other products work to moisturize my boyfriend&#x27;s hands, they get very dry and split open, but he uses this and his hands are smooth and no longer sore! I only wish that it came in a bigger size. Awesome product!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite hand creams.  It absorbs well so it doesn&#x27;t leave my hands greasy, and it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell (and thankfully no floral smell!).</li>
            <li> I have an issue with dry, chapped and peeling hands, particularly in the winter time, but sometimes in other seasons as well.  Over the years, I&#x27;ve tried just about every single brand of lotion on the market with so-so results.  When I stumbled upon C.O. Bigelow&#x27;s Chapped Hands Remedy at a Bath &amp; Bodyworks shop, I gave it a try, despite how expensive it was.  In just 3-4 days, I began to notice a major improvement on my hands.  Continued use cleared up all problems and brought my hands back to normal.  I&#x27;m now on my 4th tube of this stuff, but I&#x27;ve found that BBW can&#x27;t keep in on the shelves and it is usually on back-order, so I come to Amazon now to buy it (where it&#x27;s also cheaper).</li>
            <li> Softens my excema, my callouses and my seborrheic dermatitis that stretches beyond my hairline ... really good stuff ... well worth the price ...</li>
            <li> I wash my hands tons of times everyday. The back of my hands get super dry in the winter months. The skin gets very rough, almost like as if I&#x27;ve rubbed them against sand paper. I&#x27;ve even tried sweet almond oil, butter (yeah, that desperate), Vaseline... I bought this product through another vendor. Like dozens of products before this, I was fully expecting to not believe anything said on the label.  But the first night I applied this stuff as per instructions, I was shocked at how much damage had been repaired overnight. My hand still didn&#x27;t feel like normal, but there was no mistaking the significant improvement. Now I&#x27;ve been applying this for 3 days straight, my hands are back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;As some previous reviewer mentioned, it has a gel-like consistency and appearance, and if you overdo the cream, your hands do feel greasy. I recommend using generously at night before going to bed, and going with a tiny amount (black peppercorn) of cream during day after soap-washing your hands. Overdoing at day time will make your hands greasy and unable to handle things.&lt;br /&gt;It practically has no smell, but a very faint &#x27;medicated&#x27;-ish smell to it, which is awesome, because I always assumed anything bought at Bath &amp; Body works would have a violent, sweet smell.</li>
            <li> This lotion is the best for dry hands.</li>
            <li> The definition of Remedy is &amp;#34;something that cures or relieves a disease or bodily disorder; a healing medicine, application, or treatment.&amp;#34; Bigelow chose the word wisely and correctly. If you want to relieve your chapped hands, old No 1012 is the medicine to use. It&#x27;s the best available hand cream that I have found.</li>
            <li> This stuff is incredible.  I have dry hands from gardening, cooking or working on the lawn.  A tiny dab will do wonders for restoring the skin on my hands.</li>
            <li> I use this product often.  Does just as described would buy again.  I don&#x27;t  give a 5 stars because I don&#x27;t like to use the world love loosely.</li>
            <li> I work in a preschool and wash my hands often. They are always dry, especially in the winter. I&#x27;ve tried many, many products and this one is the best. It is very moisturizing, but not too greasy or slimy. Has a slight &amp;#34;medicated&amp;#34; smell, but not a bad smell. I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a phenomenal product.  I have been using it for about 4 years when my wife gave it to me for my extremely dry fingertips and hands.  It&#x27;s helpful anytime of day, but bedtime gives the best results.  It has all night to attract moisture to the dry areas and It won&#x27;t be washed off because I&#x27;m sleeping.  A little is all it takes so these tubes last &amp;#34;forever.&amp;#34;  Once I discovered how long it lasted I no longer minded what it costs.</li>
            <li> So, hopefully this product is wonderful for the price, but I was extremely disappointed in the packaging/shipping...the box was crumpled and opened when it arrived. This was meant to be a gift.</li>
            <li> I am a physician and I wash my hands excessively. This is hands down the best hand cream out there. Similar to an ointment, it works overnight. I am buying a few more for myself.</li>
            <li> I was given an older tube by my niece and loved it! This one smells different and doesn&#x27;t do as well with my hands. Not sure I will buy this again. Too bad because I really liked it before!</li>
