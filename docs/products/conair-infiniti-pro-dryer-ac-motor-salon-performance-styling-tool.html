            <li>and she loved it too.</li>
            <li>There is nothing good about this dryer.</li>
            <li>Has amazing air pressure&lt;br</li>
            <li>That was my own fault though.</li>
            <li>If you already own one, throw it away.  </li>
            <li>The air pressure is awesome and comes out pretty strong which is awesome for making my straight hair fuller and fluffier.</li>
            <li>Best hairdryer ever, so much better than my 150 professional dryer even!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very loud, but if the trade off is awesome hair, then that&#x27;s fine with</li>

            <li>I love this dryer.  </li>
            <li>But, all in all, I&#x27;m pleased with the performance.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t review unless I truly love a product.</li>
            <li>And I love this dryer.</li>
            <li>I guess we will have to see if mine goes up in a fireball:)</li>
            <li>** :)</li>
            <li>Spend a bit more money and get a dryer that will have staying power.</li>
            <li>Love the power in this blowdryer.</li>
            <li>Revlon hair dryers are much better.</li>
            <li>I just spent $25 more on a Babyliss dryer and it is awesome!</li>
            <li>They should either be somewhere else or not so easily activated.  </li>
            <li>At first, I liked this dryer a lot.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this hair dryer for over a year and loved how high powered it&#x27;s been, but this morning it literally shot huge electric sparks out of the bottom of the handle.</li>
            <li>One huge improvement would be a retractable cord.  </li>
            <li>I used this hairdryer at a hotel and liked it so much I bought it.</li>
            <li>If you want smooth and shiny hair, then this is the hairdryer for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I avoided burns or getting electrocuted fortunately.</li>
            <li>out!!&lt;br /&gt;The heating is ok but seems to take awhile to get hot.</li>
            <li>Great power and heat settings to help you dry your hair in a snap.</li>
            <li>I was most happy with the temperature settings where I could select Air Only and then on High speed, so</li>
            <li>The lights dim and flicker when it&#x27;s running, but it sure as heck dries some hair!</li>
            <li>and it was awesome not only for that but for actual hair drying too.</li>
            <li>It dries my hair quickly and I like the results it gives me.  </li>
            <li>dries my hair extremely quickly on</li>
            <li>this thing is built to last and is very safe.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a shame they don&#x27;t sell this in the UK where I live most of the time.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this model!!!</li>
            <li>Fast dry time, great speed.</li>
            <li>Dryer works great, but mine seems to already feel like it is losing a little power by sounds</li>
            <li>really well designed and comfortable in hand.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let the price discourage you, it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>I am sure she is going to be surprised when she gets this.</li>
            <li>Powerful . .  </li>
            <li>Powerful motor that dries hair faster and without damage.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, it is hot and then cool without reason.</li>
            <li>The right orange.</li>
            <li>It has great power to dry my hair and is more compact than other bulkier hair dryers!</li>
            <li>Dries super fast.</li>
            <li>It dries very fast without killing your hair</li>
            <li>It dries hair very fast</li>
            <li>I had really liked the dryer since it was powerful and dried my hair quickly.</li>
            <li>Does not get too hot, my hair feels healthier.</li>
            <li>The first one I bought shorted out by the cord, flamed and melted the cord.</li>
            <li>So much POWAH!</li>
            <li>I bought this hair dryer recently and really like it, for the most part.  </li>
            <li>My only issue with this dryer is that the toggle buttons are activated too easily.  </li>
            <li>bought for girlfriend to replace the same one she had, seems better than the old one!</li>
            <li>Always buy this exact make/model - this one looks a bit cheap/less quality than the older ones.</li>
            <li>Pretty decent hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>According to articles ranking blow driers, this was rated very high and it&#x27;s warranted.  </li>
            <li>works really well and not too noisy</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s built very well to boot.</li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>it just based on how much time you&#x27;ll save using it.  </li>
            <li>Really like the Conair blow dryer.</li>
            <li>Wife claims it doesn&#x27;t cause her hair to frizz as much either...</li>
            <li>The hair drys fast just with the force of the air,&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;ve used them all, including salon versions that cost three times as much.</li>
            <li>Mine does have just one screw on the back of the handle, but the website says it doesn&#x27;t fit into the recall because of the model number.</li>
            <li>Run away fast from this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Just wish it had a much lower &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; on it.</li>
            <li>Safe, with no bad wiring (I&#x27;ve had 4 over the past 4-5 years</li>
            <li>Hope it works as well as the older ones we have.</li>
            <li>even on its lowest setting it is very loud!</li>
            <li>And to be honest I was surprised by how well it was built that it lasted through all of that too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, long story short, this hair dryer</li>
            <li>Of course, I&#x27;m still a little uneasy because I thought the change in the noise it was making surely meant it was on the recall.</li>
            <li>Not as powerful as the same unit bought at Target.</li>
            <li>With their location on the handle being right where I would normally grip the dryer, I am constantly pressing the toggle switches and either reducing the speed or the temperature of the dryer.  </li>
            <li>dries my long hair quickly.  </li>
            <li>needed a new hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>I bought a second one after the first one died.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t be certain that the short was caused by the sparks.</li>
            <li>It was also extremely loud.  </li>
            <li>It has a lot of power and was well worth the $35 I spent.</li>
            <li>This product stopped working 2 months after receiving it new, it turned on but no hot air, only cool air came out.</li>
            <li>On the hottest setting it barely got hot and took forever to dry my air.  </li>
            <li>My huge complaint about this hair dryer is that it is WAY too loud,</li>
            <li>I used it while I was visiting her and was amazed at how quickly my hair dried using this product.  </li>
            <li>Thanks but no thanks.</li>
            <li>After only 3 months of owning it, taking good care of it, and using it maybe 2-3 days a week, the heat died so now it only blows cold air on every setting.</li>

            <li> I only had to buy a new one because after a year of continuous use and dropping it on to hardwood floors like 50 times it finally got a little cracked and</li>
            <li> It blows hot, hard and lasted for years, and yes, I am still talking about the hair dryer.</li>
            <li> A little loud.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to get other hair dryers around the same price range and even a bit more expensive and they all suck compared to this one!</li>
            <li> I thought the short was due to hanging the dryer on a hook, so I bought another one and stored it without any stress on the cord.</li>
            <li> my hair doesn&#x27;t dry out.</li>
            <li> I think it may be just a touch too intense on the high setting -- but unfortunately the low setting is dismally low and with long, thick hair it just doesn&#x27;t make any sense for me to use it that way.</li>
            <li> lo speed high heat, pretty quiet &amp; those ugly rubber bumps on the side keep it from sliding off the counter  &amp; destroying itself like our last 3 dryers.</li>
            <li> Most of them were weak and one of them even started making weird noises  after being on for only a minute!</li>
            <li> however if you have long hair,it sucks in your hair in the back</li>
            <li> Extremely well built</li>
            <li> My hair typically takes 5-10+ minutes to fully dry; with this dryer it was close if not fully dry in less than 5 minutes!</li>
            <li> Noise not too awful (better than the high-pitched nightmare my last dryer was -</li>
            <li> This blow dryer cut my dry time down by at least 5 minutes!</li>
            <li> Take it from me who sometimes fell asleep with it on (my heat was broken at one point and this was my only source of warmth)...</li>
            <li> It was incredibly heavy.  </li>
            <li> Works a treat, but is a bit heavy.</li>
            <li> Crappy, heavy, and</li>
            <li> It scared me half to death!</li>
            <li> Well this dryer just died, producing a dramatic flame out the back.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick, long hair.</li>
            <li> My hand is definitely not touching anything.</li>

            <li> works really well and not too noisy</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this hair dryer</li>
            <li> This is a Great hair dryer.  I was most happy with the temperature settings where I could select Air Only and then on High speed, so my hair doesn&#x27;t dry out.</li>
            <li> This dryer kicks butt. I have a lot of hair, and this dryer does the job faster than anything I&#x27;ve ever used. I bought a second one after the first one died.</li>
            <li> needed a new hair dryer.  works great.</li>
            <li> Best blow dryer ever!  Fast dry time, great speed.</li>
            <li> I love this brand of hair dryer and I&#x27;ve had it for years. I used to have this habit of sitting in front of it for warmth (weird I know) and it was awesome not only for that but for actual hair drying too. The air pressure is awesome and comes out pretty strong which is awesome for making my straight hair fuller and fluffier. I&#x27;ve tried to get other hair dryers around the same price range and even a bit more expensive and they all suck compared to this one! Most of them were weak and one of them even started making weird noises  after being on for only a minute! But this one doesn&#x27;t do that and it&#x27;s built very well to boot. Take it from me who sometimes fell asleep with it on (my heat was broken at one point and this was my only source of warmth)... this thing is built to last and is very safe. I only had to buy a new one because after a year of continuous use and dropping it on to hardwood floors like 50 times it finally got a little cracked and the inside started having tiny sparks. That was my own fault though. And to be honest I was surprised by how well it was built that it lasted through all of that too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, long story short, this hair dryer is;&lt;br /&gt;1. Extremely well built&lt;br /&gt;2. Safe, with no bad wiring (I&#x27;ve had 4 over the past 4-5 years and they only went bad after I dropped it a billion times)&lt;br /&gt;3. Will last you forever&lt;br /&gt;4. Has amazing air pressure&lt;br /&gt;5. Is probably the best hair dryer you can find in this price range&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this model!!! Hope this helps!!</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer. The right orange.</li>
            <li> Great power and heat settings to help you dry your hair in a snap. I have very thick, long hair. This blow dryer cut my dry time down by at least 5 minutes!</li>
            <li> 1 for 1 replacement for my wife&#x27;s hair dryer.  She had the same one for years but it just burned-up one day.  She&#x27;s never found a hair dryer better than this.  It blows hot, hard and lasted for years, and yes, I am still talking about the hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer.  I have one that my daughter loves so I bought her one for Christmas.  It dries very fast without killing your hair</li>
            <li> I used this hairdryer at a hotel and liked it so much I bought it.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  A little loud.</li>
            <li> If you want smooth and shiny hair, then this is the hairdryer for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very loud, but if the trade off is awesome hair, then that&#x27;s fine with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a shame they don&#x27;t sell this in the UK where I live most of the time.</li>
            <li> Dries super fast. Does not get too hot, my hair feels healthier.</li>
            <li> My mom introduced me to this dryer.  I used it while I was visiting her and was amazed at how quickly my hair dried using this product.  My hair typically takes 5-10+ minutes to fully dry; with this dryer it was close if not fully dry in less than 5 minutes! This dryer was voted a best beauty buy by Allure magazine for good reason.  I recommend this dryer to everyone.  Don&#x27;t let the price discourage you, it&#x27;s worth it just based on how much time you&#x27;ll save using it.  Plus it will make your hair look amazing!</li>
            <li> Best hairdryer ever, so much better than my 150 professional dryer even!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t purchase this product as it is a fire hazard. I purchased this dryer and while in use a fireball shot from the bottom and severely burned my arm. I&#x27;ve attempt to contact conair several times and they have yet to respond.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer recently and really like it, for the most part.  It dries my hair quickly and I like the results it gives me.  My huge complaint about this hair dryer is that it is WAY too loud, even on its lowest setting it is very loud!</li>
            <li> Really like the Conair blow dryer. It has great power to dry my hair and is more compact than other bulkier hair dryers!</li>
            <li> The first one I bought shorted out by the cord, flamed and melted the cord. I had really liked the dryer since it was powerful and dried my hair quickly. I thought the short was due to hanging the dryer on a hook, so I bought another one and stored it without any stress on the cord. Well this dryer just died, producing a dramatic flame out the back.  Conair needs to recall this model.</li>
            <li> Not as powerful as the same unit bought at Target.</li>
            <li> Wife loved it.  Best hair dryer she&#x27;s owned</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter for Christmas so she has not seen it yet.  I have the same one and she used mine and loved it.  I am sure she is going to be surprised when she gets this.</li>
            <li> Always buy this exact make/model - this one looks a bit cheap/less quality than the older ones. Hope it works as well as the older ones we have. Bought for someone as bridal shower gift - wishing well.</li>
            <li> Pretty decent hair dryer.  Powerful . .  . dries my long hair quickly.  Noise not too awful (better than the high-pitched nightmare my last dryer was - even my dog couldn&#x27;t stand the noise that thing made).  My only issue with this dryer is that the toggle buttons are activated too easily.  With their location on the handle being right where I would normally grip the dryer, I am constantly pressing the toggle switches and either reducing the speed or the temperature of the dryer.  They should either be somewhere else or not so easily activated.  One huge improvement would be a retractable cord.  But, all in all, I&#x27;m pleased with the performance.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer gets the job done, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the intensity, but my hair always ends up in knots when I use this, ultimately leading to breakage and split ends. I think it may be just a touch too intense on the high setting -- but unfortunately the low setting is dismally low and with long, thick hair it just doesn&#x27;t make any sense for me to use it that way.</li>
            <li> Got one of these for the for my wife. She let her sister borrow it and she loved it too. So this is our second one which we gave her sister for her birthday! So much POWAH! The lights dim and flicker when it&#x27;s running, but it sure as heck dries some hair! Wife claims it doesn&#x27;t cause her hair to frizz as much either... Whatever that means.</li>
            <li> The power on it is great..however if you have long hair,it sucks in your hair in the back and you have to tear it out!!&lt;br /&gt;The heating is ok but seems to take awhile to get hot. The hair drys fast just with the force of the air,&lt;br /&gt;but I would not recommend this to people with longer hair.</li>
            <li> really well designed and comfortable in hand. dries my hair extremely quickly on lo speed high heat, pretty quiet &amp; those ugly rubber bumps on the side keep it from sliding off the counter  &amp; destroying itself like our last 3 dryers.</li>
            <li> Best hairdryer I&#x27;ve ever used. And I&#x27;ve used them all, including salon versions that cost three times as much. I don&#x27;t review unless I truly love a product. And I love this dryer. I have two. Just in case.</li>
            <li> Great dryer! Second we have purchased! Thank you</li>
            <li> This product stopped working 2 months after receiving it new, it turned on but no hot air, only cool air came out.</li>
            <li> Dryer works great, but mine seems to already feel like it is losing a little power by sounds it&#x27;s making. Mine does have just one screw on the back of the handle, but the website says it doesn&#x27;t fit into the recall because of the model number. Of course, I&#x27;m still a little uneasy because I thought the change in the noise it was making surely meant it was on the recall. I guess we will have to see if mine goes up in a fireball:)</li>
            <li> If you are contemplating purchasing one of these hair dyers don&#x27;t.  If you already own one, throw it away.  Ours shot out a fire ball on Saturday and failed to even trip our ground fault. We checked on the model number and it was not part of the recall because it had the two screw holes on the handle which supposedly makes it &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34;.  Run away fast from this hair dryer. Con air&#x27;s solution is to send you another one.  Thanks but no thanks.</li>
            <li> DANGEROUS! I&#x27;ve been using this hair dryer for over a year and loved how high powered it&#x27;s been, but this morning it literally shot huge electric sparks out of the bottom of the handle. It scared me half to death! I avoided burns or getting electrocuted fortunately. I don&#x27;t know if it was because of a short in the cord or not. There appeared to be one that I noticed after the sparks shot out. I can&#x27;t be certain that the short was caused by the sparks.</li>
            <li> This is one of the worst blow dryers I have ever used.  I bought this blow dryer because of the rating.  It was rated excellent in the category of inexpensive blow dryers.  On the hottest setting it barely got hot and took forever to dry my air.  It was incredibly heavy.  I would have to stop several times to rest my arm before continuing.  It was also extremely loud.  There is nothing good about this dryer. I just spent $25 more on a Babyliss dryer and it is awesome!</li>
            <li> Very good product and we have started to use it</li>
            <li> bought for girlfriend to replace the same one she had, seems better than the old one!</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer that was recommended by a friend!</li>
            <li> It dries hair very fast</li>
            <li> Neon orange, not Bronzed. Works as well as my $120 blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several of this product ~ I&#x27;ve been an operator for 44 years &amp; I would definitely recommend this product** :)</li>
            <li> At first, I liked this dryer a lot. After only 3 months of owning it, taking good care of it, and using it maybe 2-3 days a week, the heat died so now it only blows cold air on every setting. Just before the heating element crapped out, I could hear the power surging, so I&#x27;m guessing something shorted out. It didn&#x27;t have any sort of burning smell, it just quit doing it&#x27;s job. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product, it&#x27;s unreliable. Spend a bit more money and get a dryer that will have staying power.</li>
            <li> Works a treat, but is a bit heavy.</li>
            <li> Powerful motor that dries hair faster and without damage.  Just wish it had a much lower &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; on it.</li>
            <li> Love the power in this blowdryer. Unfortunately, it is hot and then cool without reason. My hand is definitely not touching anything. I am going to return it and try another one, to see if this was just a fluke.</li>
            <li> Crappy, heavy, and the curved handle is uncomfortable. Revlon hair dryers are much better.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome blow drier.  According to articles ranking blow driers, this was rated very high and it&#x27;s warranted.  It has a lot of power and was well worth the $35 I spent.</li>
