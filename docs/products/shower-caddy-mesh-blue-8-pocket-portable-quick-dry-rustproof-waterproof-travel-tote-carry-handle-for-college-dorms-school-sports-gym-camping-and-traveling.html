            <li>Good price Good product.</li>

            <li>:)  Love it!</li>
            <li>The product is perfect, very roomy, waterproof and breathable, and easy to carry.</li>
            <li>It has saved me a lot of time; I love that I don&#x27;t have to rummage through drawers or under the cabinet to find what I need.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I am certainly glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I &amp;#34;forgot my shampoo, or washcloth, or whatever&amp;#34; in the shower.</li>
            <li>and i want to thank them. :)</li>
            <li>Love this caddy.</li>
            <li>Houseables&#x27;s customer service is fantastic!</li>
            <li>Will hold all of my toiletries and more.</li>
            <li>Purchased one for myself and love it so ordered another for my daughter when she goes to the gym and pool.</li>
            <li>Very nice caddy but a bit large for me.</li>
            <li>Many compartments fit everything you will need.</li>
            <li>so it won&#x27;t hurt your hand when carrying it or more importantly</li>
            <li>What I liked about this one is it&#x27;s not as large as the collapsible model which seemed more suited for a trash can.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to grab and use items.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to pack into luggage.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a huge problem though; I&#x27;m sure this caddy will still be perfect when I head to college!</li>
            <li>On a good note the seller was very understanding and issued a full refund.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this for someone looking for a roomy shower caddy at a great price.</li>
            <li>I liked mine so much that I bought additional ones for the rest of the family.</li>
            <li>I wish something like this had been available when I was at college.</li>
            <li>The handle is padded and comfortable</li>
            <li>Is very sturdy and holds up nicely.</li>
            <li>Also has lots of space and pockets for everything you could possibly fit in it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s great because it can get wet</li>
            <li>The seller issued a full refund.</li>
            <li>good quality, really big, can hold everything and anything you need to take to the bathroom.</li>
            <li>Just think how great it would be to have everything you need in the shower in one place, in a single container, ready for a quick shower!</li>
            <li>The mesh bottom allows for quick drying.</li>
            <li>I received this caddy extremely quickly, way faster than I</li>
            <li>Very sturdy and dries easily.</li>
            <li>When I received this product, it was as expected and good quality with one exception being the size.</li>
            <li>do wish it had more than one carrying handle to balance it out and make it a little more sturdy.</li>
            <li>I love the color and that the pockets on the sides are different sizes.  </li>
            <li>I just might have to buy another later on for another task :)</li>
            <li>Sending my son off to college for the first time and told he needed a shower caddy.</li>
            <li>but it was bigger and holds a lot more</li>
            <li>Durable material that&#x27;s easy to clean and keep dry!</li>
            <li>My boyfriend says it&#x27;s just the smell of pure rubber, but I&#x27;ve washed it and soaked it in perfume and nothing.</li>
            <li>I love that all items are in pockets and sponge and bar soap are in center.</li>
            <li>I filled the outside pockets with all of my hair products.  </li>
            <li>interior bag very roomy.  </li>
            <li>This is a very sturdy mesh so no holes will rip here.  </li>
            <li>Yet it is still very flexible</li>
            <li>Shipping is really fast.</li>
            <li>Getting ready for summer camp for the kids.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend for kids going to college or camp.</li>
            <li>The side pockets are a couple of different sizes, to fit various bottles or brushes, etc.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty big.</li>
            <li>Just the right size to fit what the need, a little bit bigger than the one I purchased for the girls.  </li>
            <li>I recently ordered 2 of the exact same bags.</li>
            <li>The middle section is large enough for my hair dryer and flat iron.  </li>

            <li> Using for our cruise to keep bathroom items in one area.</li>
            <li> Very nice caddy but a bit large for me.</li>
            <li> They work out great and I would buy them again</li>
            <li> When I received this product, it was as expected and good quality with one exception being the size. It was too big for my son&#x27;s dorm needs. I think it would be perfect for a person who needs to carry more products. I must not have looked closely enough at the photo. Amazon contacted the seller for me and they immediately sent a note that my payment was being refunded and didn&#x27;t even ask for the item to be sent back. I was impressed by the great customer service and, again, the product was of good quality and arrived as promised, it just wasn&#x27;t a perfect fit for me. I would definitely recommend this for someone looking for a roomy shower caddy at a great price.</li>
            <li> I love that all items are in pockets and sponge and bar soap are in center. It is easy to grab and use items.</li>
            <li> Nice sturdy shower caddy. Many compartments fit everything you will need. Purchased for my kids (son &amp; daughter) to take to sleep away camp.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great because it can get wet &amp; it can&#x27;t break. It folds flat so it&#x27;s easy to pack into luggage. Great price.&lt;br /&gt;Very usable product. I highly recommend for kids going to college or camp.</li>
            <li> I use this for our shower caddy in our RV. It&#x27;s perfect! I liked mine so much that I bought additional ones for the rest of the family.</li>
            <li> What a great product to help me get organized!  I love the color and that the pockets on the sides are different sizes.  I filled the outside pockets with all of my hair products.  The middle section is large enough for my hair dryer and flat iron.  Every morning, I just pull this caddy from under my sink and go to work! It has saved me a lot of time; I love that I don&#x27;t have to rummage through drawers or under the cabinet to find what I need.&lt;br /&gt;I do wish it had more than one carrying handle to balance it out and make it a little more sturdy. If I were moving around with it more I would be concerned.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great product and I am certainly glad I bought it. I just might have to buy another later on for another task :)</li>
            <li> This is part of a &amp;#34;Dorm Room Emergency Supplies&amp;#34; box that I&#x27;m packing for my grandson. I haven&#x27;t used it; but it looks great--generous size to accommodate regular sized bottles of shower gel, shampoo, shaving cream, etc.--and I wish something like this had been available when I was at college. ...I can&#x27;t tell you how many times I &amp;#34;forgot my shampoo, or washcloth, or whatever&amp;#34; in the shower. Of course, when I realized--like the next day--that I had left my something in the shower, it was too late; it was gone--again. Just think how great it would be to have everything you need in the shower in one place, in a single container, ready for a quick shower! I hope he&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> I got this today and i loved it. The size was amazing. Everthing i have for it fits in it perfectly and still have more room. I would recommend this product to everyone. Houseables did a great job and i want to thank them. :)</li>
            <li> This is a sturdy mesh bag for stuff you need to cart down the hall when you take a shower in shared quarters.  The side pockets are a couple of different sizes, to fit various bottles or brushes, etc.  interior bag very roomy.  What I liked about this one is it&#x27;s not as large as the collapsible model which seemed more suited for a trash can.  This one is a nice size.  You can tell by the picture how big it is looking at the things it has inside.  This is a very sturdy mesh so no holes will rip here.  Yet it is still very flexible so it rolls up compactly when you&#x27;ve emptied it.  Or if you just want to keep your wet bottles in it all the time, they quickly dry out.  The handle is padded and comfortable so it won&#x27;t hurt your hand when carrying it or more importantly, it won&#x27;t tear out the handle when you hang it over a shower faucet or bathroom/bedroom door, etc.  Nicely made.</li>
            <li> Love this caddy. Used it to bring toiletries to our beach vacation. I also used it to tote sunscreen and other goodies to the beach.</li>
            <li> Houseables&#x27;s customer service is fantastic! When I received my shower caddy, I noticed that the bottom was missing the padding shown in the picture (the bottom is just mesh). The seller issued a full refund. It&#x27;s not a huge problem though; I&#x27;m sure this caddy will still be perfect when I head to college!</li>
            <li> Will be an easier carrier for those college showers</li>
            <li> Meets my expectations. Very sturdy and dries easily. Would recommend it for anyone living in a dorm.</li>
            <li> Will hold all of my toiletries and more. Larger than expected. Excellent for my travels.</li>
            <li> It is big enough for college student! Shipping is really fast. Good price Good product.</li>
            <li> The product is perfect, very roomy, waterproof and breathable, and easy to carry. The only reason why I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is because it STINKS. My boyfriend says it&#x27;s just the smell of pure rubber, but I&#x27;ve washed it and soaked it in perfume and nothing.</li>
            <li> Getting ready for summer camp for the kids. This will work great to carry what he needs to the shower. Just the right size to fit what the need, a little bit bigger than the one I purchased for the girls.  The one strap is longer. The color is great for my son. The mesh bottom allows for quick drying.</li>
            <li> Very Nice lots of room and compartments for all your shower needs</li>
            <li> Simple, yet efficient design with plenty of space and compartments. Durable material that&#x27;s easy to clean and keep dry!</li>
            <li> Great for college or dorms. Is very sturdy and holds up nicely. Also has lots of space and pockets for everything you could possibly fit in it.</li>
            <li> Sending my son off to college for the first time and told he needed a shower caddy. This was the perfect item and at a great price!</li>
            <li> Great for college/camp!</li>
            <li> I received this caddy extremely quickly, way faster than I anticipated.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this because I need it for college. I can literally put everything I need (soap, deodorant, toothbrush, etc.) in this bag and STILL have room. :)  Love it!</li>
            <li> Just as I pictured, even bigger too! Holds a lot! Perfect for dorm life.</li>
            <li> Purchased one for myself and love it so ordered another for my daughter when she goes to the gym and pool. Thought this one was the same as mine but it was bigger and holds a lot more</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty big. Well-made, very tough, stands up to my cats, including the one who is hellbent on destroying everything I own. I imagine I&#x27;d be hard pressed to put a tear in the material.</li>
            <li> I bought this caddy for College and so far it is durable, and extremely spacious for everything I need to Bring to the shower with me. Definitely a must buy !!</li>
            <li> Very handy for the bathroom or bedroom and a very good price</li>
            <li> good quality, really big, can hold everything and anything you need to take to the bathroom. I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> I recently ordered 2 of the exact same bags. When I received them I was greatly disappointed. One of the two bags were stitched together horribly. The strap to carry it was extremely twisted. Therefore I have to take it apart and it myself. Wish I would have went into a store to purchase instead of receiving a shot type product. On a good note the seller was very understanding and issued a full refund.</li>
