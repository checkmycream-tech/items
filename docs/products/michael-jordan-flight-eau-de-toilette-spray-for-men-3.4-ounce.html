            <li>This is one of the best.</li>
            <li>So, out of the three Jordan&#x27;s I&#x27;ve tried here is my list from best to good.</li>
            <li>All in all I find that flight smells great all the way through</li>
            <li>it smells great</li>
            <li>smells great, great price</li>
            <li>IM SO HAPPY.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend buying the orginal one instead of this, this is great and all</li>
            <li>i love this cologne!!</li>
            <li>Good stuff</li>
            <li>This was for a gift and they loved it</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells good, with a pinch of woody musk.&lt;br /&gt;Relatively inexpensive for 3.4oz</li>
            <li>killer good price and</li>
            <li>Flight smells that good.</li>
            <li>&quot; I still purposely aim for that response from her, and it makes me feel really, REALLY good about my combinations with both colognes and oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Flight smells that good.</li>
            <li>&quot; I still purposely aim for that response from her, and it makes me feel really, REALLY good about my combinations with both colognes and oils.    </li>
            <li>My husband and I love this stuff, it smells so good and lasts all day!</li>
            <li>/&gt;That was my rabbit trail, but fellas, and even for the ladies reading this: do it for yourself or ladies, if do it for him, he will be much more than happy</li>
            <li>And fellas, if you buy it, she will be much more than happy</li>
            <li>That was my rabbit trail, but fellas, and even for the ladies reading this: do it for yourself or ladies, if do it for him, he will be much more than happy</li>
            <li>And fellas, if you buy it, she will be much more than happy</li>
            <li>the funtion is good, the design is nice, and the quality excelent</li>
            <li>I bought this for my boyfriend and it smells amazing.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing for like 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Flight starts off with a rather nice combination of bergamot and orange blossom.</li>
            <li>i ordered a cologne that I liked but what I got was not</li>
            <li>MY NEW BEST FRIEND.</li>
            <li>He always gets compliments when wearing this one--so he is getting noticed for smelling amazing. :)</li>
            <li>Scent is okay, price is very fair, and the cologne container is pretty cool looking and</li>
            <li>, I think I&#x27;m more on the \\&quot;buy again\\&quot; side now.</li>
            <li>Once Flight settles on the skin for a while, it becomes more woodsy and spicy as the sage, pepper and cedar appear.</li>
            <li>/&gt;As for when to wear Flight, I would say flight is more for spring/summer than fall/winter</li>
            <li>they&#x27;d probably better options.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a cologne that does well in numerous scenarious, smells wonderful, and won&#x27;t burn a hole in your pocket</li>
            <li>they&#x27;d probably better options.    </li>
            <li>I  love this product because my husband is a Michael Jordan fan</li>
            <li>Glad</li>
            <li>IM SURE MY BOYFRIEND WILL BE ALSO.  </li>
            <li>I bought this since my husband collects Jordan sneakers and thought it would be cute to have Jordan cologne to match.</li>
            <li>I love the way my husband smells when he sprays it.</li>
            <li>I Love It</li>
            <li>As I concur with most reviews, Legend is a scent for the fall, although it would be worn if I was going out for the evening with my wife.</li>
            <li>More so with oils, my wife will ask me, \\&quot;Mmmmm.</li>
            <li>More so with oils, my wife will ask me, \\&quot;Mmmmm.</li>
            <li>My husband and I both love him to wear the MJ colognes.</li>
            <li>Big bottle, smells great!</li>
            <li>It smelled really good, and at the time it was the first time I had heard of a unisex scent.</li>
            <li>The bergamot and organge blossom are more or less equally potent to my nose and go together wonderfully.</li>
            <li>Michael Jordan by MJ first came out, because it was from MJ, and being that there was facets of him that I truly added to my own mystique</li>
            <li>I am truly just a loyal customer since the business was opened out a shoebox in 1998, and cologne cannot compete with the longevity that the scent from oils are able to maintain for hours.</li>
            <li>I cant believe I got it this cheap.  </li>
            <li>Amazon offers a good price on this item.</li>
            <li>Flight does an amazing job with bringing out just the right amount of each note at the right time.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a cologne that does well in numerous scenarious, smells wonderful, and won&#x27;t burn a hole in your pocket, I highly recommend Flight.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t match up against the original.</li>
            <li>This smells so good, better than the other MJ lines..</li>
            <li>The main reason: I prefer to wear the oils of Smell Goods 1998, whose lovely offerings you can find at [...].</li>
            <li>but the product was received quickly as advertised.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not much for cologne, but this scent is AMAZING!</li>
            <li>There is a saving grace in that Flight is pretty cheap</li>
            <li>There is a saving grace in that Flight is pretty cheap</li>
            <li>Very well priced!!</li>
            <li>So, with the purchase of Legend came the suggestion of Flight and again, the reviews were more than positive so since it did not cost much, I decided to try it, as well.</li>
            <li>So, with the purchase of Legend came the suggestion of Flight and again, the reviews were more than positive so since it did not cost much, I decided to try it, as well.</li>
            <li>it Smells very similar to Jean Paul Gaultier &amp;#34;Le Male&amp;#34;, which is an amazing scent.</li>
            <li>If you like refined spicy, yet fresh fragrances Flight will not disappoint.&lt;br</li>
            <li>bottle is pretty cool too.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried any of the others, but certainly want to pick up his original 23 Cologne and Jordan Legend as I hear they are both fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has been a mighty, MIGHTY, MIGHTY, long time since I even thought about purchasing cologne.</li>
            <li>Was shipped right of way and immediately received.</li>
            <li>My Favorite plan and simple.</li>
            <li>If so, pretty neat.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a sporty bottle but is still pretty refined looking.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not expensive at all</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>My husband really likes this fragrance.</li>
            <li>So Much I&#x27;m Going To Buy It</li>
            <li>However, I found an article that mentioned Legend by Michael Jordan and decided to try since the reviews were mainly very favorable.</li>
            <li>One of them said, \\&quot;Somebody smells real good.\\</li>
            <li>and I really did not keep up with that aspect of him much after that.</li>
            <li>Did not like the scent that much</li>
            <li>effect of fragrance dies down very quickly after 1 hour.</li>
            <li>but if you have other colognes in your collection meant for more romantic occasions</li>
            <li>I would say four or so hours before it disappears a bit which is pretty short.</li>
            <li>I would say four or so hours before it disappears a bit which is pretty short.</li>
            <li>Apparently the rubber sides are supposed to be his famous Air Jordan sneakers (makes it hard to drop if that counts for anyone, haha).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s masculine, sporty, but classy in one package which you don&#x27;t find too, too often in colognes.</li>
            <li>Smells a little like the original Jordan cologne.</li>
            <li>, I highly recommend Flight.ore romantic occasions</li>
            <li>This is an elegant, grown-man (not to be confused with old man) scent.</li>
            <li>It can kind of be strong for the first few minutes, but it starts to slowly die down quicker than other colognes I&#x27;ve tried in the same price bracket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t need too much of it so a bottle lasts a while and the scent is long lasting - no need to refresh every hour.</li>
            <li>Not sure how it smells, but the bottle is cool.</li>
            <li>After some time on the skin, I smell the sage and cedar in the middle notes and find the amber to be the most prominent of the base notes.</li>
            <li>Oddly enough, shortly before this happened, while I was a student at UNC Charlotte, maybe this was early &#x27;97, CK One had just been released.</li>
            <li>Does down so fast.</li>

            <li> No problem, until I was in the elevator with 4 other young women.</li>
            <li> Since 2004, I had limited myself to 4 colognes, and I will and would wear two scents at a time because when I asked a lady working for Cigna back in 1997 what scent she was wearing, she said, \\&quot;It&#x27;s 2 different scents</li>
            <li> feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> As I think about it, 3 years a friend from childhood told me a guy on YouTube was showing off his Creed collection and mentioned MJ wore a particular scent from Creed, which caused my friend to buy it, bring it to my home, and while it is so expensive, Creed might be the only time I would ever consider investing that much money into cologne.</li>

            <li> but I will definitely say this cologne COULD be worn in the fall/winter and not be too out of place to the average folk</li>
            <li> I have been known to bring my cologne with me if it&#x27;s a small enough bottle and re-apply all ninja-like.</li>

            <li> I thought the smell last longer</li>
            <li> got it for my boyfriend and he loves it</li>
            <li> My husband and I love this stuff, it smells so good and lasts all day! I insist he sprays it on everything he wears!</li>
            <li> My Favorite plan and simple.</li>
            <li> Scent is okay, price is very fair, and the cologne container is pretty cool looking and feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell doesn&#x27;t last long. It can kind of be strong for the first few minutes, but it starts to slowly die down quicker than other colognes I&#x27;ve tried in the same price bracket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if I would purchase it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: After using it for about a week, I decided to increase the rating from 3/5 to 4/5. The scent is starting to grow on me and I&#x27;m getting complements. Good stuff, I think I&#x27;m more on the \\&quot;buy again\\&quot; side now.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my nephew and he loves the bottle.  Not sure how it smells, but the bottle is cool.</li>
            <li> Michael Jordan&#x27;s Flight is the fifth of the Michael Jordan&#x27;s fragrance line. I haven&#x27;t tried any of the others, but certainly want to pick up his original 23 Cologne and Jordan Legend as I hear they are both fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flight starts off with a rather nice combination of bergamot and orange blossom. Once Flight settles on the skin for a while, it becomes more woodsy and spicy as the sage, pepper and cedar appear. The base notes for this fragrance amber, vetiver and sea moss. Flight does an amazing job with bringing out just the right amount of each note at the right time. The bergamot and organge blossom are more or less equally potent to my nose and go together wonderfully. After some time on the skin, I smell the sage and cedar in the middle notes and find the amber to be the most prominent of the base notes. All in all I find that flight smells great all the way through, there&#x27;s no \\&quot;so-so\\&quot; initial smell before it dries on the skin like some colognes have. If you like refined spicy, yet fresh fragrances Flight will not disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is pretty cool too. Apparently the rubber sides are supposed to be his famous Air Jordan sneakers (makes it hard to drop if that counts for anyone, haha). If so, pretty neat. It&#x27;s a sporty bottle but is still pretty refined looking. I mean in the end it&#x27;s a bottle. If you&#x27;re buying a cologne to tote around the bottle around your neck then I would vouch something&#x27;s wrong there. I have no troubles with the spritzer and the cap stays on securely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for when to wear Flight, I would say flight is more for spring/summer than fall/winter but I will definitely say this cologne COULD be worn in the fall/winter and not be too out of place to the average folk (I&#x27;m no fragrance connisuer either). It&#x27;s masculine, sporty, but classy in one package which you don&#x27;t find too, too often in colognes. This could work for business, casual settings, even a date if you so desired but if you have other colognes in your collection meant for more romantic occasions they&#x27;d probably better options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flight, unfortunately, doesn&#x27;t last too long. I would say four or so hours before it disappears a bit which is pretty short. So spray just before you head out the door. There is a saving grace in that Flight is pretty cheap so there&#x27;s no need to be too conservative with re-application. I have been known to bring my cologne with me if it&#x27;s a small enough bottle and re-apply all ninja-like. If you&#x27;re looking for a cologne that does well in numerous scenarious, smells wonderful, and won&#x27;t burn a hole in your pocket, I highly recommend Flight.ore romantic occasions they&#x27;d probably better options.

            <li> I  love this product because my husband is a Michael Jordan fan it smells great and it&#x27;s not expensive at all</li>
            <li> i ordered a cologne that I liked but what I got was not</li>
            <li> My boyfriend wears this and I&#x27;m addicted to it!</li>
            <li> My husband really likes this fragrance. I gave it to him as a gift three years ago and have been ordering it for him ever since.  Amazon offers a good price on this item.</li>
            <li> This was for a gift and they loved it</li>
            <li> smells great, great price</li>
            <li> the funtion is good, the design is nice, and the quality excelent</li>
            <li> i love this cologne!!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend. I&#x27;m not much for cologne, but this scent is AMAZING! Glad I got it!</li>
            <li> I bought this item after extensive search and I have been using this for the past 1 month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;It smells good, with a pinch of woody musk.&lt;br /&gt;Relatively inexpensive for 3.4oz bottle.&lt;br /&gt;The container looks sporty and fancy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;It only lasts for 3 hours max.&lt;br /&gt;The effect of fragrance dies down very quickly after 1 hour.</li>
            <li> This smells so good, better than the other MJ lines..scent lasts all day...killer good price and who doesn&#x27;t like anything with MJ&#x27;s name on it? Downside? Nada</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly, like the scent, but wish it lasted longer</li>
            <li> best price ever!  I cant believe I got it this cheap.  IM SO HAPPY.  IM SURE MY BOYFRIEND WILL BE ALSO.  THANK U AMAZON.  MY NEW BEST FRIEND. ;)</li>
            <li> I bought this since my husband collects Jordan sneakers and thought it would be cute to have Jordan cologne to match. This is not an overpowering Axe-like cologne. This is an elegant, grown-man (not to be confused with old man) scent. I love the way my husband smells when he sprays it. Don&#x27;t need too much of it so a bottle lasts a while and the scent is long lasting - no need to refresh every hour. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I Love It So Much I&#x27;m Going To Buy It Again This Is A Must Buy One The Best By Michael Jordan</li>
            <li> It has been a mighty, MIGHTY, MIGHTY, long time since I even thought about purchasing cologne. The main reason: I prefer to wear the oils of Smell Goods 1998, whose lovely offerings you can find at [...]. I am truly just a loyal customer since the business was opened out a shoebox in 1998, and cologne cannot compete with the longevity that the scent from oils are able to maintain for hours. However, I found an article that mentioned Legend by Michael Jordan and decided to try since the reviews were mainly very favorable. As I concur with most reviews, Legend is a scent for the fall, although it would be worn if I was going out for the evening with my wife. Since 2004, I had limited myself to 4 colognes, and I will and would wear two scents at a time because when I asked a lady working for Cigna back in 1997 what scent she was wearing, she said, \\&quot;It&#x27;s 2 different scents so no one will know what it is.\\&quot; From that day forward, I started doing the same thing with my colognes. Oddly enough, shortly before this happened, while I was a student at UNC Charlotte, maybe this was early &#x27;97, CK One had just been released. It smelled really good, and at the time it was the first time I had heard of a unisex scent. No problem, until I was in the elevator with 4 other young women. One of them said, \\&quot;Somebody smells real good.\\&quot; Before I could open my mouth, another girl said, \\&quot;I&#x27;m wearing CK One.\\&quot; I never wore it again, and threw it away as soon as I got back to my room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Michael Jordan by MJ first came out, because it was from MJ, and being that there was facets of him that I truly added to my own mystique, I thought it smelled wonderful. But with growth, the fad of the moment vaporized just like the scent and I really did not keep up with that aspect of him much after that. That is, until Jordan by Michael was made and it is now 1 of the 4 scents; well, 5 colognes now, that I have in rotation. 23 never hooked me so I searched elsewhere after that one. The only thing about Jordan by Michael is that when I wear any type of clothing with his label, it is always one of the scents I will wear. So, with the purchase of Legend came the suggestion of Flight and again, the reviews were more than positive so since it did not cost much, I decided to try it, as well. Jordan by Michael is going to have a difficult time keeping its current position as my favorite: Flight smells that good. As I think about it, 3 years a friend from childhood told me a guy on YouTube was showing off his Creed collection and mentioned MJ wore a particular scent from Creed, which caused my friend to buy it, bring it to my home, and while it is so expensive, Creed might be the only time I would ever consider investing that much money into cologne. I realize now that that made me think Jordan had stopped making cologne, but he is still at it and he should be. More so with oils, my wife will ask me, \\&quot;Mmmmm. What are you wearing?\\&quot; I still purposely aim for that response from her, and it makes me feel really, REALLY good about my combinations with both colognes and oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was my rabbit trail, but fellas, and even for the ladies reading this: do it for yourself or ladies, if do it for him, he will be much more than happy you purchased this for him. And fellas, if you buy it, she will be much more than happy you did, too.&lt;br /&gt;~K.I.S.S~Jordan by Michael is that when I wear any type of clothing with his label, it is always one of the scents I will wear.

            <li> Did not like the scent that much but the product was received quickly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Awesome Product!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> My husband and I both love him to wear the MJ colognes. This is one of the best. He always gets compliments when wearing this one--so he is getting noticed for smelling amazing. :)</li>
            <li> Bought this for my grown son.  He loves it!  Would totally recommend for any man. Was shipped right of way and immediately received.</li>
            <li> Big bottle, smells great! My boyfriend loves it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and it smells amazing. Very well priced!!</li>
            <li> Does down so fast. It smells amazing for like 5 minutes. It&#x27;s like a tease.</li>
            <li> Smells a little like the original Jordan cologne. I&#x27;d recommend buying the orginal one instead of this, this is great and all but it doesn&#x27;t match up against the original. Also, I purchased the Legend: Michael Jordan Cologne and it Smells very similar to Jean Paul Gaultier &amp;#34;Le Male&amp;#34;, which is an amazing scent. So, out of the three Jordan&#x27;s I&#x27;ve tried here is my list from best to good. Orginal MJ, Flight, Legend</li>
