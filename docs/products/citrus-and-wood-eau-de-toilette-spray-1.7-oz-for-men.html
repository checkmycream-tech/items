            <li>AWESOME fragrance...</li>
            <li>but this fragrance starts and finishes my day impressively.</li>
            <li>The Yardley Citrus and Wood line has a wonderful earthy scent.  </li>
            <li>My husband smells good!!!</li>
            <li>Its just great!</li>
            <li>A really great buy!</li>
            <li>very good choice for men.</li>
            <li>Product is legit and smells great.</li>
            <li>GREAT fragrance for the price.  </li>
            <li>My father love is it!!</li>
            <li>Quite nice!</li>
            <li>Still a good EDT without the TDH price tag, and without the longevity.</li>
            <li>Has a good mix of woodsy goodness and citrus.</li>
            <li>Exceptional.</li>
            <li>In my search for a good men&#x27;s cologne; I found this Yardley fragrance to be superior to many of the most aggressively marketed alternatives.</li>
            <li>so many compliments...</li>
            <li>Smells ok but it doesn&#x27;t hold on the sking or cloth not even for a minute.</li>
            <li>Love this fragance, also my father.</li>
            <li>Fresh &amp; woody very nice light scent.</li>
            <li>Its high quality and its box looks great in any bathroom</li>
            <li>Not overpowering and has very good lasting power.</li>
            <li>Very crisp clean, light citrus and mellow coniferous piney scent.  </li>
            <li>Because it was such a good deal</li>
            <li>I often layer it with TdH, though neither is super long-lasting.</li>
            <li>Nice fragrance with longivity and only 12.50 pounds price!</li>
            <li>We are So glad to have found it here, as it is nowhere in our local retail area.</li>
            <li>Smells pretty much exactly like Terre D&#x27;Hermes, which is why I bought it.  </li>
            <li>The scent does not seem to last more than two hours, in my experience.&lt;br /&gt;Although for this price, reapplying is not an unreasonable solution.</li>
            <li>Bought this as a valentines present for my boyfriend, who isn&#x27;t much of a fragrance person, but this scent is so mild and earthy that I think he&#x27;ll enjoy it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like it - too musky</li>
            <li>But I was wrong, nice strong aroma and light and lasting as well.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wear it all the time, but there are certain occasions I will wear it... and with a big smile...</li>
            <li>Reminiscent of Terre de Hermes, without the ISO E Super.</li>
            <li>Yardley was probably the first moderate priced cologne I owned when I was a teen.&lt;br /&gt;Liked it then like it now.&lt;br /&gt;Woodsy type scent without smelling piney.&lt;br /&gt;Light, without being feminine, though may drive your female counterpart wild, or other half.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a big cologne person, but this is pleasant.</li>
            <li>This new male fragrance from yardley is a future success!</li>
            <li>like a strange new dresser drawer piece of furiture.</li>
            <li>Think 70&#x27;s or 80&#x27;s powerhouse scent toned down quite a bit.. and actually wearable for us modern guys under 40..</li>

            <li> the scent is long gone</li>
            <li> Well it opens with a sharp burst of piney lemon elemi.</li>
            <li> As far as I am concerned,a big Fail from Yardley.</li>
            <li> The woodsy smell, which is not pleasant, is overpowering in the beginning, and that is cause for hope that it will tone down and last for some time.  </li>
            <li> for a mere 8 bucks, which is a total steal.  </li>
            <li> and I won&#x27;t ever use it, at least not around my girlfriend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s driving me crazy.</li>
            <li> bad choice will never buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Received on time. Product is legit and smells great. Because it was such a good deal I though maybe it would be low quality. But I was wrong, nice strong aroma and light and lasting as well.</li>
            <li> This new male fragrance from yardley is a future success! Nice fragrance with longivity and only 12.50 pounds price! very good choice for men.</li>
            <li> Well it opens with a sharp burst of piney lemon elemi. like a strange new dresser drawer piece of furiture. That&#x27;s what you get. I&#x27;ve smelled this before some where and can&#x27;t place it. It&#x27;s driving me crazy. Like medicine. I will look upon this bottle in my collection with fear and apprehension every time I see it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oct&lt;br /&gt; 11&lt;br /&gt; 2011</li>
            <li> Very crisp clean, light citrus and mellow coniferous piney scent.  Think 70&#x27;s or 80&#x27;s powerhouse scent toned down quite a bit.. and actually wearable for us modern guys under 40.. haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found a 50 ml. for a mere 8 bucks, which is a total steal.  Well made, gentlemanly, and proper.  I can&#x27;t wear it all the time, but there are certain occasions I will wear it... and with a big smile...</li>
            <li> The cologne does not hold its scent . By the time you get dressed and put your clothes on and get out to your car the scent is long gone bad choice will never buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;m1djr00</li>
            <li> AWESOME fragrance...so many compliments...5 Stars*****&lt;br /&gt;Great shipping too!</li>
            <li> In my search for a good men&#x27;s cologne; I found this Yardley fragrance to be superior to many of the most aggressively marketed alternatives. I&#x27;m no expert on the particulars...but this fragrance starts and finishes my day impressively.</li>
            <li> A Tere D&#x27; Hermes knock off? Or aspiring contender. Similar to, but does not have the middle notes as Tere D&#x27; Hermes. Still a good EDT without the TDH price tag, and without the longevity. But would recommend.</li>
            <li> Smells ok but it doesn&#x27;t hold on the sking or cloth not even for a minute.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like it - too musky and I won&#x27;t ever use it, at least not around my girlfriend.</li>
            <li> My dad loves Yardley, and this version was not the exception. Fresh &amp; woody very nice light scent. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> We found &amp; tried this product on a whim then could not find it anywhere again! On a chance, we searched Amazon and there it was. The Yardley Citrus and Wood line has a wonderful earthy scent.  We are So glad to have found it here, as it is nowhere in our local retail area. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Quite nice! Reminiscent of Terre de Hermes, without the ISO E Super. Thus, it&#x27;s shorter lasting. I often layer it with TdH, though neither is super long-lasting.</li>
            <li> Yardley was probably the first moderate priced cologne I owned when I was a teen.&lt;br /&gt;Liked it then like it now.&lt;br /&gt;Woodsy type scent without smelling piney.&lt;br /&gt;Light, without being feminine, though may drive your female counterpart wild, or other half.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a big cologne person, but this is pleasant.</li>
            <li> My husband smells good!!!</li>
            <li> This cologne is just what I need for my dialy activities. Its high quality and its box looks great in any bathroom</li>
            <li> My father love is it!!</li>
            <li> Has a good mix of woodsy goodness and citrus. Not overpowering and has very good lasting power. I have had a lot of compliments while wearing it.</li>
            <li> Smells pretty much exactly like Terre D&#x27;Hermes, which is why I bought it.  The scent does not seem to last more than two hours, in my experience.&lt;br /&gt;Although for this price, reapplying is not an unreasonable solution.</li>
            <li> Love this fragance, also my father. Its just great!</li>
            <li> The woodsy smell, which is not pleasant, is overpowering in the beginning, and that is cause for hope that it will tone down and last for some time.  Sadly, no such luck- it&#x27;s all gone in an hour.  As far as I am concerned,a big Fail from Yardley.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a valentines present for my boyfriend, who isn&#x27;t much of a fragrance person, but this scent is so mild and earthy that I think he&#x27;ll enjoy it. I tried it on myself over thirteen hours ago, but I can still smell it on my wrists. A really great buy!</li>
            <li> GREAT fragrance for the price.  Exceptional.</li>
