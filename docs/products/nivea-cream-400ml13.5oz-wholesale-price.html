    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Excellent service and price.  </li>
            <li>Ironically, the cheapest cream was the one that worked the best!  </li>
            <li>Good Stuff!</li>
            <li>For the price of $9 for 400ml, this is still a great buy.</li>
            <li>but as I said, it&#x27;s great as a makeup remover.</li>
            <li>It is a great product by Nivea</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t burn your eyes at all, and smells nice to boot!  </li>
            <li>and I got a good deal on Amazon.</li>
            <li>The merchandise is good.</li>
            <li>Love the size, loved the price</li>
            <li>This can of cream is huge!  </li>
            <li>But this one is better then the Mexico one.    </li>
            <li>it smells better    3.</li>
            <li>top of the line of course..</li>
            <li>I love this cream for my aging skin.</li>
            <li>and I love the way it smells (reminds me of my mom).  </li>
            <li>and I love this cream.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s think and greasy, so eyeliner and mascara come off easily.  </li>
            <li>This product is a great buy and has been apparently rumored to be the contents of the La Mer cream which costs about 200 dollars..</li>
            <li>but my skin has been smooth and easy to apply makeup to</li>
            <li>The product was well packaged, price is great for this authentic German Nivea whose formulation &amp; results are far better to the version produced for Nivea in the US.  </li>
            <li>Why not stick to the original make with some fidelity?</li>
            <li>so for the price it was good, but i still and looking for the German one.</li>
            <li>I have been using this cream for many years now, it helps keep the skin moisturized and soft</li>
            <li>Very reasonably priced....</li>
            <li>It is pretty effective and I will buy huge vats of it because apparently there is a difference between German made or Thai made.</li>
            <li>I love this cream and that should be enough.</li>
            <li>Nivea is thick, smells so nice, rubs into my skin quickly, and within minutes makes my Psoriasis pretty</li>
            <li>Granted I have not suffered from breakouts maybe due to my good hygeine or genes but my skin really does dry up quite fast.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway to cut to the chase this cream is very very effective, I would recommend it to older people like nearing 30&#x27;s or something and above because it is pretty thick.</li>
            <li>This mini container is too small a quantity, but handy in the car if you can get the lid off while driving.</li>
            <li>If you continue to offer me this German made Nivea I&#x27;ll be loyal for life..</li>
            <li>I went through loads of different face creams trying to make it go away quickly.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I use this everyday and love it.  </li>
            <li>It is just like the product we get in Germany and now that I live in the US</li>
            <li>I have been told I will be prone to wrinkles, but the main reason why I have searched high and low for a good moisturizer was that my dry facial skin would hurt a little bit..</li>
            <li>Skin feels soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>Nivea products in themselves do really well for those with dry to normal skin.</li>
            <li>It was the only thing that almost instantly fixed my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I use it after a shower to help keep my face from getting dry as I live up north and its winter.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product really hoping it was the German one, as some other reviewers have mentioned.  </li>

            <li> roughly 200x more expensive.</li>
            <li> I just returned to Amazon two bottles of their cloying ineffectual &#x27;oil of olay&#x27; lotion and just had no idea what to buy for my scaling dry red skin</li>
            <li> I also got the German one, which seems to be a point of concern when reading the other reviews.</li>
            <li> I have a really dry face, I have no idea</li>
            <li> the ones that I bought helped my dry skin a lot.</li>
            <li> I have some dry patches on my chin and stuff</li>
            <li> A little to think to use as a facial cream,</li>
            <li> As expected, I have known this cream for decades.</li>
            <li> Delivery came as expected.</li>
            <li> but they were pretty expensive..</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> You can buy them at target, ulta, walgreens, and probably any other drugstore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product got gooey and messy inside the box it arrived in.   </li>
            <li> It is soupy and not fit to be called creme.</li>
            <li> , I purchased Nivea in the past but the walmart brand made in Mexico I am sorry but IT ISN&#x27;T THE SAME THING.</li>
            <li> The Fa aimed to the American market is again a silly ineffectual product.</li>
            <li> btw this one is made in Asia not sure if it matters though.</li>
            <li> I thought it was small one</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s a small tin).  </li>
            <li> Requiring a specific number of words for a review is silly.  </li>
            <li> Took me a few times to get used to the thick consistency of this creme, but it does wonders!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick</li>
            <li> Although the packaging was not good.</li>
            <li> Over these past few days I&#x27;ve gotten chapped cheeks from the cold weather</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never experienced anything like this before.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Wasn&#x27;t disappointed with this order.</li>
            <li> It was horrible and painful.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very reasonably priced....I have been using this cream for many years now, it helps keep the skin moisturized and soft</li>
            <li> My grandmother use to have this in her medicine cabinet. I was looking for something for my girlfriend when I came across it. I use it after a shower to help keep my face from getting dry as I live up north and its winter. Good Stuff!</li>
            <li> Although the packaging was not good. The product got gooey and messy inside the box it arrived in.   Nivea products in themselves do really well for those with dry to normal skin. Skin feels soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product really hoping it was the German one, as some other reviewers have mentioned.  However, I received the Singapore/Thailand/Malaysia/Philippines/Hong Kong version.  For the price of $9 for 400ml, this is still a great buy.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream thinking it was the German one, but i got the one from Thailand. But when i looked back they don&#x27;t say that this one is the German one, so i wasn&#x27;t to upset. But this one is better then the Mexico one.    1. it is thicker    2. it smells better    3. it was cheaper    so for the price it was good, but i still and looking for the German one.</li>
            <li> Excellent service and price.  I used to have to wait for a family member to go to Germany and stock up, and it started to become a hassle.  The product was well packaged, price is great for this authentic German Nivea whose formulation &amp; results are far better to the version produced for Nivea in the US.  There is no comparison between the two creams, I will be a customer for life now that I have an affordable reliable source!</li>
            <li> I have a really dry face, I have no idea why. Granted I have not suffered from breakouts maybe due to my good hygeine or genes but my skin really does dry up quite fast. I have been told I will be prone to wrinkles, but the main reason why I have searched high and low for a good moisturizer was that my dry facial skin would hurt a little bit..I would try putting water or petroleum jelly but it didn&#x27;t help. I thought I found my miracle in Aveeno products but they were pretty expensive..top of the line of course..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway to cut to the chase this cream is very very effective, I would recommend it to older people like nearing 30&#x27;s or something and above because it is pretty thick. Use it every time you finished showering or washing your face also before going to sleep. It is pretty effective and I will buy huge vats of it because apparently there is a difference between German made or Thai made. I don&#x27;t know. All I can say the ones that I bought helped my dry skin a lot. I have some dry patches on my chin and stuff but my skin has been smooth and easy to apply makeup to ever since I tried Nivea cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use it on your face especially the forehead as well as the neck. This product is a great buy and has been apparently rumored to be the contents of the La Mer cream which costs about 200 dollars..roughly 200x more expensive.</li>
            <li> Took me a few times to get used to the thick consistency of this creme, but it does wonders! A little goes a long way! This size tin has lasted me over a year!</li>
            <li> If you continue to offer me this German made Nivea I&#x27;ll be loyal for life.. I just returned to Amazon two bottles of their cloying ineffectual &#x27;oil of olay&#x27; lotion and just had no idea what to buy for my scaling dry red skin, I purchased Nivea in the past but the walmart brand made in Mexico I am sorry but IT ISN&#x27;T THE SAME THING. It is soupy and not fit to be called creme. I only wish I can also find German made Fa. The Fa aimed to the American market is again a silly ineffectual product. I don&#x27;t get it? Why not stick to the original make with some fidelity?</li>
            <li> This can of cream is huge!  I love this cream for my aging skin. This cream has helped diminish aging wrinkles around my mouth and chin.</li>
            <li> As expected, I have known this cream for decades. btw this one is made in Asia not sure if it matters though.</li>
            <li> I have been using this since childhood. My mother swore by it. It is just like the product we get in Germany and now that I live in the US I appreciate getting it through Amazon. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have used this facial cream to remove make up for over 10 years.  It&#x27;s think and greasy, so eyeliner and mascara come off easily.  It doesn&#x27;t burn your eyes at all, and smells nice to boot!  A little to think to use as a facial cream, but as I said, it&#x27;s great as a makeup remover.</li>
            <li> This mini container is too small a quantity, but handy in the car if you can get the lid off while driving.</li>
            <li> I have lived with using Nivea all my life.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve seen &#x27;My Big Fat Greek Wedding&#x27;, you know the father who thinks Windex and cure everything? This is my mother with Nivea.&lt;br /&gt;Did you get a cut? Put Nivea. Did you get a bruise? Put Nivea. Did both your legs get chopped off? Put some Nivea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have Psoriasis and need some way to keep my skin moisturized. Nivea is thick, smells so nice, rubs into my skin quickly, and within minutes makes my Psoriasis pretty unnoticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wasn&#x27;t disappointed with this order. I also got the German one, which seems to be a point of concern when reading the other reviews.</li>
            <li> It is a great product by Nivea and I got a good deal on Amazon. Thanx to Amazon. I thought it was small one but it a big bottle and I ordered 2 bottle.</li>
            <li> The merchandise is good. I would like to recommend to my friend and my family member to buy this product</li>
            <li> I grew up watching my mother wipe off her makeup with this and always thought to be a grown up was to have this on your vanity.  Over these past few days I&#x27;ve gotten chapped cheeks from the cold weather and I&#x27;ve never experienced anything like this before.  It was horrible and painful.  I went through loads of different face creams trying to make it go away quickly.  I grabbed this at ulta for $.97 (it&#x27;s a small tin).  It was the only thing that almost instantly fixed my sensitive skin.  It&#x27;s thick and I love the way it smells (reminds me of my mom).  Ironically, the cheapest cream was the one that worked the best!  A classic!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I have no idea what the difference is between the German, Mexican, or Asian versions of this cream are.  You can buy them at target, ulta, walgreens, and probably any other drugstore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LAST THING&lt;br /&gt; the ingredients listed on the back of the tin are: water, mineral oil, petrolatum, glycerin, microcrystalline wax, lanolin alocohol, paraffin, panthenol, magnesium sulfate, decyl ocleate, octyldodecanol, aluminum stearates, fragrance, citric acid, magnesium stearate, methylcholoroisothaizolinone, methylisothiazolinone.</li>
            <li> Requiring a specific number of words for a review is silly.  I love this cream and that should be enough.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday and love it.  Love the size, loved the price and I love this cream. Delivery came as expected.</li>
