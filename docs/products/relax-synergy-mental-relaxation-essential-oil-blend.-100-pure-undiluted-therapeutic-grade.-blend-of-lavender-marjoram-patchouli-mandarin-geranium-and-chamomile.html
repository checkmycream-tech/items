            <li>(in a good way).</li>
            <li>and I can tell these oils are good quality.</li>
            <li>It smells so good though, and that can be soothing.</li>
            <li>After a stressful or especially thoughtful day I put about 10 drops in a warm bath an let my tension melt away.</li>
            <li>Aroma was good but needed a lot to scent a room.  </li>
            <li>I does produce a relaxing atmosphere, We use it in an oil warmer and the smell is good also,  Even relaxes the dogs around here, Would recommend</li>
            <li>All are  good products.  </li>

            <li>It is a good blend for massage and body oil as well.</li>
            <li>I was a bit concerned about the patchouli, but  this is one of the BEST relaxing aromatherapy combinations I&#x27;ve smelled- clean, harmonious fragrance with no domineering notes,very soothing.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need but 3 to 5 drops and it burns nice and pleasant.</li>
            <li>Use it every day and have ordered more mixtures from this company&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;100% oil and smells great.</li>

            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>Just amazing.</li>
            <li>but this relax oil is amazing.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t girly at all - just a nice, herbal spa type of smell.</li>
            <li>I liked order, but when I searched ingredient, there are two toxic ingredients for dogs and cats.  </li>
            <li>This has a nice scent.  </li>
            <li>which I do not, but because (a) the description is honest about the contents and (b)</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>smells delicious and really helps me relax.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li>it&#x27;s still potent (in a good way)</li>
            <li>The product works nicely to help me sleep.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also impressed with the company that seems to have a real interest in my satisfaction.</li>
            <li>The blend is a menthol, minty kind of fragrance.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product to make my own bath fizz balls.  </li>
            <li>Nice and earthy.</li>
            <li>I begun building my own collection months ago with tea tree oil.  </li>
            <li>This mix smells incredible - very relaxing, hence the name.  </li>
            <li>I liked:)</li>
            <li>For a person with alot of activity in house sometimes this is a great value oil so far it is just what I wanted to try.thanks for good value</li>
            <li>Great product and reasonably priced!</li>
            <li>The scent isn&#x27;t overly powerful, and it is pleasant.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite blends--- i wear it as a perfume and get so many compliments on it</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t blow away by the scent, it gave me more of a headache</li>
            <li>Lavender is what I smell most, but the combination of oils is a prefect smell.  </li>

            <li>Love the smell of this blend.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Most of my oils are Plant Therapy now.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try to mix it with an oil that has more floral notes, in the hopes that will make it more palatable.</li>
            <li>Even my husband, who hates scents in the house, found this quite enjoyable.</li>
            <li>but It did relax me my pulse lowered after enjoying it for a bit.</li>
            <li>more isn&#x27;t better.</li>
            <li>But, I can&#x27;t wait to try more varieties.</li>
            <li>Better than taking a sleep aid</li>
            <li>I work as a massage therapist and my clients are pleased with this scent as well.</li>
            <li>Love this blend.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I had run out of the oil and just got two more bottles yesteday.  </li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>Instead, I find the Tranquil Synergy is better for me.  </li>

            <li>I love this blend.</li>
            <li>And, when she&#x27;s relaxed we make love.</li>
            <li>How could you top that :)</li>
            <li>I have been wearing patchouli for many years, and I like that it is the \\&quot;lingering\\&quot; scent as the lavender fades.</li>
            <li>Both of them love the smell.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and great scent.  </li>
            <li>I love this product .It</li>

            <li>Love this oil.  </li>
            <li>I must need more practice</li>

            <li>Love this formula.</li>

            <li>I recommend to everyone who needs a refreshing and relaxing scent in their bedroom.</li>
            <li>I used some in homemade bath salts and it was one of the most relaxing baths,&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have ordered more scents and plan to make bath salts and candles for holiday gifts.</li>
            <li>but I am still able to smell it.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Perfect blend, especially mixed with beeswax and Shea butter.  </li>
            <li>Everyone seemed very calm and relaxed on our trip and it didn&#x27;t make me sleepy while driving!</li>
            <li>Great oil, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Smells wonderful, just strong enough without being overpowering.</li>
            <li>I find this blend to be a perfect aroma to help me unwind from a long day at work.  </li>
            <li>This has a pleasant smell; however, caution in using too much or</li>
            <li>I have tried many oils, this is fabulous.  </li>
            <li>Love plant therapy, enjoy all their products.</li>
            <li>smell great, it also naturally repels fleas and ticks.</li>
            <li>My kids ask for this oil every night before bed, they are sleeping much better and fall asleep more quickly.</li>
            <li>Great quality long lasting oil and the price it great!</li>
            <li>The shipping is also very quick.</li>
            <li>not that sure, seems to be diluted and does not last, might purchase again as the price is great.</li>
            <li>The aroma is quite strong, so I mix a drop or two into almond oil.  </li>
            <li>The Relax is just a bit strong for me.</li>
            <li>It has a strong lavender element.</li>
            <li>it was not too strong.</li>
            <li>I do not feel that it is too strong, but others may.</li>
            <li>I am also 8 months pregnant and have not been able to sleep well through the night for a while.  </li>
            <li>Exceptional smell, highly concentrated.</li>
            <li>I used this oil so quickly because I loved it so much.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pure and the scent is amazing.</li>
            <li>This is a great essential oil blend!  </li>
            <li>I put a dab on my pillow case every few nights and have the best sleep ever - since I have been doing that.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough how happy my husband and I are with this EO.  </li>
            <li>The scent is light, not overpowering.</li>
            <li>I mixed it with coconut oil and it makes a great massage oil.</li>
            <li>This is a great essential oil.</li>
            <li>would suggest this blend to someone who wants to mix their own oil.  </li>
            <li>At first I felt the scent was too strong, but my students seem to be enjoying it.</li>
            <li>this brand is very reasonably priced and a very good quality essential oil...</li>
            <li>excellent essential oil, high quality.  </li>
            <li>It smells fantastic and clean.</li>
            <li>and they are equally rich in scent.  </li>
            <li>Probably wont buy any more &amp;#34;blends&amp;#34; online as I am pretty picky.</li>
            <li>This being said, I probably will purchase this oil again, despite my dissatisfaction with the dropper size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addendum to original review:  </li>
            <li>this oils have make me sleep for peaceful and more relax.</li>
            <li>Has a strong smell, exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>The essential oil blend had a concentrated but pleasant aroma.  </li>
            <li>This is a pleasant blend of oils for relaxation for the price, but, buyer, please beware that these oils pour out of the bottle briskly, so when you may only want 3-4 drops in your diffuser, you may end up with 10-12.</li>
            <li>I used around the house refreshing some dried eucalyptus, and I keep catching a wiff of the scents as it changes each day!  </li>
            <li>Following the example of another reviewer, we tried rubbing into feet at bedtime and it  almost guarantees a good night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
            <li>I really like the Tranquil much more.  </li>
            <li>although I can&#x27;t really tell if it made me relax, i sure fell asleep.</li>
            <li>I think because this one has sweet marjoram in it too.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent, very soothing, and it lasts quite a while</li>
            <li>It is very soothing and I love the lavendar/orange undertones of fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really have been enjoying this blend.</li>
            <li>This one, like others was good quality, we simply didn&#x27;t care for the smell of the blend.</li>
            <li>Love the smell it is really relaxing.</li>
            <li>I am a fan of patchouli, so I definitely loved that it had that great scent mixed in, without overpowering the other scents.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing that a scent can provoke such a strong reaction so quickly.  </li>
            <li>The remaining oils are ones I like, but I should have guessed that the lavender, being listed first, would be too strong for me.  </li>
            <li>Not exactly the aroma, I was looking for, but nevertheless it&#x27;s a great addition to my oils.</li>
            <li>give our clothes a clean fresh scent.</li>
            <li>I make lotions and use this particular oil the most.  </li>
            <li>I bought it mainly for the therapeutic benefit but have been pleased with the scent.</li>
            <li>The company that sent this to me was very fast and accurate.</li>
            <li>This is a lovely blend that reminds me of the fragrance that is ubiquitous at high end spas.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>More than a dab made the fragrance too strong, so Iwashed it off and tried a very tiny amount.  </li>
            <li>but it is Soooo very pleasant and rich with subtle undertones!</li>
            <li>Just fresh, and a bit herbal.  </li>
            <li>This scent is my favorite out of all my essentials oils so far.</li>
            <li>I used it before sleeping daily and I feel good ,gently drifting into sleep.</li>
            <li>I use this for my dogs in place of a calming collar, I just put several drops on their own collar,&lt;br /&gt;they</li>
            <li>I wanted to use a mixed oil instead so mixing my own.</li>
            <li>It kind of leaves your house (or in my case currently, the bathrooms) smelling like a spa - and what do you do at a spa, but relax!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to trying essential oils but want to share my use for this amazing stuff!  </li>
            <li>As with most of the other Plant Therapy items we are quite pleased.  </li>
            <li>Its very muted compared to &amp;#34;tranquil&amp;#34;, but very lovely, I would definitely say it sets a peaceful tone.</li>
            <li>Nice pure essential oils!</li>
            <li>This has the right consistency of each oil to make it just right, and it is, in my opinion one of the better brands I have purchased recently, especially for the price!</li>
            <li>That being said, we order Plant Therapy brand essential oils several times a year and they are of great quality.  </li>
            <li>We didn&#x27;t&#x27; care for this blend very much.  </li>
            <li>so I have to put it on my nightstand pretty close to my bed in order to smell it in the diffuser.</li>
            <li>but we both felt immediately peaceful.  </li>
            <li>Love the scent of this essential oil.  </li>
            <li>This is perfect for sprinkling a few drops in your bath after a long day or adding to a body scrub for a relaxing scent.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve finally gone through my first bottle and just ordered more.</li>
            <li>I bought a ton of essential oils and this is my favorite scent.  </li>
            <li>I guess that is the risk you take when ordering without testing first.</li>
            <li>I drop 3 drops on my pillow before going to sleep, and the aroma is soothing and so peaceful.</li>
            <li>I love this combination of essential oils.  </li>
            <li>Mixed a small amount of this with Nature&#x27;s Alchemy Grape seed Oil and it worked great!</li>
            <li>A very provocative fragrance!</li>
            <li>the oil is very relaxing, the smell is great, calming not overwhelming at all.</li>
            <li>This is my first experience in purchasing a synergy blend and is beyond my expectations.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little bit strong and more spicy than flowery.</li>
            <li>smell is pleasant but not extremely captivating as I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li>it is a good blend of essential oils to relax the human body and ease tension.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit strong, so I may just put a few drops into a misting bottle with a carrier oil, like Apricot kernel, which is very mild.</li>
            <li>At first I was taken back with how strong the smell is - but now that I&#x27;ve dabbed it in certain areas of my home, I actually really like it.  </li>
            <li>The dropper that comes in bottle is rather large.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that after taking a bath with a few drops of this oil, I fall asleep quickly , and have a deeper and a better quality sleep.  </li>
            <li>This particular oil is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>After a hard day at work it works good with my spa mist.will purchase this product again .</li>
            <li>It is very calming.</li>
            <li>Very soothing scent for the soaps and hand cream I made.</li>
            <li>I think the problem is that the pouring spout(?)  lets out too much oil at a time.</li>
            <li>Very relaxing.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast too.  </li>
            <li>Very soothing.</li>
            <li>This stuff is very relaxing as it says.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t use too much...</li>
            <li>the patchouli and lavender really come through in this blend</li>
            <li>they ship fast and are packaged well</li>
            <li>This really does the relaxing part.</li>
            <li>All together he slept seven hours, which is unusual for him.  </li>
            <li>I have since used in it a couple batches of body bitter and love the scent on my skin.  </li>
            <li>plus she smells great the entire next day...until it&#x27;s time for her next massage!  </li>
            <li>Both my sons, aged two and four, love it.</li>
            <li>But I absolutely recommend this oil blend.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell</li>
            <li>It smells divine and my husband loves it, he wants me to use it every night,</li>
            <li>It really does help me to sleep at night when I add it to my Humio humidifier.</li>
            <li>My wife likes this, but I think it smells very medicinal.</li>
            <li>Love the feeling of going to sleep without mental stress.</li>
            <li>The aromatics seem almost mesmerizing, giving a conscious awareness of a subdued blissfulness.</li>
            <li>Very versatile and high quality.</li>
            <li>pure essential because I thought it would be better since it was already mixed by expert hands.  </li>
            <li>I usually create my own relaxation blend using oils and a \\&quot;recipe\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>My 10 week old lab pup is pretty high energy.  </li>
            <li>I received my Relax Synergy essential oil quickly.</li>
            <li>and I would order this particular oil after it is all gone.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend particularly likes the fragrance, she says that it relaxes her.</li>
            <li>I put a little on my hot pack and when I warm it up it seems to fill up the entire room.  </li>
            <li>and I highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li>I believe the quality is high.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Its a high quality product for an affordable price.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Like the other plant therapy stuff, this is STRONG.  </li>
            <li>Just received it today, put a few drops on my wrist, and I love the combination of scents.</li>
            <li>I have been using essential oils for many years, and I usually purchase higher quality oils, at a higher price.</li>
            <li>Relax Synergy essential oil has a nice aroma to it that will help you wind down.</li>
            <li>It smells mostly of fine lavender with a hint of the other ingredients: marjoran, patchouli, mandarin, geranium &amp; chamomille.</li>
            <li>When they have the oil on, they go right to sleep and don&#x27;t wake up in the middle of the night either.  </li>
            <li>If I wake up during the night, I go right back to sleep.  </li>
            <li>I use this oil in my new H2EO diffuser in no time find myself unwinding and yawning.  </li>
            <li>They are really nice even though I have only used a few of them.  </li>
            <li>I really like this essential oil blend,  very relaxing.  </li>
            <li>i just leave it open next to my bed and just enjoy the peace.</li>
            <li>Given the cost of some of these oils individually they were very reasonable.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell like old hippies either!  </li>
            <li>old within minutes!</li>
            <li>This was my first experience with essential oils.  </li>
            <li>Careful pouring, drops come out quickly.</li>
            <li>I have incredibly sensitive skin~ VERY sensitive skin, so I used this cautiously without issue, thankfully.</li>
            <li>Much better than the typical drug store oils I can find locally.</li>
            <li>This essential oil is pure bliss.</li>
            <li>The only reason I&#x27;m not giving it a 5 star is because of the large dropper that is used.</li>
            <li>Really this product is basically lavender essential oil.  </li>
            <li>It is very calming, but now, it&#x27;s just not the same.</li>
            <li>Plant Therapy Essential Oils are the real deal.</li>
            <li>I have a little tea light diffuser that just a few drops of this fills the whole room or in a hot soak in my home spa.  </li>
            <li>This is my second time ordering this sent since august, doesn&#x27;t last long in this household, we use &amp;#34;relax&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;tranquil&amp;#34; the most between two different diffusers every night and sometimes during the day.</li>
            <li>I would not purchase this particular essential oil again.</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I wanted and expected.</li>
            <li>I am new to essential oils.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve used a Plant Therapy product and will not hesitate to order other oils from them.  </li>
            <li>I put some drops in my diffuser , my daughters bath to calm her down, or blend it with coco oil and place on skin!</li>
            <li>The difference is night and day, and I always know if I forget to use it, because the kids won&#x27;t go directly to sleep and need &#x27;drinks&#x27; and &#x27;kisses and hugs&#x27; 3, 4, 5, times each over the next hour.  </li>
            <li>The scent is okay - not great.  </li>
            <li>Still have to wake up a few time for obvious reasons, but fall back asleep quickly.  </li>
            <li>We have a ritual at night where I massage her with the \\&quot;Relax Synergy\\&quot; and have really seen this help her wind down at night...</li>
            <li>It seems to be overwhelmingly lavender upon initial application, but the other scents slowly come to the front as the oils mix with your skin.</li>
            <li>and I added a little too much...</li>
            <li>I mix it with a little water and it seems to really spread into the air.</li>

            <li> Just amazing.</li>
            <li> but this relax oil is amazing.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t girly at all - just a nice, herbal spa type of smell.</li>
            <li> I liked order, but when I searched ingredient, there are two toxic ingredients for dogs and cats.  </li>
            <li> This has a nice scent.  </li>
            <li> which I do not, but because (a) the description is honest about the contents and (b)</li>

            <li> Nice and earthy.</li>
            <li> I begun building my own collection months ago with tea tree oil.  </li>

            <li> I liked:)</li>

            <li> The scent isn&#x27;t overly powerful, and it is pleasant.</li>

            <li> I wasn&#x27;t blow away by the scent, it gave me more of a headache</li>

            <li> Love the smell</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try to mix it with an oil that has more floral notes, in the hopes that will make it more palatable.</li>
            <li> Even my husband, who hates scents in the house, found this quite enjoyable.</li>
            <li> but It did relax me my pulse lowered after enjoying it for a bit.</li>
            <li> more isn&#x27;t better.</li>
            <li> But, I can&#x27;t wait to try more varieties.</li>
            <li> Better than taking a sleep aid</li>

            <li> How could you top that :)</li>
            <li> I have been wearing patchouli for many years, and I like that it is the \\&quot;lingering\\&quot; scent as the lavender fades.</li>

            <li> I recommend to everyone who needs a refreshing and relaxing scent in their bedroom.</li>
            <li> I used some in homemade bath salts and it was one of the most relaxing baths,&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have ordered more scents and plan to make bath salts and candles for holiday gifts.</li>
            <li> but I am still able to smell it.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Perfect blend, especially mixed with beeswax and Shea butter.  </li>

            <li> The shipping is also very quick.</li>
            <li> not that sure, seems to be diluted and does not last, might purchase again as the price is great.</li>
            <li> The aroma is quite strong, so I mix a drop or two into almond oil.  </li>
            <li> The Relax is just a bit strong for me.</li>
            <li> It has a strong lavender element.</li>
            <li> it was not too strong.</li>
            <li> I do not feel that it is too strong, but others may.</li>
            <li> I am also 8 months pregnant and have not been able to sleep well through the night for a while.  </li>
            <li> Exceptional smell, highly concentrated.</li>
            <li> I used this oil so quickly because I loved it so much.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pure and the scent is amazing.</li>
            <li> This is a great essential oil blend!  </li>
            <li> I put a dab on my pillow case every few nights and have the best sleep ever - since I have been doing that.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough how happy my husband and I are with this EO.  </li>
            <li> The scent is light, not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I mixed it with coconut oil and it makes a great massage oil.</li>
            <li> This is a great essential oil.</li>
            <li> would suggest this blend to someone who wants to mix their own oil.  </li>
            <li> At first I felt the scent was too strong, but my students seem to be enjoying it.</li>
            <li> this brand is very reasonably priced and a very good quality essential oil...</li>
            <li> excellent essential oil, high quality.  </li>
            <li> It smells fantastic and clean.</li>
            <li> and they are equally rich in scent.  </li>
            <li> Probably wont buy any more &amp;#34;blends&amp;#34; online as I am pretty picky.</li>
            <li> This being said, I probably will purchase this oil again, despite my dissatisfaction with the dropper size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addendum to original review:  </li>
            <li> this oils have make me sleep for peaceful and more relax.</li>
            <li> Has a strong smell, exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> The essential oil blend had a concentrated but pleasant aroma.  </li>
            <li> This is a pleasant blend of oils for relaxation for the price, but, buyer, please beware that these oils pour out of the bottle briskly, so when you may only want 3-4 drops in your diffuser, you may end up with 10-12.</li>
            <li> I used around the house refreshing some dried eucalyptus, and I keep catching a wiff of the scents as it changes each day!  </li>
            <li> Following the example of another reviewer, we tried rubbing into feet at bedtime and it  almost guarantees a good night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
            <li> I really like the Tranquil much more.  </li>
            <li> although I can&#x27;t really tell if it made me relax, i sure fell asleep.</li>
            <li> I think because this one has sweet marjoram in it too.  </li>
            <li> I love the scent, very soothing, and it lasts quite a while</li>
            <li> It is very soothing and I love the lavendar/orange undertones of fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really have been enjoying this blend.</li>
            <li> This one, like others was good quality, we simply didn&#x27;t care for the smell of the blend.</li>
            <li> Love the smell it is really relaxing.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of patchouli, so I definitely loved that it had that great scent mixed in, without overpowering the other scents.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing that a scent can provoke such a strong reaction so quickly.  </li>
            <li> The remaining oils are ones I like, but I should have guessed that the lavender, being listed first, would be too strong for me.  </li>
            <li> Not exactly the aroma, I was looking for, but nevertheless it&#x27;s a great addition to my oils.</li>
            <li> give our clothes a clean fresh scent.</li>
            <li> I make lotions and use this particular oil the most.  </li>
            <li> I bought it mainly for the therapeutic benefit but have been pleased with the scent.</li>
            <li> The company that sent this to me was very fast and accurate.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely blend that reminds me of the fragrance that is ubiquitous at high end spas.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> More than a dab made the fragrance too strong, so Iwashed it off and tried a very tiny amount.  </li>
            <li> but it is Soooo very pleasant and rich with subtle undertones!</li>
            <li> Just fresh, and a bit herbal.  </li>
            <li> This scent is my favorite out of all my essentials oils so far.</li>
            <li> I used it before sleeping daily and I feel good ,gently drifting into sleep.</li>
            <li> I use this for my dogs in place of a calming collar, I just put several drops on their own collar,&lt;br /&gt;they</li>
            <li> I wanted to use a mixed oil instead so mixing my own.</li>
            <li> It kind of leaves your house (or in my case currently, the bathrooms) smelling like a spa - and what do you do at a spa, but relax!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to trying essential oils but want to share my use for this amazing stuff!  </li>
            <li> As with most of the other Plant Therapy items we are quite pleased.  </li>
            <li> Its very muted compared to &amp;#34;tranquil&amp;#34;, but very lovely, I would definitely say it sets a peaceful tone.</li>
            <li> Nice pure essential oils!</li>
            <li> This has the right consistency of each oil to make it just right, and it is, in my opinion one of the better brands I have purchased recently, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> That being said, we order Plant Therapy brand essential oils several times a year and they are of great quality.  </li>
            <li> We didn&#x27;t&#x27; care for this blend very much.  </li>
            <li> so I have to put it on my nightstand pretty close to my bed in order to smell it in the diffuser.</li>
            <li> but we both felt immediately peaceful.  </li>
            <li> Love the scent of this essential oil.  </li>
            <li> This is perfect for sprinkling a few drops in your bath after a long day or adding to a body scrub for a relaxing scent.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve finally gone through my first bottle and just ordered more.</li>
            <li> I bought a ton of essential oils and this is my favorite scent.  </li>
            <li> I guess that is the risk you take when ordering without testing first.</li>
            <li> I drop 3 drops on my pillow before going to sleep, and the aroma is soothing and so peaceful.</li>
            <li> I love this combination of essential oils.  </li>
            <li> Mixed a small amount of this with Nature&#x27;s Alchemy Grape seed Oil and it worked great!</li>
            <li> A very provocative fragrance!</li>
            <li> the oil is very relaxing, the smell is great, calming not overwhelming at all.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience in purchasing a synergy blend and is beyond my expectations.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bit strong and more spicy than flowery.</li>
            <li> smell is pleasant but not extremely captivating as I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li> it is a good blend of essential oils to relax the human body and ease tension.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit strong, so I may just put a few drops into a misting bottle with a carrier oil, like Apricot kernel, which is very mild.</li>
            <li> At first I was taken back with how strong the smell is - but now that I&#x27;ve dabbed it in certain areas of my home, I actually really like it.  </li>
            <li> The dropper that comes in bottle is rather large.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that after taking a bath with a few drops of this oil, I fall asleep quickly , and have a deeper and a better quality sleep.  </li>
            <li> This particular oil is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> After a hard day at work it works good with my spa mist.will purchase this product again .</li>
            <li> It is very calming.</li>
            <li> Very soothing scent for the soaps and hand cream I made.</li>
            <li> I think the problem is that the pouring spout(?)  lets out too much oil at a time.</li>
            <li> Very relaxing.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast too.  </li>
            <li> Very soothing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is very relaxing as it says.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t use too much...</li>
            <li> the patchouli and lavender really come through in this blend</li>
            <li> they ship fast and are packaged well</li>
            <li> This really does the relaxing part.</li>
            <li> All together he slept seven hours, which is unusual for him.  </li>
            <li> I have since used in it a couple batches of body bitter and love the scent on my skin.  </li>
            <li> plus she smells great the entire next day...until it&#x27;s time for her next massage!  </li>
            <li> Both my sons, aged two and four, love it.</li>
            <li> But I absolutely recommend this oil blend.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell</li>
            <li> It smells divine and my husband loves it, he wants me to use it every night,</li>
            <li> It really does help me to sleep at night when I add it to my Humio humidifier.</li>
            <li> My wife likes this, but I think it smells very medicinal.</li>
            <li> Love the feeling of going to sleep without mental stress.</li>
            <li> The aromatics seem almost mesmerizing, giving a conscious awareness of a subdued blissfulness.</li>
            <li> Very versatile and high quality.</li>
            <li> pure essential because I thought it would be better since it was already mixed by expert hands.  </li>
            <li> I usually create my own relaxation blend using oils and a \\&quot;recipe\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> My 10 week old lab pup is pretty high energy.  </li>
            <li> I received my Relax Synergy essential oil quickly.</li>
            <li> and I would order this particular oil after it is all gone.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend particularly likes the fragrance, she says that it relaxes her.</li>
            <li> I put a little on my hot pack and when I warm it up it seems to fill up the entire room.  </li>
            <li> and I highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li> I believe the quality is high.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Its a high quality product for an affordable price.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Like the other plant therapy stuff, this is STRONG.  </li>
            <li> Just received it today, put a few drops on my wrist, and I love the combination of scents.</li>
            <li> I have been using essential oils for many years, and I usually purchase higher quality oils, at a higher price.</li>
            <li> Relax Synergy essential oil has a nice aroma to it that will help you wind down.</li>
            <li> It smells mostly of fine lavender with a hint of the other ingredients: marjoran, patchouli, mandarin, geranium &amp; chamomille.</li>
            <li> When they have the oil on, they go right to sleep and don&#x27;t wake up in the middle of the night either.  </li>
            <li> If I wake up during the night, I go right back to sleep.  </li>
            <li> I use this oil in my new H2EO diffuser in no time find myself unwinding and yawning.  </li>
            <li> They are really nice even though I have only used a few of them.  </li>
            <li> I really like this essential oil blend,  very relaxing.  </li>
            <li> i just leave it open next to my bed and just enjoy the peace.</li>
            <li> Given the cost of some of these oils individually they were very reasonable.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell like old hippies either!  </li>
            <li> old within minutes!</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with essential oils.  </li>
            <li> Careful pouring, drops come out quickly.</li>
            <li> I have incredibly sensitive skin~ VERY sensitive skin, so I used this cautiously without issue, thankfully.</li>
            <li> Much better than the typical drug store oils I can find locally.</li>
            <li> This essential oil is pure bliss.</li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m not giving it a 5 star is because of the large dropper that is used.</li>
            <li> Really this product is basically lavender essential oil.  </li>
            <li> It is very calming, but now, it&#x27;s just not the same.</li>
            <li> Plant Therapy Essential Oils are the real deal.</li>
            <li> I have a little tea light diffuser that just a few drops of this fills the whole room or in a hot soak in my home spa.  </li>
            <li> This is my second time ordering this sent since august, doesn&#x27;t last long in this household, we use &amp;#34;relax&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;tranquil&amp;#34; the most between two different diffusers every night and sometimes during the day.</li>
            <li> I would not purchase this particular essential oil again.</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I wanted and expected.</li>
            <li> I am new to essential oils.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used a Plant Therapy product and will not hesitate to order other oils from them.  </li>
            <li> I put some drops in my diffuser , my daughters bath to calm her down, or blend it with coco oil and place on skin!</li>
            <li> The difference is night and day, and I always know if I forget to use it, because the kids won&#x27;t go directly to sleep and need &#x27;drinks&#x27; and &#x27;kisses and hugs&#x27; 3, 4, 5, times each over the next hour.  </li>
            <li> The scent is okay - not great.  </li>
            <li> Still have to wake up a few time for obvious reasons, but fall back asleep quickly.  </li>
            <li> We have a ritual at night where I massage her with the \\&quot;Relax Synergy\\&quot; and have really seen this help her wind down at night...</li>
            <li> It seems to be overwhelmingly lavender upon initial application, but the other scents slowly come to the front as the oils mix with your skin.</li>
            <li> and I added a little too much...</li>
            <li> I mix it with a little water and it seems to really spread into the air.</li>
            <li> It worked fine when I put a few drops on a cotton ball in a small glass container which I put on my bedside table.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but this product really does help me relax at the end of the night.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really tried it when I am seriously &#x27;anxious&#x27;, so I can&#x27;t say anything about its calming effects.</li>
            <li> DOES NOT SEEM TO LAST VERY LONG.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Especially, Chamomile can be lead to bleeding tendencies for using a long term for dogs and cats.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> put a few drops on a cotton ball near my bed at night.</li>
            <li> I also put a few drops near my pillow some nights.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing, because as I said above, I really liked this oil blend.</li>
            <li> after a long day at work..sends me to sleep every time!  </li>
            <li> That had not happened in a long time!  </li>
            <li> i saw in other posts i mixed it in a carrier oil(i used grape seed oil) and applied to my feet and some on a cotton ball on my pillow.</li>
            <li> I only added a few drops to my diffuser and my entire room smells heavenly.  </li>
            <li> a little goes a long way, 4 drops on the pillow enough to send you to dreamland..</li>
            <li> as I&#x27;m not particularly drawn to some of the essences that this contains...</li>
            <li> Less than a month later...</li>
            <li> I have my only little mixture of 5 drops each with the relax and tranquil oils.</li>
            <li> Such power in a little bottle.  </li>
            <li> the smell is as such little pungent .</li>
            <li> I was disappointed the first time I used it, but have grown to really like the scent now</li>
            <li> After a particularly rough day, this was just what I needed.</li>
            <li> She also uses it at night when she has trouble sleeping (a regular problem with her).  </li>
            <li> The only reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it seems just a little watered down-</li>
            <li> I typically run the diffuser for no less than four hours and, at the end of that time, the scent of the oil is only slightly weak.  </li>
            <li> the other one is Chamomile.&lt;br /&gt;[...</li>
            <li> I usually get nervous with blends since I am not the one making it to my personal preferences.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t notice any of the other notes they indicated were in this oil.</li>
            <li> It is extremely relaxing and reminds me of the scents they use when you get a massage.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, that creates much stronger scent, tipping me off.</li>
            <li> I put a few drops in my bath after a tough day or put a drop near my bed to help with sleeping.  </li>
            <li> The frequencies induced in the body with slight application to skin reinforces the healing relaxation.</li>
            <li> I have already dropped little dots of it all over my house.</li>
            <li> I also purchased Meditation formula, but it is a little musky for my taste.</li>
            <li> I just dab a little at each hip, on my shirt or pants, so it isn&#x27;t too close to my face</li>
            <li> All my blankets and sheets are washed in non scented detergent and a few drops of this oil.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who has trouble falling asleep or staying asleep.  </li>
            <li> and they ask for it before bedtime when they are having trouble falling asleep.</li>
            <li> I use this oil so much it&#x27;s tiresome carrying it back and forth!</li>
            <li> have used it on my skin, just a small dab on my wrist, as a fragrance without any issue.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unbelievably relaxing and calming.</li>
            <li> QUITE A SMALL; BOTTLE AND SCENT</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased natural oils and this is very expensive for the amount you get.  </li>
            <li> I have no issues using undiluted on my sensitive skin, no rash or bad reaction.</li>
            <li> The cap was put on wrong before shipment and arrived empty because it leaked everywhere.</li>
            <li> Figured I&#x27;d be disappointing when I received this essential oil...</li>
            <li> Very small bottle and the smell wasn&#x27;t quite as relaxing as I hoped for.</li>
            <li> Another reviewer complained that this oil is thin...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bit of heaven - turns your room into a spa!!!</li>
            <li> When I opened the bottle I was a little disappointed in how overpowering the lavender scent was (I already have lavender eo), but when using the blend, the patchouli overpowers everything else.</li>
            <li> Still bad.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I actually still use this sometimes at night to help me sleep, but I&#x27;m not that fond of the smell. I don&#x27;t dislike the smell but I don&#x27;t like it either. It&#x27;s a little bit strong and more spicy than flowery. I&#x27;d definitely recommend trying it! It is very calming.</li>
            <li> I have tried many oils, this is fabulous.  i purchased two and they are equally rich in scent.  &#x27;Relax&#x27; I used around the house refreshing some dried eucalyptus, and I keep catching a wiff of the scents as it changes each day!  Nice pure essential oils!</li>
            <li> Like the other plant therapy stuff, this is STRONG.  I use it in an oil warmer, so that is what I want.  This mix smells incredible - very relaxing, hence the name.  It doesn&#x27;t smell like old hippies either!  Just fresh, and a bit herbal.  Everyone who comes to my house likes the smell, even men.  It isn&#x27;t girly at all - just a nice, herbal spa type of smell.</li>
            <li> When I read the description of oil scents that were used it sounded very nice. When I received the oils in the mail and opened them (I bought three different ones) I found all of them offensive. I tried putting a drop on a paper and letting it sit, thinking it just needed to air. Still bad. So, I diluted each one, which helped, but I was imagining scents of different things that I would never want to smell on purpose. Maybe it&#x27;s my nose and someone else might think they&#x27;re wonderful, but I won&#x27;t be using them.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite blends--- i wear it as a perfume and get so many compliments on it</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t blow away by the scent, it gave me more of a headache then helped me relax. Maybe that&#x27;s just me though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased natural oils and this is very expensive for the amount you get.  The scent is okay - not great.  It smells mediciny.</li>
            <li> I liked order, but when I searched ingredient, there are two toxic ingredients for dogs and cats.  So I cannot use for my house.  It is not for my family, but it will be good for non pet family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tow toxic ingredients for cats and dogs.  One is Geranium and the other one is Chamomile.&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Especially, Chamomile can be lead to bleeding tendencies for using a long term for dogs and cats.&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> When I opened the bottle I was a little disappointed in how overpowering the lavender scent was (I already have lavender eo), but when using the blend, the patchouli overpowers everything else. I was disappointed the first time I used it, but have grown to really like the scent now that I&#x27;m used to it. I&#x27;d probably buy it again.</li>
            <li> Excellent mixture!  Very soothing scent for the soaps and hand cream I made.</li>
            <li> I got this blend in hopes it would help me sleep.  This has been an amazing transformation.  Relax is just what I do when I rub it on my wrist or feet at bedtime.  It has made such a different.  It has a wonderful smell.  Lavender is what I smell most, but the combination of oils is a prefect smell.  So glad I tried this oil!</li>
            <li> I love Plant Therapy.  This has a nice scent.  It&#x27;s not overpowering so I have to put it on my nightstand pretty close to my bed in order to smell it in the diffuser.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this blend. It&#x27;s my 2nd bottle.</li>
            <li> Following the example of another reviewer, we tried rubbing into feet at bedtime and it  almost guarantees a good night&#x27;s sleep. The aroma is quite strong, so I mix a drop or two into almond oil.  This is the first time I&#x27;ve used a Plant Therapy product and will not hesitate to order other oils from them.  Another reviewer complained that this oil is thin...I think the problem is that the pouring spout(?)  lets out too much oil at a time. Wish they&#x27;d fix that. Five stars anyway.</li>
            <li> This has to be diluted with a carrier oil before you apply to your skin. I was not wise and applied full strength to my temples and it burned my skin.</li>
            <li> I usually get nervous with blends since I am not the one making it to my personal preferences.  Plant Therapy did a wonderful job with this blend.  I have zero complaints with the aroma.  I find this blend to be a perfect aroma to help me unwind from a long day at work.  It helps soothe me enough so I can fall asleep and not have my mind dwelling on the day.</li>
            <li> I mistakenly put 4 drops into my humidifier. Unfortunately, that creates much stronger scent, tipping me off. Anyway, the next time, I only put 2 drops and it works well. I like the smell and I highly recommend the product. The shipping is also very quick.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Pleasant,calm and relaxing scent-smells great! After a hard day at work it works good with my spa mist.will purchase this product again .</li>
            <li> I usually create my own relaxation blend using oils and a \\&quot;recipe\\&quot;.  Thought I&#x27;d give this one a try simply because I like all of the oils used in this blend.  It&#x27;s a little bit of heaven - turns your room into a spa!!!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice blend, with herbal/spicy notes, including lavender.  I am very happy with the product.  I just put some on my arm, and can&#x27;t stop sniffing it.  Ah!!!  Very relaxing.</li>
            <li> I like this, but I bought the Tranquil Synergy that Plant Therapy also makes.  Personal preference, but I really like the Tranquil much more.  The Relax is just a bit strong for me.</li>
            <li> Really this product is basically lavender essential oil.  The lavender is the only thing that stands out.  I already had Lavender essential oil so I was unimpressed to find it smelled basically the same..</li>
            <li> Great product. Use it every day and have ordered more mixtures from this company&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;100% oil and smells great. Love it</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t stressed when we opened it but we both felt immediately peaceful.  It&#x27;s amazing that a scent can provoke such a strong reaction so quickly.  We&#x27;ll see what happens when either of us is stressed.</li>
            <li> Relax Synergy essential oil has a nice aroma to it that will help you wind down. The scent isn&#x27;t overly powerful, and it is pleasant.</li>
            <li> The essential oil blend had a concentrated but pleasant aroma.  It worked fine when I put a few drops on a cotton ball in a small glass container which I put on my bedside table.  It helped me relax a bit at bedtime.</li>
            <li> This smells great and I recently used it on a car trip with the dogs.  Everyone seemed very calm and relaxed on our trip and it didn&#x27;t make me sleepy while driving!</li>
            <li> This does what it says... I used all up and will reorder...it is a good blend of essential oils to relax the human body and ease tension.  I liked:)</li>
            <li> Great product, very good quality of oils.  Most of my oils are Plant Therapy now.  The prices are great and the quality of the oils are very good.  My kids ask for this oil every night before bed, they are sleeping much better and fall asleep more quickly.</li>
            <li> Love the scent of this essential oil.  Will definitely buy again and you can&#x27;t beat the price or the quality</li>
            <li> This is a lovely blend that reminds me of the fragrance that is ubiquitous at high end spas. Relaxing and soothing.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed using this wonderful product. It&#x27;s pure and the scent is amazing. Well packaged and it arrived on time. Thumbs up!</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the scent I was expecting -- my kids think it has a minty smell??  If you don&#x27;t have any pre-conceived notions of what it should smell like you will probably be happier.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality. I&#x27;m very happy with this oil. Much better than the typical drug store oils I can find locally.</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent to diffuse.  Love the smell and I keep some at my desk at work for times of stress.</li>
            <li> This smelled to me like a mix of lavender and menthol...I couldn&#x27;t notice any of the other notes they indicated were in this oil. It&#x27;s not nauseating, but also isn&#x27;t comforting in the slightest, not the way I&#x27;d ever want my house to smell. I&#x27;m going to try to mix it with an oil that has more floral notes, in the hopes that will make it more palatable.</li>
            <li> I am in love! I just got this yesterday and put it to use as soon as I opened it. After a particularly rough day, this was just what I needed. It smells fantastic and clean. Even my husband, who hates scents in the house, found this quite enjoyable. I will be using this everyday and will absolutely be ordering again.</li>
            <li> Pleasant aroma for the home....after a long day at work..sends me to sleep every time!  My favorite! Great company. ..quality product!</li>
            <li> It actually does seem to help me fall asleep.  I welcome the scent when I walk into my bedroomand so  I will be purchasing a larger size soon.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product!  As with most of the other Plant Therapy items we are quite pleased.  Great for Lampe Berger lamps.</li>
            <li> Bought this product to use in my home diffuser and I love it! Shipped fast too.  Would definitely recommend it</li>
            <li> I use these oils in liquid hand soap. It has a very lovely scent.</li>
            <li> This blend lives up to its name.  I only added a few drops to my diffuser and my entire room smells heavenly.  It is extremely relaxing and reminds me of the scents they use when you get a massage. Very soothing.</li>
            <li> Great quality long lasting oil and the price it great! My house smells like a spa. Very happy with this oil!</li>
            <li> This stuff is very relaxing as it says. I made a deodorizer with this and baking soda and I added a little too much... but It did relax me my pulse lowered after enjoying it for a bit. Awesome product :D</li>
            <li> although I can&#x27;t really tell if it made me relax, i sure fell asleep. don&#x27;t use too much... more isn&#x27;t better.</li>
            <li> I bought this for anxiety, of course, but I get a lot of compliments! I rub some on the back of my neck and sometimes on my wrists, and quite often I get people smelling the air around me and going, &#x27;ahhh, what&#x27;s that smell?&#x27; (in a good way). the patchouli and lavender really come through in this blend and I can tell these oils are good quality. Haven&#x27;t really tried it when I am seriously &#x27;anxious&#x27;, so I can&#x27;t say anything about its calming effects. It smells so good though, and that can be soothing. Update, 12/3/15: just bought another bottle about 6 months ago and the scent has changed! Very disappointing, because as I said above, I really liked this oil blend. It is very calming, but now, it&#x27;s just not the same.</li>
            <li> This is a great essential oil blend!  I put a dab on my pillow case every few nights and have the best sleep ever - since I have been doing that.</li>
            <li> Amazing. Just amazing. It smells just like a massage therapy room. I have already dropped little dots of it all over my house. I can&#x27;t get enough! I also purchased Meditation formula, but it is a little musky for my taste. But, I can&#x27;t wait to try more varieties. I&#x27;m going to use them for making scrubs, massage oils, etc. Great products!</li>
            <li> Great for before bed.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for sprinkling a few drops in your bath after a long day or adding to a body scrub for a relaxing scent.  This is the second time I&#x27;ve bought it so they&#x27;re stuck with me as a customer!</li>
            <li> Has a strong smell, exactly what I wanted! I received the product when I was supposed to. Very happy with the product!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but this product really does help me relax at the end of the night. It works well for me in a carrier lotion before bed.</li>
            <li> The cap was put on wrong before shipment and arrived empty because it leaked everywhere.</li>
            <li> The smell is just as the title indicates:  relaxing!  I put a few drops in my bath after a tough day or put a drop near my bed to help with sleeping.  Like others have mentioned you do need to like the smell of patchouli (which I do) since it is one of the stronger scents in this mix.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on 4 kids for the last year before bed.  I mixed it with coconut oil in a roller ball and put it on their feet at night, and in their baths.  The difference is night and day, and I always know if I forget to use it, because the kids won&#x27;t go directly to sleep and need &#x27;drinks&#x27; and &#x27;kisses and hugs&#x27; 3, 4, 5, times each over the next hour.  When they have the oil on, they go right to sleep and don&#x27;t wake up in the middle of the night either.  I&#x27;ve finally gone through my first bottle and just ordered more.</li>
            <li> Love this!  This is a reorder!!!</li>
            <li> excellent essential oil, high quality.  I use it at night to help me sleep.  Great product and reasonably priced!</li>
            <li> I bought a ton of essential oils and this is my favorite scent.  I don&#x27;t know why anyone buys perfume these days.  I make lotions and use this particular oil the most.  It has a strong lavender element.</li>
            <li> these oils are great  they ship fast and are packaged well will shop here again&lt;br /&gt;I infused them in the evening</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful blend for sleep, and Seems to work better for me than Auracacia&#x27;s Pillow Potion...I think because this one has sweet marjoram in it too.  Another superb synergy from Plant Therapy!</li>
            <li> This essential oil is pure bliss. After a stressful or especially thoughtful day I put about 10 drops in a warm bath an let my tension melt away.</li>
            <li> This really does the relaxing part. I have my only little mixture of 5 drops each with the relax and tranquil oils. Better than taking a sleep aid</li>
            <li> This blend of EO&#x27;s is very lovely. It instills a sense of tranquility within me every time I apply. It seems to be overwhelmingly lavender upon initial application, but the other scents slowly come to the front as the oils mix with your skin. I can feel myself taking longer, deeper breaths after application and fall into a state of restful relaxation.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the timeliness of this product and the scent is wonderful. I work as a massage therapist and my clients are pleased with this scent as well.</li>
            <li> Love this blend. I use it every night to help get to sleep and stay a sleep. Have been using for several weeks and cannot imagine not using it. I have no issues using undiluted on my sensitive skin, no rash or bad reaction.</li>
            <li> Definitely a relaxing scent. I love it.</li>
            <li> I did not care for the smell of it at all. I guess that is the risk you take when ordering without testing first.</li>
            <li> Product works as advertised...a little goes a long way, 4 drops on the pillow enough to send you to dreamland..I will re-order the same when used up.</li>
            <li> I put one drop of Relax Oil on my pillow and sniff the pillow.  It makes me relax and go to sleep.  If I wake up during the night, I go right back to sleep.  My husband, who has back problems and had several surgeries, put a drop on his wrists and smelled the oil last night.  All together he slept seven hours, which is unusual for him.  I had run out of the oil and just got two more bottles yesteday.  I don&#x27;t ever want to run out again.  I&#x27;m a very happy customer.</li>
            <li> This was purchased to use for homemade bubble bath. The sent is calming and aids in relaxation. It has a great sent.</li>
            <li> this product help elimate my headache without me taking pills. love it&lt;br /&gt;only use it for about three times or so</li>
            <li> The 1st week of using this blend, I slept through the night every night!  That had not happened in a long time!  Love Plant Therapy!</li>
            <li> They are really nice even though I have only used a few of them.  Given the cost of some of these oils individually they were very reasonable.  I have Amazon Prime so they got to my house 2 days after I placed the order.  I will order from this company again.</li>
            <li> I dislike lavender.  The remaining oils are ones I like, but I should have guessed that the lavender, being listed first, would be too strong for me.  I&#x27;m giving it four stars not because i like it, which I do not, but because (a) the description is honest about the contents and (b) I believe the quality is high.  Instead, I find the Tranquil Synergy is better for me.  Similar, but no lavender.</li>
            <li> I received my Relax Synergy essential oil quickly. I have since used in it a couple batches of body bitter and love the scent on my skin.  Nice product.</li>
            <li> I burn this oil in a diffuser. I mix it with a little water and it seems to really spread into the air. IT makes my home smell so relaxing and inviting. The company that sent this to me was very fast and accurate. I would definitely order this brand again and I would order this particular oil after it is all gone. I like to diffuse it before the kids get home and before bedtime.</li>
            <li> I put drops along the tops of standing pillows on my bed; the scent floats around and soothes while I sleep!</li>
            <li> I use this oil in my new H2EO diffuser in no time find myself unwinding and yawning.  I typically run the diffuser for no less than four hours and, at the end of that time, the scent of the oil is only slightly weak.  I am pleased with the scent and performance of this oil.</li>
            <li> I use relax along with velarian to promote sleep at night.  Have been falling into a deeper sleep. Love it</li>
            <li> Love the aroma this leaves throughout my home. It is exactly what I wanted and expected. I would purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Definitely give this a 5 star.  Such power in a little bottle.  I have a little tea light diffuser that just a few drops of this fills the whole room or in a hot soak in my home spa.  Recommend.  rlw</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent. I burn it and if changes the atmosphere in the room. It smells mostly of fine lavender with a hint of the other ingredients: marjoran, patchouli, mandarin, geranium &amp; chamomille. Very nice!</li>
            <li> Exceptional smell, highly concentrated. I drop 3 drops on my pillow before going to sleep, and the aroma is soothing and so peaceful. It doesn&#x27;t stain the sheets. Very lovely, and works well on clothing, and in burners. Very versatile and high quality. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough how happy my husband and I are with this EO.  I immediately puts you at ease!  I put a little on my hot pack and when I warm it up it seems to fill up the entire room.  I love the scent, very soothing, and it lasts quite a while so I imagine it would work great as a roll on with a carrier oil.  I plan to try it!</li>
            <li> Love this, calms my 1.5yr. old within minutes!</li>
            <li> This scent is my favorite out of all my essentials oils so far. All my blankets and sheets are washed in non scented detergent and a few drops of this oil. I love to breath this scent in as I fall asleep, it&#x27;s just so relaxing. Going to order an extra bottle so there&#x27;s one bottle upstairs to put in homemade lotion bars and one downstairs to put in the washing machine. I use this oil so much it&#x27;s tiresome carrying it back and forth!</li>
            <li> I love this combination of essential oils.  It has a relaxinging affect.  The scent is light, not overpowering. Careful pouring, drops come out quickly.</li>
            <li> I love this blend. You don&#x27;t need but 3 to 5 drops and it burns nice and pleasant. Don&#x27;t hesitate on this one!</li>
            <li> I mixed it with coconut oil and it makes a great massage oil.</li>
            <li> Great smell! Great price!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend particularly likes the fragrance, she says that it relaxes her. And, when she&#x27;s relaxed we make love. How could you top that :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to trying essential oils but want to share my use for this amazing stuff!  My 10 week old lab pup is pretty high energy.  We have a ritual at night where I massage her with the \\&quot;Relax Synergy\\&quot; and have really seen this help her wind down at night...plus she smells great the entire next day...until it&#x27;s time for her next massage!  Love it!</li>
            <li> Using this in my K-7th grade art classroom with a plug-in \\&quot;scent ball\\&quot;. At first I felt the scent was too strong, but my students seem to be enjoying it. I have been wearing patchouli for many years, and I like that it is the \\&quot;lingering\\&quot; scent as the lavender fades.</li>
            <li> Aroma was good but needed a lot to scent a room.  A bottle only lasted for 3 uses with the diffuser I bought</li>
            <li> For a person with alot of activity in house sometimes this is a great value oil so far it is just what I wanted to try.thanks for good value</li>
            <li> Mixed a small amount of this with Nature&#x27;s Alchemy Grape seed Oil and it worked great! Smells wonderful, just strong enough without being overpowering.</li>
            <li> Excellant product.  I would recommend this to anyone who has trouble falling asleep or staying asleep.  I use this for myself as well as my two children and they ask for it before bedtime when they are having trouble falling asleep. Both of them love the smell.</li>
            <li> This is a great essential oil. Its very muted compared to &amp;#34;tranquil&amp;#34;, but very lovely, I would definitely say it sets a peaceful tone. This is my second time ordering this sent since august, doesn&#x27;t last long in this household, we use &amp;#34;relax&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;tranquil&amp;#34; the most between two different diffusers every night and sometimes during the day. Both my sons, aged two and four, love it.</li>
            <li> This particular oil is exactly what I was looking for. The blend sends the aromatic message that it&#x27;s time and place  to relax. The frequencies induced in the body with slight application to skin reinforces the healing relaxation.</li>
            <li> Very Surprisingly Pleased! Figured I&#x27;d be disappointing when I received this essential oil...as I&#x27;m not particularly drawn to some of the essences that this contains...but it is Soooo very pleasant and rich with subtle undertones! A very provocative fragrance!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and great scent.  I use it in the diffuser to help sleep at night.</li>
            <li> I love this product .It smells delicious and really helps me relax.&lt;br /&gt;I even spray some in my classroom .</li>
            <li> This blend smells like heaven. I can feel my muscles let go when I diffuse it. Its a high quality product for an affordable price.</li>
            <li> Awesome blend! Use this in diffuser/humidifier next to bed at night in winter- is really wonderful. Adds a perfect amount of scent to our room for calming, sleeping, sense of peace. Highly recommend. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> This has a pleasant smell; however, caution in using too much or it can be over-powering.&lt;br /&gt;I put a few drops on a cotton ball near my bed at night. It is very soothing and I love the lavendar/orange undertones of fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it on my skin, just a small dab on my wrist, as a fragrance without any issue. More than a dab made the fragrance too strong, so Iwashed it off and tried a very tiny amount.  I have incredibly sensitive skin~ VERY sensitive skin, so I used this cautiously without issue, thankfully.</li>
            <li> This oil blend is great!  I made a homemade sugar scrub, and the Relax blend provided the perfect scent.  I am a fan of patchouli, so I definitely loved that it had that great scent mixed in, without overpowering the other scents.</li>
            <li> My wife is enjoying the oil blend. She uses it in her car to help get her through rush hour.  She also uses it at night when she has trouble sleeping (a regular problem with her).  She says it helps and she loves the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Very small bottle and the smell wasn&#x27;t quite as relaxing as I hoped for. Probably wont buy any more &amp;#34;blends&amp;#34; online as I am pretty picky.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time. Nice scent it was not too strong. Would order again. I use it mixed in a vinegar/water cleaning solution.</li>
            <li> Love this oil.  It works.  It is a gradual relaxation as you slide into sleep.  I am try impressed and the smell is great.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product. I take it to work with me and take a deep inhale or two when things get stressful. I also put a few drops near my pillow some nights. The only reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it seems just a little watered down-it&#x27;s still potent (in a good way) I just seem to be going through it faster than a more expensive essential oil I had before this one. But I absolutely recommend this oil blend.</li>
            <li> I love this oil!  I put it on my neck and upper body at bedtime and sleep like a baby!</li>
            <li> I must need more practice</li>
            <li> I does produce a relaxing atmosphere, We use it in an oil warmer and the smell is good also,  Even relaxes the dogs around here, Would recommend</li>
            <li> I used this oil so quickly because I loved it so much.  Less than a month later...I am purchasing my second bottle.</li>
            <li> The product works nicely to help me sleep. I&#x27;m also impressed with the company that seems to have a real interest in my satisfaction. For example, they gave sufficient time to try the oil before contacting me for a comment.</li>
            <li> Great product.  It smells wonderful, and is so enjoyable to use for relaxation.  I bought this one to share with someone else!</li>
            <li> Love plant therapy, enjoy all their products. Wish they had more blends and maybe personaliZe blends as we request them. That would be awesome! :) but this relax oil is amazing. I put some drops in my diffuser , my daughters bath to calm her down, or blend it with coco oil and place on skin!</li>
            <li> Not exactly the aroma, I was looking for, but nevertheless it&#x27;s a great addition to my oils.I thought the lavender would lead. The blend is a menthol, minty kind of fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love the products from this company!!  ahhhhhhhhh</li>
            <li> I swear by this oil.  It&#x27;s unbelievably relaxing and calming. If you are suffering from stress or anxiety I would suggest you purchase a bottle asap.</li>
            <li> the oil is very relaxing, the smell is great, calming not overwhelming at all. The combination of all the oils is great. Thank you</li>
            <li> Just received it today, put a few drops on my wrist, and I love the combination of scents. It&#x27;s a bit strong, so I may just put a few drops into a misting bottle with a carrier oil, like Apricot kernel, which is very mild. I can&#x27;t wait to spray my pillow/bedding tonight! Mmmmmm! Lovely!</li>
            <li> All are  good products.  The citrus soap smells heavenly, as do the essential oils. They will make great Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li> I use it in a diffuser  to get a good night sleep. It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I have been using essential oils for many years, and I usually purchase higher quality oils, at a higher price. I thought I&#x27;d try this brand out, just to see what it was like. This is a pleasant blend of oils for relaxation for the price, but, buyer, please beware that these oils pour out of the bottle briskly, so when you may only want 3-4 drops in your diffuser, you may end up with 10-12. The dropper that comes in bottle is rather large. I ended up pouring this mix into another bottle I had with a smaller dropper, in order to conserve on the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lavender appears to be the dominating scent in this blend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This being said, I probably will purchase this oil again, despite my dissatisfaction with the dropper size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addendum to original review:  I just placed another order for Relax on 02/02/13. I really have been enjoying this blend. This time I purchased the 30ml bottle. The only reason I&#x27;m not giving it a 5 star is because of the large dropper that is used.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s relaxing and calming .However the smell is as such little pungent . I used it before sleeping daily and I feel good ,gently drifting into sleep. However , next time am gonna try a different one like lavender or sandalwood which are not as pungent and penetrating . Good dropper cap that prevents spillage. Good quality oil .</li>
            <li> Product is delightful. A wonderful fragrance to relax the senses.  I add a couple drops to my bath water to help relax after the days&#x27; routine.</li>
            <li> I bought it mainly for the therapeutic benefit but have been pleased with the scent. People want to know what perfume I&#x27;m wearing.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell and it is definately relaxing, especially when used on my temples.  :)</li>
            <li> Bought this to add to homemade laundry detergent. Love the scent and worked well to  give our clothes a clean fresh scent.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Perfect for my Salt Lamp Diffuser.</li>
            <li> We didn&#x27;t&#x27; care for this blend very much.  That being said, we order Plant Therapy brand essential oils several times a year and they are of great quality.  This one, like others was good quality, we simply didn&#x27;t care for the smell of the blend.</li>
            <li> Have been putting this on our pillow before bed time.  It smells divine and my husband loves it, he wants me to use it every night,</li>
            <li> I want a case of this Relax Synergy Oil!</li>
            <li> I use this for my dogs in place of a calming collar, I just put several drops on their own collar,&lt;br /&gt;they smell great, it also naturally repels fleas and ticks.</li>
            <li> I am using it as a room re-freshener with a candle warmer. The scent is great, quality not that sure, seems to be diluted and does not last, might purchase again as the price is great.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to use in a reed diffuser.  I haven&#x27;t yet tried it, but I did open the bottle and it smells great!</li>
            <li> I have used this oil in a diffuser, it smells great, the dominant note is lavender, which I love.  I am also 8 months pregnant and have not been able to sleep well through the night for a while.  I have noticed that after taking a bath with a few drops of this oil, I fall asleep quickly , and have a deeper and a better quality sleep.  Still have to wake up a few time for obvious reasons, but fall back asleep quickly.  Great oil, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to make my own bath fizz balls.  I wanted to use a mixed oil instead so mixing my own. This product met my needs.</li>
            <li> Plant Therapy Essential Oils are the real deal. Love this formula. It really does help me to sleep at night when I add it to my Humio humidifier. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I was a bit concerned about the patchouli, but  this is one of the BEST relaxing aromatherapy combinations I&#x27;ve smelled- clean, harmonious fragrance with no domineering notes,very soothing. I use it in my diffuser AND on my pillow every night and went through most of a bottle in 2 weeks while recovering from surgery.I&#x27;m about to order another bottle.</li>
            <li> This scent reminds me of the spa I&#x27;ve been to for massages.  Very nice and relaxing as advertised.  Nice and earthy.</li>
            <li> QUITE A SMALL; BOTTLE AND SCENT DOES NOT SEEM TO LAST VERY LONG.</li>
            <li> quick delivery, great product - smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> I really like this essential oil blend,  very relaxing.  I use it every nite before bed,  on the soles of my feet and neck...helps me sleep better...this brand is very reasonably priced and a very good quality essential oil...</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for! Smells great!</li>
            <li> It was wonderful, will buy again. I recommend to everyone who needs a refreshing and relaxing scent in their bedroom.</li>
            <li> This essential oil relaxation blend I bought instead of ylang ylang pure essential because I thought it would be better since it was already mixed by expert hands.  I am new to essential oils.  I begun building my own collection months ago with tea tree oil.  This particular buy did not seem much different from my home made blends which I made with oils I previously bought and mixed with carriers oils like almond and olive.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is pleasant but not extremely captivating as I thought it would be.  At this point my take on essential oil is that everything I mix, no matter what it is, it smells the same, this is why I call it the Chinese Food smell effect.&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest this blend to someone who wants to mix their own oil.  It is a good blend for massage and body oil as well.</li>
            <li> My wife likes this, but I think it smells very medicinal. I would not purchase this particular essential oil again.</li>
            <li> This has the right consistency of each oil to make it just right, and it is, in my opinion one of the better brands I have purchased recently, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with essential oils.  I used some in homemade bath salts and it was one of the most relaxing baths,&lt;br /&gt;As i saw in other posts i mixed it in a carrier oil(i used grape seed oil) and applied to my feet and some on a cotton ball on my pillow. Love the smell it is really relaxing. I have ordered more scents and plan to make bath salts and candles for holiday gifts.</li>
            <li> this oils have make me sleep for peaceful and more relax. Love the feeling of going to sleep without mental stress. i just leave it open next to my bed and just enjoy the peace.</li>
            <li> we use this nightly on our sheets. It doesn&#x27;t leave a mark and smells great! I do not feel that it is too strong, but others may. When I use it before going to yoga class I just dab a little at each hip, on my shirt or pants, so it isn&#x27;t too close to my face but I am still able to smell it. I will be buying more when we are out!</li>
            <li> At first I was taken back with how strong the smell is - but now that I&#x27;ve dabbed it in certain areas of my home, I actually really like it.  It kind of leaves your house (or in my case currently, the bathrooms) smelling like a spa - and what do you do at a spa, but relax!  :)</li>
            <li> The aromatics seem almost mesmerizing, giving a conscious awareness of a subdued blissfulness. This is my first experience in purchasing a synergy blend and is beyond my expectations.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Perfect blend, especially mixed with beeswax and Shea butter.  Haven&#x27;t tried it with cocoa butter yet but plan to soon.</li>
