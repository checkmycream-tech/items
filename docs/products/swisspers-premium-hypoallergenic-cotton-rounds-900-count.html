            <li> These 100% cotton rounds are so much stronger than the typical cotton rounds...</li>
            <li> I use them for nail polish removal, to use with my toner for my face, make up removal, cleaning my flat iron, and everything in between.</li>
            <li> They are better than using thick cotton balls, at least for the toner I am currently using.</li>
            <li> I use these for applying toner every single day before adding moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> In the long run you&#x27;ll save a whole lot of money as opposed to having to pick up a crappy pack of cotton rounds in the drug store that fall apart on you leaving lint behind.</li>
            <li> Each side of the cotton pad has a different texture - I&#x27;m not sure why, they don&#x27;t appear to function differently</li>
            <li> So technically they don&#x27;t come apart, as in their layers, but they do fall apart and leave fuzzy&#x27;s behind.</li>
            <li> They are fairly small but get the job done.</li>
            <li> These by any means leave no lint behind.</li>
            <li> Sadly, they leave a lot of fuzz behind.  </li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> These are even worse than the ones that I was trying to find a replacement for!</li>
            <li> I go through these like crazy, for skincare and nail polish remover.</li>
            <li> BAD!</li>

            <li> I bought these cotton rounds else where and not on amazon but I have to say they&#x27;re amazing. I love that they&#x27;re strong and do not fall apart. I use them for nail polish removal, to use with my toner for my face, make up removal, cleaning my flat iron, and everything in between. I would definitely recommend these and can we just stop and look at the great price. This value deal of 900 actually last you quite a whole. In the long run you&#x27;ll save a whole lot of money as opposed to having to pick up a crappy pack of cotton rounds in the drug store that fall apart on you leaving lint behind. These by any means leave no lint behind. Anyone reading this review go and order these you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> These 100% cotton rounds are so much stronger than the typical cotton rounds...they don&#x27;t leave a lot of pieces on your eyes or hands.Would buy again.  Also much more economical buying this amount.</li>
            <li> These are excellent quality but I just want to reiterate what another reviewer stated that these can be purchased at Costco for 12.99.</li>
            <li> mrs siegel loves them</li>
            <li> Way overpriced !!!! Found at Costco for 12.99 for a 10 pack</li>
            <li> I had not used this brand before and thought I would give them a try.  I like the quilted side of them and that they don&#x27;t come apart...great for doing nails.  Revision after using them for awhile now.  Sadly, they leave a lot of fuzz behind.  So technically they don&#x27;t come apart, as in their layers, but they do fall apart and leave fuzzy&#x27;s behind.</li>
            <li> great came with a lot!!! they feel awesome and absorb great and don&#x27;t desolve!!!</li>
            <li> one of the better deals on rounds.</li>
            <li> great deal for the price</li>
            <li> These are the perfect cotton rounds for cosmetic and minor first-aid applications.  They are not sterile but they are clean and very low-lint.  This particular package is perfect for keeping our home stocked-- 900-count rounds in 9 separate 100-count re-sealable sleeves.  The cartoon lady on the box may vary (we got a blonde this time) but the contents are consistently high quality.</li>
            <li> I love Swisspers. I go through these like crazy, for skincare and nail polish remover. They are soft, of good quality and don&#x27;t fall apart. Great price for a big case :)</li>
            <li> My friend recommend this one. she got it from costco and I didn&#x27;t see it from costco and found it here. I can use for the whole year I guess. Like it!</li>
            <li> So, I bought these based on the reviews that I  had read that stated that they did not peel. Guess what? They do! These are even worse than the ones that I was trying to find a replacement for! I can&#x27;t stand to be performing a facial and have cotton pieces everywhere! BAD!</li>
            <li> Like this for cleaning up my baby.</li>
            <li> There are so many I have more than a year&#x27;s supply, but they are great!</li>
            <li> These are my favorite cotton rounds to use at home and in my esthetics room. They hold together well and don&#x27;t shed. And I love that I can buy them in bulk.</li>
            <li> so i do use cotton rounds every day for my toner and some serums and these are preface (as perfect as a cotton round can be lol) I never get any fuzz on my face they don&#x27;t feel cheap and i will totally buy these again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an esthetician and these are my pads of choice in the salon and at home.</li>
            <li> I use these for applying toner every single day before adding moisturizer.  They are better than using thick cotton balls, at least for the toner I am currently using.</li>
            <li> These are great cotton rounds - they are soft, no shedding, highly absorbent. They are fairly small but get the job done. Each side of the cotton pad has a different texture - I&#x27;m not sure why, they don&#x27;t appear to function differently but maybe I&#x27;ve not been paying attention when I use them!</li>
            <li> great product wish I had found it 10 years ago</li>
            <li> Love these for removing eye makeup. Most cotton rounds have too much fuzz. These cotton rounds have wonderful smooth fuzz- free sides which make removal of eye makeup a snap.</li>
            <li> Great product but this is $12.99 at Costco for the same quantity.</li>
            <li> As promised these cotton rounds do not pill, break apart or remain on your skin after using them.  I recommend trying these!</li>
            <li> I use these several times a day for applying and removing makeup. I&#x27;m very pleased with the texture and they&#x27;re not rough like a lot of other rounds.</li>
            <li> Enough quantity for whole year!</li>
