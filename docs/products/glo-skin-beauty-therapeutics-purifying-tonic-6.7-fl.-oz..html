            <li> Love this toner. Great for combination and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been much for skincare, but I love this. It&#x27;s light and it gets the job done! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I love it, it really cleans your skin deeper after you use the cleanser, you can see it in cotton all. And I love the smell!</li>
            <li> The Glo Therapeutics line is excellent for problem skin helping me to fight breakouts and have a soft, shiny skin surface.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product. It smells great and I like using it in combination with my cleanser. A few times I have forgotten a moisturizer while traveling and will use this and it seems to help lock in moisture and is non-drying.</li>
            <li> recommended by an easthetition.</li>
            <li> Only thing that keeps acne away! I first got this at the place I get facials and fell in love with it. Smells great, works well on oily, acne-prone skin. I keep 2 bottles on hand so I won&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> I keep my house cool in winter so the toner stays cool.  I like the coolness on my face.  It does not sting or burn.  It does not leave my skin overly tight (skin issue: oily).  As to the smell . . . several reviewers raved about that.  I don&#x27;t know how to describe it other than to say it smells kind of like witch hazel -- it&#x27;s neither good nor bad.  I&#x27;ve had it less than a week.  Maybe as time goes on and my skin improves, I&#x27;ll learn to associate the smell with good results and come to actively like it.  (Maybe come summer, I&#x27;ll keep the bottle in the refrigerator??)</li>
            <li> OMG this stuff smells good and it doesn&#x27;t burn like my old tonic. Will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> This product really helps clear my skin! Beat my expectations.</li>
            <li> I love Glo Therapeutics!  I used this product all the time and it is good for oily skin.  It was recommended by my skin consultant.</li>
            <li> It gives me that feeling of fresh and clean skin, I really like it. Use it twice a day, and will be using it.</li>
            <li> The product was expired, smelled like a porta-potty. I had hoped this product would follow suit with the excellent Daily Polishing cleanser that I love so much. No luck here! Stinky. Not sure if it was rancid, pre-used, or just a terrible product.</li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin and the glotherapeutics line has been the answer to my prayers. This has nice smell and it leaves a fresh, moisturizing and smooth feel, very unlike other drying toners out there.</li>
            <li> This is great product it has cleared my face up. I had the worst acne and I love this company product Always arrive on time.</li>
            <li> I have been very happy with every Glo product I&#x27;ve tried. I got hooked about a year ago when I started getting facials. They use this line at the spa I go to. I love the smell and my skin has been great since using their stuff. I love this toner because it doesn&#x27;t sting and it smells awesome. But my skin definitely feels clean after I use it.</li>
