            <li>Thanks for a good product that works!</li>
            <li>and I could not be more pleased.  </li>
            <li>I was scared of combing my hair because there would be more hair in the comb than on my head.  </li>
            <li>SO SO much more thicker.</li>
            <li>Love love the product</li>
            <li>My hair grew once my temporary hormonal problem got better, but this product saved my hair while going through transition.</li>
            <li>Love the tingle</li>
            <li>have been shedding for many years too many yearsprobaly close to 10 years now.</li>
            <li>I also started taking Hairfinity vitamins a week ago to get even better results.</li>
            <li>After years of use I still love it.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the real deal,  thank you for a great product that works</li>
            <li>I love the ingredients</li>
            <li>and she is pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff</li>
            <li>At this time she is making me order five more for her</li>
            <li>I bought a bottle a month later, realizing that was the best blow out that week.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Great product that really works</li>
            <li>Gifted it to a friend</li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;ve noticed my hair thickening at the top where it was thinning.  </li>
            <li>i love this tonic: it  helps for my hair loss</li>
            <li>However, it does make the scalp feel very good especially when applied after washing.</li>
            <li>So far I am happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>after opening the bottle,I did not like the strong smell of alcohol.  </li>
            <li>I am sure it will work great for those who can use it for long time.</li>
            <li>but it hasn&#x27;t made that huge of a difference.</li>
            <li>it had fantastic results in hail follicle infections and fungus</li>
            <li>and I am quite detailed and know my hair.  </li>
            <li>This is actually a great product but wont give it a better review due to my negligence on not keeping up with the product.</li>
            <li>UNA Italian Hair Care, is AMAZING!</li>
            <li>Worth money investmented!</li>
            <li>but I am already so excited.</li>
            <li>and i have seen the change my roots feel clean and my hair is stronger now</li>
            <li>I feel cool on my hair.  </li>
            <li>The box was damp and the bottle wasnt full</li>
            <li>I love it because it does not have any oils, odor and dries fast in your head.  </li>
            <li>But it works &amp; feels really cool on scalp.</li>
            <li>The smell is not bad and wears off after 10 seconds and the tingly feeling is a plus.  </li>
            <li>used this product, but haven&#x27;t seen any difference hair yet, smell is not bad.</li>
            <li>Also, this product finishes really quick.</li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;m very aware that every product isn&#x27;t for everyone</li>
            <li>I love the oxygenated treatment,I bought it for myself and my daughter, and the results are gantastic,instead of loosing hair we&#x27;re gaining new grouth,I recommend it.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser added drops after shampoo and right before blow out (I have many bleach high lites and breakage).  </li>
            <li>I cannot say enough amazing things about this product and the product line.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about two weeks now and I am pleased with the results that I have seen so far.</li>
            <li>GOOD, ITEM AS EXPECTED</li>
            <li>I am seeing my growth much more clearly.  </li>
            <li>It definitely works and makes your head feel nice and tingly..</li>
            <li>The first day it burned for about two minutes but the days after there was no burn at all, just this cool tingling feeling on my scalp.</li>
            <li>I have to say so far it has been ok.</li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast though!</li>
            <li>is good to use aside from other products, my aunt uses it in her hair salon ant</li>
            <li>I put the drops in clean hair after I wash and massage it in really well.</li>
            <li>The first time that I applied the treatment to my scalp, I didn&#x27;t feel anything at all.</li>
            <li>So I would recommend buying two to three bottles if you plan to use this consistently.</li>
            <li>Definitely will post more as time goes by.</li>
            <li>really works!</li>
            <li>Just have to be consistent and have patience</li>
            <li>I just received this and tried yesterday (7/8/14) for the first time.  </li>
            <li>I did see somewhat or a difference for the first like 2 - 3 weeks</li>
            <li>My hair stopped breaking and grew back healthy and stronger.</li>
            <li>It feels really nice on my scalp because it tingles, but I have seen absolutely no results.  </li>
            <li>Rare that things really work.  </li>
            <li>MY recent experience with UNA has been very good, i have started to experience less shedding, i will do an update.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have only started using it, I&#x27;m sure after a long use the result will become prominent</li>
            <li>They also have another one just like this that smells better for dry and split ends I applied it for like 2 months before this one and</li>
            <li>It is simple to apply and grease free.</li>
            <li>but because i really wanted to start using i didnt return.  </li>
            <li>This product is a miracle in a bottom, my hair has grown so much in the pass three years.</li>
            <li>This product is the absolute TRUTH I&#x27;ve been dealing with a  receding hairline for years now where I stopped</li>
            <li>This product  really helps me with my bald areas.</li>
            <li>Very impress .</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I love it, I&#x27;ve gone through one bottle so far and have purchased my second.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t until I started gently massaging my scalp, was when I felt more of a slight TINGLING sensation.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know much about this product, I don&#x27;t normally use it.</li>
            <li>My mom made me order 4 of these for her the first time because she had natural hair and with all the seasonal changes it was taking a toll on her hair.</li>
            <li>It feels vibrant.  </li>
            <li>My checked with my doc and my thyroid levels are normal so...there isn&#x27;t any hormonal imbalances!I\\&quot;ll look for a new product!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Mainly on the left and right corners.</li>
            <li>I really like the fact that this product has an applicator which helps you to apply the treatment directly to your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference as far as hair loss which I think came from my stylist&#x27;s manipulation with the blow dryer, I still continue to put this on my hair.</li>
            <li>So far it seems to be working very well.  </li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who is willing to take a chance and try something different.</li>
            <li>Oddly enough, this item seemed to have made my hair even more dry and brittle, so I discontinued use.</li>
            <li>so those with dry scalp just be sure to oil those parts to put the moisture back in.</li>
            <li>Actually, I&#x27;m going to put this on right now</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see any new hair growth</li>
            <li>I have tried everything with thining hair and this has improved my hair and even growing new hair.</li>
            <li>My new girl has been using this on my hair and my hair is on my shoulders.  </li>
            <li>but if you keep with it you will see new hair growth.</li>
            <li>suggest you visit the site above first before buying this product though, so you know how to use it.</li>
            <li>I started using this product on December 16, 2013, and as of today, January 1, 2014 I can ALREADY see new hair growing in places where my hair was completely bald.</li>
            <li>It really works and fast it does not irritate my scalp or dry out my hair change or change the texture</li>
            <li>ONLY USED FOR 2WKS, WILL HAVE TO WAIT LONGER TO SEE THE RESULTS, i DID NOTICE MY SCALP DOES NOT ITCH MUCH</li>
            <li>I would advice to not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li>Working on my naturally kinky hair</li>
            <li>I part my hair in sections and apply directly to the scalp.</li>
            <li>I am on my second bottle of this product and can tell you that it really works.</li>
            <li>I am 100% natural (Dec. 26, 2012) with 3C/4A hair and</li>
            <li>She really didn&#x27;t have much left</li>
            <li>There is this stingy, burning sensation to it but its only momentarily depending on how much of it you use.</li>
            <li>, I tried many products and the process was slow</li>
            <li>(i had a big stress 6 months ago and lost a lot of hair,with little bold patches) and really helps with my eczema.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use this product for too long because I don&#x27;t like the smell too much.</li>
            <li>and my hairline is literally coming back to a normal hairline</li>
            <li>My hair stylist told me that the hair in my crown was thinning which is more coarse than the other parts of my hair and much harder to comb.</li>
            <li>Both my husband whose Caucasian and myself African American use the same hair line, but lucky for me I only use the serum.</li>
            <li>There were other reviewer(s) who said you might feel a burn on your scalp the first time you use it.</li>
            <li>I saw no other results.</li>
            <li>Has also thinckened my hair in general.</li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a natural treatment.</li>
            <li>Nothing got better or worse.</li>
            <li>She is black also so that whole &amp;#34;edges&amp;#34; issue&#x27;s virtually been solved</li>
            <li>Apparently they stopped making it in the regular bottle and only make it in the 12 individual vials.</li>

            <li> I am seeing my growth much more clearly.  </li>
            <li> It definitely works and makes your head feel nice and tingly..</li>

            <li> I did see somewhat or a difference for the first like 2 - 3 weeks</li>
            <li> My hair stopped breaking and grew back healthy and stronger.</li>
            <li> It feels really nice on my scalp because it tingles, but I have seen absolutely no results.  </li>
            <li> Rare that things really work.  </li>
            <li> MY recent experience with UNA has been very good, i have started to experience less shedding, i will do an update.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have only started using it, I&#x27;m sure after a long use the result will become prominent</li>
            <li> They also have another one just like this that smells better for dry and split ends I applied it for like 2 months before this one and</li>
            <li> It is simple to apply and grease free.</li>
            <li> but because i really wanted to start using i didnt return.  </li>
            <li> This product is a miracle in a bottom, my hair has grown so much in the pass three years.</li>
            <li> This product is the absolute TRUTH I&#x27;ve been dealing with a  receding hairline for years now where I stopped</li>
            <li> This product  really helps me with my bald areas.</li>
            <li> Very impress .</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I love it, I&#x27;ve gone through one bottle so far and have purchased my second.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t until I started gently massaging my scalp, was when I felt more of a slight TINGLING sensation.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know much about this product, I don&#x27;t normally use it.</li>
            <li> My mom made me order 4 of these for her the first time because she had natural hair and with all the seasonal changes it was taking a toll on her hair.</li>
            <li> It feels vibrant.  </li>
            <li> My checked with my doc and my thyroid levels are normal so...there isn&#x27;t any hormonal imbalances!I\\&quot;ll look for a new product!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Mainly on the left and right corners.</li>
            <li> I really like the fact that this product has an applicator which helps you to apply the treatment directly to your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference as far as hair loss which I think came from my stylist&#x27;s manipulation with the blow dryer, I still continue to put this on my hair.</li>
            <li> So far it seems to be working very well.  </li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who is willing to take a chance and try something different.</li>
            <li> Oddly enough, this item seemed to have made my hair even more dry and brittle, so I discontinued use.</li>
            <li> so those with dry scalp just be sure to oil those parts to put the moisture back in.</li>
            <li> Actually, I&#x27;m going to put this on right now</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any new hair growth</li>
            <li> I have tried everything with thining hair and this has improved my hair and even growing new hair.</li>
            <li> My new girl has been using this on my hair and my hair is on my shoulders.  </li>
            <li> but if you keep with it you will see new hair growth.</li>
            <li> suggest you visit the site above first before buying this product though, so you know how to use it.</li>
            <li> I started using this product on December 16, 2013, and as of today, January 1, 2014 I can ALREADY see new hair growing in places where my hair was completely bald.</li>
            <li> It really works and fast it does not irritate my scalp or dry out my hair change or change the texture</li>
            <li> ONLY USED FOR 2WKS, WILL HAVE TO WAIT LONGER TO SEE THE RESULTS, i DID NOTICE MY SCALP DOES NOT ITCH MUCH</li>
            <li> I would advice to not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> Working on my naturally kinky hair</li>
            <li> I part my hair in sections and apply directly to the scalp.</li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle of this product and can tell you that it really works.</li>
            <li> I am 100% natural (Dec. 26, 2012) with 3C/4A hair and</li>
            <li> She really didn&#x27;t have much left</li>
            <li> There is this stingy, burning sensation to it but its only momentarily depending on how much of it you use.</li>
            <li> , I tried many products and the process was slow</li>
            <li> (i had a big stress 6 months ago and lost a lot of hair,with little bold patches) and really helps with my eczema.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use this product for too long because I don&#x27;t like the smell too much.</li>
            <li> and my hairline is literally coming back to a normal hairline</li>
            <li> My hair stylist told me that the hair in my crown was thinning which is more coarse than the other parts of my hair and much harder to comb.</li>
            <li> Both my husband whose Caucasian and myself African American use the same hair line, but lucky for me I only use the serum.</li>
            <li> There were other reviewer(s) who said you might feel a burn on your scalp the first time you use it.</li>
            <li> I saw no other results.</li>
            <li> Has also thinckened my hair in general.</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a natural treatment.</li>
            <li> Nothing got better or worse.</li>
            <li> She is black also so that whole &amp;#34;edges&amp;#34; issue&#x27;s virtually been solved</li>
            <li> Apparently they stopped making it in the regular bottle and only make it in the 12 individual vials.</li>
            <li> will grow back to normal in less than 30</li>
            <li> For myself since I have used it for so long, I choose to go months without using it simply because my hair gets too long, it&#x27;s middle of my back.</li>
            <li> flat ironing it and stuff</li>
            <li> Her thin hair is full and healthly.  </li>
            <li> It does deliver this cooling/tingling sensation, especially when my scalp is wet.</li>
            <li> I used this product a long time ago and it helped me with my hair.</li>
            <li> She tried other products but said this is the only one that has her hair growing.  </li>
            <li> Well I couldn&#x27;t see an actual result because I&#x27;ve been using it with other hai loss products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year and my hair is stronger and healthy again after my last beautician damaged my hair and broke off so badly.  </li>
            <li> For myself anytime my hair is washed, I apply it before I roller set, or blow dry.</li>
            <li> I recomend this product; but if your hair is dry use it with a convitation of a leaving in  condictioner.  </li>
            <li> If not your hair when it dries will feel dry.</li>
            <li> I went from thin shoulder length hair to a much fuller grade of hair which is currently down to the middle of my back.  </li>
            <li> -7th day I loose 1-2 strands a day some days</li>
            <li> (cost a lot less than the charge she charges for single use at salon).  </li>
            <li> My problem is thinning due to a hormonal imbalance.</li>
            <li> My hair started falling from one day to the other.  </li>
            <li> I use it every other day with my protective hair style and that thinning area is no longer thinning.</li>
            <li> I changed a few things and used a few different products</li>
            <li> It has helped with my hair, at least I am not loosing the same amount that I used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!!</li>
            <li> It does weigh my hair down, when consistantly used I do see the change.</li>
            <li> Have been using it every other day but still there is no difference!</li>
            <li> I use every other wash!</li>
            <li> The bottle is already below half.</li>
            <li> There is a slight tingling feeling when his product is massaged into the scalp that makes me feel that it is working.</li>
            <li> It often doesn&#x27;t take that long, but anyone whose skeptical, I would suggest that judgement should be passed after second bottle use.</li>
            <li> nothing comes out in the comb and the 7th as day just a little bit of hairs in the comb.</li>
            <li> It is a little drying because there is alcohol in it</li>
            <li> She used it 3 x per week and her little patches have grown in.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.  </li>
            <li> With these types of products, you have to use them for a few months before seeing results.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few months.  </li>
            <li> I was  pretty shocked  because i had tried this hair growth product once</li>
            <li> once a week while in the wash part my hair comes out excessively in the comb usually evert</li>
            <li> but I am not sure I&#x27;ll buy another bottle when this one is done because I haven&#x27;t seen any effect of the product on my hair.</li>
            <li> This product has helped me in the past with my hair.  </li>
            <li> , SO I recommended for those things but for hair growth the approach is long term use sorry guys.</li>
            <li> I already have thick hair, but after two weeks of using this, I have noticed that my hair has been growing in</li>
            <li> I used to use the RR line Invigorating treatment for weak and stressed hair drops and it worked miracles.</li>
            <li> Hair longer and thick!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s getting worse.</li>
            <li> I have been using these drops for about 4 weeks now, and I must say that the shedding has decreased my 80% if not</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t made my hair worse</li>
            <li> It has alchol base so it makes hair slightly dry ....</li>
            <li> I did use it, then recognized I had selected the wrong item.</li>
            <li> My hair loss actually got worst.</li>
            <li> I am afraid to stop using it because I am on meds that take your hair out.</li>
            <li> I was thinning badly in the crown of my scalp and</li>
            <li> i was shocked she recomed this product to me</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> after opening the bottle,I did not like the strong smell of alcohol.  I decided to return this item and to buy something recommended by my local pharmacist instead.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month now. It has grown an inch since i&#x27;ve been using it day in and day out. I can tell the diffrence in the texture of my growth hair and all. Extremly good product.</li>
            <li> ONLY USED FOR 2WKS, WILL HAVE TO WAIT LONGER TO SEE THE RESULTS, i DID NOTICE MY SCALP DOES NOT ITCH MUCH LIKE IT USED TO</li>
            <li> After trying every treatment under the sun my stylist said I have the miracle cure and its only $30.  I gave in and I could not be more pleased.  I was scared of combing my hair because there would be more hair in the comb than on my head.  Terrified to wash it but with this product I may lose 1-2 stands.  The smell is not bad and wears off after 10 seconds and the tingly feeling is a plus.  Try it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about two weeks now and I am pleased with the results that I have seen so far. I really like the fact that this product has an applicator which helps you to apply the treatment directly to your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are several ways you can use this treatment. (ways are listed on the bottle)  I apply this treatment to my scalp about 3 to 4 days a week, and also on my shampoo wash day. I use this product in conjuction with the UNA Compensating Shampoo. There were other reviewer(s) who said you might feel a burn on your scalp the first time you use it. However, I personally did not experience that. The first time that I applied the treatment to my scalp, I didn&#x27;t feel anything at all. It wasn&#x27;t until I started gently massaging my scalp, was when I felt more of a slight TINGLING sensation. Nothing major!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product makes my scalp feel SO GOOD. I already have thick hair, but after two weeks of using this, I have noticed that my hair has been growing in SO SO SO much more thicker. I love it! I would definitely recommend using this product with the UNA Compensating Shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downsides about this product is that I wished it came in a bigger bottle. Also, this product finishes really quick. Like I said, I have been using this product for 2 weeks now for 3 to 4 times a week. The bottle is already below half. So I would recommend buying two to three bottles if you plan to use this consistently.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product about 4 weeks ago. Have been using it every other day but still there is no difference! My hair is falling out just like before. I don&#x27;t see any new hair growth, hair didn&#x27;t get any thicker and doesn&#x27;t appear any healthier. I would advice to not waste your money on this product. My checked with my doc and my thyroid levels are normal so...there isn&#x27;t any hormonal imbalances!I\\&quot;ll look for a new product!</li>
            <li> Best product ever! It really works and fast it does not irritate my scalp or dry out my hair change or change the texture</li>
            <li> i just got this products and it is seem it is working ...it is amazing i recommend this product of every 1 that suffering from hair loos .</li>
            <li> Love love the product</li>
            <li> This product works. I had hormonal issues and my hair was falling out. My hair grew once my temporary hormonal problem got better, but this product saved my hair while going through transition.</li>
            <li> This was suggested by a hair stylist. Did not work at all. This product did nothing for me. Waste of money.  I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product trying to look for a solution, my hair falls out in chunks. It has been 3 weeks and it&#x27;s getting worse. Listen to this review is the newest one, maybe the changed the formula. Will not repurchase.</li>
            <li> Oddly enough, this item seemed to have made my hair even more dry and brittle, so I discontinued use. I did not find this product to aid in my hair growth at all. However, it does make the scalp feel very good especially when applied after washing.</li>
            <li> i go to my hair dresser every week when she told me my hair was week and falling out at the roots i was shocked she recomed this product to me i have been using it for about 6 months and i have seen the change my roots feel clean and my hair is stronger now</li>
            <li> I recently acquired this product. No tingly sensation like others described.  I feel cool on my hair.  My problem is thinning due to a hormonal imbalance. Definitely will post more as time goes by.</li>
            <li> This Oxygenating Serum is something that I have used for almost a decade now. I cannot say enough amazing things about this product and the product line. The Oxygenating Serum helps if you have shedding hair and wish to stimulate healthier growth. For myself since I have used it for so long, I choose to go months without using it simply because my hair gets too long, it&#x27;s middle of my back. If you are seeking length, healthier fuller hair, this is a definite staple to consider adding to your regime. If you have never used it, after your second bottle you will begin to notice changes and so will your peers. It often doesn&#x27;t take that long, but anyone whose skeptical, I would suggest that judgement should be passed after second bottle use. For myself anytime my hair is washed, I apply it before I roller set, or blow dry. UNA Italian Hair Care, is AMAZING! Both my husband whose Caucasian and myself African American use the same hair line, but lucky for me I only use the serum.</li>
            <li> the best treatment ever..after 3 use I see difference...Cudowny swierzy zapach</li>
            <li> Excellent product for fine, breaking hair.  It is very good if your hair is falling. I recomend this product; but if your hair is dry use it with a convitation of a leaving in  condictioner.  If not your hair when it dries will feel dry.</li>
            <li> It does weigh my hair down, when consistantly used I do see the change. Love the tingle</li>
            <li> really works! I have tried everything with thining hair and this has improved my hair and even growing new hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using these drops for about 4 weeks now, and I must say that the shedding has decreased my 80% if not more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is my story:&lt;br /&gt;I have been shedding for many years too many yearsprobaly close to 10 years now. I get my hair washed and blow dryed once a week while in the wash part my hair comes out excessively in the comb usually evert tooth of the comb is covered with hair, within the 4 day of my wash my hair starts shedding with every stroke of the comb and sometimes my hands hair all over my shoulder back and sink this is grom day 4-7th day which is the wash. Now on the 4th day no hair combs out in  the comb anf from day 4-7th day I loose 1-2 strands a day some days nothing comes out in the comb and the 7th as day just a little bit of hairs in the comb. I&#x27;m hoping to see some retention now and I hope this continues to work and I also hope I don&#x27;t have to use this forever!!!!</li>
            <li> This product is Amazing. Within a week of use I noticed my hair filling in. Really remarkable. It is simple to apply and grease free. Love it!</li>
            <li> THE PRODUCT IS AN EXCELENT ONE!! WHEN I STARTED TO USE IT I SAW THE RESULTS IN JUST ! WEEK&amp;#60; PERFECT! FAST SHIPPING</li>
            <li> About 3 years ago my mom permed my hair and I lost the back of my hair so I had to cut my hair up to my ears, I tried many products and the process was slow then my hair stylist told me about this Una product and I saw results within the 3 or 4 times that I applied it. My hair grew to the middle of my back in a matter of months and it was stronger than ever. I then started mistreating my hair flat ironing it and stuff and my hair was weaker than ever I forgot about this product for a while and now im using it again and this is the 3rd time I apply it in a month and my hair looks fuller. I believe if you apply it 2 to 3 times a week the results are faster. They also have another one just like this that smells better for dry and split ends I applied it for like 2 months before this one and my hair is now healthier. If you&#x27;re looking for longer and fuller hair this is the one. I also suggest you buy it online I pay $35 at the salon. Wish I would of seen this before</li>
            <li> I started using this product on December 16, 2013, and as of today, January 1, 2014 I can ALREADY see new hair growing in places where my hair was completely bald. I also started taking Hairfinity vitamins a week ago to get even better results.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for a close friend.  I waited to post y review until she&#x27;d had a chance to use it and formulate an opinion.  She has nothing but good things to say about it; I&#x27;m glad I got it for her.</li>
            <li> GOOD, ITEM AS EXPECTED</li>
            <li> is good to use aside from other products, my aunt uses it in her hair salon ant it had fantastic results in hail follicle infections and fungus i have seen two guys with hair holes on their heads and after two months of treatment  GONE, SO I recommended for those things but for hair growth the approach is long term use sorry guys.</li>
            <li> After years of use I still love it.  Great for hair growth, stimulates follicle, smells good, and doesn&#x27;t leave greasy feel</li>
            <li> used this product, but haven&#x27;t seen any difference hair yet, smell is not bad. I purchased two bottles and this will last for a while, before I make my next purchase .</li>
            <li> This stuff has been working on my temples. Has also thinckened my hair in general. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a natural treatment. Just have to be consistent and have patience</li>
            <li> I cannot say that I actually saw an improvement. Nothing got better or worse. Menthol feeling felt good on scalp but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> Worth money investmented! U could feel the difference in 1 month! Love it! Recomended...great product. Need to try! Hair longer and thick!</li>
            <li> I just received this and tried yesterday (7/8/14) for the first time.  It does make your scalp tingle in a good way.  It feels vibrant.  I&#x27;m only giving it a 3 because i just started using.  Note the packaging was so so.  They used a plastic bag to put the box in and you can tell some of mine spilled over.  The box was damp and the bottle wasnt full but because i really wanted to start using i didnt return.  That needs improvement.</li>
            <li> This is my second time purchasing this product. I love it. It works wonders for one&#x27;s hair and scalp. My stylist uses this product when I get my hair done and this is how I became hooked. Lol</li>
            <li> This product is a miracle in a bottom, my hair has grown so much in the pass three years.</li>
            <li> This product is the absolute TRUTH I&#x27;ve been dealing with a  receding hairline for years now where I stopped how often I see my barber and I been using this product for 2 weeks and my hairline is literally coming back to a normal hairline all of my friends and family noticed it if your losing your hair or just wanna have your hair grow trust me on my life GET THIS PRODUCT!!!!</li>
            <li> This was a great product. I actually got this recommended from this site here: hairlossnow.info&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use this product along side the ones in the site above your hair will grow back to normal in less than 30 days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest you visit the site above first before buying this product though, so you know how to use it.</li>
            <li> I am seeing my growth much more clearly.  Working on my naturally kinky hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the real deal,  thank you for a great product that works</li>
            <li> I used this when my hair was thinning to help it get thicker and grow. It definitely works and makes your head feel nice and tingly..</li>
            <li> Ive been using this for two months. No noticeable results but the menthol  feels good on my scalp. I love the ingredients but I am not sure I&#x27;ll buy another bottle when this one is done because I haven&#x27;t seen any effect of the product on my hair. I will update once I&#x27;m done with the bottle for a final review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: July 2012... I finished the bottle. I saw no decrease in my shedding and no increase in growth. Just a menthol related feeling coolness on my scalp. I saw no other results. Very disappointed it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> This is actually a great product but wont give it a better review due to my negligence on not keeping up with the product. So I cant say how fast or a good time frame on when I seen great results. I did see somewhat or a difference for the first like 2 - 3 weeks and then I stopped using the product. I will say that I have purchased similar products and this one gave faster results --- if this info is any help. I will be purchasing this product soon and follow through this time around and will give another review! Shipping was super fast though!</li>
            <li> I used to use another brand of hair drops and then I stopped. My hair stylist told me that the hair in my crown was thinning which is more coarse than the other parts of my hair and much harder to comb. I put the drops in clean hair after I wash and massage it in really well. The scalp feels amazing like it&#x27;s breathing. Although I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference as far as hair loss which I think came from my stylist&#x27;s manipulation with the blow dryer, I still continue to put this on my hair. Actually, I&#x27;m going to put this on right now &#x3D;D  It is a little drying because there is alcohol in it so those with dry scalp just be sure to oil those parts to put the moisture back in.</li>
            <li> My hair started falling from one day to the other.  This product was recommended by a friend who lost all his hair.  It worked for him and now me.  I love it because it does not have any oils, odor and dries fast in your head.  I have recommended to all my friends who are losing their hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for only 4 days and I already noticed that when I comb my hair I only lose about one maybe two strands.  I part my hair in sections and apply directly to the scalp. So far it seems to be working very well.  The first day it burned for about two minutes but the days after there was no burn at all, just this cool tingling feeling on my scalp. From what I can tell its definitely working but the jury is still out I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE**&lt;br /&gt;As of March 2012 my hair has grown about 3 &amp; 1/2 inches since I began using this product. I went from thin shoulder length hair to a much fuller grade of hair which is currently down to the middle of my back.  Just to see the difference I actually stopped using the treatment for about a month-6 weeks and I could immediately tell the difference in my scalp. Although I&#x27;m very aware that every product isn&#x27;t for everyone I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who is willing to take a chance and try something different.</li>
            <li> This product has helped me in the past with my hair.  I noticed a big change when using this product.  So I put one for my sister.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to it by my Dominican shop she started using it everyone I came I went from a shaved back neck to a shoulder length hair styles. The trick is getting your hair done regularly and switching every six weeks to the drops for oil! I love my UNA DROPS!</li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle of this product and can tell you that it really works. My hair has grown a great deal. It came out from chemo, but now I have a nice length. It no longer falls out all over the place. I also told my mom about it and she is pleased with it. She tried other products but said this is the only one that has her hair growing.  I am afraid to stop using it because I am on meds that take your hair out.</li>
            <li> I totally recommend this product. I was thinning badly in the crown of my scalp and my then hair dresser recommended this product. I use it every other day with my protective hair style and that thinning area is no longer thinning. My hair is actually stronger oppose to the thinning I was experiencing. I also take biotin supplement and recently started using a horsetail supplement.</li>
            <li> MY recent experience with UNA has been very good, i have started to experience less shedding, i will do an update.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> My mom is 56 and says she loves it. She is black also so that whole &amp;#34;edges&amp;#34; issue&#x27;s virtually been solved</li>
            <li> Well I couldn&#x27;t see an actual result because I&#x27;ve been using it with other hai loss products. But I still like it.</li>
            <li> This product  really helps me with my bald areas. Amazing treatment.</li>
            <li> With these types of products, you have to use them for a few months before seeing results. This product was recommend from a Dominican Salon that I go to from time to time. There is a slight tingling feeling when his product is massaged into the scalp that makes me feel that it is working. So far I am happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item back in August because I was experiencing some breakage in the back of my hair. Mainly on the left and right corners. These two areas have ALWAYS been breakage issues for me. I am 100% natural (Dec. 26, 2012) with 3C/4A hair and even when I relaxed my hair, this was always a problem. I used to use the RR line Invigorating treatment for weak and stressed hair drops and it worked miracles. My hair stopped breaking and grew back healthy and stronger. Apparently they stopped making it in the regular bottle and only make it in the 12 individual vials. So I decided to try this because the ingredients are very similar. I have to say so far it has been ok. It hasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;wow&#x27;ed&amp;#34; me like the RR product did. Also, I haven&#x27;t been using it as religiously as I should be. It hasn&#x27;t made my hair worse but it hasn&#x27;t made that huge of a difference. I&#x27;m going to try to use it every night and see. It does deliver this cooling/tingling sensation, especially when my scalp is wet. The RR line product did the same. I will probably do an update in about a month.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know much about this product, I don&#x27;t normally use it. I did use it, then recognized I had selected the wrong item.</li>
            <li> It did not make my edges grow, but I guess it will depend on your hair texture, this is why I rated it  3 stars only.  It&#x27;s just my opinion.</li>
            <li> I love the oxygenated treatment,I bought it for myself and my daughter, and the results are gantastic,instead of loosing hair we&#x27;re gaining new grouth,I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year and my hair is stronger and healthy again after my last beautician damaged my hair and broke off so badly.  My new girl has been using this on my hair and my hair is on my shoulders.  Love this stuff</li>
            <li> Very impress . Thanks.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product for my mother and have seen wonderful results.  It&#x27;s not an instant change but if you keep with it you will see new hair growth. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few months.  It just does not work.  It feels really nice on my scalp because it tingles, but I have seen absolutely no results.  Disappointed.</li>
            <li> My mom made me order 4 of these for her the first time because she had natural hair and with all the seasonal changes it was taking a toll on her hair. She really didn&#x27;t have much left and it couldn&#x27;t even be combed. By using this product her hair made a great recovery. I was  pretty shocked  because i had tried this hair growth product once and it never worked and now even i use this product for myself just to add some length. At this time she is making me order five more for her and i&#x27;m definitely going to use one of it for myself again. There is this stingy, burning sensation to it but its only momentarily depending on how much of it you use. Definitely give it a try. Hair always need help and its ours.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser added drops after shampoo and right before blow out (I have many bleach high lites and breakage).  That blow out was fuller and I am quite detailed and know my hair.  I feel after one use it did something.  Rare that things really work.  I bought a bottle a month later, realizing that was the best blow out that week.  And she said bring it w you everytime (cost a lot less than the charge she charges for single use at salon).  I see here she charges just about the same as you all paid for bottle.  I will do an update in a month but I am already so excited.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Beginning to see some results within 2 weeks. Best thing I have tried so far. Thanks for a good product that works!</li>
            <li> I have only started using it, I&#x27;m sure after a long use the result will become prominent</li>
            <li> Never thought that this product might work, but it does!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hairdresser used it on my hair once, then i bought it thinking like...uhhmmm lets give it a try. And when the bottle was almost done, i found myself getting a second one. It has helped with my hair, at least I am not loosing the same amount that I used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!! 100%</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for over a month and I have had no results.  I guess it&#x27;s not for everyone.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a couple months now and I love it. My hair breaks very easily and all around my face my hair was short because of blow drying and straightening it. I changed a few things and used a few different products but none of them seems to work as well as this product. It works so well that I just ordered another bottle.</li>
            <li> Worked for me in the sense that it stopped fall out.  Didn&#x27;t make the front of my grow as wanted, but it worked wonders for my granddaughter.  Her thin hair is full and healthly.  She used it 3 x per week and her little patches have grown in.  Have recommended it for coworker.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use this product for too long because I don&#x27;t like the smell too much. It works somewhat when I was using it. I am sure it will work great for those who can use it for long time.</li>
            <li> Helps with breakage. Only thing is if you have African American hair virgin you will feel a dryness on the roots of the hair. It has alchol base so it makes hair slightly dry .... But it works &amp; feels really cool on scalp. Just don&#x27;t use day of a relaxer because it will sting.  I use every other wash!</li>
            <li> I am a hair dresser and I been using this product on myself and my clients since 2011 I just wish I could find a distributor in Atlanta who sells it it does grow your hair out it takes about one month to start showing results but they r very satisfying results</li>
            <li> Great product that really works</li>
            <li> Gifted it to a friend and she said it totally worked...</li>
            <li> I love it, I&#x27;ve gone through one bottle so far and have purchased my second.  I notice a shine to my hair and the dryness is gone also.  Also when I comb my hair i don&#x27;t hear that popping or snapping at the ends.  Also, I&#x27;ve noticed my hair thickening at the top where it was thinning.  I recommend this product.  It is wonderful.</li>
            <li> I immediately started using this product as soon as i received it in the mail. It&#x27;s been well over the recommended timeframe for use as per the instructions on the box and still nothing! I want a refund!</li>
            <li> I used this product a long time ago and it helped me with my hair. It works. I suggest using all una products for hair grow or hair loss prevention</li>
            <li> I did not see any improvement in my hair.  My hair loss actually got worst.</li>
            <li> i love this tonic: it  helps for my hair loss (i had a big stress 6 months ago and lost a lot of hair,with little bold patches) and really helps with my eczema.  i will continue to use this product</li>
