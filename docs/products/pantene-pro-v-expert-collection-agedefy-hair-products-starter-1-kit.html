            <li>and she said she has been trying this new expert line of Pantene; so I&#x27;ve been using since 1/4/14 with excellent results.  </li>
            <li>Both the shampoo and conditioner have a light scent that is pleasant.</li>
            <li>It is handsomely designed as well as effective.</li>
            <li>Feels good, looks much better and is easy to brush.</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner smell good but they aren&#x27;t anything special.  </li>
            <li>So glad I found this stuff.</li>
            <li>Am enjoying this product.</li>
            <li>Love love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>It does not seem to adversely affect my colored treated hair, my hair looks fuller, healthy and shiny,  What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
            <li>and it gives my hair a more fuller, shinier look throughout.  </li>
            <li>As a matter of fact a friend of mine who I hadn&#x27;t seen for a while commented on how full and nice my hair</li>
            <li>Pretty good product.</li>
            <li>I have baby fine fly away hair and even with a perm every three months, it&#x27;s still a problem to have it look decent.</li>
            <li>I decided against ordering more and have moved on to trying something else for my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>First week of use - so far impressed with the products.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t believe it looks at good as it does.</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner smelled really good and were very moisturizing,</li>
            <li>product as described, well packed, fair price, fast delivery</li>
            <li>I had used the conditioner first when I got a sample and then liked it</li>
            <li>I recently ordered full size bottles because I&#x27;m so happy with how much better my hair is.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of weeks and my hair looks and feels fantastic.</li>
            <li>love the fresh scent of all three items in this kit.</li>
            <li>Did buy again however hoping for more of a miracle this time ;)</li>
            <li>Now I will go back to my anti breakage pantene because I know that is good shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I keep getting compliments on how full my hair looks.</li>
            <li>This product has some bold claims.</li>
            <li>I have fine, thin hair and this product makes it look healthy and smells great.  </li>
            <li>; my &#x27;do--just a little, mind you--since as of now, I still need to add some kind of product afterward to actually be able to style/</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t worth the price.</li>
            <li>The scent is fresh, the conditioner is thick and rich, great for detangling my curlts.  </li>
            <li>I receive the package right on time...</li>
            <li>My hair felt soft and was easy to comb through after using them.  </li>
            <li>I was having real problems with static and fly-aways, leaving my hair looking like a wild woman.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my 50s and my hair, always fine has become much finer and more brittle with too much hair left on the hairbrush.  </li>
            <li>I have put it on daily for three days now and my hair is better.</li>
            <li>I have super fine and thinish blonde hair, so I ordered this kit hoping it would noticeably thicken my hair.  </li>
            <li>Maybe this would work better for someone with grays as I am only 30</li>
            <li>Have not used for all that long, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>This definitely seems to increase hair density/thickness, so maybe it&#x27;s just my crappy thinning hair, but I wish it did more to &amp;#34;greasify&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone with hair that is becoming fine due to age.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll update after I have tried this for a longer time, but so far, I&#x27;m pleased and very surprised that this system seems to be working.</li>
            <li>I want it to feel clean and soft and swingy.</li>
            <li>I did notice that the products made the shorter hairs around my face even more wavy than normal, which is where most of my grays are, but they are soft waves and not particularly unruly.  </li>
            <li>Then go to your local Walmart, which has the cheapest prices for the normal size containers! :)</li>
            <li>through Amazon who currently has it listed by itself for $13.15, a good price for the full size.&lt;br /&gt;After just one use I do see a slight improvement of the hair on the crown of my head.</li>
            <li>The big surprise though was the Advanced thickener.  </li>
            <li>maybe even too much so.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t sticky or crunchy at all, but it didn&#x27;t give my roots much volume either.  </li>
            <li>Really made my thinning hair look and feel thicker.</li>
            <li>fortunately I like this and will be buying the regular sizes.</li>
            <li>My hair really does appear to be thicker</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>Many of the other products to help hair have also irritated my scalp.</li>
            <li>Even my husband, who has a head full of thick white-grey hair is using the shampoo to make his hair more manageable.  </li>
            <li>Just fried my hair completely and hot oil and resting my hair and Wen didn&#x27;t help.  </li>
            <li>Now with this product, the fullness stays all day and even wake up with full hair the 2nd day.</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy full sizes of everything when I run out.</li>
            <li>Hair has more body and less breakage.</li>
            <li>This Agedefy starter kit, at least short term, seems to be living up to the advertising claims which was a welcome surprise.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>set my newly thickened strands.</li>
            <li>I probably won&#x27;t purchase the shampoo and conditioner again because I have other favorites, but will most likely purchase the Thickening Treatment 4.2 Fl Oz.</li>
            <li>I am a 50+ female with very long wavy blonde hair with bangs, interspersed with strands of curly gray hairs around my face and on top of my head.  </li>
            <li>WOW.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy hair</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen much of difference with my hair, wondering if I need the entire Age Defying line to see a difference.</li>
            <li>So far, my hair comes out shiny with lots of body and volume.  </li>
            <li>I suspect you need to use it frequently.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After trying various shampoos and different products for volume with varying degrees of success, I saw this and decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve gotten older, my hair isn&#x27;t as thick or strong as it used to be.</li>
            <li>Instead, hair felt normal instead of old and fragile.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the starter kit, which lasts a long time because you don&#x27;t need much product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m African-Am (50 yo) with curly shoulder length hair (middle of back when straight)</li>
            <li>I only use the conditioner once per week because I live in the humid deep South and conditioner</li>
            <li>This product really tames my hair without leaving it limp and lifeless, like so many other products do that are designed to tame fly-aways.  </li>
            <li>First day I put it on wet hair, the next two days on dry hair.  </li>
            <li>I guess &amp;#34;starter kit&amp;#34; should have tipped me off, but I was nonetheless surprised just how small the shampoo and conditioner really was when I received them.</li>

            <li> Haven&#x27;t used this product long enough to see results of actual hair growth</li>
            <li> The samples were small but they are very concentrated</li>
            <li> Products with argon oil make my hair feel like straw covered with oil and irritate my scalp if left on too long.  </li>
            <li> I was on my way to getting a very short haircut to remove my ultra frizzy dry hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t color my hair and I have long hair.  </li>
            <li> I have very thin fine hair.</li>
            <li> Saw the same products, double the size and half the price at Costco.</li>
            <li> When it came time for the next application, my had begun to feel a little dry, then improved again once the next application was made.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE:  At two weeks out, I have NOTICEABLY less hair in my brush and my hair is starting to grow in length again.  </li>
            <li> I expected it to coat my hair and irritate my scalp.  </li>
            <li> I gave it a 4 star only because the creme rinse leaves my hair kinda limp.</li>
            <li> I have thinning white hair so any thin areas are very apparent.</li>
            <li> I use all three every other day.</li>
            <li> I use the shampoo and the thickening spray every other day.  </li>
            <li> Breakage has gone way down.</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t want to pull the ranking down just because the price is</li>
            <li> Not a clean feeling at all.</li>
            <li> This seems to make little difference to my hair at this point.</li>
            <li> My hair looks like hair again, not a pile of dead grass.</li>
            <li> I used this everyday for two weeks and did not notice any difference in my hair.  </li>
            <li> I believe this was a waste of my money</li>
            <li> Before when I would style my hair, it would just look limp by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> tends to make my hair limp and refuse to hold a curl.  </li>
            <li> , i really not recomend this product i thought my hair was to fell down!!!</li>
            <li> This has made my hair shiny,manageable and looking less like it&#x27;s having a mid-life crisis!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past month or so.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that my formerly thick hair was looking thin and limp,</li>

            <li> I found this kit for 18.00 plus tax at Krogers, so I&#x27;m giving the product only four stars. However, for the product itself WOW.  I was on my way to getting a very short haircut to remove my ultra frizzy dry hair. Nothing I used seemed to be helping to repair the damage I did using a color removing product I&#x27;d purchased at Sally&#x27;s with the recommendation of the store clerk. Just fried my hair completely and hot oil and resting my hair and Wen didn&#x27;t help.  The package of Age Defy caught my eye and I decided to give one last product a try before going ultra short.  So glad I found this stuff. My hair looks like hair again, not a pile of dead grass. Feels silky too.</li>
            <li> I used this everyday for two weeks and did not notice any difference in my hair.  Now I will go back to my anti breakage pantene because I know that is good shampoo.  I believe this was a waste of my money, I will not buy this one again.</li>
            <li> Your hair will benefit from this product! Great scent!</li>
            <li> I bought this without a lot of expectations.  I&#x27;m in my 50s and my hair, always fine has become much finer and more brittle with too much hair left on the hairbrush.  Products with argon oil make my hair feel like straw covered with oil and irritate my scalp if left on too long.  Many of the other products to help hair have also irritated my scalp. I have a daughter who keeps having me try rather expensive shampoos and hair repair products.  I don&#x27;t color my hair and I have long hair.  None of the products were satisfactory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This Agedefy starter kit, at least short term, seems to be living up to the advertising claims which was a welcome surprise.  Both the shampoo and conditioner have a light scent that is pleasant. My hair felt soft and was easy to comb through after using them.  The big surprise though was the Advanced thickener.  I expected it to coat my hair and irritate my scalp.  Instead, hair felt normal instead of old and fragile.  I have put it on daily for three days now and my hair is better. Feels good, looks much better and is easy to brush. When it came time for the next application, my had begun to feel a little dry, then improved again once the next application was made.  First day I put it on wet hair, the next two days on dry hair.  Worked equally well.  I&#x27;ll update after I have tried this for a longer time, but so far, I&#x27;m pleased and very surprised that this system seems to be working.</li>
            <li> I have baby fine fly away hair and even with a perm every three months, it&#x27;s still a problem to have it look decent. Since I&#x27;ve started using this product it has added volume and shine. I really can&#x27;t believe it looks at good as it does. As a matter of fact a friend of mine who I hadn&#x27;t seen for a while commented on how full and nice my hair looked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside? This price is ridiculous. I bought the kit at Wal-Mart for $10 and some change.</li>
            <li> Expensive disappointment...shampoo does not lather well, conditioner did work well but so does Suave..the extra did not show me any enhancement  like stated...Will not purchase again</li>
            <li> I have tried each item severl times and still find that it leaves my hair with a funky residue feel to it. I don&#x27;t like the way it makes my hair feel. Not a clean feeling at all.</li>
            <li> Smells really good and all projects seem to do what they&#x27;ve promised.This has made my hair shiny,manageable and looking less like it&#x27;s having a mid-life crisis!</li>
            <li> Am enjoying this product. My hairdresser says my hair feels thicker. This is a great trial size set that also works for travel. For daily use, you will want the larger sizes.</li>
            <li> I have super fine and thinish blonde hair, so I ordered this kit hoping it would noticeably thicken my hair.  The shampoo and conditioner smelled really good and were very moisturizing, maybe even too much so.  The serum was the best part!  It wasn&#x27;t sticky or crunchy at all, but it didn&#x27;t give my roots much volume either.  I decided against ordering more and have moved on to trying something else for my fine hair.  Maybe this would work better for someone with grays as I am only 30 and that is not one of my issues.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used this product long enough to see results of actual hair growth but I like the feel and smell of my hair.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner smell good but they aren&#x27;t anything special.  The &amp;#34;thickening spray&amp;#34; just makes my hair feel strawlike and dirty.  This isn&#x27;t worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past month or so. I use all three every other day. I keep getting compliments on how full my hair looks. I would agree with my friends. I have naturally wavy hair and I am over 50. Before when I would style my hair, it would just look limp by the end of the day. And forget the 2nd day - it just looked even flatter. Now with this product, the fullness stays all day and even wake up with full hair the 2nd day. I purchased the starter kit, which lasts a long time because you don&#x27;t need much product. Will definitely buy full sizes of everything when I run out.</li>
            <li> Have just used it once but it has done what it said already. Hair has more body and less breakage.</li>
            <li> This product has some bold claims. It says it will make you 10 years younger. I bought it for my girlfriend. She didn&#x27;t like it all. I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My daughter recommended this set. Love love it. I have very thin fine hair. Breakage has gone way down. Recommend</li>
            <li> When I wash my hair I want it to feel clean and soft and swingy. This stuff makes my hair feel like it needs to be washed. Don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> I gave it a 4 star only because the creme rinse leaves my hair kinda limp. The shampoo is nice and the thickener does add some body.</li>
            <li> Have not used for all that long, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen much of difference with my hair, wondering if I need the entire Age Defying line to see a difference.</li>
            <li> Really made my thinning hair look and feel thicker. Will buy again, especially the Thickening Treatment (pump spray bottle).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week.  I&#x27;ve noticed that my formerly thick hair was looking thin and limp, as I&#x27;ve aged.&lt;br /&gt;After trying various shampoos and different products for volume with varying degrees of success, I saw this and decided to give it a try.  I love this product.  I shampoo and condition my short hair every day.  So far, my hair comes out shiny with lots of body and volume.  The directions say it takes about 2 weeks to see a difference, with maximum results in about a month of daily use.  I will continue to use it.  It does not seem to adversely affect my colored treated hair, my hair looks fuller, healthy and shiny,  What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
            <li> I guess &amp;#34;starter kit&amp;#34; should have tipped me off, but I was nonetheless surprised just how small the shampoo and conditioner really was when I received them. Saw the same products, double the size and half the price at Costco.</li>
            <li> First week of use - so far impressed with the products.</li>
            <li> Perfect size and price to try this product.  Nice for travel.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Pretty good product. The shampoo, conditioner and the hair treatment all were good. The samples were small but they are very concentrated so they last quite a while.</li>
            <li> the product itself was great! but the bottles were so small!! way too expensive for the size. i only got four washes out of it</li>
            <li> This definitely seems to increase hair density/thickness, so maybe it&#x27;s just my crappy thinning hair, but I wish it did more to &amp;#34;greasify&amp;#34; my &#x27;do--just a little, mind you--since as of now, I still need to add some kind of product afterward to actually be able to style/set my newly thickened strands.</li>
            <li> Found the kit @ Target for ~$10 and saw the individual sizes at Walmart Sham/cond $7.97 @ and the spray for $18.97.  While having dinner with my friend I noticed her hair looked different and I thought it was her hair color and she said she has been trying this new expert line of Pantene; so I&#x27;ve been using since 1/4/14 with excellent results.  I&#x27;m African-Am (50 yo) with curly shoulder length hair (middle of back when straight) and it gives my hair a more fuller, shinier look throughout.  The scent is fresh, the conditioner is thick and rich, great for detangling my curlts.  I will continue to use and recommend to everyone.  I think it&#x27;s great they offered the entire kit @ a reasonable price - nothing worse than spending too much for a product you don&#x27;t like; but fortunately I like this and will be buying the regular sizes.</li>
            <li> product as described, well packed, fair price, fast delivery</li>
            <li> I have only used the three products once but I loved how they immediately made my hair look.  I am a 50+ female with very long wavy blonde hair with bangs, interspersed with strands of curly gray hairs around my face and on top of my head.  I also use blonde hair color to cover my grays.  I was having real problems with static and fly-aways, leaving my hair looking like a wild woman.  This product really tames my hair without leaving it limp and lifeless, like so many other products do that are designed to tame fly-aways.  It also gives my hair a beautiful shine.  I now have body without even blow-drying and it looks like I have teased my hair, even though I haven&#x27;t.  I did notice that the products made the shorter hairs around my face even more wavy than normal, which is where most of my grays are, but they are soft waves and not particularly unruly.  I only used the thickening spray when my hair was towel dryed, not every day like it recommends.  I am trying to save money and make the products last longer.  I will definitely be buying these again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  At two weeks out, I have NOTICEABLY less hair in my brush and my hair is starting to grow in length again.  It was at bust length and I couldn&#x27;t get it to grow any longer.  It must have been breaking off because now it is noticeably longer after two weeks.  I think this product is wonderful and I will continue to purchase it despite the expensive price.  I only use the conditioner once per week because I live in the humid deep South and conditioner tends to make my hair limp and refuse to hold a curl.  I use the shampoo and the thickening spray every other day.  I would recommend this to anyone with hair that is becoming fine due to age.  Even my husband, who has a head full of thick white-grey hair is using the shampoo to make his hair more manageable.  It looks softer and shinier as a result of this product.</li>
            <li> I have thinning white hair so any thin areas are very apparent. I had used the conditioner first when I got a sample and then liked it so I opted to try all the products. My hair really does appear to be thicker and I know it is healthier because now I don&#x27;t have to wash it every day so it will \\&quot;fluff\\&quot; up. I think that I will be using this for quite a while!</li>
            <li> I receive the package right on time...I do recommend it highly to women like me with thinning hair,it is a great product at a great price!!!</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair and this product makes it look healthy and smells great.  Even got my mom a set.</li>
            <li> I am totally impressed with these products. My hair is shinier and thicker after 2 months. Nothing works overnight.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve gotten older, my hair isn&#x27;t as thick or strong as it used to be. I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of weeks and my hair looks and feels fantastic. I recently ordered full size bottles because I&#x27;m so happy with how much better my hair is.</li>
            <li> This might work but not in me!!!, my head burn so badly and i only use it for three days. I literally felt like my head was on fire and i had to wait almost for a week to stop that burn on my head, i really not recomend this product i thought my hair was to fell down!!!</li>
            <li> This is a good set with a generous supply of conditioner. It is handsomely designed as well as effective.</li>
            <li> $24.86 is the price listed at the time of this review.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this kit at CVS for $11.46 and have seen it elsewhere for $10-and change.&lt;br /&gt;Zero stars for the price, but I&#x27;m giving the product 4* (I don&#x27;t want to pull the ranking down just because the price is outrageous.)&lt;br /&gt;I love the fresh scent of all three items in this kit. I probably won&#x27;t purchase the shampoo and conditioner again because I have other favorites, but will most likely purchase the Thickening Treatment 4.2 Fl Oz. through Amazon who currently has it listed by itself for $13.15, a good price for the full size.&lt;br /&gt;After just one use I do see a slight improvement of the hair on the crown of my head. I&#x27;ll keep using it and try to get back here with an updated review.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo and conditioner. I&#x27;d tested them before in a blind trial and were waiting for them to be released to the public for more than a year now. I bought this to verify these were the same products and they were! Try this system - its excellent! Then go to your local Walmart, which has the cheapest prices for the normal size containers! :)</li>
            <li> Ummm smells great however haven&#x27;t seen my hair get better yet. Did buy again however hoping for more of a miracle this time ;)</li>
            <li> This seems to make little difference to my hair at this point. I suspect you need to use it frequently.</li>
