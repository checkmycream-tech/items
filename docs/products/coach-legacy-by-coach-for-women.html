            <li>I was very excited to be able to get this perfume on Amazon:)</li>
            <li>A true asset to the Amazon community!</li>
            <li>As always, a beautiful fragrance, that has been discontinued, and now only available through Amazon.</li>
            <li>She really loved this perfume and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere, so she was pleasantly surprised when she got it.</li>
            <li>received promptly, price was good value and just what was wanted by one young lady.&lt;br /&gt;thanks.  xxxx</li>
            <li>This is my favorite fragrance and this retailer shipped it out right away</li>
            <li>I think it is not the original.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and was exactly what I wanted!!</li>
            <li>Not too strong, but just right.</li>
            <li>Many Thanks.  </li>
            <li>The scent was fair, but it had no lasting scent.</li>
            <li>but I cannot understand why people love this perfume so much.</li>
            <li>if I could post pictures I&#x27;d love to show what this guy is really doing.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>Packaging was adequate and item arrived undamaged.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and without problem.</li>
            <li>Wow I thought, that is a smell I love, and I don&#x27;t mind nuzzling around my wife&#x27;s neck to smell it either ;)</li>
            <li>Coach Legacy Eau De Parfum Spray for Women has amber, wooden and floral notes that give rise to memories of frolic under a solitary oak tree in a large secluded field of blooming wildflowers on a warm spring day.</li>
            <li>This perfume first caught my attention when I got a sample of it from the Coach store.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent, BUT as another reviewer said, it just doesn&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li>Love this perfume, the only sent I can wear</li>
            <li>Thanks for making me look like a Hero to my Wife!</li>
            <li>Good all year round, too.</li>
            <li>It is very overpowering as well.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>its just my nose getting use to the smell but seems like wears off fast</li>
            <li>had look at this before in the store, and was very please when I located this cologne on amazon,</li>
            <li>My second purchase of this item, and I&#x27;m never disappointed.</li>
            <li>Such a clean, suttle scent that stays w/you throughout the day.</li>
            <li>The seller had fast shipping and the perfume was brand new.</li>
            <li>This woman is high style and class, just like my wife, so I knew I had to get some of this.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with it a few years ago when I received it at Christmas.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The initial notes are like a breath of fresh air.  </li>
            <li>right back here.</li>
            <li>Once I smelled it in the Dept Store I new</li>
            <li>Brand new in box.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s is a very mature scent.</li>
            <li>Package arrived on time as promised and item was exactly as it was initially described.  </li>
            <li>It settles down after a few minutes to the second notes which is equally beautiful.  </li>
            <li>Soft, classical and above unique.</li>
            <li>It is my only perfum I like and is able to wear to work everyday.</li>
            <li>The base notes are the best.  </li>
            <li>The Coach stores are no longer selling this particular fragrance, so when I saw it here, I knew it might be my last chance.&lt;br /&gt;She</li>
            <li>The person clearly just took a used bottle of this stuff tried to pour some other perfume in it and box and seal it up and send it out as the real thing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a casual kind of gal that hates over powering smells.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not as generous in my rating as she was with hers, because I certainly wouldn&#x27;t have bought this product if I had known it would be a waste of my money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit hard to find but it is so worth</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a bit hard to find but it is so worth</li>
            <li> The smell lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> I usually have several different perfumes that I rotate between, but I end up using this one daily.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews on fragrances because it is such a deeply personal taste.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as expected.  </li>
            <li> The bottle was cracked scratched HALF MISSING and a different color and smell then what I ordered.</li>
            <li> The perfume came in the regular box that it usually comes in</li>
            <li> but the item was not completely wrapped in the usual way.</li>
            <li> I started buying this perfume a little over a year ago.  </li>
            <li> I had a hard time finding it so needless to say I was very grateful..</li>
            <li> I have someone everyday</li>
            <li> Compliments as usual.</li>
            <li> He sent me a rude email when I complained about what had happened and</li>
            <li> This is absolutely disappointing especially after buying two bottles for $120.</li>
            <li> Hands down!!!</li>
            <li> little disappointing it didn&#x27;t come in the round case as shown..</li>
            <li> I have worn this perfume every day for a few years and something was wrong with the smell of this one.  </li>
            <li> Very hard to find &amp; discontinued, grateful that it is sold here.</li>
            <li> This was a poor choice that I made.</li>
            <li> I read other bad reviews</li>
            <li> Too bad Coach doesn&#x27;t sell it anymore.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this fragrance! I wish Coach had not discontinued it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite fragrance and this retailer shipped it out right away and it arrived in perfect condition.  Many Thanks.  I will be ordering again in the future!</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected.  Smells really good.  Get lots of compliments.</li>
            <li> This perfume first caught my attention when I got a sample of it from the Coach store.  I immediately fell in love, it has such a perfect combination of notes.  I get many compliments on it from strangers.  The seller had fast shipping and the perfume was brand new.</li>
            <li> I got this after catching the aroma of a work colleague and asking her which fragrance she was wearing. This woman is high style and class, just like my wife, so I knew I had to get some of this. The Coach stores are no longer selling this particular fragrance, so when I saw it here, I knew it might be my last chance.&lt;br /&gt;She loves it, and so do I. Very nice!</li>
            <li> Coach Legacy Eau De Parfum Spray for Women has amber, wooden and floral notes that give rise to memories of frolic under a solitary oak tree in a large secluded field of blooming wildflowers on a warm spring day. Also, it smells good!</li>
            <li> Superb AUTHENTIC product as I stated before!  Scent lasts throughout my day.  I refresh one time, if we go out to dinner. Compliments as usual.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping. Great quality!</li>
            <li> This is the best smelling perfume...ever! My sister in law had some and I tried it and fell in love. Not too strong, but just right. Good all year round, too. I was impressed, too, how quickly it arrived in my mail! (within days) I know where to go when I run out...right back here. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I started buying this perfume a little over a year ago.  Once I smelled it in the Dept Store I new it was the one for me.  I think us women look for that perfect scent that matches the way we want to present ourselves.  We want someone to smell this on another person and bring us to mind because we are known for that smell.&lt;br /&gt;And this perfume is that one perfect scent for me.  I have never bought a 2nd bottle of any perfume, but I am actually almost going to need to get my 3rd.&lt;br /&gt;This is a luxurious scent that has a sexy lingering appeal.  I haven&#x27;t bought it on amazon before, but for my next bottle I will because it is cheaper here than in Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for Coach Legacy for about 2 years.  I am so happy to be able to have it again.  It is my only perfum I like and is able to wear to work everyday.</li>
            <li> Fast Delivery, Great Product</li>
            <li> The scent was fair, but it had no lasting scent.</li>
            <li> Package arrived on time as promised and item was exactly as it was initially described.  Packaging was adequate and item arrived undamaged.</li>
            <li> Bought it as a Christmas present for my mom. She really loved this perfume and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere, so she was pleasantly surprised when she got it. She&#x27;s happy. Would definitely recommend this product for anyone who can&#x27;t find it elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Maybe it just doesn&#x27;t mix with my body chemistry but I cannot understand why people love this perfume so much. It&#x27;s is a very mature scent. It is very overpowering as well. Not a fan.</li>
            <li> It smells so good, without being overwhelming! I usually have several different perfumes that I rotate between, but I end up using this one daily.</li>
            <li> 100% perfect! Will continue to keep purchasing!</li>
            <li> Great perfume, smells awesome, lasts all day, one of my go-to perfumes. Very hard to find &amp; discontinued, grateful that it is sold here.</li>
            <li> BEST FRAGRANCE! Hands down!!! This scent is perfect for every kind of woman! I&#x27;m a casual kind of gal that hates over powering smells. This perfume is the best I&#x27;ve ever smelt! Such a clean, suttle scent that stays w/you throughout the day. I&#x27;m so saddened to hear that Coach has either discontinued this scent or hopefully it&#x27;s seasonal. I MISS YOU DEARLY!</li>
            <li> very good I hope because it was a gift to my daugther, Delivery wise excellent. Thanks</li>
            <li> This was a poor choice that I made. The perfume came in the regular box that it usually comes in but the item was not completely wrapped in the usual way. The biggest problem is that the perfume does not smell like the Coach perfume should smell.  I have worn this perfume every day for a few years and something was wrong with the smell of this one.  I think it is not the original.  I read other bad reviews but I tried it any way since Coach does not sell the perfume any more and I loved it.</li>
            <li> I gave the Coach Legacy perfume as gift. Recipient loved it. Would buy it again to give again in the future.</li>
            <li> This is my FAVORITE perfume. Too bad Coach doesn&#x27;t sell it anymore. I&#x27;ve opted for buying it in the oils. Can&#x27;t even tell the difference. :)</li>
            <li> little disappointing it didn&#x27;t come in the round case as shown..but wonderful priced</li>
            <li> Brand new in box. Love this Coach perfume....would order again.  Wish Coach would bring this fragrance back.</li>
            <li> 5 Stars. Great transaction. Just as described. A true asset to the Amazon community!</li>
            <li> Great service and product!</li>
            <li> i love the smell got some compliments maybe its just my nose getting use to the smell but seems like wears off fast</li>
            <li> I was very excited to be able to get this perfume on Amazon:) I fell in love with it a few years ago when I received it at Christmas. I had a hard time finding it so needless to say I was very grateful.. New and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> would recommend this to any coach lover, came on time, and what a great deal, had look at this before in the store, and was very please when I located this cologne on amazon, came on time, Just GREAT</li>
            <li> The smell lasts all day long. I wear it in the morning, and I can still the hint of it when I get home at night. Very nice. I would definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews on fragrances because it is such a deeply personal taste.  However,I love this fragrance.  It&#x27;s a bit hard to find but it is so worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The initial notes are like a breath of fresh air.  It settles down after a few minutes to the second notes which is equally beautiful.  The base notes are the best.  The cologne stays on for hours and I find myself sniffing my wrist when I need a pick me up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m no expert on fragrance so I can&#x27;t tell you what flower or scent but if you go to a flower garden, I imagine this what that garden smells like.  Soft, classical and above unique.</li>
            <li> I love the scent, BUT as another reviewer said, it just doesn&#x27;t last.  I&#x27;m not as generous in my rating as she was with hers, because I certainly wouldn&#x27;t have bought this product if I had known it would be a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> I stumbled upon this perfume by accident.  While in the Coach store picking out a Mother&#x27;s Day gift for my wife, I happened to pick this up and smell it at the check out counter.  Wow I thought, that is a smell I love, and I don&#x27;t mind nuzzling around my wife&#x27;s neck to smell it either ;)</li>
            <li> This perfume is fresh and has a wonderful, clean scent.  I have someone everyday ask what I am wearing.  Timeless and probably will never go out of style...</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and was exactly what I wanted!!</li>
            <li> Love this perfume, the only sent I can wear</li>
            <li> this scent smells sooo good!! Wish they brought it back in Coach stores</li>
            <li> Christmas gift. received promptly, price was good value and just what was wanted by one young lady.&lt;br /&gt;thanks.  xxxx&lt;br /&gt;xxx</li>
            <li> This Coach perfume as just as advertised, a great price, plus very quicl shipping.&lt;br /&gt;WIll purchase from this Seller again for sure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many Thanks for making me look like a Hero to my Wife!</li>
            <li> Excellent product! It made an excellent gift!</li>
            <li> As always, a beautiful fragrance, that has been discontinued, and now only available through Amazon. My second purchase of this item, and I&#x27;m never disappointed.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume at a GREAT price! It arrived quickly and without problem. I would definitely purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Received two Coach Legacy perfumes supposed to be sealed in the box. What I got was a substance that was NOT Coach Legacy in the Coach Legacy bottle. The bottle was cracked scratched HALF MISSING and a different color and smell then what I ordered. The person clearly just took a used bottle of this stuff tried to pour some other perfume in it and box and seal it up and send it out as the real thing. He sent me a rude email when I complained about what had happened and if I could post pictures I&#x27;d love to show what this guy is really doing. This is absolutely disappointing especially after buying two bottles for $120.</li>
