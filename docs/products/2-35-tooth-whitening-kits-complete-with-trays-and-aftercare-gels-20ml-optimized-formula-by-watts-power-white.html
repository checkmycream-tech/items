    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I have ordered it twice now because I&#x27;ve been so impressed, and I&#x27;ve recommended it to friends looking to whiten their teeth.</li>
            <li>Works great!  </li>
            <li>Excellent service A++++++</li>
            <li>The best part is I don&#x27;t have any sensitivity issues, though they included remineralization gel to help should any issues arise.</li>
            <li>But it works perfect.</li>
            <li>what the heck,I&#x27;ll give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;Soooo happy I did.</li>
            <li>I experienced some sensitivity while drinking some flavored water yesterday.</li>
            <li>Apart from that everything is great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After about 5 applications I stopped because it looks great to me.</li>
            <li>This is a great kit to buy.</li>
            <li>This worked great.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!!</li>
            <li>Dont buy it if you think the price was cheap like me!!!</li>
            <li>and it was a perfect fit!  </li>
            <li>For the price its a good value.</li>
            <li>Good product</li>
            <li>Overall just an excellent, excellent purchase and experience.</li>
            <li>The top tray was easiest to do, and I fit it perfectly.</li>
            <li>But since the instructions said you don&#x27;t need a perfect fit, I decided it would be ok and didn&#x27;t worry about it.</li>
            <li>This product worked much better and was remarkably cheaper.  </li>
            <li>It is a nice Do-it-yourself whitening tool.</li>
            <li>It cuts easily with a good pair of scissors.    </li>
            <li>It is very easy to use, and I have never had any tooth sensitivity to the product.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied, and I would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li>Also, the directions say that you do not need a perfect fit for the product to work, but the better the fit the better</li>
            <li>Glad i did, because these syringes full of magic work great.</li>
            <li>I opted for a sports athlete mouth guard and have noticed it fits and feels better.</li>
            <li>Did not even try this product, resold it to a friend with more patience.  </li>
            <li>It was made for me...:)))</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re certainly not terrible in appearance, but they&#x27;re also not pearly whites.</li>
            <li>This product did not perform better than anything else I&#x27;ve used:  strips, gels, etc...  </li>
            <li>Custom fitting the trays was not a problem.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>With one or two more treatments, I&#x27;m hoping to be where I want for now.     </li>
            <li>But if you follow directions, you should be able to minimize any discomfort or queasiness.    </li>
            <li>Listerine pre-brush mouthwash gives a better whiting result.</li>
            <li>I also found that it works best if you put a pretty decent coating of gel on each tooth, because saliva does seep in and start to wash it out.</li>
            <li>As I said, I had problems fitting the bottom tray, so it didn&#x27;t fit to my teeth as well as the top tray did.</li>
            <li>So that&#x27;s when I decided to try to remold the bottom tray and make it fit better.</li>
            <li>the gel can cause irritation to the gums but so far I&#x27;ve experienced none.  </li>
            <li>I had no problems as far as burning of my gums; I think the strips of paper towel help greatly to reduce the odds of that happening.    </li>
            <li>When useing its a good idea not to put too much on your teeth and or in the tray that comes with it.</li>
            <li>The kits are also nicely packaged, with good quality vinyl ziplock pouches to hold all the pieces after you open them.</li>
            <li>I liked the results very much.</li>
            <li>I took the time to make sure I got a good fit, heating and molding them a few times until I felt they were as good as need be.</li>
            <li>That way you can gradually cut it down to a perfect fit.</li>
            <li>I first dabbed tiny beads of the whitening gel, but after fitting them in my mouth, and not feeling any sort of burning sensation, I removed them and added more to make sure my teeth got a good coating.    </li>
            <li>This is nothing spectacular, but it certainly has been noticeable.</li>
            <li>After two days of using this for 15 minutes I noticed a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>and it was cheap</li>
            <li>For five days I applied the gel with a q-tip, put the guards on (no need to shrink-they fit as is), and relaxed for 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I kept adding water until it looked like a smooth mix with no bubbles.  </li>
            <li>Now for how it works:  Fantastic, i noticed results after one application.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic gels</li>
            <li>so the molds fit over my teeth but not my gums.</li>
            <li>A very well thought-out and effective package.</li>
            <li>Enjoy...</li>
            <li>Simple and very effective.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t hot enough to soften them, so I tried again with a two minute boil and   it worked perfectly, making them pliable without making them too hot for my mouth.</li>
            <li>Be sure to shake out the excess water before inserting the tray in your mouth, so you don&#x27;t burn your mouth with hot water.     </li>
            <li>The strips worked better and I saw results after the first thirty-minute application.</li>
            <li>I also am useing a tray that was special made for my teeth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very strong and will burn your gums if left on for more than 10-15 min.</li>
            <li>If you have bright yellow teeth, don&#x27;t expect movie star looks within a week.    </li>
            <li>I had tried everything and my teeth were bright yellow.</li>
            <li>The trays that come with it are OK, but I noticed that I really had to hold the tray in place with my tongue for it to stick.</li>
            <li>I feel so good knowing &amp; seeing that my teeth are looking white again..</li>
            <li>I really wish Amazon allowed half-star reviews as I feel this deserves a 3.5 more than either a 3 or a 4.     </li>
            <li>I really like the shape-able trays that come with this, although I had to use both pair to get a good form because I accidentally ruined the first pair with the hot water.</li>
            <li>Strongly recommended since my teeth were pretty stained.</li>
            <li>Boil water, insert for literally 3 seconds and quickly place in your mouth and suck the air out so</li>
            <li>Also, you don&#x27;t need to use a tremendous amount.  </li>
            <li>I appreciate the strength of the whitening since you only need to leave it on for short periods to get great results unlike many lower percentage products.</li>
            <li>First, I liked to dry my teeth off because I figured the gel would stick to my teeth better.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li>But it does the job, really whitens!!</li>
            <li>I also prepped a cup of cool (not cold) water and as soon as I had the first mold fitted, I doused the cool water in my mouth to harden the mold.</li>
            <li>I saw results after the first 30 minute session and the instructions were ridiculously verbose, which was excellent.</li>
            <li>complaints would mainly be about the trays, but thats an easy fix, so do yourself a favor and buy</li>
            <li>For the price, its worth it.</li>
            <li>I put off whitening my teeth for years because of the expected costs involved, but this is a perfect solution for a ridiculously low price.</li>
            <li>After having little luck with Crest Whitening Strips, I tried these and found them to be very effective.</li>
            <li>And instead of putting the gel in the tray, I applied it directly to my teeth using the syringe and just spread it around on my teeth with the tip, which was quick and easy to do.</li>
            <li>The price is also right.</li>
            <li>This product is awesome BUT be very careful how long you leave it on.  </li>
            <li>I leave it in for a good 20 mins and my teeth look slightly brighter instantly&lt;</li>
            <li>The product was delivered in two days from ordering, so it arrived super fast.</li>
            <li>Anyway, seeing the great reviews for this whitening kit and the much higher whitening strength of the gel, I decided that for the price it was worth at least trying out.     </li>
            <li>Very fast delivery.</li>
            <li>The first time, it stung for the first 5 minutes after that no pain and pain-free for the additional 4 treatments.    </li>
            <li>I will edit this review if I experience any more sensitivity in the future.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;I would have to say this is some pretty potent stuff to whiten my teeth after only using it once, and also to cause pain after 2 uses.</li>
            <li>I knew the peroxide gel was more likely to cause</li>
            <li>This is my first ever review on amazon, i thought i would take the time to say how well this product works.    </li>
            <li>First, please please plase, do the thermo molding to the dental trays before you try applying the gels.  </li>
            <li>But do note, i freaked out after the first time.  </li>
            <li>After the second treatment, the results were even better.</li>
            <li>The first step is to boil water and soften the plastic tooth trays which you then insert and mold to your teeth.</li>
            <li>I first tried boiling a coffee cup of water for one minute in a microwave.   </li>
            <li>Also, if you store the product in the fridge it will last for 3 more years.</li>
            <li>I had a question for the customer support and it too was answered super fast and very helpful.     </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the old Rembrandt home whitening strips (not the pro ones) and one brush-on system (can&#x27;t remember which; all I remember is that the paste and tiny brushes were not dramatically effective and were a bit of a hassle to use).    </li>
            <li>This is the trickiest part of the whole thing, but it&#x27;s really not difficult.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice much difference in my teeth when I used this the first time, but my wife did so</li>
            <li>Luster White did nothing after the first use, but I noticed a HUGE difference after using this 35% gel.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to anyone who has strong teeth and no sensitivity issues.  </li>
            <li>The purchase of sensitivity tooth paste largely minimized this sensitivity.    </li>
            <li>Large supply-perfect for two people.  </li>
            <li>In short, so long as you&#x27;re not expecting a miracle from this kit and are realistic about its potential, this is a good product that Iwould feel comfortable recommending to friends.</li>
            <li>, you shouldn&#x27;t have much of a problem.</li>
            <li>This works very well.</li>
            <li>I needed immedate results and throughout the time my teeth/gums did tingle a bit but not too much</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think the mouth trays in this kit fit as well as the ones made by the dentist, but my teeth whitened just the same.</li>
            <li>The bleach works fast</li>
            <li>I found the trays that come with it really dont mold  well to your teeth.</li>
            <li>I expected a more drastic change in whitening</li>
            <li>My teeth are whiter and this product is far better than Crest White Strips.</li>
            <li>Granted this is only my second time to whiten my teeth, and I haven&#x27;t really tried many of the other products available, but this kit worked amazingly well and everyone has commented on how white my teeth are and have even asked me what I used and where I got it.</li>
            <li>My teeth really aren&#x27;t that far off from being white, but I bought these figuring I could have a super quick fix, and really make them stand out without much effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>Works much more quickly than 16%, which I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li>My only note here is that the teeth in the rear of my mouth are very ground down, and the gel would always find a way to get on them somehow (even though I followed instructions perfectly and was incredibly careful with gel application).</li>
            <li>I used it a month before I got married, and one of the first things I noticed with my wedding pictures was how blindingly white my teeth looked, which is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Mine were definitely yellow from light smoking; after two treatments they were more white than yellow.     </li>
            <li>I am turned off by the high prices of other teeth whitening products, so I decided to try this kit because it was marked down almost 70% of the original price and had good reviews.</li>
            <li>Just if you have really sensitive teeth, I would consult a dentist first.</li>
            <li>But after a few whitening sessions, I noticed my top teeth were getting much whiter than my bottom teeth and that they they didn&#x27;t seem to be whitening much at all.</li>
            <li>Since the product comes with a big syringe of gel, you have more than enough to use and don&#x27;t have to skimp.</li>
            <li>If you can manage to use it a few times though, you will have bright white teeth, guaranteed!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s main purpose is to keep the saliva from washing away the gel.     </li>
            <li>I noticed more improvement after the first treatment than I had after using either of the other systems for their entire prescribed regimen.   </li>
            <li>These are not as easy to use as the strips, but then again, you&#x27;ll get much faster results and will probably have to use them far fewer times than the strips or other systems.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve completed five 30 min applications, but I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a change.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t waste my money elsewhere.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t leave it on even a second longer than instructions suggested, and I made sure the gel was not near the gum lining, and used the revitalizing minerals</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t buy again, I will look for a different seller that has the product individually packaged and more professional.</li>
            <li>One thing nice is that the gel did not cause any sensitivity common with these types of products.</li>
            <li>One issue that I noticed a few reviewers had were with fitting the mouth guards.</li>
            <li>Completely normal and fades by the morning if you apply it at night.    </li>
            <li>I decided to finally do something about it by going for the professional grade trays for a quick fix.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re very squeamish and gag easily, you might have trouble keeping the units in your mouth for the required 30 minutes.   </li>
            <li>At the same time, I also ran my fingers along the entire tray to make sure that it fit tight against my teeth.</li>
            <li>This is the only whitening kit I&#x27;ve ever used so it is hard for me to compare but this kit is easy to use, the trays are easy to make if you follow the instructions.</li>
            <li>all I can say is WOW!</li>
            <li>Apparently this was from using too much gel, and it seeped out onto my gums.  </li>
            <li>After several tries, I finally found that actually physically holding the tray tightly to my teethworked best.</li>
            <li>Have given them a rest for a couple weeks and will try again, but will separate the treatments by a few days to allow my mouth to recover between assaults from this strong stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had my teeth whitened by a professional nor have i used whitening trays or strips.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive teeth, I&#x27;d avoid this, because it will give you shooting pain.</li>
            <li>Myself it didn&#x27;t bother me at all, but my sister has sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>I have sensitive gums, but this did not irritate them.  </li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t stick with it enough to see real results.  </li>
            <li>so my teeth don&#x27;t get sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the kit now for about 5 days and have seen considerable whitening.</li>
            <li>What I like to do is apply the gel directly to my teeth, using the stick of a Q-tip (non-fuzzy), then put on the guard.</li>
            <li>This product strips the enamel off your teeth and makes them extremely sensitive.</li>
            <li>My teeth whitened more on the biting surface than the portions near the gums, also there were a few white spots.  </li>
            <li>Then I got looking at the nice, thin appicator on the Opalescence syringe and wondered if I might super-glue it on to the end of the Watts applicator.  </li>
            <li>But I did have a little more trouble with the bottom because it is more difficult to get the proper suction on the tray for it to fit right.</li>
            <li>If you tilt your face down and remove the trays quickly, you&#x27;ll reduce the chances of getting the goo in your mouth and gagging.    </li>
            <li>So if you put too thin of a coating, the saliva will wash it away pretty quickly and not give enough time to really whiten.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not entirely sure the purpose of applying it (to strengthen enamel after the peroxide exposure?), but it can&#x27;t hurt as a free addition.    </li>
            <li>The smaller stain on my left front tooth completely disappeared and I saw significant lightening on the other front tooth.  </li>
            <li>This gel is MUCH faster and teeth are MUCH whiter in MUCH less time!  </li>
            <li>one last thing, my first application, the gums which protrude between the teeth bleached white,and i was scared i ruined my gums haha, but it went away after a few hours.  </li>
            <li>I put a thin strip from end to end, and it spread out very smoothly over my teeth.    </li>
            <li>The included trays are not spectacular but they work just fine.  </li>
            <li>I watched 30 minutes of TV, and when I removed the trays and rinsed my mouth, I was very pleasantly surprised at the improvement after only one treatment.    </li>
            <li>Whitening has been modest to moderate; wish I&#x27;d done a \\&quot;before\\&quot; photo</li>
            <li>It is pretty sour</li>
            <li>As long as you make a good attempt, I don&#x27;t think you can go critically wrong.    </li>
            <li>The only draw back is if it can be a bit sensitive on the teeth and gums at times.  </li>
            <li>Based on my results after only two 30 minute sessions, I&#x27;d guess you could get two or even three complete whitenings from each of the two kits included, depending on how yellow your teeth are.</li>
            <li>this is completely normal and is due to</li>
            <li>i am not sure how this product works with the others but at first that i have tried this product the tray didnt fit on my teeth and the GEL gives me Gum irritation and few times of use the felt that my teeth will fall down because of the pain...</li>

            <li> Dont buy it if you think the price was cheap like me!!!</li>
            <li> and it was a perfect fit!  </li>

            <li> Good product</li>
            <li> Overall just an excellent, excellent purchase and experience.</li>
            <li> The top tray was easiest to do, and I fit it perfectly.</li>
            <li> But since the instructions said you don&#x27;t need a perfect fit, I decided it would be ok and didn&#x27;t worry about it.</li>
            <li> This product worked much better and was remarkably cheaper.  </li>

            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied, and I would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> Also, the directions say that you do not need a perfect fit for the product to work, but the better the fit the better</li>
            <li> Glad i did, because these syringes full of magic work great.</li>
            <li> I opted for a sports athlete mouth guard and have noticed it fits and feels better.</li>
            <li> Did not even try this product, resold it to a friend with more patience.  </li>
            <li> It was made for me...:)))</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re certainly not terrible in appearance, but they&#x27;re also not pearly whites.</li>
            <li> This product did not perform better than anything else I&#x27;ve used:  strips, gels, etc...  </li>
            <li> Custom fitting the trays was not a problem.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> With one or two more treatments, I&#x27;m hoping to be where I want for now.     </li>
            <li> But if you follow directions, you should be able to minimize any discomfort or queasiness.    </li>
            <li> Listerine pre-brush mouthwash gives a better whiting result.</li>
            <li> I also found that it works best if you put a pretty decent coating of gel on each tooth, because saliva does seep in and start to wash it out.</li>
            <li> As I said, I had problems fitting the bottom tray, so it didn&#x27;t fit to my teeth as well as the top tray did.</li>
            <li> So that&#x27;s when I decided to try to remold the bottom tray and make it fit better.</li>
            <li> the gel can cause irritation to the gums but so far I&#x27;ve experienced none.  </li>
            <li> I had no problems as far as burning of my gums; I think the strips of paper towel help greatly to reduce the odds of that happening.    </li>
            <li> When useing its a good idea not to put too much on your teeth and or in the tray that comes with it.</li>
            <li> The kits are also nicely packaged, with good quality vinyl ziplock pouches to hold all the pieces after you open them.</li>
            <li> I liked the results very much.</li>
            <li> I took the time to make sure I got a good fit, heating and molding them a few times until I felt they were as good as need be.</li>
            <li> That way you can gradually cut it down to a perfect fit.</li>
            <li> I first dabbed tiny beads of the whitening gel, but after fitting them in my mouth, and not feeling any sort of burning sensation, I removed them and added more to make sure my teeth got a good coating.    </li>
            <li> This is nothing spectacular, but it certainly has been noticeable.</li>
            <li> After two days of using this for 15 minutes I noticed a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> and it was cheap</li>
            <li> For five days I applied the gel with a q-tip, put the guards on (no need to shrink-they fit as is), and relaxed for 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I kept adding water until it looked like a smooth mix with no bubbles.  </li>
            <li> Now for how it works:  Fantastic, i noticed results after one application.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic gels</li>
            <li> so the molds fit over my teeth but not my gums.</li>
            <li> A very well thought-out and effective package.</li>
            <li> Enjoy...</li>
            <li> Simple and very effective.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t hot enough to soften them, so I tried again with a two minute boil and   it worked perfectly, making them pliable without making them too hot for my mouth.</li>
            <li> Be sure to shake out the excess water before inserting the tray in your mouth, so you don&#x27;t burn your mouth with hot water.     </li>
            <li> The strips worked better and I saw results after the first thirty-minute application.</li>
            <li> I also am useing a tray that was special made for my teeth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very strong and will burn your gums if left on for more than 10-15 min.</li>
            <li> If you have bright yellow teeth, don&#x27;t expect movie star looks within a week.    </li>
            <li> I had tried everything and my teeth were bright yellow.</li>
            <li> The trays that come with it are OK, but I noticed that I really had to hold the tray in place with my tongue for it to stick.</li>
            <li> I feel so good knowing &amp; seeing that my teeth are looking white again..</li>
            <li> I really wish Amazon allowed half-star reviews as I feel this deserves a 3.5 more than either a 3 or a 4.     </li>
            <li> I really like the shape-able trays that come with this, although I had to use both pair to get a good form because I accidentally ruined the first pair with the hot water.</li>
            <li> Strongly recommended since my teeth were pretty stained.</li>
            <li> Boil water, insert for literally 3 seconds and quickly place in your mouth and suck the air out so</li>
            <li> Also, you don&#x27;t need to use a tremendous amount.  </li>
            <li> I appreciate the strength of the whitening since you only need to leave it on for short periods to get great results unlike many lower percentage products.</li>
            <li> First, I liked to dry my teeth off because I figured the gel would stick to my teeth better.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li> But it does the job, really whitens!!</li>
            <li> I also prepped a cup of cool (not cold) water and as soon as I had the first mold fitted, I doused the cool water in my mouth to harden the mold.</li>
            <li> I saw results after the first 30 minute session and the instructions were ridiculously verbose, which was excellent.</li>
            <li> complaints would mainly be about the trays, but thats an easy fix, so do yourself a favor and buy</li>
            <li> For the price, its worth it.</li>
            <li> I put off whitening my teeth for years because of the expected costs involved, but this is a perfect solution for a ridiculously low price.</li>
            <li> After having little luck with Crest Whitening Strips, I tried these and found them to be very effective.</li>
            <li> And instead of putting the gel in the tray, I applied it directly to my teeth using the syringe and just spread it around on my teeth with the tip, which was quick and easy to do.</li>
            <li> The price is also right.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome BUT be very careful how long you leave it on.  </li>
            <li> I leave it in for a good 20 mins and my teeth look slightly brighter instantly&lt;</li>
            <li> The product was delivered in two days from ordering, so it arrived super fast.</li>
            <li> Anyway, seeing the great reviews for this whitening kit and the much higher whitening strength of the gel, I decided that for the price it was worth at least trying out.     </li>
            <li> Very fast delivery.</li>
            <li> The first time, it stung for the first 5 minutes after that no pain and pain-free for the additional 4 treatments.    </li>
            <li> I will edit this review if I experience any more sensitivity in the future.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;I would have to say this is some pretty potent stuff to whiten my teeth after only using it once, and also to cause pain after 2 uses.</li>
            <li> I knew the peroxide gel was more likely to cause</li>
            <li> This is my first ever review on amazon, i thought i would take the time to say how well this product works.    </li>
            <li> First, please please plase, do the thermo molding to the dental trays before you try applying the gels.  </li>
            <li> But do note, i freaked out after the first time.  </li>
            <li> After the second treatment, the results were even better.</li>
            <li> The first step is to boil water and soften the plastic tooth trays which you then insert and mold to your teeth.</li>
            <li> I first tried boiling a coffee cup of water for one minute in a microwave.   </li>
            <li> Also, if you store the product in the fridge it will last for 3 more years.</li>
            <li> I had a question for the customer support and it too was answered super fast and very helpful.     </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the old Rembrandt home whitening strips (not the pro ones) and one brush-on system (can&#x27;t remember which; all I remember is that the paste and tiny brushes were not dramatically effective and were a bit of a hassle to use).    </li>
            <li> This is the trickiest part of the whole thing, but it&#x27;s really not difficult.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much difference in my teeth when I used this the first time, but my wife did so</li>
            <li> Luster White did nothing after the first use, but I noticed a HUGE difference after using this 35% gel.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to anyone who has strong teeth and no sensitivity issues.  </li>
            <li> The purchase of sensitivity tooth paste largely minimized this sensitivity.    </li>
            <li> Large supply-perfect for two people.  </li>
            <li> In short, so long as you&#x27;re not expecting a miracle from this kit and are realistic about its potential, this is a good product that Iwould feel comfortable recommending to friends.</li>
            <li> , you shouldn&#x27;t have much of a problem.</li>
            <li> This works very well.</li>
            <li> I needed immedate results and throughout the time my teeth/gums did tingle a bit but not too much</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think the mouth trays in this kit fit as well as the ones made by the dentist, but my teeth whitened just the same.</li>
            <li> The bleach works fast</li>
            <li> I found the trays that come with it really dont mold  well to your teeth.</li>
            <li> I expected a more drastic change in whitening</li>
            <li> My teeth are whiter and this product is far better than Crest White Strips.</li>
            <li> Granted this is only my second time to whiten my teeth, and I haven&#x27;t really tried many of the other products available, but this kit worked amazingly well and everyone has commented on how white my teeth are and have even asked me what I used and where I got it.</li>
            <li> My teeth really aren&#x27;t that far off from being white, but I bought these figuring I could have a super quick fix, and really make them stand out without much effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> Works much more quickly than 16%, which I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li> My only note here is that the teeth in the rear of my mouth are very ground down, and the gel would always find a way to get on them somehow (even though I followed instructions perfectly and was incredibly careful with gel application).</li>
            <li> I used it a month before I got married, and one of the first things I noticed with my wedding pictures was how blindingly white my teeth looked, which is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Mine were definitely yellow from light smoking; after two treatments they were more white than yellow.     </li>
            <li> I am turned off by the high prices of other teeth whitening products, so I decided to try this kit because it was marked down almost 70% of the original price and had good reviews.</li>
            <li> Just if you have really sensitive teeth, I would consult a dentist first.</li>
            <li> But after a few whitening sessions, I noticed my top teeth were getting much whiter than my bottom teeth and that they they didn&#x27;t seem to be whitening much at all.</li>
            <li> Since the product comes with a big syringe of gel, you have more than enough to use and don&#x27;t have to skimp.</li>
            <li> If you can manage to use it a few times though, you will have bright white teeth, guaranteed!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s main purpose is to keep the saliva from washing away the gel.     </li>
            <li> I noticed more improvement after the first treatment than I had after using either of the other systems for their entire prescribed regimen.   </li>
            <li> These are not as easy to use as the strips, but then again, you&#x27;ll get much faster results and will probably have to use them far fewer times than the strips or other systems.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve completed five 30 min applications, but I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a change.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t waste my money elsewhere.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t leave it on even a second longer than instructions suggested, and I made sure the gel was not near the gum lining, and used the revitalizing minerals</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy again, I will look for a different seller that has the product individually packaged and more professional.</li>
            <li> One thing nice is that the gel did not cause any sensitivity common with these types of products.</li>
            <li> One issue that I noticed a few reviewers had were with fitting the mouth guards.</li>
            <li> Completely normal and fades by the morning if you apply it at night.    </li>
            <li> I decided to finally do something about it by going for the professional grade trays for a quick fix.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re very squeamish and gag easily, you might have trouble keeping the units in your mouth for the required 30 minutes.   </li>
            <li> At the same time, I also ran my fingers along the entire tray to make sure that it fit tight against my teeth.</li>
            <li> This is the only whitening kit I&#x27;ve ever used so it is hard for me to compare but this kit is easy to use, the trays are easy to make if you follow the instructions.</li>
            <li> all I can say is WOW!</li>
            <li> Apparently this was from using too much gel, and it seeped out onto my gums.  </li>
            <li> After several tries, I finally found that actually physically holding the tray tightly to my teethworked best.</li>
            <li> Have given them a rest for a couple weeks and will try again, but will separate the treatments by a few days to allow my mouth to recover between assaults from this strong stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had my teeth whitened by a professional nor have i used whitening trays or strips.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive teeth, I&#x27;d avoid this, because it will give you shooting pain.</li>
            <li> Myself it didn&#x27;t bother me at all, but my sister has sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> I have sensitive gums, but this did not irritate them.  </li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t stick with it enough to see real results.  </li>
            <li> so my teeth don&#x27;t get sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the kit now for about 5 days and have seen considerable whitening.</li>
            <li> What I like to do is apply the gel directly to my teeth, using the stick of a Q-tip (non-fuzzy), then put on the guard.</li>
            <li> This product strips the enamel off your teeth and makes them extremely sensitive.</li>
            <li> My teeth whitened more on the biting surface than the portions near the gums, also there were a few white spots.  </li>
            <li> Then I got looking at the nice, thin appicator on the Opalescence syringe and wondered if I might super-glue it on to the end of the Watts applicator.  </li>
            <li> But I did have a little more trouble with the bottom because it is more difficult to get the proper suction on the tray for it to fit right.</li>
            <li> If you tilt your face down and remove the trays quickly, you&#x27;ll reduce the chances of getting the goo in your mouth and gagging.    </li>
            <li> So if you put too thin of a coating, the saliva will wash it away pretty quickly and not give enough time to really whiten.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not entirely sure the purpose of applying it (to strengthen enamel after the peroxide exposure?), but it can&#x27;t hurt as a free addition.    </li>
            <li> The smaller stain on my left front tooth completely disappeared and I saw significant lightening on the other front tooth.  </li>
            <li> This gel is MUCH faster and teeth are MUCH whiter in MUCH less time!  </li>
            <li> one last thing, my first application, the gums which protrude between the teeth bleached white,and i was scared i ruined my gums haha, but it went away after a few hours.  </li>
            <li> I put a thin strip from end to end, and it spread out very smoothly over my teeth.    </li>
            <li> The included trays are not spectacular but they work just fine.  </li>
            <li> I watched 30 minutes of TV, and when I removed the trays and rinsed my mouth, I was very pleasantly surprised at the improvement after only one treatment.    </li>
            <li> Whitening has been modest to moderate; wish I&#x27;d done a \\&quot;before\\&quot; photo</li>
            <li> It is pretty sour</li>
            <li> As long as you make a good attempt, I don&#x27;t think you can go critically wrong.    </li>
            <li> The only draw back is if it can be a bit sensitive on the teeth and gums at times.  </li>
            <li> Based on my results after only two 30 minute sessions, I&#x27;d guess you could get two or even three complete whitenings from each of the two kits included, depending on how yellow your teeth are.</li>
            <li> this is completely normal and is due to</li>
            <li> i am not sure how this product works with the others but at first that i have tried this product the tray didnt fit on my teeth and the GEL gives me Gum irritation and few times of use the felt that my teeth will fall down because of the pain...</li>
            <li> tooth sensitivity which is why I also purchased the Luster White process which boasted that it would not given it is a less sensitive gel which does not contain carbamide peroxide.    </li>
            <li> I am useing a small art brush to put on teeth and in tray and it seems to help from putting too much on your teeth.</li>
            <li> First off, when the directions say no more than 3 seconds or so, it means it!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll also need to carefully trim down the trays until they cover only a little bit of your gums, don&#x27;t go right to the teeth line otherwise</li>
            <li> The dental trays were not a good fit even when I cut them down to size.</li>
            <li> Anything longer than that melts the tray so much that it folds and loses all shape.</li>
            <li> The product does as it advertises: it whitens your teeth, so long as you&#x27;re not expecting any wonders.</li>
            <li> The remineralizing gel was strange.</li>
            <li> Following instructions, I then carefully trimmed off some of the excess plastic</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used more expensive products with less satisfactory results.</li>
            <li> I will definitely order this product again after my current kit runs out (which won&#x27;t be for a few months; this kit lasts a long time!).</li>
            <li> No need to aim for total results in only a few days.</li>
            <li> Although it can be a little bit tricky, this really isn&#x27;t very difficult to do, and if you read the directions and do it exactly like it explains (practice first!)</li>
            <li> The boil-and-bite mouth molds are less than desirable, but they work well enough at keeping the gel where it is supposed to be.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t change it or hurt it at all by doing it several times, so if you mess up</li>
            <li> A little about me, I have fairly white teeth already</li>
            <li> I received this product only 3 days after ordering it took a little longer for me to see results</li>
            <li> I can tell something is on my teeth, and occasionally they get an achy feeling for a few minutes after use, but never any discomfort.    </li>
            <li> Be careful.  </li>
            <li> Yellow teeth, non-smoker, no coffee, no soda, a glass of wine every few weeks.</li>
            <li> However, be careful on the frequency of the usage and the amount of the product you use on your teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a heavy green tea drinker, and my teeth have been stained since I was a young child.</li>
            <li> Since the end of the Watts applicator is very crude (too large to get a precise amount of gel in each tooth area), I tried to fill up one of my empty Opalscence plungers, but the seal was not strong enough to suck it up even with the watered down mix.  </li>
            <li> (Careful not to get it on your gums, though, because it can sting!)</li>
            <li> This product works and doesn&#x27;t hurt my gums as much as other teeth whiteners.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not boxed individual, seems a bit shady,</li>
            <li> The next morning my teeth were only slightly sensitive to the cold fruit I ate for breakfast.</li>
            <li> I was very careful to follow the instructions to the T.</li>
            <li> The kit (one of them) lasted me roughly two and a half weeks.</li>
            <li> This created some extreme sensitivity, and made eating certain foods difficult.</li>
            <li> After second treatment, had significant pain in areas where my gums had receded some from the base of teeth over the years.</li>
            <li> I found it difficult however to keep it from getting on my gums, and when it did, it really caused a lot of irritation.</li>
            <li> Just be careful to trim a narrow sliver each time.</li>
            <li> My self confidence was really down</li>
            <li> I would have this very sharp pain on the surface of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I figure once I&#x27;m about half done with one syringe I&#x27;ll use the remineralizing gel, and then again when I finish the syringe.  </li>
            <li> The tighter it is, the less saliva gets in and washes the gel off your teeth.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t believe I will pursue any other avenues, but if they do tend to get worse in the future, I believe I will leave the whitening to a professional....possibly using lighting instead of chemicals in my mouth.</li>
            <li> It looked thick and gluey, but the instructions said to suck up some water into the syringe and it would re-constitute with no negative effect if that happened.  </li>
            <li> but they were a little yellowy around the gums from soda drinking when I was a kid.</li>
            <li> Additionally, even though I was cautious during application, inevitably, a little gel would find its way on to my gums.</li>
            <li> Money was wasted..</li>
            <li> There is no need to waste lots of money on the strips when this works.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve never had my teeth whitened by a professional nor have i used whitening trays or strips. My teeth weren&#x27;t yellow, but they weren&#x27;t exactly white either. I decided to finally do something about it by going for the professional grade trays for a quick fix. Glad i did, because these syringes full of magic work great. The trays that come with it are OK, but I noticed that I really had to hold the tray in place with my tongue for it to stick. I opted for a sports athlete mouth guard and have noticed it fits and feels better. I leave it in for a good 20 mins and my teeth look slightly brighter instantly&lt;br /&gt;My complaints would mainly be about the trays, but thats an easy fix, so do yourself a favor and buy this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note: if this gets on your gums when applying, use a Q-Tip/cotton swap to wipe it off or its going to burn like hell.</li>
            <li> I am turned off by the high prices of other teeth whitening products, so I decided to try this kit because it was marked down almost 70% of the original price and had good reviews. I have ordered it twice now because I&#x27;ve been so impressed, and I&#x27;ve recommended it to friends looking to whiten their teeth. It is very easy to use, and I have never had any tooth sensitivity to the product. (Careful not to get it on your gums, though, because it can sting!). I will definitely order this product again after my current kit runs out (which won&#x27;t be for a few months; this kit lasts a long time!).</li>
            <li> Did not even try this product, resold it to a friend with more patience.  can get the same whiteness from strips.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never buy tooth bleach from the dentist again.  This product worked much better and was remarkably cheaper.  I had no teeth sensitivity, either.</li>
            <li> This product works and doesn&#x27;t hurt my gums as much as other teeth whiteners. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have tryed Crest Whitestrips..Oxyclean...Money was wasted..&lt;br /&gt;Reading the reviews on here..what the heck,I&#x27;ll give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;Soooo happy I did.I love this stuff!! After 4 treatments,there is a hugh differance.&lt;br /&gt;I do smoke,or I should say I did..Have not smoked for 3 days now..I feel so good knowing &amp; seeing that my teeth are looking white again..that I don&#x27;t want to smoke..\\&quot;Please\\&quot; don&#x27;t ever stop selling this product..It was made for me...:))) If you decide to  stop selling let us know..so \\&quot;we\\&quot; your customers can stock up.. Thank you so much!! Me</li>
            <li> This product works just as advertised.  Noticed a difference within a week and continue to use this product.  The only draw back is if it can be a bit sensitive on the teeth and gums at times.  Otherwise would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I was thinking of getting my teeth bleached though the lazer treatments, but read reviews saying that it was very painful and burns your gums. I saw this product online and it was cheap, so I thought I would give it a shot.    A little about me, I have fairly white teeth already but they were a little yellowy around the gums from soda drinking when I was a kid. I dont smoke or drink coffee.    I was apprehensive of using this and the possible pain. I have just completed 5 treatments now. The first time, it stung for the first 5 minutes after that no pain and pain-free for the additional 4 treatments.    I experienced some sensitivity while drinking some flavored water yesterday. Apart from that everything is great. I will edit this review if I experience any more sensitivity in the future.    So, as for the results... it definately worked. My teeth are a couple of shades whiter and the yellowy stain next to my gums is all but gone. I would recommend this product. There is no need to waste lots of money on the strips when this works. Just if you have really sensitive teeth, I would consult a dentist first. Note this product is designed to improve your teeth by a few shades. If you have bright yellow teeth, don&#x27;t expect movie star looks within a week.    On a side note, you get a lot of gel. My 5 treatments only used about 1/3 of a tube. One kit would probably be enough for 2 people if you purchase another mouth tray from somewhere. So with this double pack you should have enough gel for 4.</li>
            <li> I was leery of the strength of this but it hasn&#x27;t burned my gum&#x27;s yet.  It was received as described, with basic instructions.      The included trays are not spectacular but they work just fine.  Heat them up in boiling water and suck them to your teeth - they&#x27;re just there to keep the product from getting washed away or burning your lips/gum&#x27;s.    You can put the product in the tray and stick it on your teeth or paint it on with something.  I use a damp cotton swab to paint it on my teeth where I want it, and then stick the tray in to keep it there.    I had yellowish stains from years of coffee, soda, etc.  After two days of using this for 15 minutes I noticed a huge difference.  Now I use it about once a week.  I figure once I&#x27;m about half done with one syringe I&#x27;ll use the remineralizing gel, and then again when I finish the syringe.  I found it convenient to apply it before getting in the shower in the morning and then after you&#x27;re out and dried off, rinse it out and go on about your routine.    There have been no sensitivity or burning issues.  I can tell something is on my teeth, and occasionally they get an achy feeling for a few minutes after use, but never any discomfort.    I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t waste my money elsewhere.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone who has strong teeth and no sensitivity issues.  Otherwise I might suggest a lesser % but probably the same brand.</li>
            <li> My teeth really aren&#x27;t that far off from being white, but I bought these figuring I could have a super quick fix, and really make them stand out without much effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well..only after using them twice my teeth began to seriously hurt. I did notice a difference in brightness even after using it one time, but DANG! Any air that hit my teeth I would have this very sharp pain on the surface of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I was very careful to follow the instructions to the T. I didn&#x27;t leave it on even a second longer than instructions suggested, and I made sure the gel was not near the gum lining, and used the revitalizing minerals afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have to say this is some pretty potent stuff to whiten my teeth after only using it once, and also to cause pain after 2 uses. It&#x27;s definitely nothing to play around with. As I said before, my teeth are not that bad to begin with so I don&#x27;t believe I will pursue any other avenues, but if they do tend to get worse in the future, I believe I will leave the whitening to a professional....possibly using lighting instead of chemicals in my mouth.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive teeth, I&#x27;d avoid this, because it will give you shooting pain. Myself it didn&#x27;t bother me at all, but my sister has sensitive teeth and she complained about shooting pain. It works, but the packaging is a bit iffy. You get a 2 plastic ziploc type bags, and the mouthguards/case and the syringes, it&#x27;s all just thrown in a box as if they get these products mass amount and they just separate it out per purchase. It&#x27;s not boxed individual, seems a bit shady, I dunno. I wouldn&#x27;t buy again, I will look for a different seller that has the product individually packaged and more professional. 5 stars on shipping for this seller though. Very fast delivery.</li>
            <li> What can I say about this product? I really wish Amazon allowed half-star reviews as I feel this deserves a 3.5 more than either a 3 or a 4.     The product does as it advertises: it whitens your teeth, so long as you&#x27;re not expecting any wonders. The boil-and-bite mouth molds are less than desirable, but they work well enough at keeping the gel where it is supposed to be. The remineralizing gel was strange. I&#x27;m not entirely sure the purpose of applying it (to strengthen enamel after the peroxide exposure?), but it can&#x27;t hurt as a free addition.    As for the actual whitening power of the product. I&#x27;m a heavy green tea drinker, and my teeth have been stained since I was a young child. They&#x27;re certainly not terrible in appearance, but they&#x27;re also not pearly whites. I bought this kit with the hopes of just getting them \\&quot;white.\\&quot; Since I&#x27;m 18 now, those stains have had plenty of time to set in, and I can speak from a position of having \\&quot;okay\\&quot; teeth. The kit (one of them) lasted me roughly two and a half weeks. From start to finish, I think my teeth probably improved by about two shades. This is nothing spectacular, but it certainly has been noticeable. I still have one kit left, and when I finish trying that, I will try to update my review here.    My only note here is that the teeth in the rear of my mouth are very ground down, and the gel would always find a way to get on them somehow (even though I followed instructions perfectly and was incredibly careful with gel application). This created some extreme sensitivity, and made eating certain foods difficult. Additionally, even though I was cautious during application, inevitably, a little gel would find its way on to my gums. This was painful, but was expected when you are using peroxide inside your mouth. The purchase of sensitivity tooth paste largely minimized this sensitivity.    In short, so long as you&#x27;re not expecting a miracle from this kit and are realistic about its potential, this is a good product that Iwould feel comfortable recommending to friends.</li>
            <li> This product did not perform better than anything else I&#x27;ve used:  strips, gels, etc...  Custom fitting the trays was not a problem.  One thing nice is that the gel did not cause any sensitivity common with these types of products.</li>
            <li> I bought this kit a few months ago after trying the Crest Whitestrips with no results (although, granted, they were a couple of years expired). Anyway, seeing the great reviews for this whitening kit and the much higher whitening strength of the gel, I decided that for the price it was worth at least trying out.     One issue that I noticed a few reviewers had were with fitting the mouth guards. Although it can be a little bit tricky, this really isn&#x27;t very difficult to do, and if you read the directions and do it exactly like it explains (practice first!), you shouldn&#x27;t have much of a problem. First off, when the directions say no more than 3 seconds or so, it means it! Anything longer than that melts the tray so much that it folds and loses all shape. The top tray was easiest to do, and I fit it perfectly. But I did have a little more trouble with the bottom because it is more difficult to get the proper suction on the tray for it to fit right. BUT you can re-dip it in the water and do it again if you mess up!!! I re-dipped the bottom tray 4 - 5 times before I finally got it where it worked for me. It doesn&#x27;t change it or hurt it at all by doing it several times, so if you mess up it&#x27;s no big deal, just do it again. There&#x27;s no need to throw it away and use the second pair. Also, the directions say that you do not need a perfect fit for the product to work, but the better the fit the better it will whiten. As I said, I had problems fitting the bottom tray, so it didn&#x27;t fit to my teeth as well as the top tray did. But since the instructions said you don&#x27;t need a perfect fit, I decided it would be ok and didn&#x27;t worry about it. But after a few whitening sessions, I noticed my top teeth were getting much whiter than my bottom teeth and that they they didn&#x27;t seem to be whitening much at all. So that&#x27;s when I decided to try to remold the bottom tray and make it fit better. After several tries, I finally found that actually physically holding the tray tightly to my teethworked best. At the same time, I also ran my fingers along the entire tray to make sure that it fit tight against my teeth. The tighter it is, the less saliva gets in and washes the gel off your teeth. For me, this was key! After I did it this way, my bottom teeth finally started to noticeably whiten.     Now on to actually applying the gel. First, I liked to dry my teeth off because I figured the gel would stick to my teeth better. And instead of putting the gel in the tray, I applied it directly to my teeth using the syringe and just spread it around on my teeth with the tip, which was quick and easy to do. I also found that it works best if you put a pretty decent coating of gel on each tooth, because saliva does seep in and start to wash it out. So if you put too thin of a coating, the saliva will wash it away pretty quickly and not give enough time to really whiten. Since the product comes with a big syringe of gel, you have more than enough to use and don&#x27;t have to skimp. I used it for about a month and still have some gel leftover.    Granted this is only my second time to whiten my teeth, and I haven&#x27;t really tried many of the other products available, but this kit worked amazingly well and everyone has commented on how white my teeth are and have even asked me what I used and where I got it. I used it a month before I got married, and one of the first things I noticed with my wedding pictures was how blindingly white my teeth looked, which is exactly what I wanted. I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied, and I would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> Unless you use it daily, the whitening effect will fade out withing 3 days. But it does the job, really whitens!!</li>
            <li> My teeth was stained from drinking sodas and coffee I had tried everything and my teeth were bright yellow.My self confidence was really down I hated smiling I received this product only 3 days after ordering it took a little longer for me to see results but I did and all I can say is WOW! my teeth are pearly white you will not be disappointed when ordering this product.</li>
            <li> This works very well. I found it difficult however to keep it from getting on my gums, and when it did, it really caused a lot of irritation. I only used it twice because of the irritation. If you can manage to use it a few times though, you will have bright white teeth, guaranteed!</li>
            <li> Simple and very effective.  For five days I applied the gel with a q-tip, put the guards on (no need to shrink-they fit as is), and relaxed for 30 minutes.  I have sensitive gums, but this did not irritate them.  I&#x27;ve used more expensive products with less satisfactory results. PLUS there&#x27;s plenty of gel.  You can save what&#x27;s leftover in the fridge for next time.</li>
            <li> I have tried Opalescence 10% and 20% gels before, but keeping the dentist-made trays in my mouth overnight interfered with my sleep so I didn&#x27;t stick with it enough to see real results.  This gel is MUCH faster and teeth are MUCH whiter in MUCH less time!  I have been using it once every 2nd or 3rd day so my teeth don&#x27;t get sensitive.  I haven&#x27;t tried the re-mineralizing gel yet.  Now on to the problems, and my solutions.  After the second or third application, this gel refused to come out of the syringe.  It looked thick and gluey, but the instructions said to suck up some water into the syringe and it would re-constitute with no negative effect if that happened.  I couldn&#x27;t get the syringe to suck any water up since it was so gluey, so took out the plunger and added the water and  mixed it up with a stick.  I kept adding water until it looked like a smooth mix with no bubbles.  Since the end of the Watts applicator is very crude (too large to get a precise amount of gel in each tooth area), I tried to fill up one of my empty Opalscence plungers, but the seal was not strong enough to suck it up even with the watered down mix.  Then I got looking at the nice, thin appicator on the Opalescence syringe and wondered if I might super-glue it on to the end of the Watts applicator.  I took it off, pushed it on the end and it was a perfect fit!  If you firmly push the Opalescence applicator onto the Watts end (The Opalescence tip unscrews from the syringe) it will stay on, even though it is threaded.  Problem solved.  I hope this helps others since I was wasting too much gel and getting frustrated because the Watts applicator is not very good.  However, the gel WORKS!</li>
            <li> I recommend molding these to your teeth per instructions, it will help keep the gel in place on your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They work as advertised!  I saw a difference thirty minutes after using.  Had some tooth sensitivity but that stopped after I used the restoring gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about 5 applications I stopped because it looks great to me.</li>
            <li> My teeth have gotten quite a bit whiter since using this product. I would def. use it again.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Over the Christmas holiday mentioned that she noticed two coffee stains on my front 2 teeth.  I read tons of reviews and decided to purchase the Luster White package and this one.  I wanted the strongest carbamide peroxide I could find - 35%.  I knew the peroxide gel was more likely to cause tooth sensitivity which is why I also purchased the Luster White process which boasted that it would not given it is a less sensitive gel which does not contain carbamide peroxide.    Luster White did nothing after the first use, but I noticed a HUGE difference after using this 35% gel. The smaller stain on my left front tooth completely disappeared and I saw significant lightening on the other front tooth.  I did stray a bit from the instructions which rec. to keep the gel on for 15- 30min, instead I kept it on for 1 hour and 15 minutes.  I needed immedate results and throughout the time my teeth/gums did tingle a bit but not too much so I knew I could handle it.  The next morning my teeth were only slightly sensitive to the cold fruit I ate for breakfast. Iwaited a day and started the second treatment tonight.  I plan to go for another 1 hour and 15min.    The only thing I do not like about this is the gel taste. It is pretty sour so I stuff gauze in my mouth under the mouth tray to catch saliva that might have some of the gel taste.  If this is the only issue, I can handle it.</li>
            <li> This is my first ever review on amazon, i thought i would take the time to say how well this product works.    First, please please plase, do the thermo molding to the dental trays before you try applying the gels.  Boil water, insert for literally 3 seconds and quickly place in your mouth and suck the air out so it molds to your teeth.  You&#x27;ll also need to carefully trim down the trays until they cover only a little bit of your gums, don&#x27;t go right to the teeth line otherwise your inside of the lips will wash that part of the gel which seeps out.  Also, you don&#x27;t need to use a tremendous amount.  I put a thin strip from end to end, and it spread out very smoothly over my teeth.    Now for how it works:  Fantastic, i noticed results after one application.  But do note, i freaked out after the first time.  My teeth whitened more on the biting surface than the portions near the gums, also there were a few white spots.  Apparentyl this is completely normal and is due to there being thinner enamel at the biting surface so it bleaches quicker, and the spots are from areas of decalcification.  Completely normal and fades by the morning if you apply it at night.    After 3-4applications my teeth are a ton whiter, quite a noticable difference from the yellowish color they used to be.  I don&#x27;t smoke, so my teeth probably aren&#x27;t the yellowest ever.    one last thing, my first application, the gums which protrude between the teeth bleached white,and i was scared i ruined my gums haha, but it went away after a few hours.  Apparently this was from using too much gel, and it seeped out onto my gums.  Be careful.  (it&#x27;s actually a chemical burn caused by the oxidation by the peroxide)    Fantastic gels</li>
            <li> This whitening kit comes with everything you need including two mouthpieces which you can mold to the shape of your teeth.  The directions state the gel can cause irritation to the gums but so far I&#x27;ve experienced none.  I&#x27;ve used the kit now for about 5 days and have seen considerable whitening.</li>
            <li> I had a teeth whitening system from a dentist about ten years ago. This kit does just as well whitening.     I didn&#x27;t think the mouth trays in this kit fit as well as the ones made by the dentist, but my teeth whitened just the same. What I like to do is apply the gel directly to my teeth, using the stick of a Q-tip (non-fuzzy), then put on the guard. It&#x27;s main purpose is to keep the saliva from washing away the gel.     The product was delivered in two days from ordering, so it arrived super fast. I had a question for the customer support and it too was answered super fast and very helpful.     This is a great kit to buy.</li>
            <li> I really like the shape-able trays that come with this, although I had to use both pair to get a good form because I accidentally ruined the first pair with the hot water. The bleach works fast and I do get visible results after using it. I have already recommended this product to my friends!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the old Rembrandt home whitening strips (not the pro ones) and one brush-on system (can&#x27;t remember which; all I remember is that the paste and tiny brushes were not dramatically effective and were a bit of a hassle to use).    I ordered this system four or five days ago. It arrived two days ago, and I&#x27;ve used it twice. I noticed more improvement after the first treatment than I had after using either of the other systems for their entire prescribed regimen.   After the second treatment, the results were even better. With one or two more treatments, I&#x27;m hoping to be where I want for now.     There are a few caveats. If you&#x27;re very squeamish and gag easily, you might have trouble keeping the units in your mouth for the required 30 minutes.   But if you follow directions, you should be able to minimize any discomfort or queasiness.    Read and follow the instructions. They&#x27;re fairly simple. The first step is to boil water and soften the plastic tooth trays which you then insert and mold to your teeth. I first tried boiling a coffee cup of water for one minute in a microwave.   It wasn&#x27;t hot enough to soften them, so I tried again with a two minute boil and   it worked perfectly, making them pliable without making them too hot for my mouth. Be sure to shake out the excess water before inserting the tray in your mouth, so you don&#x27;t burn your mouth with hot water.     I also prepped a cup of cool (not cold) water and as soon as I had the first mold fitted, I doused the cool water in my mouth to harden the mold. Then I heated the second tray and molded it. I took the time to make sure I got a good fit, heating and molding them a few times until I felt they were as good as need be. As long as you make a good attempt, I don&#x27;t think you can go critically wrong.    Following instructions, I then carefully trimmed off some of the excess plastic so the molds fit over my teeth but not my gums. This is the trickiest part of the whole thing, but it&#x27;s really not difficult. Just be careful to trim a narrow sliver each time. That way you can gradually cut it down to a perfect fit. It cuts easily with a good pair of scissors.    I first dabbed tiny beads of the whitening gel, but after fitting them in my mouth, and not feeling any sort of burning sensation, I removed them and added more to make sure my teeth got a good coating.    I do tend to gag so I placed a 4 inch square of hefty paper towel between the   two trays in my mouth, to soak up excess saliva. I also placed a thin strip of paper towel behind each lip to soak up any overflow of the gel.    This worked great. I watched 30 minutes of TV, and when I removed the trays and rinsed my mouth, I was very pleasantly surprised at the improvement after only one treatment.    Removing the trays is the messiest part. Do it over a sink, as the trays do collect saliva, which mixes with the gel. If you tilt your face down and remove the trays quickly, you&#x27;ll reduce the chances of getting the goo in your mouth and gagging.    These are not as easy to use as the strips, but then again, you&#x27;ll get much faster results and will probably have to use them far fewer times than the strips or other systems. I had no problems as far as burning of my gums; I think the strips of paper towel help greatly to reduce the odds of that happening.    The price is also right. Based on my results after only two 30 minute sessions, I&#x27;d guess you could get two or even three complete whitenings from each of the two kits included, depending on how yellow your teeth are. Mine were definitely yellow from light smoking; after two treatments they were more white than yellow.     The kits are also nicely packaged, with good quality vinyl ziplock pouches to hold all the pieces after you open them. A very well thought-out and effective package.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve completed five 30 min applications, but I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a change.  The gel is a bit painful, but not too bad.  I&#x27;ll continue the regiment for another 2 weeks and update with the results.    Some background:  Yellow teeth, non-smoker, no coffee, no soda, a glass of wine every few weeks.</li>
            <li> I used this product a couple evenings in a row, applying to teeth using a QTip, then putting in the funky tooth covers to minimize drooling and wash-off of treatment. Left in place for about 15 minutes before rinsing. After second treatment, had significant pain in areas where my gums had receded some from the base of teeth over the years. Have given them a rest for a couple weeks and will try again, but will separate the treatments by a few days to allow my mouth to recover between assaults from this strong stuff. Whitening has been modest to moderate; wish I&#x27;d done a \\&quot;before\\&quot; photo so I could compare. With hindsight, I&#x27;d go with a milder solution, apply every few days for a couple weeks. No need to aim for total results in only a few days.</li>
            <li> The trays were terrible, wish I had gotten custom fitted ones. But the gel stayed for YEARS. I&#x27;m writing this review over 2 years since I made the purchase online. I saw results after the first 30 minute session and the instructions were ridiculously verbose, which was excellent.</li>
            <li> In the process of trying this item.When useing its a good idea not to put too much on your teeth and or in the tray that comes with it.I am useing a small art brush to put on teeth and in tray and it seems to help from putting too much on your teeth.I also am useing a tray that was special made for my teeth.I found the trays that come with it really dont mold  well to your teeth.For the price its a good value.</li>
            <li> Works great!  Large supply-perfect for two people.  I did have some irritation on my gums, but I stopped using for a day and it went away.  Works much more quickly than 16%, which I have used in the past.  I use it for 30 min in the shower and I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> WASTE OF MONEY    i am not sure how this product works with the others but at first that i have tried this product the tray didnt fit on my teeth and the GEL gives me Gum irritation and few times of use the felt that my teeth will fall down because of the pain...Dont buy it if you think the price was cheap like me!!!</li>
            <li> After having little luck with Crest Whitening Strips, I tried these and found them to be very effective. I didn&#x27;t use the dental trays, however, I substituted generic whitening strips from Walmart. The dental trays were not a good fit even when I cut them down to size. The strips worked better and I saw results after the first thirty-minute application. My gums weren&#x27;t sore or affected in any way.</li>
            <li> For the price, its worth it. It works but temporarily for me. Nonetheless, I&#x27;m a heavy coffee drinker, perhaps that says it all.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice much difference in my teeth when I used this the first time, but my wife did so she has started using it to. It&#x27;s hard to beat it for the price.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome BUT be very careful how long you leave it on.  It&#x27;s very strong and will burn your gums if left on for more than 10-15 min. at a time.  I appreciate the strength of the whitening since you only need to leave it on for short periods to get great results unlike many lower percentage products.</li>
            <li> Listerine pre-brush mouthwash gives a better whiting result. This product strips the enamel off your teeth and makes them extremely sensitive.</li>
            <li> Item was shipped out ASAP!  I had results after just one use.  My teeth are whiter and this product is far better than Crest White Strips.</li>
            <li> Received my order in a timely manner and the product was everything it advertised!!  Excellent service A++++++</li>
            <li> After only 4 days&#x27; use twice per day for 30 minutes each time, my teeth are as white as if I had paid a dentist $300 - $500 to do the same job. The best part is I don&#x27;t have any sensitivity issues, though they included remineralization gel to help should any issues arise. Overall just an excellent, excellent purchase and experience. I put off whitening my teeth for years because of the expected costs involved, but this is a perfect solution for a ridiculously low price. The fact that the item comes with two kits (so my wife can do her teeth, as well) makes it an even sweeter deal. If you&#x27;re thinking about getting a whitening kit, this is the one to get.</li>
            <li> This is the only whitening kit I&#x27;ve ever used so it is hard for me to compare but this kit is easy to use, the trays are easy to make if you follow the instructions. I expected a more drastic change in whitening but I did notice a difference. The kit also comes with some mineralizing gel that is supposed to strengthen and protect your teeth. Good product but I am still considering having a dentist do a bleaching.</li>
            <li> It is a nice Do-it-yourself whitening tool. However, be careful on the frequency of the usage and the amount of the product you use on your teeth. Follow directions just the way they say so. Otherwise, your teeth will suffer a lot in terms of sensitivity. But it works perfect. Strongly recommended since my teeth were pretty stained. I liked the results very much. Also, if you store the product in the fridge it will last for 3 more years. Enjoy...</li>
