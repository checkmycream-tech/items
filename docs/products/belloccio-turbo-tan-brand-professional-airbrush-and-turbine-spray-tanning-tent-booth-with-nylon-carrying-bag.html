            <li>I am content with the tanning tent, but I have to admit that it is very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>but I can do it now :)</li>
            <li>I will now have to incur an additional expense to replace this tent with a better quality tent.</li>

            <li>So happy that we got this and at decent price.</li>
            <li>Nice quality, exactly what I was expecting!</li>
            <li>Plus, it folds up super easy and fits in the storage/travel bag!</li>
            <li>easy set up and easy to put away  </li>
            <li>Sets up fine.</li>
            <li>Received the item quickly!</li>
            <li>The thing is Huge, so plenty of room to move around.  </li>
            <li>There is plenty of space for one person to stand comfortably.</li>
            <li>Excited to use.</li>
            <li>I like the clear top, gives more light which can be an issue when mobile tanning....</li>
            <li>The spray tanning tent was excellent quality and was big enough to handle any size person.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s huge and does exactly what we needed it to do.  </li>
            <li>definitely makes my mobile tanning business more convenient!</li>
            <li>It is easy to popup, pretty quick to collapse and put away, and it doesn&#x27;t take up much space in your storage area.  </li>
            <li>, sometimes we get it right</li>
            <li>Very easy to open.</li>
            <li>so big and easy for my clients to move around!</li>
            <li>So I bought this tent.... thinking It would look EXACTLY like the photo I saw on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Even my 6&#x27;4&#x27;&#x27; male client fit!</li>
            <li>Global, I use this as a &amp;#34;wrap room&amp;#34;, and it is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>Took a few times to learn how to fold back up, but I&#x27;m loving it so far!</li>
            <li>This came quickly and was all that I expected.</li>
            <li>The only issue I have is that this thing can sometimes be a bit of a pain to collapse down, but it gets easier the more you do it.</li>
            <li>Tried painting my guitars in my back yard and there was just too much stuff blowing around and getting in the paint.</li>
            <li>It is well made, solid fabric and is holding up very well.  </li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s just say at least 2 of those people got very upset in the process (was pretty funny to watch actually).</li>
            <li>I purchased this tent to replace our current tent and was surprised at how unprofessional this tent looks in contrast with the old one.</li>
            <li>Its a nice little pop-up tent it takes a bit to figure out how to fold it back down even with the instructions</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I bought this as a gift for my wife so that I could apply a spray tan to her.  The spray tanning tent was excellent quality and was big enough to handle any size person.  Plenty of height and width.&lt;br /&gt;I feel this was a very good value and I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> So I bought this tent.... thinking It would look EXACTLY like the photo I saw on Amazon.  I was WRONG.  My product came with their logo splashed on the bag and on the tent, which ISN&#x27;T pictured on the ad.  Now I have to somehow cover their logo.  SO if you are planning on buying this tent, just a note, it WILL have &#x27;BELLOCCIO&#x27; splashed on the inside of the tent and on the outside of the bag.</li>
            <li> Tried painting my guitars in my back yard and there was just too much stuff blowing around and getting in the paint. I ran across this on Amazon and figured I&#x27;d give it a try. Even with nitrocellulose lacquers this thing has held up great. The only issue I have is that this thing can sometimes be a bit of a pain to collapse down, but it gets easier the more you do it.</li>
            <li> I love this tent!  It is well made, solid fabric and is holding up very well.  I am very pleased with this purchase!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great perfect size easy set up and easy to put away  definitely makes my mobile tanning business more convenient!</li>
            <li> Great size for tanning clients. Even my 6&#x27;4&#x27;&#x27; male client fit! Plus, it folds up super easy and fits in the storage/travel bag!</li>
            <li> This came quickly and was all that I expected. Excited to use.</li>
            <li> Very easy to open. A little trickey to fold up but with some practice it only takes a few seconds. I love it!</li>
            <li> Being an Independent Distributor for It Works! Global, I use this as a &amp;#34;wrap room&amp;#34;, and it is fantastic!  It is easy to popup, pretty quick to collapse and put away, and it doesn&#x27;t take up much space in your storage area.  There is plenty of space for one person to stand comfortably.</li>
            <li> Awesome answer for at home airbrush tanning to keep bathroom clean.  The thing is Huge, so plenty of room to move around.  Well constructed.</li>
            <li> Received the item quickly! Nice quality, exactly what I was expecting!</li>
            <li> perfect pops up and closes easy</li>
            <li> Took a few times to learn how to fold back up, but I&#x27;m loving it so far! its quite big, so be prepared.</li>
            <li> love it! so big and easy for my clients to move around! took me a while to learn how to put it back in the bag but I can do it now :)</li>
            <li> Its a nice little pop-up tent it takes a bit to figure out how to fold it back down even with the instructions, sometimes we get it right sometimes it takes about 4 of us to figure it out.</li>
            <li> Sets up fine. The only problem is that I never use it. I just throw a sheet down on the floor which does the job.</li>
            <li> I am content with the tanning tent, but I have to admit that it is very cheaply made. I purchased this tent to replace our current tent and was surprised at how unprofessional this tent looks in contrast with the old one. I will now have to incur an additional expense to replace this tent with a better quality tent. The Belloccio tent serves it&#x27;s purpose. I guess I was just expecting something better.</li>
            <li> I like the clear top, gives more light which can be an issue when mobile tanning....you never know how your clients lighting will be.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s huge and does exactly what we needed it to do.  Others complained about the advertising where you can see the manufacturers label, but we don&#x27;t care.  If you don&#x27;t like it, just spray-paint it black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wife loved it and she uses it at least once a week for her tanning business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the record, our unit does not leave the house so I cannot rate it on it&#x27;s mobility - sorry.</li>
            <li> FYI this thing is IMPOSSIBLE to fold back up once it&#x27;s opened. I had 4 people try and no one could get it folded back up so we had to toss it. Let&#x27;s just say at least 2 of those people got very upset in the process (was pretty funny to watch actually). Piece of crap!!</li>
            <li> It was a great purchase but the item came bended at the bottom so it wouldnt stand! Its sturdy - a lil tough to put back in... wish it had a closed &amp;#34;door&amp;#34; but i will repurchase again, hopefully this time, it wont be damaged. I was able to return w/ no problem.</li>
            <li> Perfect thing for on the go spray tans. So happy that we got this and at decent price. Thank you.</li>
