            <li>Love, love, LOVE it!!!!</li>
            <li>smells great, doesn&#x27;t revert straightened hair and just doesn&#x27;t have overwhelming processed ingredients.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products and techniques when trying to achieve an attractive wash &#x27;n go style.</li>
            <li>It tames my hair and adds moisture and great definition which is a godsend considering type 4 hair is mostly coils and kinks instead of curls.</li>
            <li>So happy to have found my favorite styling product.  </li>
            <li>Mostly organic ingredient,  works great.</li>
            <li>top it off, most people ask what smells so good!</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner!</li>
            <li>love this product and delivery was on time, will buy again!</li>
            <li>I use it for weave curly hair it light it smell great</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>it also SMELLS AMAZING.</li>
            <li>, this is a wonderful product to use if  you have very curly hair.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice if you like smell.</li>
            <li>Very light weight non-greasy.</li>
            <li>I love the smell</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t pay more than $10</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad that I gave this product a chance.</li>
            <li>I already use the Goddess Curls gel from this line and love it.</li>
            <li>the results (I.e shinier prominent curls)</li>
            <li>I love this line.</li>
            <li>and no bill up will purchase more bottles for a friend.....</li>
            <li>If u have a 3 or 4A texture this works ok as a styler.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for my curly/wavy Euro Jewish hair.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>I love braidouts and this product delivers.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not found a better regimen than these three products used together.</li>
            <li>Only good thing is that it smelled great..</li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>it may work better for you then me</li>
            <li>3c people (who are more curly and not really at all coily) will probably get the best results if they tried perm rods, but they should do well by themselves because their hair is much more silkier and looser.</li>
            <li>Leaves my curls with weavy style, I use to combine two types of creams (in this case with miss jessie&#x27;s) and my hair stays all day long perfectly.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product, makes my hair feel good and easy to style.  </li>
            <li>Work good for curly hair not the great for national black hair</li>
            <li>I can easily stretch my wash n</li>
            <li>easily finger</li>
            <li>My curls are soft and defined after a good scrunch, and they look better as the week progresses on.</li>
            <li>Really strong smell.</li>
            <li>but if you are using the curl creme brule for curl defining and/or frizz control I strongly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>Now if your hair is curly it probably will work just fine in curling your hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine 4C hair.</li>
            <li>Smells great, but not moisturizing enough for my 4A/4B hair.</li>
            <li>love, love, love this on my natural hair..</li>
            <li>but my hair still doesn&#x27;t look anything like the women in the ad with these smooth, elongated curls.</li>
            <li>So for the natrual part of my hair it works fabulous but my relaxed hair hates it.</li>
            <li>, my hair doesn&#x27;t have a &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; appearance, rather smooth and kept</li>
            <li>And it smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>I used it during the summer months primarily and I continued to hope this product would work if I continued to use it.</li>
            <li>I originally bought the Goddess Curls</li>
            <li>I have fairly curly hair but after years of straightening some peices are just barely wavey.</li>
            <li>claims to be a super light whipped curl cream that defines curls without adding hold and eliminates frizz.</li>
            <li>He is able to smooth it in to his hair damp or dry because it&#x27;s short, and its perfectly styled every time.</li>
            <li>It smells good enough to eat.</li>
            <li>My wash and go looks good for several days after use.</li>
            <li>If you have coily kinky hair.i highly recommend perm rods.they are very cheap.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super moisturizing and helps soften and define curls.</li>
            <li>It smells like a warm bakery vanilla scent mixed into a hair product that blends smoothly.</li>
            <li>Although not really touted for its hold, I find that this product does hold my curls nicely for most of the day without making my hair crunchy.</li>
            <li>I tried to use this product many different ways to see if I could get better results, but to no avail.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to get my new bottles and try more of this line.</li>
            <li>I love both this product and the new 4Naturals Curls Craze lotion.  </li>
            <li>The product works very well with my relaxed texture as well, in turn making it easy for both textures to blend spotless.</li>
            <li>First time user of this product, and I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li>(it has a VERY STRONG creme brulee odor), but the smell doesn&#x27;t stick around long, so it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>It really defines my waves and makes them look smooth.</li>
            <li>This is my staple to natural hair moisturizing when I need a more cream based approached.  </li>
            <li>However  if it&#x27;s 4c, but not crazily scrunched up maybe 4b ish</li>
            <li>Give it a try, you might be pleasantly surprised like I was :)</li>
            <li>2nd day was nice too.</li>
            <li>the other CURLS brand products, you really cannot just throw a huge glop of this in your hair and still expect it to look good.</li>
            <li>My curls are well defined, soft, springy, and my hair is growing back very nicely.</li>
            <li>Plus it say right there on the bottle.</li>
            <li>After spending lots of money on trying to find the right moisturizer</li>
            <li>The price is right here at Amazon.</li>
            <li>So I bought this product on a whim since i wanted to cut down my many styling products into one that would give my hair more of a hold.</li>
            <li>My nappy hair is comb- able and moist and I only need this one product for my babys natural curl :-)</li>
            <li>It was the first product I used after I fully transistioned that really showed me the true nature of my curls.</li>
            <li>VERY VERY helpful for the needs of my hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not expensive, and does the trick.</li>
            <li>not anymore, now I only need one product (this one) to do what my hair is supposed to do...look natural, healthy and frizz free.</li>
            <li>This product was exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>First, let me start off by saying, this stuff smells decadent.</li>
            <li>I brought the whole line !</li>
            <li>I incorporated this product into my wash and go routine after my big chop and my hair has never been better.</li>
            <li>I was originally looking for something mild enough to put in my baby&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>Smells so good and the curls are defined enough to last for a couple of days if you sleep on a satin pillowcase or scarf.</li>
            <li>At first, I thought the smell would really bother me</li>
            <li>:) i do reccommend you buy this becuase of the amazing smell that isn&#x27;t too strong after you put it on its very faint so don&#x27;t worry about that</li>
            <li>I wanted nice curl definition and slightly less hold than</li>
            <li>depending on how loose your coils are the better</li>
            <li>I will say that less is more (which is a good thing because this stuff goes fast if you&#x27;re using it everyday like I do) and it also helps with moisture.  </li>
            <li>Haha</li>
            <li>go to five days after using this product with only a nightly spritz of water and a swipe of a light</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s a very affordable product.</li>
            <li>I was really running out of ideas.</li>
            <li>I really like this and will keep it in my routine.</li>
            <li>And the heat dries ones hair fast, and sitting at the beach gives your afro life.</li>
            <li>Otherwise it dosent do much at all and gel is still needed</li>
            <li>Really does help curl my twists</li>
            <li>This product didn&#x27;t really do anything for my hair.</li>
            <li>I am a very curly girl.  </li>
            <li>My hair has taken very well to this product.  </li>
            <li>This product accomplished nothing to my hair.  </li>
            <li>I got lovely curls the next day that were soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>So far the only product I like more is Oyin Handmade Hair Dew.</li>
            <li>I usually put some of this all over my hair, and then I leave some on my hands and twist a few of my own curls in the front and sides of my head, which has been looking really nice.  </li>
            <li>If you have wavy or curly hair, these will define your curls and give you a beautiful looking hairdo that will last at least two days and maybe three without your having to do anything except define your curls with your fingers in the morning.</li>
            <li>well in looking for the magic bullet to make my hair the way I want it or how they advertise, I would say this is something that at least makes my hair soft and it smells great and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy.  </li>
            <li>I bought the Curls Creme Brule and another product by Dark and Lovely Au Naturale</li>
            <li>I first put the curls creme brule through a section of my hair, and noticed that it hydrated the natural part of my hair, causing curl definition.</li>
            <li>its a pretty natural hair product that helps with frizz</li>
            <li>My hair does frizz a litle bit when using this, but its really nothing to complain about since I&#x27;ve learned to just live with and embrace my frizz.</li>
            <li>But I took to mixing it half and half with a regular (non-curl) leave-in and it suits my curls perfectly.</li>
            <li>I have 3c hair, and although my curls are easily defined when wet, once my hair dries often</li>
            <li>I seen this on sale for $10 &amp; since my Pantene for women of color cream was running super low</li>
            <li>should have generous result along with decent shine and looser curls.</li>
            <li>I think that the Creme Brule gives some decent hold because of the aloe in it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it as much nowadays because my main focus is just trying to grow it out, so I mainly use it on my looser, curlier strands near the crown of my head that sometimes hang out of hairstyles I do.</li>
            <li>and i totally think its worth trying.</li>
            <li>This bottle has lasted about two months, (maybe more) and changes my frizzy mess to soft curls.  </li>
            <li>I live in florida.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this Curl Creme after I ran out of my Miss Jessie&#x27;s Pillow Soft Curls and didn&#x27;t want to spend another $23.00 on that particular product.</li>
            <li>I took fairly large sections of my detangled freshly washed and conditioned hair, raked a quarter sized amount of this on each section (using more for the ends), then topped it off with coconut oil (keeps it from getting crunchy) and twisted - 6 sections altogether.</li>
            <li>First off it smells divine, which is a must for me, and the smell actually stays on your hair.</li>
            <li>My curls came out better than they ever have in the past</li>
            <li>I remember buying this and the goddess curls gel on a whim when I saw them on sale on target, and later loving them enough to keep the almost empty bottles under my sink</li>
            <li>and that it helps with frizz when i want to wear my hair natural!</li>
            <li>Sometimes it&#x27;s a bit heavy for my fine curly hair.</li>
            <li>I had said that after I ran out of Pillow Soft Curls, I would try this one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only ever had straight hair, and the care of this was a mystery.  </li>
            <li>I am in my 6th month of transitioning to natural.</li>
            <li>It was soft, my curls were well defined, and it wasn&#x27;t frizzy at all.</li>
            <li>I have 3c/4a kinky curly hair and moisture is important to keep my locks from looking dried out.</li>
            <li>If you have very kinky/coarse hair it will do the same for you.</li>
            <li>But it should still be soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much cheaper at target for only like $9 including tax</li>
            <li>I have type4 natural hair</li>
            <li>I then use Lavish Curls and follow that with Bumble and Bumble Curl Conscious Holding Foam.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally curly, I apply  this product when my hair is damp.</li>
            <li>as it dries it feels soft</li>
            <li>They both make my curls well defined, moist, and soft.</li>
            <li>Although it says it has soft hold, it works well for me.</li>
            <li>Leaves it soft and moisturized</li>
            <li>I tried it again on freshly washed, dripping wet hair, and I put it in my hair in sections.</li>
            <li>I have thick curly hair and just love this Creme Brule Curls product.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried to use it I was foolish in thinking that I could spread it around on dry hair, ruffle it through and get results.</li>
            <li>I doubt it would help with retaining moisture if you already have really dry hair (my hair is pretty moisturized already when I use this)</li>
            <li>So with that being said it didn&#x27;t make my half curls full curls</li>
            <li>She is a mixed baby (black &amp; Mexican) and I am so in love with how her hair turned out.</li>
            <li>Purchased this recently another rubbish product, truly to many junky products being packed as great, when clearly they are just terrible.</li>
            <li>I use this after my hair is completely dry and it makes it so much softer without a greasy feel afterwards.</li>
            <li>one palm size bit of creme and gell through my wet hair was enough to make my hair dry in full soft curls</li>
            <li>It takes quite a while for my hair to air dry when the sections are large, so I make sure I have at least 10 to 12 hours of dry time.</li>
            <li>plus...just wet your curls a little before bed, apply a small amount, braid your hair, and the next morning your curls are good as new.  </li>
            <li>The only time I&#x27;ll spend that much on a product should be if it&#x27;s a moisturizer that I use every day or every other day between wash-n-go&#x27;s, like Jane Carter Nourish and Shine or Lush R &amp;B.</li>
            <li>When it comes to my natural, afro type hair, I&#x27;m not too big on stylers/gels because I find when my hair has enough moisture, my curls will define themselves.</li>
            <li>I can justify the price of those two products because my hair just eats up the moisture they provide, and I use them frequently, while a styler such as Miss Jessie&#x27;s I would only use after a wash-n-go (every five days).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First found this product in a Target store  35 miles from home near a job that is no more.</li>
            <li>No matter what I put on my hair, my hair was horribly dry (the natural part).</li>
            <li>this product works very well in softening and moisturizing curls and tight coils.</li>

            <li> Works great in hair....</li>
            <li> , the smell is amazing!</li>
            <li> This cream brule cream is fabulous and the smell is just as awesome</li>
            <li> May be good for others but didn&#x27;t give me the look I was going for.</li>
            <li> I loved it.</li>
            <li> The smell is just too good which is why i decided to try it.</li>
            <li> nothing good to say about it.</li>
            <li> Love, love, LOVE it!!!!</li>
            <li> smells great, doesn&#x27;t revert straightened hair and just doesn&#x27;t have overwhelming processed ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products and techniques when trying to achieve an attractive wash &#x27;n go style.</li>
            <li> It tames my hair and adds moisture and great definition which is a godsend considering type 4 hair is mostly coils and kinks instead of curls.</li>
            <li> So happy to have found my favorite styling product.  </li>
            <li> Mostly organic ingredient,  works great.</li>
            <li> top it off, most people ask what smells so good!</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner!</li>
            <li> love this product and delivery was on time, will buy again!</li>
            <li> I use it for weave curly hair it light it smell great</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> it also SMELLS AMAZING.</li>
            <li> , this is a wonderful product to use if  you have very curly hair.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice if you like smell.</li>
            <li> Very light weight non-greasy.</li>
            <li> I love the smell</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t pay more than $10</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m glad that I gave this product a chance.</li>
            <li> I already use the Goddess Curls gel from this line and love it.</li>
            <li> the results (I.e shinier prominent curls)</li>
            <li> I love this line.</li>
            <li> and no bill up will purchase more bottles for a friend.....</li>
            <li> If u have a 3 or 4A texture this works ok as a styler.  </li>
            <li> Perfect for my curly/wavy Euro Jewish hair.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> I love braidouts and this product delivers.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not found a better regimen than these three products used together.</li>
            <li> Only good thing is that it smelled great..</li>
            <li> I really love this product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> it may work better for you then me</li>
            <li> 3c people (who are more curly and not really at all coily) will probably get the best results if they tried perm rods, but they should do well by themselves because their hair is much more silkier and looser.</li>
            <li> Leaves my curls with weavy style, I use to combine two types of creams (in this case with miss jessie&#x27;s) and my hair stays all day long perfectly.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product, makes my hair feel good and easy to style.  </li>
            <li> Work good for curly hair not the great for national black hair</li>
            <li> I can easily stretch my wash n</li>
            <li> easily finger</li>
            <li> My curls are soft and defined after a good scrunch, and they look better as the week progresses on.</li>
            <li> Really strong smell.</li>
            <li> but if you are using the curl creme brule for curl defining and/or frizz control I strongly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> Now if your hair is curly it probably will work just fine in curling your hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine 4C hair.</li>
            <li> Smells great, but not moisturizing enough for my 4A/4B hair.</li>
            <li> love, love, love this on my natural hair..</li>
            <li> but my hair still doesn&#x27;t look anything like the women in the ad with these smooth, elongated curls.</li>
            <li> So for the natrual part of my hair it works fabulous but my relaxed hair hates it.</li>
            <li> , my hair doesn&#x27;t have a &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; appearance, rather smooth and kept</li>
            <li> And it smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> I used it during the summer months primarily and I continued to hope this product would work if I continued to use it.</li>
            <li> I originally bought the Goddess Curls</li>
            <li> I have fairly curly hair but after years of straightening some peices are just barely wavey.</li>
            <li> claims to be a super light whipped curl cream that defines curls without adding hold and eliminates frizz.</li>
            <li> He is able to smooth it in to his hair damp or dry because it&#x27;s short, and its perfectly styled every time.</li>
            <li> It smells good enough to eat.</li>
            <li> My wash and go looks good for several days after use.</li>
            <li> If you have coily kinky hair.i highly recommend perm rods.they are very cheap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super moisturizing and helps soften and define curls.</li>
            <li> It smells like a warm bakery vanilla scent mixed into a hair product that blends smoothly.</li>
            <li> Although not really touted for its hold, I find that this product does hold my curls nicely for most of the day without making my hair crunchy.</li>
            <li> I tried to use this product many different ways to see if I could get better results, but to no avail.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to get my new bottles and try more of this line.</li>
            <li> I love both this product and the new 4Naturals Curls Craze lotion.  </li>
            <li> The product works very well with my relaxed texture as well, in turn making it easy for both textures to blend spotless.</li>
            <li> First time user of this product, and I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li> (it has a VERY STRONG creme brulee odor), but the smell doesn&#x27;t stick around long, so it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> It really defines my waves and makes them look smooth.</li>
            <li> This is my staple to natural hair moisturizing when I need a more cream based approached.  </li>
            <li> However  if it&#x27;s 4c, but not crazily scrunched up maybe 4b ish</li>
            <li> Give it a try, you might be pleasantly surprised like I was :)</li>
            <li> 2nd day was nice too.</li>
            <li> the other CURLS brand products, you really cannot just throw a huge glop of this in your hair and still expect it to look good.</li>
            <li> My curls are well defined, soft, springy, and my hair is growing back very nicely.</li>
            <li> Plus it say right there on the bottle.</li>
            <li> After spending lots of money on trying to find the right moisturizer</li>
            <li> The price is right here at Amazon.</li>
            <li> So I bought this product on a whim since i wanted to cut down my many styling products into one that would give my hair more of a hold.</li>
            <li> My nappy hair is comb- able and moist and I only need this one product for my babys natural curl :-)</li>
            <li> It was the first product I used after I fully transistioned that really showed me the true nature of my curls.</li>
            <li> VERY VERY helpful for the needs of my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not expensive, and does the trick.</li>
            <li> not anymore, now I only need one product (this one) to do what my hair is supposed to do...look natural, healthy and frizz free.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> First, let me start off by saying, this stuff smells decadent.</li>
            <li> I brought the whole line !</li>
            <li> I incorporated this product into my wash and go routine after my big chop and my hair has never been better.</li>
            <li> I was originally looking for something mild enough to put in my baby&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> Smells so good and the curls are defined enough to last for a couple of days if you sleep on a satin pillowcase or scarf.</li>
            <li> At first, I thought the smell would really bother me</li>
            <li> :) i do reccommend you buy this becuase of the amazing smell that isn&#x27;t too strong after you put it on its very faint so don&#x27;t worry about that</li>
            <li> I wanted nice curl definition and slightly less hold than</li>
            <li> depending on how loose your coils are the better</li>
            <li> I will say that less is more (which is a good thing because this stuff goes fast if you&#x27;re using it everyday like I do) and it also helps with moisture.  </li>
            <li> Haha</li>
            <li> go to five days after using this product with only a nightly spritz of water and a swipe of a light</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s a very affordable product.</li>
            <li> I was really running out of ideas.</li>
            <li> I really like this and will keep it in my routine.</li>
            <li> And the heat dries ones hair fast, and sitting at the beach gives your afro life.</li>
            <li> Otherwise it dosent do much at all and gel is still needed</li>
            <li> Really does help curl my twists</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t really do anything for my hair.</li>
            <li> I am a very curly girl.  </li>
            <li> My hair has taken very well to this product.  </li>
            <li> This product accomplished nothing to my hair.  </li>
            <li> I got lovely curls the next day that were soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> So far the only product I like more is Oyin Handmade Hair Dew.</li>
            <li> I usually put some of this all over my hair, and then I leave some on my hands and twist a few of my own curls in the front and sides of my head, which has been looking really nice.  </li>
            <li> If you have wavy or curly hair, these will define your curls and give you a beautiful looking hairdo that will last at least two days and maybe three without your having to do anything except define your curls with your fingers in the morning.</li>
            <li> well in looking for the magic bullet to make my hair the way I want it or how they advertise, I would say this is something that at least makes my hair soft and it smells great and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Curls Creme Brule and another product by Dark and Lovely Au Naturale</li>
            <li> I first put the curls creme brule through a section of my hair, and noticed that it hydrated the natural part of my hair, causing curl definition.</li>
            <li> its a pretty natural hair product that helps with frizz</li>
            <li> My hair does frizz a litle bit when using this, but its really nothing to complain about since I&#x27;ve learned to just live with and embrace my frizz.</li>
            <li> But I took to mixing it half and half with a regular (non-curl) leave-in and it suits my curls perfectly.</li>
            <li> I have 3c hair, and although my curls are easily defined when wet, once my hair dries often</li>
            <li> I seen this on sale for $10 &amp; since my Pantene for women of color cream was running super low</li>
            <li> should have generous result along with decent shine and looser curls.</li>
            <li> I think that the Creme Brule gives some decent hold because of the aloe in it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it as much nowadays because my main focus is just trying to grow it out, so I mainly use it on my looser, curlier strands near the crown of my head that sometimes hang out of hairstyles I do.</li>
            <li> and i totally think its worth trying.</li>
            <li> This bottle has lasted about two months, (maybe more) and changes my frizzy mess to soft curls.  </li>
            <li> I live in florida.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this Curl Creme after I ran out of my Miss Jessie&#x27;s Pillow Soft Curls and didn&#x27;t want to spend another $23.00 on that particular product.</li>
            <li> I took fairly large sections of my detangled freshly washed and conditioned hair, raked a quarter sized amount of this on each section (using more for the ends), then topped it off with coconut oil (keeps it from getting crunchy) and twisted - 6 sections altogether.</li>
            <li> First off it smells divine, which is a must for me, and the smell actually stays on your hair.</li>
            <li> My curls came out better than they ever have in the past</li>
            <li> I remember buying this and the goddess curls gel on a whim when I saw them on sale on target, and later loving them enough to keep the almost empty bottles under my sink</li>
            <li> and that it helps with frizz when i want to wear my hair natural!</li>
            <li> Sometimes it&#x27;s a bit heavy for my fine curly hair.</li>
            <li> I had said that after I ran out of Pillow Soft Curls, I would try this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only ever had straight hair, and the care of this was a mystery.  </li>
            <li> I am in my 6th month of transitioning to natural.</li>
            <li> It was soft, my curls were well defined, and it wasn&#x27;t frizzy at all.</li>
            <li> I have 3c/4a kinky curly hair and moisture is important to keep my locks from looking dried out.</li>
            <li> If you have very kinky/coarse hair it will do the same for you.</li>
            <li> But it should still be soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much cheaper at target for only like $9 including tax</li>
            <li> I have type4 natural hair</li>
            <li> I then use Lavish Curls and follow that with Bumble and Bumble Curl Conscious Holding Foam.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly, I apply  this product when my hair is damp.</li>
            <li> as it dries it feels soft</li>
            <li> They both make my curls well defined, moist, and soft.</li>
            <li> Although it says it has soft hold, it works well for me.</li>
            <li> Leaves it soft and moisturized</li>
            <li> I tried it again on freshly washed, dripping wet hair, and I put it in my hair in sections.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and just love this Creme Brule Curls product.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried to use it I was foolish in thinking that I could spread it around on dry hair, ruffle it through and get results.</li>
            <li> I doubt it would help with retaining moisture if you already have really dry hair (my hair is pretty moisturized already when I use this)</li>
            <li> So with that being said it didn&#x27;t make my half curls full curls</li>
            <li> She is a mixed baby (black &amp; Mexican) and I am so in love with how her hair turned out.</li>
            <li> Purchased this recently another rubbish product, truly to many junky products being packed as great, when clearly they are just terrible.</li>
            <li> I use this after my hair is completely dry and it makes it so much softer without a greasy feel afterwards.</li>
            <li> one palm size bit of creme and gell through my wet hair was enough to make my hair dry in full soft curls</li>
            <li> It takes quite a while for my hair to air dry when the sections are large, so I make sure I have at least 10 to 12 hours of dry time.</li>
            <li> plus...just wet your curls a little before bed, apply a small amount, braid your hair, and the next morning your curls are good as new.  </li>
            <li> The only time I&#x27;ll spend that much on a product should be if it&#x27;s a moisturizer that I use every day or every other day between wash-n-go&#x27;s, like Jane Carter Nourish and Shine or Lush R &amp;B.</li>
            <li> When it comes to my natural, afro type hair, I&#x27;m not too big on stylers/gels because I find when my hair has enough moisture, my curls will define themselves.</li>
            <li> I can justify the price of those two products because my hair just eats up the moisture they provide, and I use them frequently, while a styler such as Miss Jessie&#x27;s I would only use after a wash-n-go (every five days).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First found this product in a Target store  35 miles from home near a job that is no more.</li>
            <li> No matter what I put on my hair, my hair was horribly dry (the natural part).</li>
            <li> this product works very well in softening and moisturizing curls and tight coils.</li>
            <li> For the first few times I used this, I avoided using my diffuser because the product specifically says to let the hair air dry.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes my natural hair without the weighed down look.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, just use a blow dryer on low heat to dry each section before you put the product in.</li>
            <li> curls usually dry with frizziness and a bit of roughness in the back,</li>
            <li> And recently, after thinking I&#x27;d finally conquered dryness, my hair became so dry!!</li>
            <li> I hate when there&#x27;s a ton of negative reviews on beauty products when the main issue is that a person doesn&#x27;t know their own hair!</li>
            <li> This was long.</li>
            <li> This works well for me, so long as I remember to clip my hair up.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product for stretched styles.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Months later I stepped out of the shower and realized I had nothing to put in my hair and found the almost empty bottles and decided to give them ago....</li>
            <li> And so for now, I think I&#x27;ve found a solution to my dry, transitioning hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this product in the hopes that it would keep my curls defined when dry and reduce frizz.</li>
            <li> I use a diffuser to dry my hair with the Creme Brule already on it.</li>
            <li> mmmm Highly recommended if your looking for a thick leave in/moisturizer</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, just to get this off my chest...if your hair doesn&#x27;t have a single curl and you buy this in hopes that it&#x27;ll give them to you, you&#x27;re wasting your time.</li>
            <li> I air dried my hair and when it was dry it still had the same shape as it did while wet without the wet look.</li>
            <li> I hate my hair to be hard or crunchy so this product is great for me.  </li>
            <li> On a side note, I always use this product when my hair is wet</li>
            <li> after I cowash on soaking wet hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m mixed with long, thick, curly hair for reference</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Not only did I save product (c&#x27;mon, the bottle&#x27;s so small</li>
            <li> thats it.. other than that..</li>
            <li> These awful products are damaging to your health and hair make your own stop making these fake distributors rich.</li>
            <li> Made me hungry when I used it due to the smell and seemed to weigh down my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick and naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> However, I really wanted to move away from expensive stylers.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure how it works when hair is dry.</li>
            <li> They make slightly crimpy looking strands that may have gotten a bit straighter from stretching my hair out with hair ties spiral up again.</li>
            <li> I bought this with hopes that it would make my hair curlier (the few hairs that aren&#x27;t curly even though i have such thick hair).</li>
            <li> hair(coils that turn into little balls) your curls will be very tight but not very shiny.</li>
            <li> (a quarter size or less does the trick on my thick 4b dry hair)</li>
            <li> Since I get a crazy amount of shrinkage when I twist or braid soaking wet hair, I pinned the sections across my head so they would dry in a stretched out state.</li>
            <li> if it is extreme thick 4c</li>
            <li> I use to use 4-5 products every day to tame my hair....</li>
            <li> I conditioned my hair (combing the conditioner in), micro-fiber towel dried it, did my usual size part and applied Curls Creme Brule.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave behind residue as long as I use it sparingly.</li>
            <li> This stuff made my hair so dried out and hard.</li>
            <li> I usually buy it from somewhere else</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d probably only get three uses out of it if I used it wrong) but the finished result was springy, non-frizzy curls that weren&#x27;t crunchy.</li>
            <li> I decided to try using my diffuser to dry my hair because I was strapped for time and because I don&#x27;t want wet hair in the cold nights.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It clumps my girls but does not have that hard feel that you get with the use of gel.</li>
            <li> but my hair is a little on the thin side, and this product defines my curls without flattening my hair, which can happen with thinner hair.  </li>
            <li> The shipping and handling was as spected even tough</li>
            <li> thin, 2c hair.</li>
            <li> Someone said they disliked the artificial fragrance.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this product by mistake, as I am not of mixed ethnicity and I have thin, 2c hair. Using this product alone made my hair quite oily. But I took to mixing it half and half with a regular (non-curl) leave-in and it suits my curls perfectly. For years I have been adding about 10 drops of oil to my non-curl leave-ins, and this seems to do the same thing (FYI I use Macadamia Leave-In or L&#x27;Anza Healing Colorcare Trauma Treatment). I love the smell and I&#x27;m perfectly happy with the results. I hate when there&#x27;s a ton of negative reviews on beauty products when the main issue is that a person doesn&#x27;t know their own hair!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I usually buy it from somewhere else but I just happened to look and see that Amazon had it for $10. When I twist my hair this product helps me keep great curl definition. I wouldn&#x27;t pay more than $10 but I&#x27;m glad that I gave this product a chance.</li>
            <li> When it comes to my natural, afro type hair, I&#x27;m not too big on stylers/gels because I find when my hair has enough moisture, my curls will define themselves. However, I bought this stuff on a whim one day and when I took a sniff...I had to put it on my hair. I just HAD to. I am obsessive over good smelling things and smelling good all the time, and if my hair could smell as wonderful as this stuff does I&#x27;d be one happy camper. The first time I tried to use it I was foolish in thinking that I could spread it around on dry hair, ruffle it through and get results. Maybe some thinner hair types can, but not me. I tried it again on freshly washed, dripping wet hair, and I put it in my hair in sections. Not only did I save product (c&#x27;mon, the bottle&#x27;s so small I&#x27;d probably only get three uses out of it if I used it wrong) but the finished result was springy, non-frizzy curls that weren&#x27;t crunchy. LOOOOVE ITTTT.  I don&#x27;t use it as much nowadays because my main focus is just trying to grow it out, so I mainly use it on my looser, curlier strands near the crown of my head that sometimes hang out of hairstyles I do. They make slightly crimpy looking strands that may have gotten a bit straighter from stretching my hair out with hair ties spiral up again. It&#x27;s wonderful. I&#x27;d highly recommend it.  HOWEVER, just to get this off my chest...if your hair doesn&#x27;t have a single curl and you buy this in hopes that it&#x27;ll give them to you, you&#x27;re wasting your time. Curl defining products can only define a curl that&#x27;s already there. I just had to put that out there. I&#x27;m tired of seeing reviews on products where a person gets mad that their curls aren&#x27;t defined and they have no curls to start out with.  I&#x27;m sorry. This was long. I&#x27;m done now. Haha</li>
            <li> I decided to try this Curl Creme after I ran out of my Miss Jessie&#x27;s Pillow Soft Curls and didn&#x27;t want to spend another $23.00 on that particular product. Now, don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love my Miss Jessie&#x27;s. It was the first product I used after I fully transistioned that really showed me the true nature of my curls. However, I really wanted to move away from expensive stylers. The only time I&#x27;ll spend that much on a product should be if it&#x27;s a moisturizer that I use every day or every other day between wash-n-go&#x27;s, like Jane Carter Nourish and Shine or Lush R &amp;B. I can justify the price of those two products because my hair just eats up the moisture they provide, and I use them frequently, while a styler such as Miss Jessie&#x27;s I would only use after a wash-n-go (every five days).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, I had seen this product before whilst browsing the aisles of Target. I already use the Goddess Curls gel from this line and love it. I had said that after I ran out of Pillow Soft Curls, I would try this one. I purchased this at Target for $10.99. I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s more expensive than the companion product, but I digress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This claims to be a super light whipped curl cream that defines curls without adding hold and eliminates frizz. For me, nothing eliminates my frizz halo, so I&#x27;ve stopped fighting it. I wanted nice curl definition and slightly less hold than the Goddess Curls gel gives me. This product provides all of these things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like the other CURLS brand products, you really cannot just throw a huge glop of this in your hair and still expect it to look good. It just won&#x27;t work. I&#x27;ve taken to just dividing my hair into four sections and using slightly larger than a dime size for each section. This works well for me, so long as I remember to clip my hair up. For the first few times I used this, I avoided using my diffuser because the product specifically says to let the hair air dry. Well, in the words of &amp;#34;sweet brown&amp;#34; wilkins: &amp;#34;Ain&#x27;tnobody got time for that!&amp;#34;. I decided to try using my diffuser to dry my hair because I was strapped for time and because I don&#x27;t want wet hair in the cold nights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy to report that this product works well even when using a diffuser. My curls are soft and defined after a good scrunch, and they look better as the week progresses on. My hair does frizz a litle bit when using this, but its really nothing to complain about since I&#x27;ve learned to just live with and embrace my frizz. I can easily stretch my wash n go to five days after using this product with only a nightly spritz of water and a swipe of a light moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the smell is amazing! It smells like marshmallows. So delicious.And the best part-it doesn&#x27;t linger!&lt;br /&gt;So, all in all, this is a wonderful product to use if  you have very curly hair. It will leave it defined and curly, with not a lot of hold. And it&#x27;s a very affordable product.</li>
            <li> My organic product recently was discontinued and I&#x27;ve gone to this. I like the texture but do not care for synthetic fragrances, which this definitely has. Some may love that fake coconut/baked-good smell, but I&#x27;d rather they leave it out because otherwise it would be perfect.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve gone through 3 rounds of chemo over 3 years, and lost my hair, then it grew back curly!  I&#x27;ve only ever had straight hair, and the care of this was a mystery.  Curls Creme Brule is wonderful.  This bottle has lasted about two months, (maybe more) and changes my frizzy mess to soft curls.  It&#x27;s not greasy, but then I only use about a dime sized dollop.  It&#x27;s not expensive, and does the trick.</li>
            <li> I have very thick and naturally curly hair. This has been wonderful on my hair.  I use to use 4-5 products every day to tame my hair....not anymore, now I only need one product (this one) to do what my hair is supposed to do...look natural, healthy and frizz free. Love, love, LOVE it!!!!</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what it says. It&#x27;s like desert for your hair! First off it smells divine, which is a must for me, and the smell actually stays on your hair. It&#x27;s super moisturizing and helps soften and define curls. I will definitely buy again</li>
            <li> I am in my 6th month of transitioning to natural. And recently, after thinking I&#x27;d finally conquered dryness, my hair became so dry!! No matter what I put on my hair, my hair was horribly dry (the natural part). I was really running out of ideas. I went to CVS and looked at the shelves, wondering what could possibly help. I bought the Curls Creme Brule and another product by Dark and Lovely Au Naturale called 10-1 Gelee. I first put the curls creme brule through a section of my hair, and noticed that it hydrated the natural part of my hair, causing curl definition. I then put the 10 in 1 over that same section and twisted--repeating for my entire head. I don&#x27;t know how permanent the results will be. But my hair does feel hydrated. And so for now, I think I&#x27;ve found a solution to my dry, transitioning hair.</li>
            <li> a great product.  This is my staple to natural hair moisturizing when I need a more cream based approached.  smells great, doesn&#x27;t revert straightened hair and just doesn&#x27;t have overwhelming processed ingredients.</li>
            <li> Really strong smell. Returned it and they were great about returning it.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products and techniques when trying to achieve an attractive wash &#x27;n go style. I seen this on sale for $10 &amp; since my Pantene for women of color cream was running super low I made this purchase. I conditioned my hair (combing the conditioner in), micro-fiber towel dried it, did my usual size part and applied Curls Creme Brule. It wasn&#x27;t sticky and distributed evenly. I air dried my hair and when it was dry it still had the same shape as it did while wet without the wet look. It was soft, my curls were well defined, and it wasn&#x27;t frizzy at all. My mom immediately noticed and complimented me on the difference and insisted I use this product from now on.</li>
            <li> This product does wonders for my twist outs and braidouts. I have 3c/4a kinky curly hair and moisture is important to keep my locks from looking dried out. I took fairly large sections of my detangled freshly washed and conditioned hair, raked a quarter sized amount of this on each section (using more for the ends), then topped it off with coconut oil (keeps it from getting crunchy) and twisted - 6 sections altogether. Since I get a crazy amount of shrinkage when I twist or braid soaking wet hair, I pinned the sections across my head so they would dry in a stretched out state. I got lovely curls the next day that were soft and shiny. It takes quite a while for my hair to air dry when the sections are large, so I make sure I have at least 10 to 12 hours of dry time. Otherwise, just use a blow dryer on low heat to dry each section before you put the product in. This also eliminates the shrinkage issue but heat causes damage to beware. Then just spritz the ends so they don&#x27;t get frizzy. Smells so good and the curls are defined enough to last for a couple of days if you sleep on a satin pillowcase or scarf. I really like this and will keep it in my routine.</li>
            <li> This cream brule cream is fabulous and the smell is just as awesome</li>
            <li> First, let me start off by saying, this stuff smells decadent. It mimic that smell of nilla cookies. Or something vanillay and doughy. Someone said they disliked the artificial fragrance. I honestly don&#x27;t know what they were talking about because it does not smell artificial to me. It smells like a warm bakery vanilla scent mixed into a hair product that blends smoothly. Plus it say right there on the bottle. &amp;#34;no artificial sulfates, silicones, parabens, artificial oils, colors, or FRAGRANCE&amp;#34; and also certified organic ingredients. Now enough about the scent.  this product works very well in softening and moisturizing curls and tight coils. If you have very kinky/coarse hair it will do the same for you. You apply it in sections and feel/see the difference immediately. Now if your hair is curly it probably will work just fine in curling your hair. If you have coily kinky hair.i highly recommend perm rods.they are very cheap. depending on how loose your coils are the better the results (I.e shinier prominent curls) if it is extreme thick 4c hair(coils that turn into little balls) your curls will be very tight but not very shiny. But it should still be soft and moisturized. However  if it&#x27;s 4c, but not crazily scrunched up maybe 4b ish it will give you some shine and 4a hair  should have generous result along with decent shine and looser curls. 3c people (who are more curly and not really at all coily) will probably get the best results if they tried perm rods, but they should do well by themselves because their hair is much more silkier and looser.</li>
            <li> Purchased this recently another rubbish product, truly to many junky products being packed as great, when clearly they are just terrible. Drying to the hair smell medicinal, which equates to toxic. These awful products are damaging to your health and hair make your own stop making these fake distributors rich.</li>
            <li> Made me hungry when I used it due to the smell and seemed to weigh down my hair.  May be good for others but didn&#x27;t give me the look I was going for.</li>
            <li> Smells great, but not moisturizing enough for my 4A/4B hair.</li>
            <li> I was originally looking for something mild enough to put in my baby&#x27;s hair. And something to keep my crunchy hair moist. I brought the whole line ! My nappy hair is comb- able and moist and I only need this one product for my babys natural curl :-)</li>
            <li> What can i say it speaks for itself with its organic ingredients! After spending lots of money on trying to find the right moisturizer THIS IS It! works wounders on my 4c hair! And tge smell is AWESOME!  have found the PERFECT MOISTERIZER! When nothing else worked! AM HOOKED!</li>
            <li> I am a product junkie. I have fine 4C hair. So I can say that being a naturalist is work. However this product worked wonders for me, and smells great to boot. I applied on my hair after and sealed with castor oil. I loved it. I live in florida. And the heat dries ones hair fast, and sitting at the beach gives your afro life. Its just all at the wrong time. I love this line. VERY VERY helpful for the needs of my hair.</li>
            <li> I have 3c hair, and although my curls are easily defined when wet, once my hair dries often times my hair can become frizzy. I bought this product in the hopes that it would keep my curls defined when dry and reduce frizz. For this it works like a charm. I will say that less is more (which is a good thing because this stuff goes fast if you&#x27;re using it everyday like I do) and it also helps with moisture.  I doubt it would help with retaining moisture if you already have really dry hair (my hair is pretty moisturized already when I use this) but if you are using the curl creme brule for curl defining and/or frizz control I strongly recommend it.  On a side note, I always use this product when my hair is wet so I&#x27;m not sure how it works when hair is dry. Also, I bought it at target for 10.00 dollars, so just an fyi that you can possibly buy it cheaper in a store.</li>
            <li> I used it on my 2 year olds&#x27; head the same day I got it. Let me tell you I have tried Everything for her curls but there wasn&#x27;t anything that was leaving them defined and not frizzy. She is a mixed baby (black &amp; Mexican) and I am so in love with how her hair turned out. I going to order this in bulk..LOL</li>
            <li> I use it for weave curly hair it light it smell great and no bill up will purchase more bottles for a friend.....</li>
            <li> Leave a residue behind. Did not like it.</li>
            <li> I am still learning what it can do to my hair. Smells good!</li>
            <li> So I bought this product on a whim since i wanted to cut down my many styling products into one that would give my hair more of a hold. I originally bought the Goddess Curls but that didnt moisturize my type 4 hair at all. So i got the Creme Brulee to go along with it. Let me tell you, this stuff is definitely a staple. I may not buy the gel again but i&#x27;m def rebuying this. It tames my hair and adds moisture and great definition which is a godsend considering type 4 hair is mostly coils and kinks instead of curls. Give it a try, you might be pleasantly surprised like I was :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus a little goes a long way. It&#x27;s much cheaper at target for only like $9 including tax</li>
            <li> I have type4 natural hair and I use this product as a moisturizer and it does the job (still searching for products). Note that it is water pasted and will cause your hair to shrink. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product for stretched styles. The smell is just too good which is why i decided to try it. The bottle does state that it doesn&#x27;t have great hold for those looking for it. Also you don&#x27;t have to follow the directions as stated.</li>
            <li> I tried this product on a whim while at target. I absolutely love this now!!! It smells delicious like cake batter and it&#x27;s creamy consistency glides through my transitioning hair. I use this after my hair is completely dry and it makes it so much softer without a greasy feel afterwards. (a quarter size or less does the trick on my thick 4b dry hair) Plus my hair smells like cake batter all day. mmmm Highly recommended if your looking for a thick leave in/moisturizer</li>
            <li> I am a 4B with 4A texture in the crown and nape. If u have a 3 or 4A texture this works ok as a styler.  Otherwise it dosent do much at all and gel is still needed</li>
            <li> First time user of this product, and I am not disappointed. My curls came out better than they ever have in the past</li>
            <li> Perfect for my curly/wavy Euro Jewish hair. First found this product in a Target store  35 miles from home near a job that is no more. Have not seen it again in stores closer to home.  The price is right here at Amazon.</li>
            <li> love, love, love this on my natural hair.. Really does help curl my twists</li>
            <li> I am a transitioner into my 15 month post relaxer.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE LOVE LOVE this product. It moisturizes my natural hair without the weighed down look.  The product works very well with my relaxed texture as well, in turn making it easy for both textures to blend spotless. I love braidouts and this product delivers. I apply my Giovanni leave in, castor oil, and curls. This combination leaves both textures looking and feeling GREAT!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and just love this Creme Brule Curls product. I use a diffuser to dry my hair with the Creme Brule already on it. It smells good enough to eat. I then use Lavish Curls and follow that with Bumble and Bumble Curl Conscious Holding Foam. All of these products are applied to my hair before I diffuse it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not found a better regimen than these three products used together. If you have wavy or curly hair, these will define your curls and give you a beautiful looking hairdo that will last at least two days and maybe three without your having to do anything except define your curls with your fingers in the morning. I&#x27;ve never used anything like these before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To top it off, most people ask what smells so good!</li>
            <li> well in looking for the magic bullet to make my hair the way I want it or how they advertise, I would say this is something that at least makes my hair soft and it smells great and it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy.  but my hair still doesn&#x27;t look anything like the women in the ad with these smooth, elongated curls.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice if you like smell. Sometimes it&#x27;s a bit heavy for my fine curly hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m transitioning. So for the natrual part of my hair it works fabulous but my relaxed hair hates it. I&#x27;ll probably just keep it for when I eventually big chop</li>
            <li> I have 2c/3a curls, but I need help with hold. This product didn&#x27;t really do anything for my hair. It was almost like there was nothing in there. Not impressed</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I like the feel of my hair after I use it and the smell is delightful.  It clumps my girls but does not have that hard feel that you get with the use of gel. My wash and go looks good for several days after use.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, makes my hair feel good and easy to style.  I will purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> This product was horrible. My hair became really tough, it tangled, and was just annoying. Only good thing is that it smelled great..thats it.. other than that..nothing good to say about it.</li>
            <li> Work good for curly hair not the great for national black hair</li>
            <li> This cream is a miracle!! Leaves my curls with weavy style, I use to combine two types of creams (in this case with miss jessie&#x27;s) and my hair stays all day long perfectly.  The shipping and handling was as spected even tough Im in Colombia. Totally recommended</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly, I apply  this product when my hair is damp. as it dries it feels soft, my hair doesn&#x27;t have a &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; appearance, rather smooth and kept</li>
            <li> I remember buying this and the goddess curls gel on a whim when I saw them on sale on target, and later loving them enough to keep the almost empty bottles under my sink so I wouldn&#x27;t forget them ...time got away from me though and I never got around to getting it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Months later I stepped out of the shower and realized I had nothing to put in my hair and found the almost empty bottles and decided to give them ago....and ...o...m.....g....how could i forget this!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m mixed with long, thick, curly hair for reference&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My curls usually dry with frizziness and a bit of roughness in the back, one palm size bit of creme and gell through my wet hair was enough to make my hair dry in full soft curls easily finger combed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big plus...just wet your curls a little before bed, apply a small amount, braid your hair, and the next morning your curls are good as new.  I can&#x27;t wait to get my new bottles and try more of this line.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner! I incorporated this product into my wash and go routine after my big chop and my hair has never been better. My curls are well defined, soft, springy, and my hair is growing back very nicely. Best of all, my boyfriend also uses this, and it makes his hair smell like cupcakes. He is able to smooth it in to his hair damp or dry because it&#x27;s short, and its perfectly styled every time.</li>
            <li> I have type 2B hair. It really defines my waves and makes them look smooth. Doesn&#x27;t leave behind residue as long as I use it sparingly. And it smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> Excellent curl definer for my 4a type of hair.  I love both this product and the new 4Naturals Curls Craze lotion.  They both make my curls well defined, moist, and soft. I hate my hair to be hard or crunchy so this product is great for me.  I apply it (finger combing/raking) after I cowash on soaking wet hair.  The trick is not to touch hair afterwards.  The smell is DIVINE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  2nd day was nice too. I just refreshed/saturated hair with water (using a bottle spray) and let the water puff up my flattened curls. I then shook hair to loosen the curls.  I really love this product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product. At first, I thought the smell would really bother me (it has a VERY STRONG creme brulee odor), but the smell doesn&#x27;t stick around long, so it&#x27;s fine. Although not really touted for its hold, I find that this product does hold my curls nicely for most of the day without making my hair crunchy. I have big curls but my hair is a little on the thin side, and this product defines my curls without flattening my hair, which can happen with thinner hair.  I usually put some of this all over my hair, and then I leave some on my hands and twist a few of my own curls in the front and sides of my head, which has been looking really nice.  Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I use this for my type 4b/c twist outs and braid outs. Although it says it has soft hold, it works well for me. So far the only product I like more is Oyin Handmade Hair Dew. I think that the Creme Brule gives some decent hold because of the aloe in it. It indeed has some moisturizing qualities. I&#x27;d recommend this product without hesitiation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this product 2 stars for the smell because it does smell great. I tried to use this product many different ways to see if I could get better results, but to no avail. This stuff made my hair so dried out and hard. I used it during the summer months primarily and I continued to hope this product would work if I continued to use it. Sorry this stuff is horrible for low porosity hair.</li>
            <li> Smells GREAT! I am a very curly girl.  My hair has taken very well to this product.  Very light weight non-greasy.</li>
            <li> Works great in hair.... Leaves it soft and moisturized</li>
            <li> So happy to have found my favorite styling product.  I stocked up in case I can&#x27;t find it again, very happy.</li>
            <li> this only getting four starts because i feel like it doesn&#x27;t help make my hair any curlier. I have fairly curly hair but after years of straightening some peices are just barely wavey. I bought this with hopes that it would make my hair curlier (the few hairs that aren&#x27;t curly even though i have such thick hair). So with that being said it didn&#x27;t make my half curls full curls but it did help with frizz. it also SMELLS AMAZING. it reminds me of vanilla cupcake lip smackers lip gloss i used to have. its a pretty natural hair product that helps with frizz and i totally think its worth trying. it may work better for you then me :) i do reccommend you buy this becuase of the amazing smell that isn&#x27;t too strong after you put it on its very faint so don&#x27;t worry about that and that it helps with frizz when i want to wear my hair natural! yayy for no frizz</li>
            <li> I had an allergoc reaction to the smell.. Nauseating! This product accomplished nothing to my hair.  I gave it to a friend.</li>
            <li> Mostly organic ingredient,  works great. Smells like vanilla cream pie.</li>
            <li> love this product and delivery was on time, will buy again!</li>
