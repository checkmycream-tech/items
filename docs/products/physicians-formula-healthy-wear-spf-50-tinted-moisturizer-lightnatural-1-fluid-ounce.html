    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>and I had been wanting to find a tinted moisturizer, so I thought it was perfect.</li>
            <li>Perfect for summer.</li>
            <li>Its moisturizing, awesome SPF protection and</li>
            <li>no applying foundations - its perfect!!!</li>
            <li>I use this foundation as sunscreen for my face and it provides excellent coverage and protection.</li>
            <li>and I use it, and I am impressed.  </li>
            <li>It helps even out my skin tone without feeling like I&#x27;m wearing a mask, it keeps my skin hydrated, it blends perfectly with my skin tone, and it has a killer SPF.</li>
            <li>This product is awesome!</li>
            <li>It is a great light-to-medium coverage that feel light-weight and gives excellent moisture.</li>
            <li>I get the light/natural color and it is perfect for my fair skin.  </li>
            <li>And 50 SPF is a great plus.</li>
            <li>I cannot find this product in stores anymore, so I was happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The even tone and great coverage  LASTS all day.  </li>
            <li>container is great.  </li>
            <li>I have a fair complexion</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, I have fair skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The light color of this moisturizer is perfect for my skin.</li>
            <li>So if the Healthy Wear SPF 50 Tinted Moisturizer sounds like the perfect fit for you too - step away from this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week - and its ingenious!</li>
            <li>I really love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I really love this product!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, it sets really beautifully, and really gives great coverage.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been a write a review kind of person</li>
            <li>/&gt;In conclusion, I kind of avoid this stuff, then curiosity gets to me</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s a bit heavier than I expected, but the color matches my own skin tone perfectly and evens out imperfections while providing great moisture and sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I love the pump, I love the cheery color.  </li>
            <li>I also have very fair skin with many facial freckles which are not covered, but accentuated by this product in a great way.</li>
            <li>This is not for a light, fair skin.</li>
            <li>Really, really love it.</li>
            <li>I typically love Physicians Formula products and buy their concealer, blush, and powder.  </li>
            <li>And why does this have to have so many chemicals?  </li>
            <li>This mousturizer has better coverage than any foundation I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Go buy it &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>I have tried many &amp;#34;CC&amp;#34; creams and that is what I am comparing this with.  </li>
            <li>, I hope it&#x27;s not discontinued...but e-bay has a better price, FYI.</li>
            <li>I really do receive compliments, and believe me, my skin isn&#x27;t all that great.  </li>
            <li>I was in the market for a tinted moisturizer, and this product is more like a moisturized tint.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>When put on top of another moisturizer, the Physician&#x27;s Formula tinted moisturizer blends much better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit more sanitary than something you can stick your bacteria-ridden fingers in.</li>
            <li>I love that is</li>
            <li>I am sure the SPF ingredients work just fine - it is the tinted component that is not so healthy feeling.  </li>
            <li>They also make a powder foundation but that makes my face to dry and cakey looking - this product works great for me!</li>
            <li>Great coverage and really natural looking.</li>
            <li>it looks great even on naturally oily skin.</li>
            <li>so I have to be easy with the makeup I wear.  </li>
            <li>If you apply with your hands, its easy to end up with streaks.  </li>
            <li>Easy</li>
            <li>It works fine, but I wish there were a lighter shade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe I got so lucky!</li>
            <li>But, as a sheer foundation with SPF on top of my normal, heavy-duty moisturizer, it works great!</li>
            <li>I bought it as a moisturizer but use it as a light foundation.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic.</li>
            <li>This dilutes the moisturizer and makes it more sheer and hydrating for days when my skin looks good.</li>
            <li>ORIGINAL REVIEW:</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great when I can find something mixed with the right tone for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My mild acne is also improving.  </li>
            <li>It blends very nicely with any other kind of moisturizer and feels less like foundation and more like a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nothing like the first one I had which I loved and used daily.</li>
            <li>It is fairly heavy going on, but it lasts and provides great coverage.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>Please note that you MAY really like this product if you are used to a full coverage liquid makeup and lots of shine.  </li>
            <li>A little pasty looking on the skin, but otherwise it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>I generally like Physician&#x27;s Formula, but I think this product really needs more work on their part.</li>
            <li>I have been looking forever for a foundation that has an SPF over 30 and finally found it in the physicians formula healthy wear.</li>
            <li>While this product is called a tinted moisturizer, I feel that is more like a sheer, moisturizing foundation.</li>
            <li>The only drawback I find in this product is that it is more drying than moisturizing.</li>
            <li>They are doing great with new &#x27;green&#x27; packaging</li>
            <li>It felt oily, and I just felt like I had a huge layer of makeup on my face (even though I had barely put any on).</li>
            <li>I prefer sheer foundations because my skin is generally good, and I am trying to achieve a more natural everyday look when I am teaching in the classroom.</li>
            <li>far, I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 years in total, and I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with my experience.</li>
            <li>Plus, you really need to slather on sunscreen for it to work, and you can&#x27;t do that with this product.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend for anyone with sun sensitivity!  </li>
            <li>and it really smoothes out my skin tone.</li>
            <li>is very valuable to me.</li>
            <li>(it is fairly liquidy/oily) and provides coverage but is not cakey or too thick so as to look unnatural.  </li>
            <li>It looks natural and the color is just right for my light-medium skin.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, it is priced extremely well for such a good product.</li>
            <li>I have had a good relationship with Physicians Formula and was hoping they would come out with a tinted moisturizer product that did not have the perfumes like their other tinted moisturizers - low and behold: here it is!!!</li>
            <li>Like other review said: why so many chemicals?</li>
            <li>I wanted a higher SPF and a little more coverage than Clinique&#x27;s City Block, but I&#x27;m sticking City Block that instead of using this.  </li>
            <li>On my skin, this felt more like that super cheap $3 makeup you get at the Dollar Store (perhaps worse actually).</li>
            <li>I try to apply it while my previous moisturizer is still &amp;#34;wet,&amp;#34; to blend them both in better and allow it to soak in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>is 50 SPF instead of the typical 15 that is in most tinted moisturizers and makeups.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I normally wear MAC make up but wanted something lighter for summer with built in SPF.  </li>
            <li>Blended with a makeup wedge and used as a foundation or mixed with regular sunscreen, it works fine, but it&#x27;s not what I meant to buy at all.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I could imagine that if you live in a humid climate or want a very sheer foundation as you would expect from a \\&quot;tinted moisturizer\\&quot; that this might seem to heavy (as some other reviewers have noted), but it works great for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s way more opaque than I expected and also has a sort of orange tone to it that their other products don&#x27;t have.  </li>
            <li>Not heavy and just gives sheer coverage!</li>
            <li>: Most days I mix it with my regular moisturizer to help thin it out a bit.</li>
            <li>/Feel: Like other reviewers, I felt that this tinted moisturizer felt more like a runny foundation than a thick moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li>My skin is relatively dry and my sense of smell is very sensitive, so to have a moisturizer that can double as makeup and not give me a migraine from the smell</li>
            <li>It keeps it lighter and it smooths on a little better (but not on heavy sun exposure days)!</li>
            <li>The color is a bit dark for pale skin (I&#x27;m really pale), but overall it&#x27;s a good alternative to other face sunscreens.</li>

            <li> I live in a very dry climate (Phoenix) and have dry skin.</li>
            <li> Covers my extreme redness completely and blocks both A &amp; B UV rays to prevent my skin reacting to the sun or indoor lighting.  </li>
            <li> I set it with powder, usually the PF SPF 50 compact, and it really stays.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I live in Arizona and need a high SPF sunscreen--this is SPF 50 which is very hard to find.  </li>
            <li> My skin still felt super dry, it didn&#x27;t soak in and moisturize at all, and it was very hard to spread.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Normally, I actually combine this tinted moisturizer with another plain moisturizer with similar SPF.</li>
            <li> By itself, the moisturizer is insufficient to keep my very dry skin hydrated.</li>
            <li> It feels a little gross, even though my skin is on the drier side.  </li>
            <li> It has become harder to find</li>
            <li> Unlike some white-Caucasian women, my skin tone is yellow/olive, so the &amp;#34;fair&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; colors in other brands are often too pink for me.</li>

            <li> I thought the point of tinted moisturizer is for it to be lightweight, and for it to give you the feel of moisturizer with some of the slight benefits from makeup?</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Like other review said: why so many chemicals? Look at the list of Ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;If you buy sunscreen, should stay way from: Retinyl palmitate, titanium dioxide, Iron oxides.&lt;br /&gt;And all of them are in this &amp;#34;healthy wear&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I bought it as a moisturizer but use it as a light foundation.  Great coverage and really natural looking. My skin looks amazing. And 50 SPF is a great plus. This is replacing my foundation, moisturizer and sunscreen.  Really, really love it.</li>
            <li> I typically love Physicians Formula products and buy their concealer, blush, and powder.  I have a fair complexion so I have to be easy with the makeup I wear.  So if the Healthy Wear SPF 50 Tinted Moisturizer sounds like the perfect fit for you too - step away from this product.  It is heavy, cakey and is certainly not ideal for anyone who prefers a lighter feel to makeup on the face.  I am sure the SPF ingredients work just fine - it is the tinted component that is not so healthy feeling.  Please note that you MAY really like this product if you are used to a full coverage liquid makeup and lots of shine.  And why does this have to have so many chemicals?  They are doing great with new &#x27;green&#x27; packaging so kudos to PF for that!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been a write a review kind of person but I bought this moisturizer two days ago and I will never buy anything else again.  I normally wear MAC make up but wanted something lighter for summer with built in SPF.  This mousturizer has better coverage than any foundation I have ever used.  It doesn&#x27;t look cakey or exaggerate my forehead 11&#x27;s.  My mild acne is also improving.  I love this stuff!  Go buy it &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> ORIGINAL REVIEW: If you want a moisturizing foundation with a high SPF and your skin tone matches one of the shades, this will work for you, but I actually wanted a tinted sunscreen/moisturizer and was disappointed.  It&#x27;s way more opaque than I expected and also has a sort of orange tone to it that their other products don&#x27;t have.  If you apply with your hands, its easy to end up with streaks.  Plus, you really need to slather on sunscreen for it to work, and you can&#x27;t do that with this product.  You&#x27;d end up looking ridiculously made up if you wore enough of it to protect your face at the beach.  Blended with a makeup wedge and used as a foundation or mixed with regular sunscreen, it works fine, but it&#x27;s not what I meant to buy at all.  I wanted a higher SPF and a little more coverage than Clinique&#x27;s City Block, but I&#x27;m sticking City Block that instead of using this.  (If you buy from the Clinique website, the price is comparable to this product, at the moment it&#x27;s nearly twice as expensive on Amazon.)    UPDATE: This product separated after about six weeks and I threw it out. So even if what you want is an opaque moisturizing foundation, you may want to buy something else.  Don&#x27;t know how widespread this problem is or if I just got a bad batch of it, but I&#x27;ve never had that happen with makeup before.  I generally like Physician&#x27;s Formula, but I think this product really needs more work on their part.</li>
            <li> I have been looking forever for a foundation that has an SPF over 30 and finally found it in the physicians formula healthy wear. There are 4 different colors to choose from so if you find something close to your shade it seems to blend well. I can finally get rid of the moisturizer, sunscreen &amp; foundation and just use this 1 product. They also make a powder foundation but that makes my face to dry and cakey looking - this product works great for me! LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> This was 75% off at CVS and I had been wanting to find a tinted moisturizer, so I thought it was perfect. I got it home and washed my face and tried it on, and I felt like I immediately needed to wash my face again! I thought the point of tinted moisturizer is for it to be lightweight, and for it to give you the feel of moisturizer with some of the slight benefits from makeup? This didn&#x27;t feel like moisturizer at all. My skin still felt super dry, it didn&#x27;t soak in and moisturize at all, and it was very hard to spread. It felt oily, and I just felt like I had a huge layer of makeup on my face (even though I had barely put any on). On my skin, this felt more like that super cheap $3 makeup you get at the Dollar Store (perhaps worse actually). I definitely won&#x27;t be trying this again.</li>
            <li> I love this. Worth the money. Been using it for the past two years. Can&#x27;t beat SPF 50. Does not make me break out. Perfect for summer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week - and its ingenious! Its moisturizing, awesome SPF protection and it looks great even on naturally oily skin. Use it like you would lotion and your skin just glows - no makeup brushes, no applying foundations - its perfect!!! Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I use this foundation as sunscreen for my face and it provides excellent coverage and protection. I cannot find this product in stores anymore, so I was happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have tried many &amp;#34;CC&amp;#34; creams and that is what I am comparing this with.  I get the light/natural color and it is perfect for my fair skin.  I live in Arizona and need a high SPF sunscreen--this is SPF 50 which is very hard to find.  It goes on smoothly (it is fairly liquidy/oily) and provides coverage but is not cakey or too thick so as to look unnatural.  I have ordered and reordered this, and I am comparing it to smashbox foundation, a different physician&#x27;s formula &amp;#34;cc&amp;#34; cream, cover girl CC cream and Rimmel&#x27;s version, all of which sit unused because they don&#x27;t work as well.  It has become harder to find, I hope it&#x27;s not discontinued...but e-bay has a better price, FYI.</li>
            <li> This is a hard one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I have fair skin.  This necessitated the lightest shade, which I find to be slightly too dark.  It works fine, but I wish there were a lighter shade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the texture is gross.  Watery and greasy.  It feels a little gross, even though my skin is on the drier side.  HOWEVER, it sets really beautifully, and really gives great coverage.  It evens me out, covers redness, and I get a ton of compliments.  WTF?  I&#x27;ve concluded that it takes a foundation brush to apply it evenly, which takes getting used to, but the gross feeling goes away once it sets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The even tone and great coverage  LASTS all day.  I really do receive compliments, and believe me, my skin isn&#x27;t all that great.  I set it with powder, usually the PF SPF 50 compact, and it really stays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The container is great.  I love the pump, I love the cheery color.  Easy transport.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though it&#x27;s a heavier coverage than I&#x27;m used to, it DOESN&#x27;T break me out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I kind of avoid this stuff, then curiosity gets to me and I use it, and I am impressed.  I&#x27;ll buy another.</li>
            <li> I live in a very dry climate (Phoenix) and have dry skin. I need intensive UV protection and moisturizing. This product is fantastic. It is fairly heavy going on, but it lasts and provides great coverage. It looks natural and the color is just right for my light-medium skin. I could imagine that if you live in a humid climate or want a very sheer foundation as you would expect from a \\&quot;tinted moisturizer\\&quot; that this might seem to heavy (as some other reviewers have noted), but it works great for me. In my opinion, it is priced extremely well for such a good product.</li>
            <li> The color is a bit dark for pale skin (I&#x27;m really pale), but overall it&#x27;s a good alternative to other face sunscreens.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this because it&#x27;s watery. Nothing like the first one I had which I loved and used daily. Something happened to mess up the consistency. Who knows but I won&#x27;t order this product again. :(</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff! I was in the market for a tinted moisturizer, and this product is more like a moisturized tint. Yes, it&#x27;s a bit heavier than I expected, but the color matches my own skin tone perfectly and evens out imperfections while providing great moisture and sunscreen. This will 100% replace my current foundation. I can&#x27;t believe I got so lucky!</li>
            <li> I need an SPF 50 makeup and this is the only one I can use!!  Highly recommend for anyone with sun sensitivity!  Covers my extreme redness completely and blocks both A &amp; B UV rays to prevent my skin reacting to the sun or indoor lighting.  This product is a literal lifesaver, I cannot say enough about it!!  I have very sensitive skin and it protects my skin and prevents it reacting.  I wear it with or without moisturizer and it really smoothes out my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I really love this product!  Not heavy and just gives sheer coverage! I wear it in place of makeup in the summer.  Too bad it took so long to ship!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff. It helps even out my skin tone without feeling like I&#x27;m wearing a mask, it keeps my skin hydrated, it blends perfectly with my skin tone, and it has a killer SPF. After wearing this, I will never go back to a powder or heavier liquid again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Most days I mix it with my regular moisturizer to help thin it out a bit. It keeps it lighter and it smooths on a little better (but not on heavy sun exposure days)!</li>
            <li> While this product is called a tinted moisturizer, I feel that is more like a sheer, moisturizing foundation. I use it everyday as a replacement for makeup foundation. I prefer sheer foundations because my skin is generally good, and I am trying to achieve a more natural everyday look when I am teaching in the classroom. To this end, it definitely works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Texture/Feel: Like other reviewers, I felt that this tinted moisturizer felt more like a runny foundation than a thick moisturizing cream. By itself, the moisturizer is insufficient to keep my very dry skin hydrated. But, as a sheer foundation with SPF on top of my normal, heavy-duty moisturizer, it works great! I can see how others might get streaks when applying this tinted moisturizer with their hands. I prefer to use a makeup sponge to even it out after I apply it with my hands. When put on top of another moisturizer, the Physician&#x27;s Formula tinted moisturizer blends much better. I try to apply it while my previous moisturizer is still &amp;#34;wet,&amp;#34; to blend them both in better and allow it to soak in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally, I actually combine this tinted moisturizer with another plain moisturizer with similar SPF. This dilutes the moisturizer and makes it more sheer and hydrating for days when my skin looks good. I dilute it less for days when my skin is having problems. It blends very nicely with any other kind of moisturizer and feels less like foundation and more like a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The light color of this moisturizer is perfect for my skin. I am Asian-American with fairer skin. Unlike some white-Caucasian women, my skin tone is yellow/olive, so the &amp;#34;fair&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; colors in other brands are often too pink for me. It&#x27;s great when I can find something mixed with the right tone for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging: I like the pump. It&#x27;s a bit more sanitary than something you can stick your bacteria-ridden fingers in. You can also measure out fractions of a pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 years in total, and I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with my experience. The only drawback I find in this product is that it is more drying than moisturizing.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome! I love it! It is a great light-to-medium coverage that feel light-weight and gives excellent moisture. I love that is is 50 SPF instead of the typical 15 that is in most tinted moisturizers and makeups. It does have a sunscreen-like smell, but it is not very strong. My skin is relatively dry and my sense of smell is very sensitive, so to have a moisturizer that can double as makeup and not give me a migraine from the smell is very valuable to me. I also have very fair skin with many facial freckles which are not covered, but accentuated by this product in a great way. I cannot recommend it enough! I have had a good relationship with Physicians Formula and was hoping they would come out with a tinted moisturizer product that did not have the perfumes like their other tinted moisturizers - low and behold: here it is!!!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in the darkness of the color.  This is not for a light, fair skin.</li>
            <li> A little pasty looking on the skin, but otherwise it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
