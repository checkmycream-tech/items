            <li>Nice wig made out of nice materials.</li>
            <li>This is not one of those cheap wigs you get at a costume shop, this is a nice wig that looks great on.  </li>
            <li>buy it at your own risk.</li>
            <li>The hair also falls out very easily.</li>
            <li>Very amazing wig perfect and cashmere soft, and feels like real hair along with this wig</li>
            <li>Its adorable.</li>
            <li>Over all, its adorable.</li>
            <li>i really love this wig...</li>
            <li>I love the heck out of this wig</li>
            <li>so it looks more authentic</li>
            <li>But, that&#x27;s ok...</li>
            <li>/&gt;However I ordered this item along with another item from this store and was pleased on the amount it took to ship out...</li>
            <li>The color was quite interesting m</li>
            <li>love the rich brown color at the top</li>
            <li>good quality i paid little to nothing for it, am i am able to wear it alot, it is a great buy</li>
            <li>The hair looks natural, the color is great as well.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m glad it was as cheap as it</li>
            <li>It is adjustable to make sure it fits perfectly and is nice and thick.  </li>
            <li>I am only going to wear it for fun, but I was really impressed with the style and quality!</li>
            <li>but the hair does not fall out easy</li>
            <li>im sporting a bob with curled under tips instead of the straight tips, im still loving it.</li>
            <li>a few strands fell out which happens... but all around very beautiful wig</li>
            <li>yet - here I am with a wig that doesn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>gave this review 2 stars because it doesn&#x27;t fit and therefore it can&#x27;t be used.</li>
            <li>but I guess that&#x27;s what you get buying a cheap wig ;/</li>
            <li>beside it&#x27;s cheap so...</li>
            <li>It was light radish brown</li>
            <li>I was so excited to receive it</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was excited to get it.</li>
            <li>Material is good and I&#x27;ll defiantly buy again from here in the future.</li>
            <li>But, oh well.. it is still very pretty ..</li>
            <li>I love this company.. and the shipping was pretty fast..</li>
            <li>but as an african-american woman that&#x27;s ok with me as my natural hair has texture</li>
            <li>I am not cutting 28 plus inches off of my head if I&#x27;m not going to like</li>
            <li>I have to braid my hair to be able to hide it all under a wig and you could clearly see the bumps!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The assemetrical bob does not lay right.  </li>
            <li>The color was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I am ordering two more this evening in a different style just to have for my photo shoots and</li>
            <li>Got this yesterday right on time, the right color and everything, the only problem I have with it, is when I first put it on the hair started falling out, and it was a little longer, but it a beautiful wig if the hair didn&#x27;t fall out..............</li>
            <li>Also, it shipped so quickly I was happily surprised!</li>
            <li>it looks very realistic.  </li>
            <li>but I think this problem is pretty common with even good quality wigs.</li>
            <li>This wig was really inexpensive</li>
            <li>Thanks a bunch.</li>
            <li>The bangs cover my face too much</li>
            <li>, it really doesn&#x27;t deserve 1 star.</li>
            <li>Which I really did NOT want to do..</li>
            <li>And it was really affordable..</li>
            <li>but, it sheds everytime you comb it so much.</li>
            <li>One of the  main reasons ,I got this one,</li>
            <li>highly recommend this to anyone looking to purchase any wig or item from this store.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not too shiny, so it actually can be worn and look like real hair!</li>
            <li>As i opened it, I could see how glossy and ,rich dark brown it was..</li>
            <li>This worries me as far as styling and brushing it.</li>
            <li>THAT COMES FROM SO FAR.</li>
            <li>The hair is soft and manageable&lt;</li>
            <li>Because of this wig, I am getting my real hair cut next week.</li>
            <li>It does not look natural at all.  </li>
            <li>and ,it felt so soft and silky..</li>
            <li>took nearly two weeks since the products are sent from Asia.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I was supposed to get a dark brown colored wig, but when I got it was a light brown almost blonde color!!</li>
            <li>I tried this wig and though it had the potential to look very much like the picture provided in the ad, the next day my face became swollen and red and itchy and burning.  </li>
            <li>Just be gentle with it and it will last for a long time!</li>
            <li>Wears well,but can get a little hot to wear in wstm weather.</li>
            <li>It ends a little higher than my jaw line.</li>
            <li>Overall the price was decent and shipping was quicker than was expected.</li>

            <li> Overall the price was decent and shipping was quicker than was expected.</li>
            <li> The tips came curved in, so for the style pictured, you would have to flat iron it, so</li>
            <li> I have very long hair and refuse to cut it, so I buy short hair wigs often, and for the price, I took a chance on this one.</li>
            <li> it was really cheap, looked totally fake.</li>
            <li> I have waist long hair and am contemplating a cut, so I got this to see if I would like it.</li>
            <li> It came well packaged and it didn&#x27;t even take that long to get here</li>
            <li> Yes I have long hair</li>
            <li> so I have to pin them back, but I have to be careful about it</li>
            <li> The wig was so shiny and it sheds a lot of long strains of hair.  </li>
            <li> two days followed by another three to four days of dry, itchy, puffy, peeling skin.  </li>
            <li> (Any excuse to buy another wig!!)</li>
            <li> Plus it was delivered with in a few weeks and earlier than the estimated time.</li>
            <li> when you comb it hair fall off, so no much to say you know what to do.</li>
            <li> i waited for the other wig which was supposed to be coming.</li>
            <li> Oh and I forgot to mention, the expected day of arrival was four weeks out, and I got this in TWO!</li>
            <li> The colour is too dark and it was shorter than shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> like 2 and  a half weeks...</li>
            <li> It was also really tight on my head, and you could tell as well.</li>
            <li> it has a little nap to it</li>
            <li> It does shed a little bit but what head of hair doesn&#x27;t - and this is a wig!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Finally, I just HAD to end up cutting short bangs, on it!</li>
            <li> I think the quality of this wig is really quite disappointing.</li>
            <li> The part is weird and it makes me look like coconut head from that one old nickelodeon show.</li>
            <li> WHAT A WASTE OF MY TIME AND MONEY.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Problem is - it does not fit on my head.</li>
            <li> I wear it everyday.</li>
            <li> I have wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I think I was working with it, for almost an hour and a half!</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure about how durable it is for an everyday wearer like myself</li>
            <li> This wig is small around the head, hair fell out.</li>
            <li> Not what it looks like in the picture, fit is horrible, and takes FOREVER to come from China!!!!</li>
            <li> When you are cooking or doing any day to day activities, it&#x27;s not a good idea to wear it.</li>
            <li> , bc it is very hard to work with , in the style it is..</li>
            <li> This wig is very thick.  </li>
            <li> You should just go to a store and buy a wig if you really want one instead of wasting your money on this company and their crap!!</li>
            <li> ALL THE WAY FROM CHINA WHICH TURNED OUT TO BE THE WRONG D***N WIG.</li>
            <li> You can tell it&#x27;s a fake wig</li>
            <li> casual wear.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very poorly made.</li>
            <li> Terrible product, what a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Much disappointment.</li>
            <li> THE WIG THEY SENT WAS THE UGLIEST I&#x27;VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE:(( WHAT A DISAPPOINTING DAY...</li>
            <li> Quality is bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed.</li>
            <li> really disappointed it won&#x27;t go on my head.</li>
            <li> It just wouldn&#x27;t go any way, except i&#x27;n my face!  :(  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with product......</li>
            <li> and then when I did get it I was sooo disappointed!!</li>
            <li> Its horrible.</li>
            <li> To make matters worst it smelled like somebody soaked it in a bucket of BPA chemicals and sardines.  </li>

            <li> Wears well,but can get a little hot to wear in wstm weather.</li>
            <li> Got this yesterday right on time, the right color and everything, the only problem I have with it, is when I first put it on the hair started falling out, and it was a little longer, but it a beautiful wig if the hair didn&#x27;t fall out..............</li>
            <li> I have very long hair and refuse to cut it, so I buy short hair wigs often, and for the price, I took a chance on this one. Its adorable. I would have given it 5 stars, but i noticed it sheds a bit and ive only had it on for an hour. This worries me as far as styling and brushing it. Over all, its adorable. The tips came curved in, so for the style pictured, you would have to flat iron it, so im sporting a bob with curled under tips instead of the straight tips, im still loving it.</li>
            <li> VERY NICE  AND WE LOVED it !!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot shorter than the picture lets on. It ends a little higher than my jaw line. The part is weird and it makes me look like coconut head from that one old nickelodeon show. I&#x27;m so disappointed.</li>
            <li> But hair is already falling out. It took 3 weeks to get here but I&#x27;m happy with it. Recommend it!</li>
            <li> the wig i got is way longer and doesn&#x27;t look anything like the picture and the color is way lighter</li>
            <li> I WENT THROUGH ALL THE PATIENCE OF HAVING THIS WIG SENT TO ME ALL THE WAY FROM CHINA WHICH TURNED OUT TO BE THE WRONG D***N WIG. WHAT A WASTE OF MY TIME AND MONEY. I WILL NOT BE ORDERING ANYTHING ELSE THAT COMES FROM SO FAR. THE WIG THEY SENT WAS THE UGLIEST I&#x27;VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE:(( WHAT A DISAPPOINTING DAY...</li>
            <li> This wig was really inexpensive so I thought what the heck.  I love it! it looks very realistic.  I am only going to wear it for fun, but I was really impressed with the style and quality!</li>
            <li> i really love this wig... i just got it today along with 2 others but i have been wearing this one since i got it... has to be my favorite... good quality... a few strands fell out which happens... but all around very beautiful wig</li>
            <li> This wig is small around the head, hair fell out. The style was great. The color was exactly what I wanted. Overall the price was decent and shipping was quicker than was expected.</li>
            <li> It is nothing as it is described in the picture or as it is stated!! I was so excited to receive it and then when I did get it I was sooo disappointed!! The wig was shorter than in the picture, looked nothing like the picture and I was supposed to get a dark brown colored wig, but when I got it was a light brown almost blonde color!! NOT EVEN CLOSE TO WHAT I ORDERED!!! I will NEVER order from this company again and neither should you. You should just go to a store and buy a wig if you really want one instead of wasting your money on this company and their crap!!</li>
            <li> I cannot speak for everyone of course and others may have different experiences.  I tried this wig and though it had the potential to look very much like the picture provided in the ad, the next day my face became swollen and red and itchy and burning.  This spread to the back of my neck and my ears and lasted approx. two days followed by another three to four days of dry, itchy, puffy, peeling skin.  I don&#x27;t believe it was the material itself as I have worn numerous synthetic wigs. Perhaps there was some chemical or something on the wig from the factory or shipping.  Again, others may not have this issue but it should be considered.</li>
            <li> I love the heck out of this wig it is the same style as on the pic. It looks great brush it well so that the lose hair combs out. put a lil oil sheen and your on your way.</li>
            <li> It sheds.  Its think.  Its Low quality.  Its horrible.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so versatile and perfect for hand tossing to make it your own. The hair is soft and manageable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the rich brown color at the top it has a little nap to it but as an african-american woman that&#x27;s ok with me as my natural hair has texture so it looks more authentic I just got it today so I&#x27;m not sure about how durable it is for an everyday wearer like myself I hope it can stand the test of time</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 wigs and only received 1... it was really cheap, looked totally fake. i waited for the other wig which was supposed to be coming. never came and they charged my account.</li>
            <li> Terrible product, what a waste of money. Item was not the color I ordered</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted. Plus it was delivered with in a few weeks and earlier than the estimated time.</li>
            <li> I have waist long hair and am contemplating a cut, so I got this to see if I would like it. After all - once you cut your hair - it&#x27;s done! I am not cutting 28 plus inches off of my head if I&#x27;m not going to like the style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was excited to get it. It came well packaged and it didn&#x27;t even take that long to get here even though it cam from Japan...maybe 10 days or so. Definitely WAY before it was expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problem is - it does not fit on my head. Yes I have long hair but when I put it in the stocking I look bald so there should be no problem getting it on . yet - here I am with a wig that doesn&#x27;t fit. It&#x27;s not like I have a block head or  a bubble head!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wig itself is very nice. The hair looks natural, the color is great as well. It does shed a little bit but what head of hair doesn&#x27;t - and this is a wig!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really disappointed it won&#x27;t go on my head. But I&#x27;m glad it was as cheap as it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this review 2 stars because it doesn&#x27;t fit and therefore it can&#x27;t be used.</li>
            <li> Nice wig made out of nice materials. This is not one of those cheap wigs you get at a costume shop, this is a nice wig that looks great on.  It is adjustable to make sure it fits perfectly and is nice and thick.  A great value for the price.  Also, it shipped so quickly I was happily surprised!</li>
            <li> Very beautiful. I wear it everyday. I will be ordering again. Great price and quality. Thanks a bunch. Kiddos to the persons that made it.</li>
            <li> I got this for s***s and giggles. And the quality is great! Granted that this was my second wig, and I have a s***** one to compare it to, but the hair does not fall out easy, it&#x27;s not too shiny, so it actually can be worn and look like real hair! Because of this wig, I am getting my real hair cut next week. I recommend this brand to everyone!    Oh and I forgot to mention, the expected day of arrival was four weeks out, and I got this in TWO! From Asia!!!! Great service.</li>
            <li> You can tell it&#x27;s a fake wig and I never wear it..but I guess that&#x27;s what you get buying a cheap wig ;/</li>
            <li> when you comb it hair fall off, so no much to say you know what to do. buy it at your own risk. beside it&#x27;s cheap so...</li>
            <li> It was light radish brown</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very cute bob. I have no problems with this wig except for the fact that if you pull a bit some hair will fall out but I think this problem is pretty common with even good quality wigs. Just be gentle with it and it will last for a long time!</li>
            <li> I received it and it was shedding everywhere! The colour is too dark and it was shorter than shown in the picture. It was also really tight on my head, and you could tell as well. I have to braid my hair to be able to hide it all under a wig and you could clearly see the bumps!&lt;br /&gt;I am not at all impressed with this wig, however. It was received 2 days before the estimated date, which was great.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was great, but the wig was not.</li>
            <li> Not what it looks like in the picture, fit is horrible, and takes FOREVER to come from China!!!! I was very disappointed with product......</li>
            <li> This was not what I order and I couldn&#x27;t even return it back.</li>
            <li> The bangs cover my face too much so I have to pin them back, but I have to be careful about it or the tracks will show.</li>
            <li> The wig was so shiny and it sheds a lot of long strains of hair.  You get what you pay for keeps coming to mind.  I would only suggest ordering this wig if you need it for a costume.  It does not look natural at all.  I gave it 1 star because I had to so that I could write the review, it really doesn&#x27;t deserve 1 star. I have wasted my money.</li>
            <li> This wig does. Not look like the picture. Very poorly made. Much disappointment. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Quality is bad.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s looks a tad shorter than I wanted it but it&#x27;s actually perfect. Material is good and I&#x27;ll defiantly buy again from here in the future.</li>
            <li> I received this beautiful wig , along with 2 others ,I had ordered , from Taobaopit. As i opened it, I could see how glossy and ,rich dark brown it was.. and ,it felt so soft and silky.. So, I went to my  bathroom mirror, and put it on.. Well, I tried EVERY way i could, to style this wig.. so it wouldn&#x27;t fall in my face! I think I was working with it, for almost an hour and a half! It just wouldn&#x27;t go any way, except i&#x27;n my face!  :(  Finally, I just HAD to end up cutting short bangs, on it! Which I really did NOT want to do.. bc I already have another wig ,this color, with short blunt bangs, and even the same length. One of the  main reasons ,I got this one,was bc it was all one length But, oh well.. it is still very pretty .. Now, I just need to search for another all one length one... (Any excuse to buy another wig!!) lol lol  I love this company.. and the shipping was pretty fast.. like 2 and  a half weeks... And it was really affordable.. I got it for $5.99.. and now, its gone up to $7.99! Just in the last week!! I don&#x27;t think they should have raised the price, bc it is very hard to work with , in the style it is.. But, that&#x27;s ok...</li>
            <li> I think the quality of this wig is really quite disappointing. It arrived as seen in images but, it sheds everytime you comb it so much. The hair also falls out very easily. When you are cooking or doing any day to day activities, it&#x27;s not a good idea to wear it.</li>
            <li> Very amazing wig perfect and cashmere soft, and feels like real hair along with this wig I ordered a second one. Happy and satisfied I am ordering two more this evening in a different style just to have for my photo shoots and casual wear.&lt;br /&gt;However I ordered this item along with another item from this store and was pleased on the amount it took to ship out...two weeks ago i ordered and got it shipped to me on friday took nearly two weeks since the products are sent from Asia.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this to anyone looking to purchase any wig or item from this store.</li>
            <li> This is horrendous and I wish I could hurl it back the same way the mailman hurled it through my mailbox.  To make matters worst it smelled like somebody soaked it in a bucket of BPA chemicals and sardines.  The wig in the picture doesn&#x27;t have short bangs across the forehead the wig I received does.  I look like one of the Beatles and smell like a Barbie that got finished eating a fish sandwich.</li>
            <li> This wig is very thick.  The assemetrical bob does not lay right.  Quality is good for the price. The color was quite interesting m</li>
            <li> good quality i paid little to nothing for it, am i am able to wear it alot, it is a great buy</li>
