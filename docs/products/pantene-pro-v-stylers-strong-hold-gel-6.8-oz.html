            <li> It reminds me of their gel for curly hair before they changed the formulation and made me search for something new.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have a hard time finding it in the store(s).</li>
            <li> My curls stay shiny and soft all day.</li>
            <li> I normally use Paul Mitchell products to tame my rather independent hair.</li>
            <li> It holds my curl all day long</li>
            <li> I let it air dry and scrunch out any crunchy areas.</li>
            <li> It leaves a white layer of frost on dark/black hair once it&#x27;s dried.</li>
            <li> used it on my son today, it doesn&#x27;t get stiff and it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue, will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it smells like the Pantene shampoo...</li>
            <li> I hate the heavy duty gel you find in stores, this is the only one that holds but is still light and wont leave your hair crusty.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh my curls down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a very strong hold like to label says and doesn&#x27;t stay in my hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few years and now I cannot find it in any of the stores I searched.  </li>
            <li> however I like without the gel being too stiff.</li>
            <li> This product controls my hair without making it crunchy or stiff.</li>
            <li> my hair isn&#x27;t utterly dried out or hard to brush through afterward.  </li>
            <li> I was used to hair sprays but after this no more hair sprays ...holds medium ...great for me.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this because it doesn&#x27;t have that sticky icky feel.</li>
            <li> not good will not buy again no hold</li>
            <li> so ill see how that one works.</li>
            <li> its so expensive in the store</li>

            <li> I love this product and have a hard time finding it in the store(s).</li>
            <li> Apparently this works wonders for the latest teen hairstyles.  My son never leaves the house without this, so I have it now on save and subscribe.</li>
            <li> Great product and smells nice too!</li>
            <li> No flakes and does the job!</li>
            <li> It made my hair feel sticky, wouldn&#x27;t buy again</li>

            <li> Love this stuff. A bit pricey but does the job!!!</li>
            <li> Good one, stays very long,looks natural..</li>
            <li> I got this to try to save money from the salon brand I was using and it didn&#x27;t meet my expectations. It&#x27;s not a very strong hold like to label says and doesn&#x27;t stay in my hair. They make a stronger version and I&#x27;ve ordered it, so ill see how that one works.</li>
            <li> Sometimes i spike my hair and this holds up very well without drying it out too much and  still allows it to be bendable</li>
            <li> I was used to hair sprays but after this no more hair sprays ...holds medium ...great for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few years and now I cannot find it in any of the stores I searched.  I was thrilled to find it on Amazon and I would like to order more.</li>
            <li> This gel holds my hair in place without affecting my scalp, or creating dandruff. I can style my hair however I like without the gel being too stiff.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and the #2 is not very strong should buy #4 as it works much, much better.</li>

            <li> This worked very well for me ! It was easy to use,and I love the scent ! I don&#x27;t often use gel but I had a nice experience with this !</li>
            <li> I hate the heavy duty gel you find in stores, this is the only one that holds but is still light and wont leave your hair crusty. I keep my hair short so without gel it looks frizzy. This product solves that and my wife likes my hair better too.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this because it doesn&#x27;t have that sticky icky feel.</li>
