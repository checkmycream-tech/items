            <li>/&gt;It came very quickly, and it was undamaged, even though the outer box was</li>
            <li>Together these ingredients work to treat fine lines and wrinkles as well as moisturize and protect your skin.</li>

            <li>It has a pleasant fragrance and is not real heavy.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure that I wanted to spend this much money on a moisturizer, until I tried moisture rich!</li>

            <li>The fine lines are slowly but surely fading and the fact that I only need to use the smallest amount to hydrate is wonderful!</li>
            <li>seller is trying to ship me a new one and on top of this matter.</li>
            <li>This one goes on really easy and works fast too.</li>
            <li>After a few weeks of using this product my fine lines are fading and I am receiving complements from everyone about how good I look.</li>
            <li>You can feel your skin soak it up, it never just sits there which assures me my skin is receiving all it&#x27;s powerful ingredients.</li>
            <li>My face is so soft and more hydrated.</li>
            <li>now i haven&#x27;t had any acne breakouts, and it&#x27;s actually reduced the size of my pores and gives me a nice glow.</li>
            <li>I figured it was worth a try.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I am in my late 40&#x27;s and always interested in trying out new face creams as I am in panic mode as I creep upon 50, so when I was offered this NUJU Anti Aging Moisturizer during a promotion for the purpose of testing and my honest opinion I was happy to test it</li>
            <li>I will be ordered their other products to try since I have had such a wonderful experience with this moisturizer!</li>
            <li>I purchased  the eye gel, the dark spot corrector cream in the large bottle and this one after I read all the great reviews.  </li>
            <li>Noticed difference in my pores &amp; skin right away.</li>
            <li>Would run right off my hand.  </li>
            <li>The moisturizer is very rich so a recommend only using the smallest amount to achieve full coverage.</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin and love this product!</li>
            <li>I would not recommend ANYONE with sensitive skin, rosacea or allergies to try this -- and the smell is rather strong and perfume-like.</li>
            <li>Not only has this moisturizer provided my skin with the right oil-free hydration, it has added a more plump youthful elasticity to my skin.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time this morning--</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t give it a higher score .</li>
            <li>Inside this box is a very fancy bottle!</li>
            <li>I can stop having to keep trying different brands to get results &amp; not too many chemical ingredients</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel so soft, glides on smoothly with no oily residue</li>
            <li>It has a cooling and refreshing effect that is quite addictive.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve also definitely noticed that my skin looks better and firmer when I use this twice a day.</li>
            <li>To have only used one week, I swear my skin seems more  hydrated and firmer.</li>
            <li>and I really like it!</li>
            <li>My thirsty skin drinks it right up, and I am ready to apply my makeup in no time.  </li>
            <li>However, I have noticed that is seem so get rid of the very soft lines on my forehead, underneath my lips and around my smile.</li>
            <li>Anti Aging Skin Care To Diminish Fine Lines &amp; Wrinkles, Daily Moisturizer By NuJu Skincare!</li>
            <li>I see changes in my skin texture and my fine lines are starting to fade.</li>
            <li>My fine lines have faded, my skin is hydrated, and I have such a youthful glow I am always getting complemented on it.</li>
            <li>After a few days of use, I have already began to see my fine lines filled in and crows feet reduced.</li>
            <li>My face has been a bit splotchy lately, and I&#x27;ve noticed I have more fine lines</li>
            <li>The product absorbs really well into my skin and does not cause me to breakout.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it both at night &amp; daytime &amp; it&#x27;s a great thin but hydrating consistency for summer use.</li>
            <li>so at age 76 I don&#x27;t expect my skin to look like I&#x27;m 16, but as I touch it feels very soft--but not greasy.</li>
            <li>It feels very hydrating on the skin and it seem so moisturize really well.</li>
            <li>Really like this combined with their eye treatment.</li>
            <li>but because i had so much i used it all over</li>
            <li>Nothing worked for me even if I&#x27;m always very thorough in cleansing and prepping my face for my skincare routine.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I feel my face is smooth, especially in the morning when I wake up.</li>
            <li>and I really like that.</li>
            <li>It feels very silky when applying to skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but so far has been worth it.</li>
            <li>I am chasing the invasive fountain of youth and I do believe this is a much needed elixir for my anti-aging goal.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and absorbs instantly.</li>
            <li>A bit heavy to be called a moisturizer, but may be an effective wrinkle reducer</li>
            <li>The texture is fluffy and the aroma is nice.</li>
            <li>I have only been using the Nuju moisturizer for about two weeks now and have noticed less fine lines, so I am excited to see what a full month of use will do.</li>
            <li>Even better, it does not make my skin greasy and that normally happens within the first hour with other moisturizers.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin and was searching for a new cream that wouldn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
            <li>moisturized my dry skin, made it glowing &amp; radiant &amp; definitely made it more supple/firmer!</li>
            <li>Which surprised me, at first I thought this Moisturizer wasn&#x27;t going to work.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many different anti-aging creams at various price points, and this cream by Nuju is an absolute stand-out.</li>
            <li>My light fine lines are slowly fading and that is an added bonus for me since my priority was the hydration.</li>
            <li>So many moisturizers make my oily skin greasy half way through the day or an hour after applying.</li>
            <li>I have never had such smooth and soft skin.</li>
            <li>I now feel confident enough to go &amp;#34;bare-faced&amp;#34; in public.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend and believe me-</li>
            <li>I have used  high end products (La Mer, Pevonia, Intraceuticals, spa treatments, etc..)</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The product is without a doubt made with high quality ingredients.</li>
            <li>I have not seen this type of glow since I was in High School…..</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this moisturizer based on all the reviews and the list of ingredients.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very comforting for my sensitive / oily combination skin.</li>
            <li>comes with a pump for dispensing which I love, because I tend to have far less</li>
            <li>When I took my first pump of product from the container I could instantly tell that this is a high quality product.</li>
            <li>Definitely my new go to moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This Moisturizer is beige but when you apply the Moisturizer it&#x27;s clear and you can&#x27;t even see it!</li>
            <li>Because most moisturizers I have used in the past didn&#x27;t work and others have burnt my face and irritate it</li>
            <li>Some fine lines have diminished and are less noticeable.</li>
            <li>Since using this moisturizer my skin looks plump and young!</li>
            <li>I FEEL YOUNG AGAIN!</li>
            <li>PLEASE disclose your complete ingredients!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed some fine lines are less visible after a month of continuous use.</li>
            <li>The formulation is rich which allows you to only use a small amount while still achieving full coverage.</li>
            <li>I never heard of NutriLayer before, but it is a newly discovered natural extract that helps to retain skins moisture.</li>
            <li>As far as fine lines, I have noticed the appearance of them less since using this product.</li>
            <li>I have only been using a few weeks, but I can already see my skin looking better and wrinkles becoming less visible.</li>
            <li>My skin is extremely hydrated and the fine lines are barely there.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and so far no irritation at all from this Moisturizer !</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s incredibly lightweight and very thin, but you don&#x27;t need to squeeze out a lot because just a pea sized amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I made the mistake of applying too much the first time around because I am so used to other brands where you need a lot to feel hydrated.</li>
            <li>This product is worth every single penny!</li>
            <li>First, let me start by saying that I absolutely love the product packaging because it looks for high end, expensive, and professional.</li>
            <li>The labeling is clear and informative.</li>
            <li>I have highly sensitive skin with rosacea, and green tea is an important ingredient for fighting it.  </li>
            <li>completely destroyed.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>and I look and feel years young .</li>
            <li>It is not heavy or overly creamy.</li>
            <li>I’m young, as in my early twenties</li>
            <li>This moisturizer also has not caused my sensitive skin to break out.</li>
            <li>Happily surprised by how well this cream moisturizer absorbs into my skin.</li>
            <li>but it was much thinner the 2nd time I ordered.  </li>
            <li>it hasn&#x27;t really helped the lines around my mouth, but I&#x27;ve only been using it for two days.</li>
            <li>After only a few days, I rate it OK.</li>
            <li>I do not feel too dry later on in the day and the light wrinkles around my mouth do seem to be a bit smoother after only using it a week.</li>
            <li>The moisturizer has a very high quality feel and the bottle has lasted me a shockingly long time.</li>
            <li>we won’t talk about how long ago that was haha.</li>
            <li>have not used NuJu long enough to see real results, but so far I can say that my skin feels soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>The texture of my face has completely changed ever since I added this to my daily routine.</li>
            <li>I gave only two stars because of the lack of complete information.  </li>
            <li>I only use a little of the product at a time to really control the placement and hydration, normally focusing on my drier areas.</li>
            <li>I am Asian (Fiipino, Spanish and a little bit of Chinese) and have normal ( in the colder months) and combination skin ( during hot summer months).</li>
            <li>So far have not noticed any results, only been only two weeks.</li>
            <li>Not sure if I&#x27;ll order again since the 2nd bottle doesn&#x27;t seem to be the same rich consistency.</li>
            <li>I have actually saved money with this product because I don&#x27;t have to use as much, compared to my other moisturizers.</li>
            <li>You only need a little dab to cover the whole face.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have noticed some fine lines fading and a more plump youthful glow.</li>
            <li> The exterior box, like the application container itself, is attractive and gives it an extremely professional presentation.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It came very quickly, and it was undamaged, even though the outer box was</li>
            <li> Together these ingredients work to treat fine lines and wrinkles as well as moisturize and protect your skin.</li>
            <li> I hope to experience a change in my fine lines with continued use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My fine lines around my mouth and in between my eyes are fading too.</li>
            <li> According to these compliments I have a glow, my fine lines are gone, and my skin has a youthful appearance.</li>
            <li> My fine lines are beginning to fade noticeably.</li>
            <li> but the product is for reducing fine lines and appearance of wrinkles.</li>

            <li> It has a pleasant fragrance and is not real heavy.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure that I wanted to spend this much money on a moisturizer, until I tried moisture rich!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting older, like ya do, and it seems with every year, I see more and more wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this purchase and plan on trying more of their products in the future.</li>

            <li> It moisturizes deeply without leaving a greasy feel and has a nice light citrus scent without being overly greasy.</li>
            <li> so my aging is mild.</li>
            <li> The fine lines are slowly but surely fading and the fact that I only need to use the smallest amount to hydrate is wonderful!</li>
            <li> seller is trying to ship me a new one and on top of this matter.</li>
            <li> This one goes on really easy and works fast too.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of using this product my fine lines are fading and I am receiving complements from everyone about how good I look.</li>
            <li> You can feel your skin soak it up, it never just sits there which assures me my skin is receiving all it&#x27;s powerful ingredients.</li>
            <li> My face is so soft and more hydrated.</li>
            <li> now i haven&#x27;t had any acne breakouts, and it&#x27;s actually reduced the size of my pores and gives me a nice glow.</li>
            <li> I figured it was worth a try.</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> It is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I am in my late 40&#x27;s and always interested in trying out new face creams as I am in panic mode as I creep upon 50, so when I was offered this NUJU Anti Aging Moisturizer during a promotion for the purpose of testing and my honest opinion I was happy to test it</li>
            <li> I will be ordered their other products to try since I have had such a wonderful experience with this moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I purchased  the eye gel, the dark spot corrector cream in the large bottle and this one after I read all the great reviews.  </li>
            <li> Noticed difference in my pores &amp; skin right away.</li>
            <li> Would run right off my hand.  </li>
            <li> The moisturizer is very rich so a recommend only using the smallest amount to achieve full coverage.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and love this product!</li>
            <li> I would not recommend ANYONE with sensitive skin, rosacea or allergies to try this -- and the smell is rather strong and perfume-like.</li>
            <li> Not only has this moisturizer provided my skin with the right oil-free hydration, it has added a more plump youthful elasticity to my skin.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time this morning--</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t give it a higher score .</li>
            <li> Inside this box is a very fancy bottle!</li>
            <li> I can stop having to keep trying different brands to get results &amp; not too many chemical ingredients</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel so soft, glides on smoothly with no oily residue</li>
            <li> It has a cooling and refreshing effect that is quite addictive.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve also definitely noticed that my skin looks better and firmer when I use this twice a day.</li>
            <li> To have only used one week, I swear my skin seems more  hydrated and firmer.</li>
            <li> and I really like it!</li>
            <li> My thirsty skin drinks it right up, and I am ready to apply my makeup in no time.  </li>
            <li> However, I have noticed that is seem so get rid of the very soft lines on my forehead, underneath my lips and around my smile.</li>
            <li> Anti Aging Skin Care To Diminish Fine Lines &amp; Wrinkles, Daily Moisturizer By NuJu Skincare!</li>
            <li> I see changes in my skin texture and my fine lines are starting to fade.</li>
            <li> My fine lines have faded, my skin is hydrated, and I have such a youthful glow I am always getting complemented on it.</li>
            <li> After a few days of use, I have already began to see my fine lines filled in and crows feet reduced.</li>
            <li> My face has been a bit splotchy lately, and I&#x27;ve noticed I have more fine lines</li>
            <li> The product absorbs really well into my skin and does not cause me to breakout.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it both at night &amp; daytime &amp; it&#x27;s a great thin but hydrating consistency for summer use.</li>
            <li> so at age 76 I don&#x27;t expect my skin to look like I&#x27;m 16, but as I touch it feels very soft--but not greasy.</li>
            <li> It feels very hydrating on the skin and it seem so moisturize really well.</li>
            <li> Really like this combined with their eye treatment.</li>
            <li> but because i had so much i used it all over</li>
            <li> Nothing worked for me even if I&#x27;m always very thorough in cleansing and prepping my face for my skincare routine.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I feel my face is smooth, especially in the morning when I wake up.</li>
            <li> and I really like that.</li>
            <li> It feels very silky when applying to skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but so far has been worth it.</li>
            <li> I am chasing the invasive fountain of youth and I do believe this is a much needed elixir for my anti-aging goal.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and absorbs instantly.</li>
            <li> A bit heavy to be called a moisturizer, but may be an effective wrinkle reducer</li>
            <li> The texture is fluffy and the aroma is nice.</li>
            <li> I have only been using the Nuju moisturizer for about two weeks now and have noticed less fine lines, so I am excited to see what a full month of use will do.</li>
            <li> Even better, it does not make my skin greasy and that normally happens within the first hour with other moisturizers.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin and was searching for a new cream that wouldn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
            <li> moisturized my dry skin, made it glowing &amp; radiant &amp; definitely made it more supple/firmer!</li>
            <li> Which surprised me, at first I thought this Moisturizer wasn&#x27;t going to work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different anti-aging creams at various price points, and this cream by Nuju is an absolute stand-out.</li>
            <li> My light fine lines are slowly fading and that is an added bonus for me since my priority was the hydration.</li>
            <li> So many moisturizers make my oily skin greasy half way through the day or an hour after applying.</li>
            <li> I have never had such smooth and soft skin.</li>
            <li> I now feel confident enough to go &amp;#34;bare-faced&amp;#34; in public.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend and believe me-</li>
            <li> I have used  high end products (La Mer, Pevonia, Intraceuticals, spa treatments, etc..)</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The product is without a doubt made with high quality ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have not seen this type of glow since I was in High School…..</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this moisturizer based on all the reviews and the list of ingredients.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very comforting for my sensitive / oily combination skin.</li>
            <li> comes with a pump for dispensing which I love, because I tend to have far less</li>
            <li> When I took my first pump of product from the container I could instantly tell that this is a high quality product.</li>
            <li> Definitely my new go to moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This Moisturizer is beige but when you apply the Moisturizer it&#x27;s clear and you can&#x27;t even see it!</li>
            <li> Because most moisturizers I have used in the past didn&#x27;t work and others have burnt my face and irritate it</li>
            <li> Some fine lines have diminished and are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Since using this moisturizer my skin looks plump and young!</li>
            <li> I FEEL YOUNG AGAIN!</li>
            <li> PLEASE disclose your complete ingredients!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed some fine lines are less visible after a month of continuous use.</li>
            <li> The formulation is rich which allows you to only use a small amount while still achieving full coverage.</li>
            <li> I never heard of NutriLayer before, but it is a newly discovered natural extract that helps to retain skins moisture.</li>
            <li> As far as fine lines, I have noticed the appearance of them less since using this product.</li>
            <li> I have only been using a few weeks, but I can already see my skin looking better and wrinkles becoming less visible.</li>
            <li> My skin is extremely hydrated and the fine lines are barely there.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and so far no irritation at all from this Moisturizer !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s incredibly lightweight and very thin, but you don&#x27;t need to squeeze out a lot because just a pea sized amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of applying too much the first time around because I am so used to other brands where you need a lot to feel hydrated.</li>
            <li> This product is worth every single penny!</li>
            <li> First, let me start by saying that I absolutely love the product packaging because it looks for high end, expensive, and professional.</li>
            <li> The labeling is clear and informative.</li>
            <li> I have highly sensitive skin with rosacea, and green tea is an important ingredient for fighting it.  </li>
            <li> completely destroyed.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> and I look and feel years young .</li>
            <li> It is not heavy or overly creamy.</li>
            <li> I’m young, as in my early twenties</li>
            <li> This moisturizer also has not caused my sensitive skin to break out.</li>
            <li> Happily surprised by how well this cream moisturizer absorbs into my skin.</li>
            <li> but it was much thinner the 2nd time I ordered.  </li>
            <li> it hasn&#x27;t really helped the lines around my mouth, but I&#x27;ve only been using it for two days.</li>
            <li> After only a few days, I rate it OK.</li>
            <li> I do not feel too dry later on in the day and the light wrinkles around my mouth do seem to be a bit smoother after only using it a week.</li>
            <li> The moisturizer has a very high quality feel and the bottle has lasted me a shockingly long time.</li>
            <li> we won’t talk about how long ago that was haha.</li>
            <li> have not used NuJu long enough to see real results, but so far I can say that my skin feels soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> The texture of my face has completely changed ever since I added this to my daily routine.</li>
            <li> I gave only two stars because of the lack of complete information.  </li>
            <li> I only use a little of the product at a time to really control the placement and hydration, normally focusing on my drier areas.</li>
            <li> I am Asian (Fiipino, Spanish and a little bit of Chinese) and have normal ( in the colder months) and combination skin ( during hot summer months).</li>
            <li> So far have not noticed any results, only been only two weeks.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I&#x27;ll order again since the 2nd bottle doesn&#x27;t seem to be the same rich consistency.</li>
            <li> I have actually saved money with this product because I don&#x27;t have to use as much, compared to my other moisturizers.</li>
            <li> You only need a little dab to cover the whole face.</li>
            <li> Next, this goes on clear which is a relief since some other anti aging creams I have tried don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> This combination works, is fast &amp; easy to apply &amp; much less expensive.</li>
            <li> As I became older, my skin dried out over the years.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has very little smell at all, not sure what the reviewer was smelling that said it is strong......</li>
            <li> I can only imagine what the long term use will do.</li>
            <li> It looks like it fits right in on my makeup shelf with my other high end and expensive makeup.</li>
            <li> I have not used it long enouth to give an opinion.</li>
            <li> and you have to keep rubbing them in for a long time.</li>
            <li> As a woman I am clearly not going to complain at that!</li>
            <li> It is not greasy, but moisturizes my dry skin so well.</li>
            <li> Although its expensive I bought the full sizes.</li>
            <li> The only down side to this anti aging cream</li>
            <li> This was a big letdown and a total waste of money!  </li>
            <li> It only takes a little to moisturize my face.</li>
            <li> However, because the list of ingredients shown is about half of what this actually contains (including perfume as fragrance, and other preservatives), and because even the photographs chosen do not allow you to see the ingredients, it began to sting and itch the minute I put it on.  </li>
            <li> NuJu Anti Aging Moisturizer Cream contains NutriLayer, Duo-peptides, green tea and white tea extracts.</li>
            <li> To some this may seem a bit expensive, but it is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> It arrived empty</li>
            <li> No more dry spots and my pores are smaller.</li>
            <li> It hydrates extremely well</li>
            <li> and I only use a small amount.</li>
            <li> I was a bit uncomfortable at first</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see the results after the bottle is empty!</li>
            <li> like I have with some other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll be looking into their other products as well.</li>
            <li> I do put very thin layer of Yeouth Hyaluronic Acid Plus on first after washing my face before applying this moisture cream.</li>
            <li> - then I realized that my forehead lines were EXTREMELY reduced!</li>
            <li> Unlike other products also, it does not feel harsh on the skin either.</li>
            <li> Less breakouts, splotches, and hydration without feeling like I rubbed oil all over my face.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer has done wonders to my dull dry skin.</li>
            <li> very small amount goes a very long way, i used 2 pumps</li>
            <li> and oh my it felt greasy for a few hours but did soak</li>
            <li> When I received this it came it in a plain box that had the Directions and Ingredients.</li>
            <li> My dry skin is terrible in the sense that I’m always flakey or oily but never just right, until I found NuJu!</li>
            <li> The packaging for this product is not very good.  </li>
            <li> that in my opinion is it&#x27;s expensive, but as long as it continues to deliver I will use it faithfully day and night, along with my sunscreen lotion during the day.</li>
            <li> The lines on my face are slowly fading and my skin looks healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What I mean by that is that it does not cause my skin to grease up or breakout.</li>
            <li> I have had a sample of this for a while, and the other night I was looking for some night time lotion and randomly grabbed it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather just use a less expensive moisturizer and hydrate my face than use this product for no visible benefit.</li>
            <li> Due to the thickness of the product, and the shape of the bottle, it is almost impossible to get the product out of the bottle when the pump does not work.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t broken out in a rash</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t see any difference.</li>
            <li> A must buy, can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I will be buying the full-sized version.</li>
            <li> but I just didn&#x27;t see any change :(</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> So many moisturizers make my oily skin greasy half way through the day or an hour after applying. This one keeps my skin hydrated all day without a greasy appearance. I only use a little of the product at a time to really control the placement and hydration, normally focusing on my drier areas. The product absorbs really well into my skin and does not cause me to breakout.</li>
            <li> I have not used it long enouth to give an opinion. So far have not noticed any results, only been only two weeks.</li>
            <li> This product works with my skin and not against it. What I mean by that is that it does not cause my skin to grease up or breakout. Instead, this product hydrates my face so well that my skin is beginning to glow. As far as fine lines, I have noticed the appearance of them less since using this product. Will order again.</li>
            <li> I received this serum as a sample, literally used it for 3 days &amp; ran out to buy the product! It changed my skin dramatically: moisturized my dry skin, made it glowing &amp; radiant &amp; definitely made it more supple/firmer! I&#x27;ve used it both at night &amp; daytime &amp; it&#x27;s a great thin but hydrating consistency for summer use. You can feel your skin soak it up, it never just sits there which assures me my skin is receiving all it&#x27;s powerful ingredients. Overall great product</li>
            <li> It arrived in perfect shape.  I used it for the first time this morning--so at age 76 I don&#x27;t expect my skin to look like I&#x27;m 16, but as I touch it feels very soft--but not greasy.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t see any difference. I was hoping it would work but I just didn&#x27;t see any change :( can&#x27;t give it a higher score . maybe it just didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> Love this!  I have only been using a few weeks, but I can already see my skin looking better and wrinkles becoming less visible.</li>
            <li> I love it I look much younger when used this</li>
            <li> I just love this NuJu Anti Aging Moisturizer Cream - w/ Nutrilayer Rapid Anti Wrinkle Correction, Best Anti Aging Cream, Anti Wrinkle Cream, Anti Aging Serum Anti Aging Skin Care To Diminish Fine Lines &amp; Wrinkles, Daily Moisturizer By NuJu Skincare! When I received this it came it in a plain box that had the Directions and Ingredients. Inside this box is a very fancy bottle! Which surprised me, at first I thought this Moisturizer wasn&#x27;t going to work. Because most moisturizers I have used in the past didn&#x27;t work and others have burnt my face and irritate it but this one has not. This Moisturizer is beige but when you apply the Moisturizer it&#x27;s clear and you can&#x27;t even see it! This Moisturizer leaves your face smooth and radiant. I have sensitive skin and so far no irritation at all from this Moisturizer ! I received this product at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased review. I recommend this NuJu Anti Aging Moisturizer Cream By NuJu Skincare 100% to anyone who wants a great quality Moisturizer!</li>
            <li> It feels very hydrating on the skin and it seem so moisturize really well. I have not noticed any difference on my skin after two weeks use. I will update my review if I notice any improvements...</li>
            <li> Feels really good, only used it a couple of times, but good results!</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Noticed difference in my pores &amp; skin right away. No breakouts either. Really like this combined with their eye treatment. My wrinkles around my lips have almost disappeared! THAT is amazing-I don&#x27;t need to go get Juviderm injected into them like I did once before. I have already re-ordered this because I don&#x27;t want to run out. Highly recommend and believe me-I have used  high end products (La Mer, Pevonia, Intraceuticals, spa treatments, etc..) &amp; this is better! Happy I can stop having to keep trying different brands to get results &amp; not too many chemical ingredients either-I watch for that. Note:  I do put very thin layer of Yeouth Hyaluronic Acid Plus on first after washing my face before applying this moisture cream. This combination works, is fast &amp; easy to apply &amp; much less expensive.</li>
            <li> NuJu Anti Aging Moisturizer Cream contains NutriLayer, Duo-peptides, green tea and white tea extracts. I never heard of NutriLayer before, but it is a newly discovered natural extract that helps to retain skins moisture. Together these ingredients work to treat fine lines and wrinkles as well as moisturize and protect your skin. To use NuJu you simply apply it, after cleansing, to your neck and face in an upward motion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not used NuJu long enough to see real results, but so far I can say that my skin feels soft and moisturized. I like how smooth and creamy NuJu is. My thirsty skin drinks it right up, and I am ready to apply my makeup in no time.  I hope to experience a change in my fine lines with continued use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free in exchange for sharing my honest and unbiased review. Opinion is entirely my own.</li>
            <li> I am in my late 40&#x27;s and always interested in trying out new face creams as I am in panic mode as I creep upon 50, so when I was offered this NUJU Anti Aging Moisturizer during a promotion for the purpose of testing and my honest opinion I was happy to test it out.&lt;br /&gt;It came very quickly, and it was undamaged, even though the outer box was completely destroyed.&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a pump for dispensing which I love, because I tend to have far less waste.&lt;br /&gt;It has very little smell at all, not sure what the reviewer was smelling that said it is strong...... because I had to take the pump out to even smell it.&lt;br /&gt;A very small amount goes a very long way, i used 2 pumps and oh my it felt greasy for a few hours but did soak in.&lt;br /&gt;My results were almost instant. I wish I had taken a picture because I normally only use products on one side of my face but because i had so much i used it all over and I look and feel years young . This product is worth every single penny!</li>
            <li> After only a few days, I rate it OK. A bit heavy to be called a moisturizer, but may be an effective wrinkle reducer</li>
            <li> My face is softer and more glowy. Definitely my new go to moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This is the third product I got from NuJu.  I purchased  the eye gel, the dark spot corrector cream in the large bottle and this one after I read all the great reviews.  I was so disappointed.  Nothing worked for me even if I&#x27;m always very thorough in cleansing and prepping my face for my skincare routine. I am Asian (Fiipino, Spanish and a little bit of Chinese) and have normal ( in the colder months) and combination skin ( during hot summer months). This was a big letdown and a total waste of money!  This is just a warning that the products don&#x27;t work well on everyone.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer! I have very dry skin and love this product!</li>
            <li> Feels great. Lightweight. Wish there was vitamin e and SPF but otherwise it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting older, like ya do, and it seems with every year, I see more and more wrinkles. I am not too proud to admit to being a vain guy and being vain, I like to look for products to aid in my quest to retain my youthful appearance. When this item came up as part of a promotion, I wanted to try it. I ended up receiving it in exchange for an honest critique of the product and although I&#x27;ve been inclined to believe that the anti-aging creams were scams, I happy to say that my tune has changed. I am very happy with this product. The exterior box, like the application container itself, is attractive and gives it an extremely professional presentation. The labeling is clear and informative. The cream is not oily in the slightest. It&#x27;s smooth and my family tells me it smells very nice (as I have no sense of smell). More impressively, I began to see results right away. Unlike other products also, it does not feel harsh on the skin either. It&#x27;s pleasant and moisturizing. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel so soft, glides on smoothly with no oily residue</li>
            <li> This is the best face moisturizer I have came across. It hydrates your skin, without making it feel greasy and the cream is very light weight. You only need a little dab to cover the whole face. The moisturizer itself has a very pleasant scent to it, can&#x27;t put my finger on it. Anyone else care to chip in on that the scent is? Aside from the hydration I&#x27;ve noticed my skin more plump with a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> The cream works great. My face is so soft and more hydrated. No more dry spots and my pores are smaller. I&#x27;ve noticed that some of the lines around my t-lines have faded significantly. This is just the best cram I have ever used, and that is saying a lot! Just try this and you will love it.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is great! To some this may seem a bit expensive, but it is well worth the price. It leaves my skin feeling smooth and moisturized. It&#x27;s incredibly lightweight and very thin, but you don&#x27;t need to squeeze out a lot because just a pea sized amount goes a long way. it&#x27;s very comforting for my sensitive / oily combination skin. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now i haven&#x27;t had any acne breakouts, and it&#x27;s actually reduced the size of my pores and gives me a nice glow. Some fine lines have diminished and are less noticeable. A must buy, can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> I am seeing results after only a week. It feels good, is non-irritating and works on my neck as well. I&#x27;ve used it for several weeks now and am happy with the results. It absorbs quickly and goes on feeling light. My skin feels smooth and supple. I&#x27;ve used many different anti-aging creams at various price points, and this cream by Nuju is an absolute stand-out. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure that I wanted to spend this much money on a moisturizer, until I tried moisture rich! I really enjoy this product. I have never had such smooth and soft skin. The texture of my face has completely changed ever since I added this to my daily routine. Spend the money here. I have actually saved money with this product because I don&#x27;t have to use as much, compared to my other moisturizers.</li>
            <li> I have only been using the Nuju moisturizer for about two weeks now and have noticed less fine lines, so I am excited to see what a full month of use will do. The texture is fluffy and the aroma is nice. I am very pleased with this purchase and plan on trying more of their products in the future.</li>
            <li> Since using this moisturizer my skin looks plump and young! As I became older, my skin dried out over the years. This moisturizer has allowed my skin to regain it’s YOUTHFUL GLOW! I am amazed at how well this moisturizer works and will be re-ordering!</li>
            <li> I have this product for more than a week now, 2 times a day. I like it. I feel my face is smooth, especially in the morning when I wake up. It is not greasy and seems to absorb into your skin quickly. It has a pleasant fragrance and is not real heavy. I do not feel too dry later on in the day and the light wrinkles around my mouth do seem to be a bit smoother after only using it a week. It gives my skin a wonderful smooth feel and I really like that. It is not heavy or overly creamy. Overall great.</li>
            <li> I’m young, as in my early twenties so I did not buy this with the purpose of being an anti-aging lifesaver. However, I have noticed that is seem so get rid of the very soft lines on my forehead, underneath my lips and around my smile. It hydrates extremely well and I only use a small amount. My skin has a more adolescent glow than before and when I apply my make up my skin looks flawless!</li>
            <li> Love It! It feels very silky when applying to skin. I see changes in my skin texture and my fine lines are starting to fade. This product is heavenly. It is not greasy, but moisturizes my dry skin so well. It even helps diminish lines and wrinkles around my forehead and eye area. It has a cooling and refreshing effect that is quite addictive. The only down side to this anti aging cream that in my opinion is it&#x27;s expensive, but as long as it continues to deliver I will use it faithfully day and night, along with my sunscreen lotion during the day.</li>
            <li> Some ladies I had lunch with were talking about their beauty regimen and this product seemed to stand out in the conversation. I figured it was worth a try. I have been thrilled with the results of this product. My fine lines have faded, my skin is hydrated, and I have such a youthful glow I am always getting complemented on it. Worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have been caught off guard by these results! Two weeks and my face already looks younger! I can only imagine what the long term use will do. It is simply a must have in my book.</li>
            <li> Does not remove any wrinkles after 3 weeks!</li>
            <li> My wife was using this product and suggested I try it. I was a bit uncomfortable at first but this product has plumped up my face in the good way. My skin is extremely hydrated and the fine lines are barely there. The moisturizer has a very high quality feel and the bottle has lasted me a shockingly long time. I will be ordered their other products to try since I have had such a wonderful experience with this moisturizer!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome anti aging moisturizer that works like a charm! First, let me start by saying that I absolutely love the product packaging because it looks for high end, expensive, and professional. It looks like it fits right in on my makeup shelf with my other high end and expensive makeup. I also love that the ingredients and directions are easy to read and follow. Next, this goes on clear which is a relief since some other anti aging creams I have tried don&#x27;t and you have to keep rubbing them in for a long time. This one goes on really easy and works fast too. After a few days of use, I have already began to see my fine lines filled in and crows feet reduced. I can&#x27;t wait to see the results after the bottle is empty! Overall I am very impressed and happy with my purchase. I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer leaves a greasy residue all over my face. I don&#x27;t like it at all.</li>
            <li> no ingredients listed...??? how it could be so great that you hide what is in there.</li>
            <li> My face has been a bit splotchy lately, and I&#x27;ve noticed I have more fine lines so I decided to give this a try. I haven&#x27;t broken out in a rash like I have with some other products I&#x27;ve tried. It absorbs quickly cools my skin, almost like putting cucumbers on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also definitely noticed that my skin looks better and firmer when I use this twice a day. The lines on my face are slowly fading and my skin looks healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but so far has been worth it.</li>
            <li> To have only used one week, I swear my skin seems more  hydrated and firmer.</li>
            <li> When I took my first pump of product from the container I could instantly tell that this is a high quality product. The moisturizer is very rich so a recommend only using the smallest amount to achieve full coverage. I made the mistake of applying too much the first time around because I am so used to other brands where you need a lot to feel hydrated. With Nuju a small amount will go a long way and once absorbed my skin feels amazing. Very hydrated and very smooth. After a few weeks of using this product my fine lines are fading and I am receiving complements from everyone about how good I look.</li>
            <li> Grate Will get some more when is gone make my skin radiance</li>
            <li> My dry skin is terrible in the sense that I’m always flakey or oily but never just right, until I found NuJu! This moisturizer has done wonders to my dull dry skin. I FEEL YOUNG AGAIN! Not only has this moisturizer provided my skin with the right oil-free hydration, it has added a more plump youthful elasticity to my skin. I am beyond satisfied with this purchase and Nuju will have a loyal customer in me!</li>
            <li> I waited a full month of using this product before writing my review, because it almost seemed to good to be true! After one month the difference in my skin is a total transformation. My skin is smooth and the lines on my forehead and around my t-zone are gone! I wake up in the morning and it seems as though each day my skin just keeps getting better and better...I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> With most moisturizers I always feel that it is never a win/win situation. That is not the case with this moisturizer. My skin feels silky smooth from being so hydrated but never greasy. This moisturizer also has not caused my sensitive skin to break out. I love this moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I will always make sure to have this at hand! My skin has improved dramatically since using this product. Less breakouts, splotches, and hydration without feeling like I rubbed oil all over my face. Another thing that I LOVE about this product is I can use the smallest amount and still get the coverage and moisture I need.</li>
            <li> This face moisturizer has been the most amazing find for me! I have fair, sensitive skin with freckles and my skin is so sensitive and picky about the lotions I use on it, but this moisturizer has been perfect from day one!  After 2 weeks I could not believe the difference in my skin. Although its expensive I bought the full sizes. My skin has not looked this good in years. It is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer delivers. The product is without a doubt made with high quality ingredients. The formulation is rich which allows you to only use a small amount while still achieving full coverage. I have noticed some fine lines fading and a more plump youthful glow. All in all this is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I have not seen this type of glow since I was in High School…..we won’t talk about how long ago that was haha. My fine lines around my mouth and in between my eyes are fading too. Great product and I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Since using this moisturizer I have been complimented in every way. According to these compliments I have a glow, my fine lines are gone, and my skin has a youthful appearance. As a woman I am clearly not going to complain at that! It is a good product and I plan on buying it again in the future.</li>
            <li> Excellent and smooth cream. It&#x27;s only been a month but I&#x27;m waiting patiently!!</li>
            <li> There was no product inside!  It arrived empty so I have no idea if this is the &amp;#34;anti-aging miracle&amp;#34; as advertised.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this moisturizer based on all the reviews and the list of ingredients.  I have highly sensitive skin with rosacea, and green tea is an important ingredient for fighting it.  However, because the list of ingredients shown is about half of what this actually contains (including perfume as fragrance, and other preservatives), and because even the photographs chosen do not allow you to see the ingredients, it began to sting and itch the minute I put it on.  Since it was so pricey I stuck with it for 3 days, but to no avail.  Manufacturers:  PLEASE disclose your complete ingredients!  I gave only two stars because of the lack of complete information.  I would not recommend ANYONE with sensitive skin, rosacea or allergies to try this -- and the smell is rather strong and perfume-like.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin and was searching for a new cream that wouldn&#x27;t make me break out. I love this one! It moisturizes deeply without leaving a greasy feel and has a nice light citrus scent without being overly greasy. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks now and I really like it! Would definitely recommend it and I&#x27;ll be looking into their other products as well.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer has made my skin finally feel health and nourished. I love the texture, hydration level, and the glow that I am seeing. My skin has not looked this good since I was in my 20s!!! My light fine lines are slowly fading and that is an added bonus for me since my priority was the hydration.</li>
            <li> I have just been using this cream for 3 weeks on my toughest areas...my neck and upper chest area and I can already see a significant improvement in the appearance of these areas. Pricey but worth it!! I did not receive free sample. I would recommend this product to a friend.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this. I love how well this cream absorbs into my skin as well as how hydrated my skin stays throughout the day. I am chasing the invasive fountain of youth and I do believe this is a much needed elixir for my anti-aging goal. So very glad I tried the sample!</li>
            <li> When I ordered this moisturizer I never thought it would be as great as it is! Happily surprised by how well this cream moisturizer absorbs into my skin. On top of that my skin stays hydrated for the FULL day! Even better, it does not make my skin greasy and that normally happens within the first hour with other moisturizers. I&#x27;ve also noticed some fine lines are less visible after a month of continuous use. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get the pump to work and have contacted the seller. Was excited to use it but can&#x27;t any of the cream to come out.....seller is trying to ship me a new one and on top of this matter. Very much appreciated and can&#x27;t wait to try this stuff due to all the great feedback!! Thx to the seller!</li>
            <li> Followup - I ordered twice.  LOVED it the 1st time but it was much thinner the 2nd time I ordered.  Would run right off my hand.  Not sure if I&#x27;ll order again since the 2nd bottle doesn&#x27;t seem to be the same rich consistency.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for a three weeks (in place of the pore minimizing serum) and absolutely love it. It goes on smoothly and absorbs instantly. My fine lines are beginning to fade noticeably. I now feel confident enough to go &amp;#34;bare-faced&amp;#34; in public. After I put this on, I can already feel the difference, and when I touch my face, it&#x27;s so smooth. It only takes a little to moisturize my face.</li>
            <li> The packaging for this product is not very good.  The product has a pump, but the pump did not work on the one I received.  Due to the thickness of the product, and the shape of the bottle, it is almost impossible to get the product out of the bottle when the pump does not work.  The product may work as described, but I will never know.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer has met all of my expectations that I have had since purchasing it. My skin looks and feels great! The fine lines are slowly but surely fading and the fact that I only need to use the smallest amount to hydrate is wonderful!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and feels good but the product is for reducing fine lines and appearance of wrinkles. I&#x27;m only 32 so my aging is mild. I used the entire bottle and noticed no difference. I&#x27;d rather just use a less expensive moisturizer and hydrate my face than use this product for no visible benefit.</li>
            <li> I have had a sample of this for a while, and the other night I was looking for some night time lotion and randomly grabbed it. The next morning, I looked in the mirror and I couldn&#x27;t figure out what was different - then I realized that my forehead lines were EXTREMELY reduced! I couldn&#x27;t believe that a product actually worked so well. Needless to say, I will be buying the full-sized version. One thing - it hasn&#x27;t really helped the lines around my mouth, but I&#x27;ve only been using it for two days.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!! I&#x27;ve never written a review before about a face product. But, this is so amazing that I had to give the product a shout out!! Fabulous!</li>
            <li> This product is also great, it goes on so nice, skin feels so soft and silky.</li>
