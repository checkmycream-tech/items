            <li>I didn&#x27;t bought it from Amazon though I 2.5 Oz seems to be a good value at the price offered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I read the good reviews about this cologne and decided to get it for my husband as a gift.</li>
            <li>This guy friend who I&#x27;ve known for quite a bit wears this, and I have to tell you, it smells so good.</li>

            <li>Almost overwhelming!</li>
            <li>The item arrived quickly and in excellent condition and is 100% authentic.</li>
            <li>Everyone has their own opinion.</li>
            <li>to me, I have to resist the urge of jumping on top of my friend because he just smells so darn good.</li>
            <li>Honestly i now shop for everything on here because i can&#x27;t find it any cheaper elsewhere if i know what i want.</li>
            <li>In addition, while Code is a popular cologne, Drakkar is exponentially more popular and quite overused, I might add.</li>
            <li>Great smell, worth the splurge for yourself or your guy.</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful - masculine but with a touch of sweetness.</li>
            <li>This is one of Armani&#x27;s best so far.</li>
            <li>So far the best fragance that Armani has on the market.</li>
            <li>Add to that excellent customer service good to excellent prices, and you just cannot go wrong.</li>
            <li>Very pleased especially considering the great price!!</li>
            <li>Great smell and does not wear off right away.</li>
            <li>very responsible and great deals</li>
            <li>This cologne has a very pleasant, masculine aroma.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very popular with stellar reviews, my guess with men over 55 though.  </li>
            <li>Super fast shipping and the cologne arrived perfectly, as described.</li>
            <li>It is a very good cologne, and at the price I got it for a far better deal than any department store wanted to charge me.</li>
            <li>I really really love this fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Everyone seems to love it when I wear it.  </li>
            <li>what I got was not&lt;br /&gt;an authentic bottle of Armani Code.  </li>
            <li>Nothing more to be said</li>
            <li>:)&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li>I have been in love with it since then.</li>
            <li>I just love the scent of Armani Code.</li>
            <li>It stays on all day and has a fragrance that the ladies love.</li>
            <li>Although I like Drakkar, The Code lasts longer and has a more memorable scent to it.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I must say I am 100% satisfied with the purchase I made.</li>
            <li>It smells so seductive and sexy.</li>
            <li>but I love this cologne.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments when I wear this out.</li>
            <li>definetly a revitalizing scent, i am really in love with armani code.</li>
            <li>Armani code is the best male fragance.</li>
            <li>love when it sticks to there clothes or when they borrow/steal my shirts..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a discriminating taste thing for sure</li>
            <li>love the price and the smell of the product.</li>
            <li>The cologne itself is AMAZING - great for men 20-30yrs old, a very crisp and warm scent.</li>
            <li>what else can I say, just like my first bottle, always loved the smell, and still do love the smell</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty good scent, but I prefer Ralph Lauren&#x27;s \\&quot;Romance.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>All of them have good fragrance, but personally I like \\&quot;Armani Code\\&quot; better than others as it just smells so good.  </li>
            <li>The item came in it&#x27;s original packaging (plastic too!)</li>
            <li>Very good one, the smell of it is different and put you in another world!</li>
            <li>I would feel more than comfortable buying from this person again.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with Amazon&#x27;s incredibly fast shipping!</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;honestly wearing this stuff is almost like cheating for attracting girls, its to easy...</li>
            <li>The scent is way to strong..</li>
            <li>/&gt;I seem to be drawn to the Armani products and feel this is the one that I find to be appropriate for a special evening</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m lucky to be able to notice this one after a couple hrs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn this great scent and have had numerous compliments from it!</li>
            <li>To my surprise I received a cheap copy of the fragrance CODE from Armani.  </li>
            <li>Its not cheap but its great that the seller made the shipping free as it makes it a better buy than in most department stores.</li>
            <li>But this cologne has a very clean fresh scent that seem invoke romantic tendencies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall making this a superb men&#x27;s evening fragrance, but this is simply my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After wearing it, he smelled like sweet cooking spice.</li>
            <li>I made sure to order one that was shipped AND sold by amazon which I felt would guarantee I was getting the real product</li>
            <li>I recently purchased several colognes to see which would be best recieved for my upcoming music school interviews.</li>
            <li>and if I did not they would handle the situation quickly and accurately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received this product quickly without any problems.</li>
            <li>I take special interest in the way I smell and thought this would be worth it.</li>
            <li>I remember when I first put this on I sat there and did nothing but enjoy the sent for like an hour,</li>
            <li>I did like the Curve, but while it is attractive, it does not seem sophisticated at all - more of a teenager&#x27;s cologne for casual wear.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I wanted--a smell that makes me want to snuggle up to my hubby!</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m pretty familiar with the product and</li>
            <li>Powerful and long-lasting fragrance, wear when you want to be noticed.</li>
            <li>It was fun to try</li>
            <li>probably right from China-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a real fan of Cologne, but the fragrance is really mellow and pleasant.</li>
            <li>: The fragrance is really nice and holds for a long time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad, but like any fragrance, it&#x27;s very subjective.</li>
            <li>This cologne is a sexy, fresh scent that is definitely lucious!!</li>
            <li>but this was such a great value that he bought the larger bottle.  </li>
            <li>Actually I do not use colognes much, but there are times when it is a nice addition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tested this cologne at work and have recieved plenty of positive comments from my co-workers to convince me that Armani Code is the right choice.</li>
            <li>Armani Code is one of the best colognes on the market you can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase.</li>
            <li>what the person at the cologne counter at the store I tried it at first said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got positive feedback from others whenver I wore this perfume.</li>
            <li>/&gt;almost didnt want to write a positive review so that i can keep this scent to myself..</li>
            <li>Very nice mellow scent, not too overpowering, only bad thing is wears off after about 3 hours, but it does only take a couple sprays for someone to notice it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the best colognes for the money, do not skip this if you are a cologne wearer.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>The supplier that shipped this product was fast and I had no hassles.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent fragrance, I only get compliments, expensive but definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>This is not the real cologne, it&#x27;s a knockoff from China.</li>
            <li>So he must really like it</li>
            <li>The bottle was identical but there was no serial number like the real Emporio has on the bottom.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it a 5 stars because I am sure that other ladies will agree on this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I liked the subtle smell of this one very much.</li>
            <li>The seller asked me to send the bottle back and promised a full refund.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d compare it to a Preferred Stock, but less potent.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>It is highly versatile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product and from this buyer:</li>
            <li>what I recieved wasn&#x27;t of high quality.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Light and not overpowering scent.&lt;br /&gt;The style of the scent can be described as \\&quot;Powdery\\&quot;, like if you smell baby powder (but not the actual smell of it).&lt;br /&gt;I would say the scent is a light and powdery burst at first with a crisp finish in a very subtle citrus scent (not overly strong citrus at all).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Black Code is a little more than I&#x27;d normally spend on something like this, but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>They look quite similar, so be sure to read the product description carefully.  </li>
            <li>To be fair though I hate that powdery smell on a man or a woman many people find it pleasing.</li>
            <li>After looking for it locally &amp; online, I bought it at Amazon at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>subject is obviously very subjective, since I&#x27;ve known some women that still love old spice above anything else a man can wear.</li>
            <li>recently smells exactly like this Armani Code.  </li>
            <li>Also, the word \\&quot;CODE\\&quot; was not written in pure white, it was more like a beige, which is usually a sign of copied product.  </li>
            <li>this considering that it all smells different on different people, but Black Code is a nice, mellow scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering or distracting at all.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like it because of the constant smell of cinnamon spice which reminds me of strong Big Red gum.</li>
            <li>Armani Blue with a little Otis Redding will make for a memorable night.  </li>
            <li>Surprised since this is sold by Amazon.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find that the box was never opened, still plastic wrapped, and it was even packed with bubble wrapped.  </li>
            <li>Got this cologne for my 15 year old nephew for Christmas since my sister told me he is sneaking into his father&#x27;s room to use his.  </li>
            <li>and so far there is no indication of a cheapened cologne as you sometimes find online.</li>
            <li>Though I must admit, it smells great, but I am confused because in some places it is titled Black Code and in others it is just Code.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t exactly what I expected, but I don&#x27;t mind it at all.</li>
            <li>I know because I have the real stuff from Arman (and about 30 bottles of other real colognes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this as a present to my brother for Christmas.</li>
            <li>When he opened it, it was leaking everywhere, the top was faded, and the box itself had Chinese markings on the inside lining where the glue previously held the box together (but had opened due to the leaky bottle).</li>
            <li>Seems like the scent doesn&#x27;t last as if it&#x27;s an old bottle.  </li>
            <li>It has a strong modern smell, and goes well with semi casual or formal evening wearing.</li>
            <li>When I try to  compare this one with other Perfumes available in market in  similar price ranges , it was thinking this is not a great one for the price, but at the same time this is not worst , also the other thing i had noticed</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Very satisfied with Amazon&#x27;s incredibly fast shipping!</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;honestly wearing this stuff is almost like cheating for attracting girls, its to easy...</li>
            <li> The scent is way to strong..</li>
            <li> /&gt;I seem to be drawn to the Armani products and feel this is the one that I find to be appropriate for a special evening</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m lucky to be able to notice this one after a couple hrs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this great scent and have had numerous compliments from it!</li>
            <li> To my surprise I received a cheap copy of the fragrance CODE from Armani.  </li>
            <li> Its not cheap but its great that the seller made the shipping free as it makes it a better buy than in most department stores.</li>
            <li> But this cologne has a very clean fresh scent that seem invoke romantic tendencies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall making this a superb men&#x27;s evening fragrance, but this is simply my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After wearing it, he smelled like sweet cooking spice.</li>
            <li> I made sure to order one that was shipped AND sold by amazon which I felt would guarantee I was getting the real product</li>
            <li> I recently purchased several colognes to see which would be best recieved for my upcoming music school interviews.</li>
            <li> and if I did not they would handle the situation quickly and accurately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received this product quickly without any problems.</li>
            <li> I take special interest in the way I smell and thought this would be worth it.</li>
            <li> I remember when I first put this on I sat there and did nothing but enjoy the sent for like an hour,</li>
            <li> I did like the Curve, but while it is attractive, it does not seem sophisticated at all - more of a teenager&#x27;s cologne for casual wear.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted--a smell that makes me want to snuggle up to my hubby!</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m pretty familiar with the product and</li>
            <li> Powerful and long-lasting fragrance, wear when you want to be noticed.</li>
            <li> It was fun to try</li>
            <li> probably right from China-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a real fan of Cologne, but the fragrance is really mellow and pleasant.</li>
            <li> : The fragrance is really nice and holds for a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad, but like any fragrance, it&#x27;s very subjective.</li>
            <li> This cologne is a sexy, fresh scent that is definitely lucious!!</li>
            <li> but this was such a great value that he bought the larger bottle.  </li>
            <li> Actually I do not use colognes much, but there are times when it is a nice addition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tested this cologne at work and have recieved plenty of positive comments from my co-workers to convince me that Armani Code is the right choice.</li>
            <li> Armani Code is one of the best colognes on the market you can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase.</li>
            <li> what the person at the cologne counter at the store I tried it at first said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got positive feedback from others whenver I wore this perfume.</li>
            <li> /&gt;almost didnt want to write a positive review so that i can keep this scent to myself..</li>
            <li> Very nice mellow scent, not too overpowering, only bad thing is wears off after about 3 hours, but it does only take a couple sprays for someone to notice it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the best colognes for the money, do not skip this if you are a cologne wearer.</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> The supplier that shipped this product was fast and I had no hassles.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent fragrance, I only get compliments, expensive but definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> This is not the real cologne, it&#x27;s a knockoff from China.</li>
            <li> So he must really like it</li>
            <li> The bottle was identical but there was no serial number like the real Emporio has on the bottom.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it a 5 stars because I am sure that other ladies will agree on this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I liked the subtle smell of this one very much.</li>
            <li> The seller asked me to send the bottle back and promised a full refund.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d compare it to a Preferred Stock, but less potent.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> It is highly versatile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this product and from this buyer:</li>
            <li> what I recieved wasn&#x27;t of high quality.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Light and not overpowering scent.&lt;br /&gt;The style of the scent can be described as \\&quot;Powdery\\&quot;, like if you smell baby powder (but not the actual smell of it).&lt;br /&gt;I would say the scent is a light and powdery burst at first with a crisp finish in a very subtle citrus scent (not overly strong citrus at all).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Black Code is a little more than I&#x27;d normally spend on something like this, but it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> They look quite similar, so be sure to read the product description carefully.  </li>
            <li> To be fair though I hate that powdery smell on a man or a woman many people find it pleasing.</li>
            <li> After looking for it locally &amp; online, I bought it at Amazon at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> subject is obviously very subjective, since I&#x27;ve known some women that still love old spice above anything else a man can wear.</li>
            <li> recently smells exactly like this Armani Code.  </li>
            <li> Also, the word \\&quot;CODE\\&quot; was not written in pure white, it was more like a beige, which is usually a sign of copied product.  </li>
            <li> this considering that it all smells different on different people, but Black Code is a nice, mellow scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering or distracting at all.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it because of the constant smell of cinnamon spice which reminds me of strong Big Red gum.</li>
            <li> Armani Blue with a little Otis Redding will make for a memorable night.  </li>
            <li> Surprised since this is sold by Amazon.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to find that the box was never opened, still plastic wrapped, and it was even packed with bubble wrapped.  </li>
            <li> Got this cologne for my 15 year old nephew for Christmas since my sister told me he is sneaking into his father&#x27;s room to use his.  </li>
            <li> and so far there is no indication of a cheapened cologne as you sometimes find online.</li>
            <li> Though I must admit, it smells great, but I am confused because in some places it is titled Black Code and in others it is just Code.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t exactly what I expected, but I don&#x27;t mind it at all.</li>
            <li> I know because I have the real stuff from Arman (and about 30 bottles of other real colognes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this as a present to my brother for Christmas.</li>
            <li> When he opened it, it was leaking everywhere, the top was faded, and the box itself had Chinese markings on the inside lining where the glue previously held the box together (but had opened due to the leaky bottle).</li>
            <li> Seems like the scent doesn&#x27;t last as if it&#x27;s an old bottle.  </li>
            <li> It has a strong modern smell, and goes well with semi casual or formal evening wearing.</li>
            <li> When I try to  compare this one with other Perfumes available in market in  similar price ranges , it was thinking this is not a great one for the price, but at the same time this is not worst , also the other thing i had noticed</li>
            <li> Maybe I was sent an old bottle or possibly tampered with and watered down some</li>
            <li> Also, the scent does last a long time.</li>
            <li> It is also long lasting - bonus!</li>
            <li> is if I spray this  once it  does n&#x27;t stay very long enough on your  skin touch points on hands and around neck.</li>
            <li> I then opened the box, which smelled strong and weird.  </li>
            <li> I used just a little bit and was surprised on how long it held.</li>
            <li> Will update how long the perfume holds.&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Armani for quite some time now an any other time I can use 1 squirt an last all day.</li>
            <li> I have seen other reviews which seem to indicate that Amazon has goods that are old and therefore are \\&quot;less</li>
            <li> I have NEVER gotten a thing from Amazon that did not live up to its on-line appearance.</li>
            <li> It is not strong and its odor last for a short time.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that is not that long lasting, and the smell fades quicker than I&#x27;d like for a $50 bottle of colgone.</li>
            <li> Be careful with fragrance on here.  </li>
            <li> It was everything I expected and arrived on time.  </li>
            <li> But be careful</li>
            <li> Be careful though, spraying two shots will overkill and may give you a headache.  </li>
            <li> I was always curious to know what the Armani hype was all about...</li>
            <li> The box of parfume was wet.</li>
            <li> I night on the town and certainly not to look for a woman.  </li>
            <li> It has no top, bottom or middle notes.</li>
            <li> He usually gets the smaller bottle</li>
            <li> Usually I buying perfumes for only increasing my collection.</li>
            <li> Smells extremely deluded.</li>
            <li> I have worn this fragrance my whole life and this is definitely fake-</li>
            <li> We thought maybe the smell would die down, so he went to work with it on.</li>
            <li> Thumbs down.</li>
            <li> I always keep a cabinet stocked with Armani Black Code.  </li>
            <li> This review is for Black Code, but my bottle just says Code.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this is either a knock off or a very old bottle.  </li>
            <li> It was either very old or I bought a fake.</li>
            <li> The lettering was also a dead giveaway.</li>
            <li> I got suspiscious when I unpacked because the plastic was thicker than usual.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m not impressed with overall quality.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a sexy scent at all.</li>
            <li> then wrote to the Amazon and the seller who wrote me back quickly and were very sorry about my bad luck.  </li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m complimenting Amazon with their prices that are hard to beat.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to review something like</li>
            <li> dishonest seller.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ordered this item after seeing that some individuals had received fake items or were not happy with their purchase overall.</li>
            <li> Product is identical to what I would purchase at Macy&#x27;s but less expensive through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> When i received it , it was broken.</li>
            <li> I got a refund... but lost S+H charges... DONT waste your time or money!!!!</li>
            <li> I am sorry to say this seems to be an aftermarket/duplicate version that I received.</li>
            <li> Fake cologne knock off.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not remotely impressed and</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> Eau De Toilette Spray 2.5 Ounces perfume disappointed me.</li>
            <li> It is the worst I have.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really really love this fragrance.  Unfortunately this is either a knock off or a very old bottle.  It does not smell the same as a bottle I pick up at the store.  Be careful with fragrance on here.  If it&#x27;s a cheaper than should be price, than go to the next listing.</li>
            <li> I got it for Father&#x27;s day, and my dad loved it. I&#x27;m not a real fan of Cologne, but the fragrance is really mellow and pleasant.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this item. It was everything I expected and arrived on time.  I had been looking for this specific cologne everywhere.</li>
            <li> Great smell and does not wear off right away. I remember when I first put this on I sat there and did nothing but enjoy the sent for like an hour, haha.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this great scent and have had numerous compliments from it! And I&#x27;m complimenting Amazon with their prices that are hard to beat. The supplier that shipped this product was fast and I had no hassles.</li>
            <li> I ordered this cologne for my son.  He had been using it for several years when the store he bought it from stopped handling it.  I found it on line, however, I almost made the mistake of getting CODE for women!  They look quite similar, so be sure to read the product description carefully.  This cologne is a sexy, fresh scent that is definitely lucious!!</li>
            <li> smells great and came quick!&lt;br /&gt;a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping and the cologne arrived perfectly, as described. Very pleased especially considering the great price!!</li>
            <li> I always keep a cabinet stocked with Armani Black Code.  Everyone seems to love it when I wear it.  I highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Am very pleased with Armani Code. Though I must admit, it smells great, but I am confused because in some places it is titled Black Code and in others it is just Code. This review is for Black Code, but my bottle just says Code. Did I get what I ordered? I don&#x27;t know!</li>
            <li> Excellent perfume! I liked the subtle smell of this one very much. I got positive feedback from others whenver I wore this perfume.</li>
            <li> I know what Code smells like, and what I got was not&lt;br /&gt;an authentic bottle of Armani Code.  Please beware of&lt;br /&gt;this dishonest seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is real enough, but the product is phony.</li>
            <li> To my surprise I received a cheap copy of the fragrance CODE from Armani.  I got suspiscious when I unpacked because the plastic was thicker than usual.  I then opened the box, which smelled strong and weird.  It had linked in the box.  Looking at the bottle and its cap I realized that the bottle and the cap were all scratched.  Also, the word \\&quot;CODE\\&quot; was not written in pure white, it was more like a beige, which is usually a sign of copied product.  A bit despaired, I took the bottle to a parfum shop to compare the odor with another CODE.  It was obviously different!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then wrote to the Amazon and the seller who wrote me back quickly and were very sorry about my bad luck.  The seller asked me to send the bottle back and promised a full refund.  He will works it out with his supplier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know many people are happy with their purchase (that&#x27;s why I decided to give internet a try), I guessed I was just unlucky?!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent fragrance, I only get compliments, expensive but definitely worth it. Nothing more to be said Armani Code is one of the best colognes on the market you can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted--a smell that makes me want to snuggle up to my hubby!</li>
            <li> I like this and bought this as a gift. The person loved it. Product arrived on time and in good condition.</li>
            <li> Got this after reading the reviews as a gift. One of the photos by a customer showed resealed container and stickers on the barcode. Had the same thing with the box that I got. Surprised since this is sold by Amazon. Good fragrance. Will update how long the perfume holds.&lt;br /&gt;Update: The fragrance is really nice and holds for a long time. I used just a little bit and was surprised on how long it held. Updating the rating to 5 stars</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it.  The fact that it&#x27;s a spray will hopefully ensure that it stretches longer.  Great smell, worth the splurge for yourself or your guy.</li>
            <li> Product is identical to what I would purchase at Macy&#x27;s but less expensive through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will purchase again through Amazon&#x27;s website.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve done the research, you&#x27;ll know this 2.5 oz bottle is an excellent value.  My husband loves it and I love it on him!</li>
            <li> My husband has been wearing Givenchy Pi for several years, but after smelling this in a magazine sample, we decided to give it a try.  It smells wonderful - masculine but with a touch of sweetness.</li>
            <li> I have never tried an Armani product before, but when a couple of friends at work wore this perfume, I had to buy one. I take special interest in the way I smell and thought this would be worth it. Inspite of being suggested to buy at another online store I bought it here. I am sorry to say this seems to be an aftermarket/duplicate version that I received. It has no top, bottom or middle notes. It doesn&#x27;t stay at all. I never bothered to return this. But be careful</li>
            <li> Item was just what I ordered.  This is a Christmas gift for my son. Fragrance was good and it arrived timely.</li>
            <li> I received this in my newspaper this morning. I opened it up and it smells very womanly. I could not believe it is a mens scent! It smells similar to CK One a female relative of mine wears. The Roca Wear X cologne I bought on a whim recently smells exactly like this Armani Code.  If you want something quite manly Drakkar Noir or Lacoste are still good choices.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to find that the box was never opened, still plastic wrapped, and it was even packed with bubble wrapped.  I would feel more than comfortable buying from this person again. :)&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> This is one of Armani&#x27;s best so far. I bought it as a gift for my husband and I hope he continues to buy if for himself.</li>
            <li> Powerful and long-lasting fragrance, wear when you want to be noticed. I discovered this from a roomie I had when I studied abroad in Latin America a couple of years ago. I have been in love with it since then. Can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> Incredible cologne, the smell is superb. It is one that I will not go without. Wears great for daytime. One of my favorites!</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t exactly what I expected, but I don&#x27;t mind it at all. It&#x27;s a pretty good scent, but I prefer Ralph Lauren&#x27;s \\&quot;Romance.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Armani Code By Giorgio Armani For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 2.5 Ounces perfume disappointed me. It is not strong and its odor last for a short time. It is the worst I have.</li>
            <li> I just love the scent of Armani Code. It is not overpowering, but is definitely noticeably in close proximity. I only spray once and that is usually enough. Also, the scent does last a long time.</li>
            <li> This is not the real cologne, it&#x27;s a knockoff from China. I know because I have the real stuff from Arman (and about 30 bottles of other real colognes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this as a present to my brother for Christmas. When he opened it, it was leaking everywhere, the top was faded, and the box itself had Chinese markings on the inside lining where the glue previously held the box together (but had opened due to the leaky bottle). The lettering was also a dead giveaway. It was glued on and crooked, like some kid assembled it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY from this person. Fake cologne knock off.</li>
            <li> This is my second choice for cologne.  It has a strong modern smell, and goes well with semi casual or formal evening wearing. It is highly versatile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that is not that long lasting, and the smell fades quicker than I&#x27;d like for a $50 bottle of colgone.</li>
            <li> Very nice mellow scent, not too overpowering, only bad thing is wears off after about 3 hours, but it does only take a couple sprays for someone to notice it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the best colognes for the money, do not skip this if you are a cologne wearer.</li>
            <li> Got this cologne for my 15 year old nephew for Christmas since my sister told me he is sneaking into his father&#x27;s room to use his.  So he must really like it alot.  Great price on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I bought the 3.4 ounce Emporio armani perfume for women by georgio armani. However- it smelled like rubbing alcohol when I got it. The bottle was identical but there was no serial number like the real Emporio has on the bottom. Also, the bottom of the bottle had glue sticking out from it like someone opened the bottle, refilled it with something else and glued it back shut. I have worn this fragrance my whole life and this is definitely fake- probably right from China- beware! I went to post a review about this but suddenly the product disappeared from this sellers collection of perfumes!!! I got a refund... but lost S+H charges... DONT waste your time or money!!!!</li>
            <li> My husband bought this cologne and loves it. He usually gets the smaller bottle but this was such a great value that he bought the larger bottle.  It stays on all day and has a fragrance that the ladies love. It is not overpowering at all like some colognes that knock you out.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my husband; however, for some reason the smell is different from the one I tried at the Macy&#x27;s store. It was either very old or I bought a fake. I&#x27;d never think that I could get something like that from Amazon - the only reason why I bought it was because Amazon was the supplier...</li>
            <li> I have 3 Armani perfumes namely Code, Acqua Di Gio and Attitude.  All of them have good fragrance, but personally I like \\&quot;Armani Code\\&quot; better than others as it just smells so good.  I didn&#x27;t bought it from Amazon though I 2.5 Oz seems to be a good value at the price offered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MUST MUST try this one.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased several colognes to see which would be best recieved for my upcoming music school interviews. Along with Code, I also purchased Drakkar Noir, Curve and Polo. Although I like Drakkar, The Code lasts longer and has a more memorable scent to it. In addition, while Code is a popular cologne, Drakkar is exponentially more popular and quite overused, I might add. I did like the Curve, but while it is attractive, it does not seem sophisticated at all - more of a teenager&#x27;s cologne for casual wear. I did not like the Polo at all. I&#x27;ve tested this cologne at work and have recieved plenty of positive comments from my co-workers to convince me that Armani Code is the right choice.</li>
            <li> I have been using Armani Code since it came out in 2005.  So far the best fragance that Armani has on the market.</li>
            <li> Armani Code is probably the best cologne I have used in my life.  Girls like it and guys want to wear it.  I typically only need one spray and that gets me through the day.  Be careful though, spraying two shots will overkill and may give you a headache.  I use this and Burberry London as well as Lacoste Essential just to give you an Idea of my rotation.  I prefer this to those as well but only on weekends will I wear the Burberry or Lacoste.</li>
            <li> Being a developer/software engineer, I couldn&#x27;t resist a fragrance called \\&quot;CODE\\&quot;. :)  It&#x27;s not bad, but like any fragrance, it&#x27;s very subjective. Everyone has their own opinion. It was fun to try and I like it enough to wear it on occasion.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy.</li>
            <li> This cologne has a very pleasant, masculine aroma. After looking for it locally &amp; online, I bought it at Amazon at a very reasonable price. I recommend you try it!</li>
            <li> One of the best smelling cologne that I&#x27;ve ever came across. You&#x27;ll get great comments from girls who smell this. I&#x27;ve not met a girl who didn&#x27;t like the smell of this.</li>
            <li> I read the good reviews about this cologne and decided to get it for my husband as a gift. I never smelled the scent, so I was taking a chance. After wearing it, he smelled like sweet cooking spice. We thought maybe the smell would die down, so he went to work with it on. He said that people kept asking who was wearing cinnamon scented cologne while he was there. He knew it was him, but he didn&#x27;t say anything...LOL! I don&#x27;t like it because of the constant smell of cinnamon spice which reminds me of strong Big Red gum. I kept getting queasy, so we just decided to throw it away. Maybe his body chemistry just didn&#x27;t go with it. Overall, If you like the smell of pumpkin pies on your skin, then I would suggest this. If not, do not buy this scent. And from now on when it comes to scents, I will have to sniff before buying.</li>
            <li> Seems like the scent doesn&#x27;t last as if it&#x27;s an old bottle.  I&#x27;ve been using Armani for quite some time now an any other time I can use 1 squirt an last all day. I&#x27;m lucky to be able to notice this one after a couple hrs.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item after seeing that some individuals had received fake items or were not happy with their purchase overall. I must say I am 100% satisfied with the purchase I made. The item arrived quickly and in excellent condition and is 100% authentic. I made sure to order one that was shipped AND sold by amazon which I felt would guarantee I was getting the real product and if I did not they would handle the situation quickly and accurately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In regards to the cologne itself, if you have not tried this or smelled it I will do my best to give you the description I gave to it and what the person at the cologne counter at the store I tried it at first said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Light and not overpowering scent.&lt;br /&gt;The style of the scent can be described as \\&quot;Powdery\\&quot;, like if you smell baby powder (but not the actual smell of it).&lt;br /&gt;I would say the scent is a light and powdery burst at first with a crisp finish in a very subtle citrus scent (not overly strong citrus at all).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could wear this daily or on an evening out I feel like. It is a very good cologne, and at the price I got it for a far better deal than any department store wanted to charge me.</li>
            <li> The item came in it&#x27;s original packaging (plastic too!) and so far there is no indication of a cheapened cologne as you sometimes find online. The cologne itself is AMAZING - great for men 20-30yrs old, a very crisp and warm scent. It is also long lasting - bonus! Would highly recommend this product and from this buyer: good price, beats Macy&#x27;s or even Perfumania!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best fragrances for men out there.  Its not cheap but its great that the seller made the shipping free as it makes it a better buy than in most department stores.</li>
            <li> Usually I buying perfumes for only increasing my collection. After buying this one I think I won&#x60;t buy any perfume again except it.&lt;br /&gt;Very Very good one, the smell of it is different and put you in another world!</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with Amazon&#x27;s incredibly fast shipping! I was always curious to know what the Armani hype was all about... I just bought this cologne on a whim from Amazon since it had good ratings and a great price! After wearing it to work today I am very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> This guy friend who I&#x27;ve known for quite a bit wears this, and I have to tell you, it smells so good. It smells so seductive and sexy. I&#x27;d so buy it for my boyfriend if I had one. I&#x27;m giving it a 5 stars because I am sure that other ladies will agree on this.&lt;br /&gt;As to me, I have to resist the urge of jumping on top of my friend because he just smells so darn good.</li>
            <li> When i received it , it was broken. The box of parfume was wet. I lost some amount of it.</li>
            <li> Forget about wearing anything else.  Armani Blue with a little Otis Redding will make for a memorable night.  Trust me!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product earlier but this has a different fragrance and its not upto the mark. So I&#x27;m not impressed with overall quality.</li>
            <li> When I try to  compare this one with other Perfumes available in market in  similar price ranges , it was thinking this is not a great one for the price, but at the same time this is not worst , also the other thing i had noticed is  is if I spray this  once it  does n&#x27;t stay very long enough on your  skin touch points on hands and around neck.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and its not a keeper! The scent is way to strong.. Almost overwhelming! It&#x27;s not a sexy scent at all.</li>
            <li> Smells extremely deluded. Maybe I was sent an old bottle or possibly tampered with and watered down some how...I&#x27;ve been wearing Armani Code for years now So I&#x27;m pretty familiar with the product and what I recieved wasn&#x27;t of high quality. Surprising it came from Amazon. Thumbs down.</li>
            <li> but I love this cologne. It&#x27;s hard to review something like this considering that it all smells different on different people, but Black Code is a nice, mellow scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering or distracting at all. I get so many compliments when I wear this out. I&#x27;d compare it to a Preferred Stock, but less potent. Black Code is a little more than I&#x27;d normally spend on something like this, but it&#x27;s worth it! While no cologne can guarantee that someone will tear off whatever clothes you&#x27;re wearing just by your scent, this one definitely inspires compliments from people!</li>
            <li> definetly a revitalizing scent, i am really in love with armani code. i have definetly gotten a lot of compliments from the ladies while wearing this scent</li>
            <li> I received this product quickly without any problems. Armani code is the best male fragance. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Actually I do not use colognes much, but there are times when it is a nice addition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I seem to be drawn to the Armani products and feel this is the one that I find to be appropriate for a special evening out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This subject is obviously very subjective, since I&#x27;ve known some women that still love old spice above anything else a man can wear. But this cologne has a very clean fresh scent that seem invoke romantic tendencies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall making this a superb men&#x27;s evening fragrance, but this is simply my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get a hold of tester vial if you can, or ask to try it at the mens counters or mens stores. I think you&#x27;ll agree with me on this one.</li>
            <li> get compliments all the time while wearing this.&lt;br /&gt;girls love when it sticks to there clothes or when they borrow/steal my shirts..&lt;br /&gt;honestly wearing this stuff is almost like cheating for attracting girls, its to easy...&lt;br /&gt;almost didnt want to write a positive review so that i can keep this scent to myself..</li>
            <li> Smells great!! I have seen other reviews which seem to indicate that Amazon has goods that are old and therefore are \\&quot;less potent\\&quot;....I dunno about that. My GF loves this stuff....it seems to have the same strength as the same product purchased at Sephora. I have NEVER gotten a thing from Amazon that did not live up to its on-line appearance. Add to that excellent customer service good to excellent prices, and you just cannot go wrong.</li>
            <li> very good cologne for the price. Honestly i now shop for everything on here because i can&#x27;t find it any cheaper elsewhere if i know what i want.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells like the powder that your barber or hairdresser brushes on your neck after a trim.  It&#x27;s a discriminating taste thing for sure but I&#x27;m not remotely impressed and doubt I would wear it.  My girlfriend was equally unimpressed I will likely re-gift it if I can find someone that appreciates scent.  It the type of thing I would use for funeral, not I night on the town and certainly not to look for a woman.  It&#x27;s very popular with stellar reviews, my guess with men over 55 though.  To be fair though I hate that powdery smell on a man or a woman many people find it pleasing.</li>
            <li> The scent stays on well - when he sprays it on he doesn&#x27;t need to reapply for several hours. Very nice!</li>
            <li> what else can I say, just like my first bottle, always loved the smell, and still do love the smell</li>
            <li> It came her on time.. love the price and the smell of the product. I am very happy with my purchase. very responsible and great deals</li>
