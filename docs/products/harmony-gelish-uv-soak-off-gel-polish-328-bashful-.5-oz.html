            <li>I totally LOVED it!!</li>
            <li>Beautiful shear color just a touch of blush and some shimmer.</li>
            <li>Beautiful.</li>
            <li>This is a great summer color.</li>
            <li>It stays on great but the color was lighter than it appeared on the sample.</li>
            <li>The price is great since Sally&#x27;s has it this week for $14.95 per bottle.</li>
            <li>The gelish brand is great.  </li>
            <li>I really loved this color.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just not having good luck with color as of yet.  </li>
            <li>Great color to start with when learning to apply gel nails on your own.  </li>
            <li>Lovely colour!</li>
            <li>I have fallen in love with the Gelish system!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still a nice color</li>
            <li>It goes on nicely</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d continue if I could carry in my own foot</li>
            <li>:) really pleased!</li>
            <li>I read the reviews before ordering so I knew that this was going to be very light-</li>
            <li>This appears to be on the pinkish side, but it is not - it is definitely more of a nude, browntone color.  </li>
            <li>I love the Gelish system</li>
            <li>but as one reviewer said, it&#x27;s more of a milky-yellow.  </li>
            <li>I usually am satisfied with Gellish, however this color, which is shown to be a pinkish color, turned out to be a tan color.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t satisfied at all.</li>
            <li>do love the gelish home kit and do my nails weekly or bi-weekly.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for French manicures.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know much more about it - I&#x27;m a dude after all....</li>
            <li>Better tan what I thought it would be, great color and went on very well.</li>
            <li>It will be perfect for French manicures.     </li>
            <li>This is more of a nude color with some sparkle.  </li>
            <li>and it is more of a flesh color.</li>
            <li>You can put a coat of sparkle on top to add some bling if that&#x27;s what you are looking for.  </li>
            <li>This color is ok.  </li>
            <li>I love Gelish nail color.  </li>
            <li>top it off, it&#x27;s non-refundable...</li>
            <li>I thought this color would cover my nail better.</li>
            <li>I applied two coats and my nails look very clean.</li>
            <li>It is nice and light without being too light that you need to put 3 or 4 coats for the color to be seen.</li>
            <li>So if you don&#x27;t want pink, this is perfect.</li>
            <li>but it works great as a top coat on a French manicure.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and doesn&#x27;t chip</li>
            <li>I will say that it goes on even and two coats are plenty, so quality is fine</li>
            <li>Especially useful if your growing out your nails because it makes them so much stronger.</li>
            <li>Will be great for a French Mani.</li>
            <li>This would be fine for true red heads, who can wear pumpkin orange, or strawberry blonds, who look great in peach.</li>
            <li>I buffed my nails with a very fine buffer, wiped them with rubbing alcohol, used the gelish foundation, cured, used one coat of Bashful, cured, one coat of sleek white on my tips, cured, then one more coat of this polish before using a top coat.  </li>
            <li>and I was too excited to wait until I returned the product and got a prettier color.  </li>
            <li>b/c it looks so clean.</li>
            <li>Very pretty, use with a uv light.</li>
            <li>This is a great color to use as a natural color for the French Manicure or if you are looking for a more neutral color to wear.</li>
            <li>It is a nice, natural, neutral color.  </li>
            <li>Believe me, I love a pop of color, but this Bashful color really took me by surprise.  </li>
            <li>I have had good luck doing a gelly sandwich, which uses regular polish for the color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t provide full coverage so not idea for use alone unless you desire translucent polish</li>
            <li>:) thanks</li>
            <li>First, I do like Gelish and believe once I get the right color,  starter kit,and UV lamp, I&#x27;ll be able to give myself long-lasting manis and pedis for a fraction of the cost salons charge.</li>
            <li>I bought it because I got my nails done light pink at a salon and the lady told me the color was called gelish bashful, and I loved it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not convinced they can or are cleaned adequately.</li>
            <li>I love this color since I have to wear natural colors to work.  </li>
            <li>I really like the \\&quot;Bashful\\&quot; color since is really good for a french manicure</li>
            <li>and if I notice anything near my cuticles I will pick so when applying this product make sure to pay attention to the cuticles and do not let it &#x27;pool&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>It is great for a clear coat manicure or for french manicure.  </li>
            <li>This is a very light colour and can barely be seen so if you are looking for lots of colour or lots of bling this is not the one for you.  </li>
            <li>Love the product but the color looks more pink than it really is.</li>
            <li>Love this color, but it&#x27;s not pink like it appears in the picture</li>
            <li>This polish looks really lovely and pink in the picture, but when I put it on it was more of a peach color, and very translucent.</li>
            <li>I paired this with sleek white and it was great for a french manicure.  </li>
            <li>In the picture it looks cute and light pink.</li>
            <li>It would also be good for just a sheer natural shine.  </li>
            <li>When I first saw this color for the first time online</li>
            <li>i am a nail tech and love it on short nails</li>
            <li>I tried the product out because it was my first at home GELISH trial</li>
            <li>~it&#x27;s more of an iridescent white.  </li>
            <li>Bashful was the first color that I bought.</li>
            <li>I love them and only buy that brand.</li>
            <li>Pretty color.</li>
            <li>Even though others said to be aware of the color, I did not realize what the problem was.</li>
            <li>More of a very pale beige color, mostly shimmer.</li>
            <li>, I am more of a flat color person.</li>
            <li>It is more of a grey in person</li>
            <li>I wanted a pinkish shimmer for frenches, but this color is much more neutral, more on the yellow side of neutral than the pink side.  </li>
            <li>It looks good, and I will keep using it, but I am not sure if I would buy it knowing about the shimmery pearl.</li>
            <li>As some other reviews that I&#x27;ve read this shade has nearly no color to it at all, it&#x27;s more like a glitter top coat then color.  </li>
            <li>but I feel the picture is much more pink than it really is.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this color.</li>
            <li>I bought it to use with my UV light for when I do a french manicure.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t look like you&#x27;re wearing much.  </li>
            <li>Very disapointing.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>It is very neutral with a hint of shimmer.  </li>
            <li>Very clever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It might be okay over another pink gelish color, just to add an opal-y sheen.</li>
            <li>The color wasn&#x27;t even close to what this pic looks like, but rather more like a natural color for using in a french manicure.</li>
            <li>I love Gelish but am giving 3 stars due to the misrepresentation of the colors.</li>
            <li>This color is so light it looks clear, very classy for wedding or just a natural nail look.  </li>
            <li>I personally wouldn&#x27;t buy it again because I prefer more of a fresh, hint of pink shimmer.  </li>
            <li>In the past, I purchased and carried in my own set of utensils.  </li>
            <li>we can&#x27;t always wear bright blue color everyday.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Gelish polishes.</li>
            <li>However when I was inside it looked more like a clear polish with very small specks of glitter (not bad).  </li>
            <li>I purchased \\&quot;Bashful\\&quot; because I wanted a light pink nail color.  </li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;re looking for a light pink, this is not it.</li>
            <li>I think it makes a very pretty and natural french manicure.  </li>
            <li>However, I prefer more of a pink color in my french manicure.  </li>
            <li>In the picture look much more pink than it actually is.</li>
            <li>Now I do and will sell mine to purchase a light, natural looking pink.</li>
            <li>- goes with any thing and very professional looking.</li>
            <li>This color is clear!</li>
            <li>higher price point of gel polish vs. regular polish.  </li>
            <li>so I just put 2 coats of my regular soft pink polish over it, applied the Gelish top coat and cured it.</li>
            <li>After you wipe down the cured top it off, apply regular nail polish, LET IT AIR DRY and make sure it&#x27;s REALLY dry (or you&#x27;ll get</li>
            <li>I would not recommend it if you really want the pretty pink color it&#x27;s advertised as.</li>
            <li>Very soft color and natural looking.  </li>
            <li>Now this makes me think that none of the other pictures are true to color.</li>
            <li>not what I thought, it&#x27;s basically clear.  </li>
            <li>It is clear with a pinkish yellowish brownish tone to it...</li>
            <li>When I just use 1 or 2 coats it looks like a shimmery clear coat.</li>
            <li>but it shows up clear not pinkish like the color charts.</li>
            <li>I did three coats and it was still clear.  </li>
            <li>its almost clear</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a clear flesh color, the &#x27;sparkle&#x27; goes unnoticeable.</li>
            <li>Not the seller&#x27;s fault as this picture was directly from Gelish.</li>
            <li>This Bashful color looks pink right</li>
            <li>Would give a nice subtle shimmer, but for a regular mani, it basically looks clear.</li>
            <li>Picture shows a solid light pink, yet this polish is actually clear with a barely visible hint of shimmer.  </li>
            <li>I love the subtle color if this.</li>
            <li>It is still pretty but not what I expected and your natural nail tip, even with two coats, will show thru.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a pale pink suitable for business manicures.  </li>
            <li>I thought it was a sheer pink, since the picture - dot next to the nail polis bottle looks really light pink, but its really more beige than pink, with a hint of sheer.</li>
            <li>This nail polish is clear with a hint of beige not pink.</li>
            <li>The color wasn&#x27;t exactly what I expected</li>
            <li>Color is not pink at all, let me repeat... NOT pink, not even a hint!!!</li>
            <li>Although i like the color i got its is not this pink, its more of a sheer color and for it to even be a little bit opaque</li>
            <li>For someone that usually only puts a clear polish on fingernails</li>
            <li>No pink at all.</li>
            <li>Overall, I really like the product because I always do lot of french manicures and with gelish you don&#x27;t have to worry with any chip or the polish coming off because it will last you for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>it is tan with no pink to it at all.</li>
            <li>It is not pink toned, at all.</li>
            <li>I gave this color a three because the picture is no where near what the color actually is.  </li>
            <li>This looks as if it should be a pink color, but it really has no color at all.</li>
            <li>I put on 3 coats and it barely appears  to be a pearl color.</li>
            <li>Not super loud and very feminine.</li>
            <li>It is slightly pink with some shimmer but is an excellent base for french manicures.  </li>
            <li>a very shiny (top coat is shiny) normal French Manicure with very white tips and clear base below the tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> It looks good, and I will keep using it, but I am not sure if I would buy it knowing about the shimmery pearl.</li>
            <li> As some other reviews that I&#x27;ve read this shade has nearly no color to it at all, it&#x27;s more like a glitter top coat then color.  </li>
            <li> but I feel the picture is much more pink than it really is.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this color.</li>
            <li> I bought it to use with my UV light for when I do a french manicure.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t look like you&#x27;re wearing much.  </li>
            <li> Very disapointing.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> It is very neutral with a hint of shimmer.  </li>
            <li> Very clever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It might be okay over another pink gelish color, just to add an opal-y sheen.</li>
            <li> The color wasn&#x27;t even close to what this pic looks like, but rather more like a natural color for using in a french manicure.</li>
            <li> I love Gelish but am giving 3 stars due to the misrepresentation of the colors.</li>
            <li> This color is so light it looks clear, very classy for wedding or just a natural nail look.  </li>
            <li> I personally wouldn&#x27;t buy it again because I prefer more of a fresh, hint of pink shimmer.  </li>
            <li> In the past, I purchased and carried in my own set of utensils.  </li>
            <li> we can&#x27;t always wear bright blue color everyday.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Gelish polishes.</li>
            <li> However when I was inside it looked more like a clear polish with very small specks of glitter (not bad).  </li>
            <li> I purchased \\&quot;Bashful\\&quot; because I wanted a light pink nail color.  </li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re looking for a light pink, this is not it.</li>
            <li> I think it makes a very pretty and natural french manicure.  </li>
            <li> However, I prefer more of a pink color in my french manicure.  </li>
            <li> In the picture look much more pink than it actually is.</li>
            <li> Now I do and will sell mine to purchase a light, natural looking pink.</li>
            <li> - goes with any thing and very professional looking.</li>
            <li> This color is clear!</li>
            <li> higher price point of gel polish vs. regular polish.  </li>
            <li> so I just put 2 coats of my regular soft pink polish over it, applied the Gelish top coat and cured it.</li>
            <li> After you wipe down the cured top it off, apply regular nail polish, LET IT AIR DRY and make sure it&#x27;s REALLY dry (or you&#x27;ll get</li>
            <li> I would not recommend it if you really want the pretty pink color it&#x27;s advertised as.</li>
            <li> Very soft color and natural looking.  </li>
            <li> Now this makes me think that none of the other pictures are true to color.</li>
            <li> not what I thought, it&#x27;s basically clear.  </li>
            <li> It is clear with a pinkish yellowish brownish tone to it...</li>
            <li> When I just use 1 or 2 coats it looks like a shimmery clear coat.</li>
            <li> but it shows up clear not pinkish like the color charts.</li>
            <li> I did three coats and it was still clear.  </li>
            <li> its almost clear</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a clear flesh color, the &#x27;sparkle&#x27; goes unnoticeable.</li>
            <li> Not the seller&#x27;s fault as this picture was directly from Gelish.</li>
            <li> This Bashful color looks pink right</li>
            <li> Would give a nice subtle shimmer, but for a regular mani, it basically looks clear.</li>
            <li> Picture shows a solid light pink, yet this polish is actually clear with a barely visible hint of shimmer.  </li>
            <li> I love the subtle color if this.</li>
            <li> It is still pretty but not what I expected and your natural nail tip, even with two coats, will show thru.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a pale pink suitable for business manicures.  </li>
            <li> I thought it was a sheer pink, since the picture - dot next to the nail polis bottle looks really light pink, but its really more beige than pink, with a hint of sheer.</li>
            <li> This nail polish is clear with a hint of beige not pink.</li>
            <li> The color wasn&#x27;t exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> Color is not pink at all, let me repeat... NOT pink, not even a hint!!!</li>
            <li> Although i like the color i got its is not this pink, its more of a sheer color and for it to even be a little bit opaque</li>
            <li> For someone that usually only puts a clear polish on fingernails</li>
            <li> No pink at all.</li>
            <li> Overall, I really like the product because I always do lot of french manicures and with gelish you don&#x27;t have to worry with any chip or the polish coming off because it will last you for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> it is tan with no pink to it at all.</li>
            <li> It is not pink toned, at all.</li>
            <li> I gave this color a three because the picture is no where near what the color actually is.  </li>
            <li> This looks as if it should be a pink color, but it really has no color at all.</li>
            <li> I put on 3 coats and it barely appears  to be a pearl color.</li>
            <li> Not super loud and very feminine.</li>
            <li> It is slightly pink with some shimmer but is an excellent base for french manicures.  </li>
            <li> a very shiny (top coat is shiny) normal French Manicure with very white tips and clear base below the tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I now know that I have to really research a color before buying: a) the color charts are not accurate and b)the</li>
            <li> It has a very subtle sparkle to it, but it&#x27;s verrrrry light.</li>
            <li> I normally use pale pinks (Opi&#x27;s Kiss on the Chic &amp; Bubble Bath) but on my complexion (yellow, tan)</li>
            <li> I was looking for a natural pink that I&#x27;ve gotten at the salons during a pink and white manicure, and this did not meet the mark.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a pale, clear, yellow.  </li>
            <li> It would look like a healthy natural color on both of the latter but not on those with blue base undertone skin.  </li>
            <li> I am African American with medium to dark skin.</li>
            <li> trouble with trying to gauge how you like a color of soak off gel polishes is that your application may vary a lot from pictures you see online and also our monitors display colors way off unless they have been professionally calibrated (which almost none of them are).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is clear,kind of yellow not even a bit close to pink.</li>
            <li> It is very sheer had a hint of pink shimmer.  </li>
            <li> a weird wrinkle affect)then do top it off again, cure and wipe down.</li>
            <li> A very natural Color with a little bit of shimmer just what I wanted!</li>
            <li> However if a strange beige is what you are after choose this one!</li>
            <li> It does have a bit of shimmer, and doesn&#x27;t look bad, but I think the best purpose for this color is for someone who wants a slightly shimmery base for a french, but doesn&#x27;t want any pink tones.  </li>
            <li> but I expected something else.</li>
            <li> Bashful looks like a pearly pink in the color swatch</li>
            <li> If however you are like me and want a pink color then please look else where</li>
            <li> Guess I&#x27;m still on the hunt for that pink.</li>
            <li> There is not a hint of pink in the color at all.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for pink, don&#x27;t buy this color.</li>
            <li> The picture looks pink</li>
            <li> but I like pink</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t even pink at all.  </li>
            <li> I almost never use it because it&#x27;s about the same affect as just doing the base and top it off and call it good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not nearly as shimmery as the picture and way less tint.</li>
            <li> I used two coats and it still didn&#x27;t change the color of my nails, it only added a very slight peachy opal cast.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s SO natural and subtle, the equivalent to a nude lip gloss.  </li>
            <li> It is a very neutral color with a very subtle shimmer.  </li>
            <li> I just did my m-i-l nails this weekend with Bashful, and using 1 coats as a base for a french manicure (free handed the tips with Sleek White), this color looked almost clear with a very subtle shimmer.</li>
            <li> should have read the other reviews...</li>
            <li> I am waiting on the other colors that I ordered from Amazon to arrive.</li>
            <li> It is ok for what I bought but a bit disappointed at the color.</li>
            <li> I have purchased other deeper colours and like them as well</li>
            <li> Lasts me two weeks with a sports active life style</li>
            <li> I use it with other colors to tone them down.</li>
            <li> when I went outside that I discovered that it looked like a clear to off white polish that had yellowed badly.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting a light shade of pink :(</li>
            <li> It worked well when I was having surgery and could not have a dark color on my nails.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s yellowish beige, not light pink as on photo</li>
            <li> But I like it none the less.</li>
            <li> Semi transparent and slightly pearlized color.</li>
            <li> This shade is very subtle, looks natural.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed it was so light</li>
            <li> It has a little bit of sparkle</li>
            <li> did read the reviews first and decided that if it didn&#x27;t turn out to be pink like the reviews said, then at least I can use it for a base for French manicures.  </li>
            <li> regard to this product, the color was not accurately portrayed in the picture.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely would not recommend this color unless you are going for a very subtle French Manicure.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed as it looks like it should be a light pink.</li>
            <li> Plain and simple the coloring is all wrong.</li>
            <li> BUT it has some pearl in it which i am not sure about</li>
            <li> On the top of this the costumer service is just BAD!!!</li>
            <li> The color shown is unbelievably deceiving.</li>
            <li> nails\\&quot; with a sickly golden base undertone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed, makes me very weary of purchasing another harmony gelish product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mean lets face it</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s so subtle</li>
            <li> It was also extremely thin and runny, which made it hard to control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With how much I paid for this product, I was very disappointed with the results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sort of what you&#x27;d expect the base of the nail to look like when doing an American manicure.  </li>
            <li> Even the base color in a French manicure is pinker than this Bashful color.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a winter with medium blue base skin tones.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this one won&#x27;t get a lot of use from me.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> So sad.</li>
            <li> (WRONG)</li>
            <li> The worst nail polish I ever seen, it is totally different form the description.</li>
            <li> Sounds as bad as it looked!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed!  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed and wish I never ordered it.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> The color is horrible, It looks nothing like the picture.</li>
            <li> However it&#x27;s an awful yucky beige color.</li>
            <li> I hate it!</li>
            <li> Horrible color!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;M SO DISAPPOINTED!!!</li>

            <li> This appears to be on the pinkish side, but it is not - it is definitely more of a nude, browntone color.  It is still pretty but not what I expected and your natural nail tip, even with two coats, will show thru.</li>
            <li> I love this color since I have to wear natural colors to work.  It has a little bit of sparkle but I feel the picture is much more pink than it really is.</li>
            <li> No pink at all. It&#x27;s like some yellowish color will return .</li>
            <li> A very natural Color with a little bit of shimmer just what I wanted!</li>
            <li> This is a great summer color. It is nice and light without being too light that you need to put 3 or 4 coats for the color to be seen.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this color. I bought it to use with my UV light for when I do a french manicure. It has a very subtle sparkle to it, but it&#x27;s verrrrry light. I also found that after about 2 days of wearing it, it got a dingy, yellow-ish tone to it. I was looking for a natural pink that I&#x27;ve gotten at the salons during a pink and white manicure, and this did not meet the mark. I&#x27;ve also tried it solo, but it takes about 3 coats before you can even see it on my skin tone. Unfortunately, this one won&#x27;t get a lot of use from me.</li>
            <li> When I first saw this color for the first time online I thought it was a sheer pink, since the picture - dot next to the nail polis bottle looks really light pink, but its really more beige than pink, with a hint of sheer. Don&#x27;t get me wrong I really like the \\&quot;Bashful\\&quot; color since is really good for a french manicure but I expected something else. Overall, I really like the product because I always do lot of french manicures and with gelish you don&#x27;t have to worry with any chip or the polish coming off because it will last you for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> This is a great color to use as a natural color for the French Manicure or if you are looking for a more neutral color to wear. I mean lets face it we can&#x27;t always wear bright blue color everyday. Especially useful if your growing out your nails because it makes them so much stronger.</li>
            <li> I just did my m-i-l nails this weekend with Bashful, and using 1 coats as a base for a french manicure (free handed the tips with Sleek White), this color looked almost clear with a very subtle shimmer. The finished result looked like a very shiny (top coat is shiny) normal French Manicure with very white tips and clear base below the tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trouble with trying to gauge how you like a color of soak off gel polishes is that your application may vary a lot from pictures you see online and also our monitors display colors way off unless they have been professionally calibrated (which almost none of them are).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also what I describe as this word or another, may be described very differently from another person.&lt;br /&gt;We don&#x27;t all use the same terminology. Just sayin...</li>
            <li> The color is completely different than what the picture shows... I am very disappointed and wish I never ordered it.</li>
            <li> this is very sheer with a bit of a shimmer, almost like a mother of pearl color. i am a nail tech and love it on short nails b/c it looks so clean.</li>
            <li> I ordered Harmony Gelish Polish month ago, but I did not get it yet.  Harmony Gelish UV Soak Off Gel Polish #328 Bashful .5 oz  I would like to know if anyone lse have a similar problem and how to solve it, get produch which I paid for? Thank you</li>
            <li> I read the reviews before ordering so I knew that this was going to be very light- it is perfect!  I applied two coats and my nails look very clean.</li>
            <li> It stays on great but the color was lighter than it appeared on the sample. I&#x27;m a little disappointed it was so light but it works great as a top coat on a French manicure.</li>
            <li> I really loved this color.  It is a nice, natural, neutral color.  I got it to finish off my french manicure but I tend to wear it without the white tips.  The product lasted about 2 weeks for me, I am a picker and if I notice anything near my cuticles I will pick so when applying this product make sure to pay attention to the cuticles and do not let it &#x27;pool&#x27;.  I would recommend this product to my friends!!</li>
            <li> The color is horrible, It looks nothing like the picture. It is more of a grey in person</li>
            <li> I got this color thinking it would be just like OPI buble bath, and it is BUT it has some pearl in it which i am not sure about, I am more of a flat color person. It looks good, and I will keep using it, but I am not sure if I would buy it knowing about the shimmery pearl.</li>
            <li> I purchased \\&quot;Bashful\\&quot; because I wanted a light pink nail color.  When the polish arrived I thought I&#x27;d send it back because it looked somewhat like the color of malt-o-meal and I thought perhaps the item was defective.  I tried the product out because it was my first at home GELISH trial and I was too excited to wait until I returned the product and got a prettier color.  To my amazement the color is BEAUTIFUL!  It&#x27;s SO natural and subtle, the equivalent to a nude lip gloss.  There&#x27;s a hint of color and my nails look shiny, but it&#x27;s so subtle it doesn&#x27;t look like you&#x27;re wearing much.  Believe me, I love a pop of color, but this Bashful color really took me by surprise.  It&#x27;s sort of what you&#x27;d expect the base of the nail to look like when doing an American manicure.  Even the base color in a French manicure is pinker than this Bashful color.  I totally LOVED it!!</li>
            <li> This nail polish is clear with a hint of beige not pink. Very disapointing. I was expecting a light shade of pink :(</li>
            <li> I paired this with sleek white and it was great for a french manicure.  It is slightly pink with some shimmer but is an excellent base for french manicures.  I highly recommend Gelish polishes.</li>
            <li> I love the Gelish system but I wish I had chosen a different color.  Bashful looks like a pearly pink in the color swatch but as one reviewer said, it&#x27;s more of a milky-yellow.  I&#x27;m not a fan of this color at all and am thinking of adding a couple of drops of another color or maybe a glitter into it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely would not recommend this color unless you are going for a very subtle French Manicure.</li>
            <li> Uuuuuuuummm no! In the picture it looks cute and light pink. However it&#x27;s an awful yucky beige color. I hate it! So sad. However if a strange beige is what you are after choose this one! If however you are like me and want a pink color then please look else where</li>
            <li> I usually am satisfied with Gellish, however this color, which is shown to be a pinkish color, turned out to be a tan color. I wasn&#x27;t satisfied at all.</li>
            <li> This color is so light it looks clear, very classy for wedding or just a natural nail look.  Love the product but the color looks more pink than it really is.</li>
            <li> should have read the other reviews...not what I thought, it&#x27;s basically clear.  Would be find for French Manicures, but is blahhh.  Not nearly as shimmery as the picture and way less tint.</li>
            <li> Beautiful shear color just a touch of blush and some shimmer.</li>
            <li> Not the color in the photo.</li>
            <li> Color don&#x27;t match picture . It&#x27;s yellowish beige, not light pink as on photo</li>
            <li> I buffed my nails with a very fine buffer, wiped them with rubbing alcohol, used the gelish foundation, cured, used one coat of Bashful, cured, one coat of sleek white on my tips, cured, then one more coat of this polish before using a top coat.  It is a very neutral color with a very subtle shimmer.  I think it makes a very pretty and natural french manicure.  It would also be good for just a sheer natural shine.  However, I prefer more of a pink color in my french manicure.  So if you don&#x27;t want pink, this is perfect.</li>
            <li> Beautiful. Works with a French tip manicure well or by itself for a simple finish.its a see through polish.</li>
            <li> As some other reviews that I&#x27;ve read this shade has nearly no color to it at all, it&#x27;s more like a glitter top coat then color.  I almost never use it because it&#x27;s about the same affect as just doing the base and top it off and call it good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do love the gelish home kit and do my nails weekly or bi-weekly.  I&#x27;m just not having good luck with color as of yet.  I have had good luck doing a gelly sandwich, which uses regular polish for the color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To gelly sandwich...follow the regular instructions, just skip the color coat.  After you wipe down the cured top it off, apply regular nail polish, LET IT AIR DRY and make sure it&#x27;s REALLY dry (or you&#x27;ll get a weird wrinkle affect)then do top it off again, cure and wipe down.</li>
            <li> Perfect for French manicures. Doesn&#x27;t provide full coverage so not idea for use alone unless you desire translucent polish</li>
            <li> Lovely colour! :) really pleased! :) thanks</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves this and uses it all the time. I don&#x27;t know much more about it - I&#x27;m a dude after all....</li>
            <li> The color wasn&#x27;t even close to what this pic looks like, but rather more like a natural color for using in a french manicure.</li>
            <li> Better tan what I thought it would be, great color and went on very well. I would buy again with out hesitation.</li>
            <li> Horrible color!  I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very soft color and natural looking.  It is translucent even with three coats.</li>
            <li> This color is hideous. Makes my nails a yellowish color. It is clear with a pinkish yellowish brownish tone to it... Ick. That&#x27;s the risk you take when buying online though!</li>
            <li> Love this color, but it&#x27;s not pink like it appears in the picture~it&#x27;s more of an iridescent white.  I use if for nail tips on a french manicure.</li>
            <li> More of a very pale beige color, mostly shimmer. When I just use 1 or 2 coats it looks like a shimmery clear coat.</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time, was as described</li>
            <li> This color is clear! I did expect a tad bit of tint but it shows up clear not pinkish like the color charts. It will be perfect for French manicures.     I love Gelish but am giving 3 stars due to the misrepresentation of the colors. The colors aren&#x27;t even the same as the view window on the bottle.</li>
            <li> Picture shows a solid light pink, yet this polish is actually clear with a barely visible hint of shimmer.  I did three coats and it was still clear.  It was also extremely thin and runny, which made it hard to control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did read the reviews first and decided that if it didn&#x27;t turn out to be pink like the reviews said, then at least I can use it for a base for French manicures.  I bought it because I got my nails done light pink at a salon and the lady told me the color was called gelish bashful, and I loved it.  Guess I&#x27;m still on the hunt for that pink.</li>
            <li> I have fallen in love with the Gelish system!  Bashful was the first color that I bought. I now know that I have to really research a color before buying: a) the color charts are not accurate and b)the higher price point of gel polish vs. regular polish.  I normally use pale pinks (Opi&#x27;s Kiss on the Chic &amp; Bubble Bath) but on my complexion (yellow, tan) it just looked like a milky yellow color!! Sounds as bad as it looked!  However when I was inside it looked more like a clear polish with very small specks of glitter (not bad).  It was the next morning when I went outside that I discovered that it looked like a clear to off white polish that had yellowed badly.  I had a meeting to go to so I just put 2 coats of my regular soft pink polish over it, applied the Gelish top coat and cured it. I have been wearing this application for almost a week and it is wearing well.  I am waiting on the other colors that I ordered from Amazon to arrive. Hth!!</li>
            <li> Not the color that&#x27;s posted. Very yellow when I got it.</li>
            <li> The color wasn&#x27;t exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> For someone that usually only puts a clear polish on fingernails I love the subtle color if this. There is just a hint of a sparkly ness. I really like it.</li>
            <li> Plain and simple the coloring is all wrong. I am African American with medium to dark skin. My nail beds are pinkish and tan. This Bashful color looks pink right (WRONG) it is tan with no pink to it at all. It is called bashful for a reason and the reason is the color is scared to show. It is not pink toned, at all. The price is great since Sally&#x27;s has it this week for $14.95 per bottle.</li>
            <li> I gave this color a three because the picture is no where near what the color actually is.  There is not a hint of pink in the color at all.  This is more of a nude color with some sparkle.  It&#x27;s still a nice color but if you&#x27;re looking for a light pink, this is not it.</li>
            <li> This looks as if it should be a pink color, but it really has no color at all. If anything it has a hint of yellow. I was very disappointed as it looks like it should be a light pink. I put on 3 coats and it barely appears  to be a pearl color. Not what I had in mind. If you are looking for pink, don&#x27;t buy this color.</li>
            <li> This color had too nude/beige tone to my taste. In the picture look much more pink than it actually is.</li>
            <li> The picture looks pink and I bought it for French Nails but I like pink and it is more of a flesh color. It is ok for what I bought but a bit disappointed at the color. Now this makes me think that none of the other pictures are true to color.</li>
            <li> This is a great color for either a base color or a French manicure. It goes on easily and doesn&#x27;t chip and it&#x27;s way cheaper than paying a salon.</li>
            <li> This is a very light colour and can barely be seen so if you are looking for lots of colour or lots of bling this is not the one for you.  It goes on nicely and I like it because I prefer wearing the lighter shades.  I have purchased other deeper colours and like them as well but this is one of my favourites.  You can put a coat of sparkle on top to add some bling if that&#x27;s what you are looking for.  The gelish brand is great.  I love them and only buy that brand.</li>
            <li> Although i like the color i got its is not this pink, its more of a sheer color and for it to even be a little bit opaque youll need to do abotu 3 coats.</li>
            <li> This color is ok.  It is very neutral with a hint of shimmer.  I wanted a pinkish shimmer for frenches, but this color is much more neutral, more on the yellow side of neutral than the pink side.  It does have a bit of shimmer, and doesn&#x27;t look bad, but I think the best purpose for this color is for someone who wants a slightly shimmery base for a french, but doesn&#x27;t want any pink tones.  I personally wouldn&#x27;t buy it again because I prefer more of a fresh, hint of pink shimmer.  I will say that it goes on even and two coats are plenty, so quality is fine, it&#x27;s just a color issue for me.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a pale pink suitable for business manicures.  This isn&#x27;t even pink at all.  It&#x27;s like a pale, clear, yellow.  It is great for a clear coat manicure or for french manicure.  Just wasn&#x27;t as the picture portrays it.</li>
            <li> The worst nail polish I ever seen, it is totally different form the description. It is clear,kind of yellow not even a bit close to pink. Also I want mention this nail polish smell like a nail polish remover! I&#x27;M SO DISAPPOINTED!!! On the top of this the costumer service is just BAD!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed!  This is not even close to the color in the picture...its yellow...yuck! And the consistency is like water. The only reason i gave the rating one star, is because zero isn&#x27;t an option.  I will not buy from this seller again...nor will i recommend.</li>
            <li> This polish worked well with my gel manicure set even though it was from a different manufacturer.  I like the shade - goes with any thing and very professional looking.</li>
            <li> Pretty color. Not super loud and very feminine. Lasts me two weeks with a sports active life style</li>
            <li> its not that color which shows on the picture. its almost clear</li>
            <li> I love Gelish nail color.  This shade is very subtle, looks natural.  I use it with other colors to tone them down.</li>
            <li> I had seen this on pentrest so I had to buy it. It is very sheer had a hint of pink shimmer.  It worked well when I was having surgery and could not have a dark color on my nails.</li>
            <li> The color shown is unbelievably deceiving. Color is not pink at all, let me repeat... NOT pink, not even a hint!!! It&#x27;s a clear flesh color, the &#x27;sparkle&#x27; goes unnoticeable. I&#x27;m so disappointed, makes me very weary of purchasing another harmony gelish product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To top it off, it&#x27;s non-refundable... Very clever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money &amp; time!</li>
            <li> Very pretty, use with a uv light.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great base for French manicures. Would give a nice subtle shimmer, but for a regular mani, it basically looks clear. Doesn&#x27;t look anything like the sample image.</li>
            <li> I thought this color would cover my nail better. The color is very sheer and you can see through it. Will be great for a French Mani.</li>
            <li> This color is almost a bit yellow. But I like it none the less. Not the seller&#x27;s fault as this picture was directly from Gelish.</li>
            <li> Great color to start with when learning to apply gel nails on your own.  Semi transparent and slightly pearlized color.</li>
            <li> First, I do like Gelish and believe once I get the right color,  starter kit,and UV lamp, I&#x27;ll be able to give myself long-lasting manis and pedis for a fraction of the cost salons charge. Also, I&#x27;m concerned about fungal infections being contracted from the pedicure water spas.  I&#x27;m not convinced they can or are cleaned adequately. In the past, I purchased and carried in my own set of utensils.  I&#x27;d continue if I could carry in my own foot bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With regard to this product, the color was not accurately portrayed in the picture. I&#x27;m a winter with medium blue base skin tones. This color makes my nails look like yellowed \\&quot;tobacco smokers nails\\&quot; with a sickly golden base undertone. This would be fine for true red heads, who can wear pumpkin orange, or strawberry blonds, who look great in peach. It would look like a healthy natural color on both of the latter but not on those with blue base undertone skin.  Even though others said to be aware of the color, I did not realize what the problem was. Now I do and will sell mine to purchase a light, natural looking pink.</li>
            <li> This polish looks really lovely and pink in the picture, but when I put it on it was more of a peach color, and very translucent. I used two coats and it still didn&#x27;t change the color of my nails, it only added a very slight peachy opal cast. With how much I paid for this product, I was very disappointed with the results. I would not recommend it if you really want the pretty pink color it&#x27;s advertised as. It might be okay over another pink gelish color, just to add an opal-y sheen.</li>
