            <li>I do my own home manicure and wanted a long lasting polish system.  </li>
            <li>I have found my OPI or ESSIE nail polishes with their standard top coats last much longer and stay nicer looking.</li>

            <li>it last so much longer than the salon.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it and would give it ten stars.....</li>
            <li>This product was much gentler on my nails that Shellac and did last longer than regular polish.</li>
            <li>Okay, but not great.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure that you could find a less expensive one that lasts longer at the drug store (wet and wild,</li>

            <li> So brown it might as well be black.</li>
            <li> The polish pulls away from edge of nails, scratches, and gets a dull finish after a few days.</li>
            <li> HAVE LASTED AT LEAST 5 DAYS ON MY NAILS</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have job that is tough on hands</li>

            <li> Okay, but not great.  Didn&#x27;t last as long as I expected it to.  The color was solid after three coats.  I&#x27;m pretty sure that you could find a less expensive one that lasts longer at the drug store (wet and wild, for instance - i had worn it the week previously with no chips....)</li>
            <li> Keeps your polish on . Fast drying</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S OKAY, I WAS HOPPING THAT IT WOULD  HAVE LASTED AT LEAST 5 DAYS ON MY NAILS BUT IT DID NOT</li>
            <li> great quality, but hard on your nails</li>
            <li> I was very excited to see this product and ordered two colors. This polish went on nicely and was quick to dry.

            <li> I am very happy so far with vinylux. Color seems to last. This shade chipped sooner than the  other colors i bought.Shellach gel polish ruined my nails.</li>
            <li> Great dark color. Has hues of browns and reds. This product is a great product so far. NO CHIPPING!!&lt;br /&gt;Dries super fast!!</li>
            <li> I love this product! The color is exactly as advertised and the polish is a great product! I love it</li>
            <li> I love this nail polish! I highly recommend it to you!  The price was right too! Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> Great color!! Really worth it.</li>
            <li> I was very excited, but then became quickly disappointed when my nail tips started to chip. It&#x27;s supposed to last a week. I would have taken 3 days!</li>
            <li> Best nail polish ever!It really does look professional and really lasts.....I highly recommend it and would give it ten stars.....</li>
            <li> This polish has lasted an entire week, simply by applying the top coat every 2-3 days.  I&#x27;ll buy more of this product in the future!</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Color is beautiful</li>
            <li> I love this brand, I recommend buying the top coat.  it last so much longer than the salon.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite long lasting polish.  I do my own home manicure and wanted a long lasting polish system.  Vinylux does not disappoint.  At my nail salon they charge an extra $5 to have this polish applied.  I bring my own polish when I have a manicure.  Who needs to pay $5 -  I have several of these colors and this one is a favorite color.  Chocolate look.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous color - perfect for all year round use; dries quickly and looks great. Shipping was fast !!</li>
            <li> Love it - I am wearing it right now! Such a dark great retro looking color without being purple or black. Reddish brown.</li>
            <li> Long lasting manicure, easy to use.</li>
            <li> I love this polish.  It is an expensive polish, but well worth it.  I can polish my nails at home, they dry in 8 MINUTES!!  And they last for about a week.</li>
            <li> Its is like eggplant with a red tint. very dark but not black. i use three coats and it seems to extend the life beyond 7 days. alos wearing nails short helps.</li>
            <li> Bought for my wife. Great colour</li>
            <li> So brown it might as well be black. I didn&#x27;t like the color - but can&#x27;t return it.  You should know that you can&#x27;t return these nail polishes.</li>
            <li> Item as described.  Quick shipping!</li>
            <li> Nice deep color.  Perfect for winter.</li>
            <li> I like the color and was enticed by the promise that this was a polish that would last a week.  Well, it didn&#x27;t stay very nice for long (about 4 days). I don&#x27;t have job that is tough on hands, I didn&#x27;t garden or do hand dish-washing. The polish pulls away from edge of nails, scratches, and gets a dull finish after a few days. I have found my OPI or ESSIE nail polishes with their standard top coats last much longer and stay nicer looking. It&#x27;s a great idea that still needs some work.</li>
