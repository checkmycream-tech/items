            <li> Did nothing for my nails or anything else I used it for ----- one thing I&#x27;ll tell you to be careful of - this crap melts in a warmish room and when you open it to use it - it flies all over you, the bed and whatever the-HELL is close to you and it is very greasy.</li>

            <li> Extremely good product</li>
            <li> My daughter and granddaughter both have dry skin in the winter months.  I recommend they both use it because as a child in South America my mother use to apply the same to my dry skin, so I know it&#x27;s use. It&#x27;s helpful to the skin,  it leaves it very smooth and supple not greasy.</li>
