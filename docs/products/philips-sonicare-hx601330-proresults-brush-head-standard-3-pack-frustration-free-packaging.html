            <li>I LOVE THE PHILLIPS SONICARE!  </li>
            <li>Best part is, if used as directed, in most cases you can stop worrying about flossing, as the bristles push on the edge of the gum to clean below the gum line.</li>
            <li>Great product, easy packaging.</li>
            <li>Nice packaging, not too wasteful and no sealed plastic nonsense.</li>
            <li>Although I concede that the star rating is more for the product, which is good, vice packaging, the fact remains that purchase of this product includes both aspects.  </li>
            <li>buy over 400 items a year from Amazon and always give an honest review in order to help those trying to make a purchase decision.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>The box isn&#x27;t fancy which is actually nice,</li>
            <li>Seeing these available on Amazon with the environmentally friendly no hassle packaging is just wonderful.  </li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;The brand is tried and true and the brushes ate great.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m happy to report that the brushes I received are of top quality and have been performing as well as the original brushes included with the Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li>You will be glad you join all of us that own this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a great product and a great value, each brush head will provide several months of use and preventative care for your teeth.  </li>
            <li>This is a great value and arrived very fast.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t remember the exact version that came with the Costco package - these are great.</li>
            <li>great product, thanks!</li>
            <li>Better price too.</li>
            <li>What more can you ask for??</li>
            <li>I love the tooth brush.</li>
            <li>and these brushes are simply the best.</li>
            <li>Glad I bought this in the three pack,  as it saved me money.</li>
            <li>For me, I may be able to reduce the frequency of my visit to my dental hygienst</li>
            <li>This is probably the most cost-effective way to buy the &amp;#34;blades&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>do love this toothbrush though.</li>
            <li>I have used the Sonicare electronic toothbrush lines for over 5 years and love them.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>maybe it&#x27;s better brushing, maybe not.</li>
            <li>Works and is a better price than I could find even at Costco.  </li>
            <li>The box is nice now, frustration free packaging.</li>
            <li>The Philips Sonic care does do a much better job.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>I love the results of using it faithfully.  </li>
            <li>I was able to find them cheaper at the warehouse club</li>
            <li>When I brush my teeth, I love how my teeth feel afterwards.</li>
            <li>Make sure you get these with Phillips on the shaft.</li>
            <li>New brushes feels great on teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li>They come in an easy packaging and my wife and I love the tooth brush.</li>
            <li>I love the Amazon Frustration Free Packaging!&lt;br /&gt;Set</li>
            <li>And most don&#x27;t fit on the power pack holder</li>
            <li>I love my Sonicare, and ordering heads every so often is just part of keeping your teeth so superhumanly clean.</li>
            <li>Subscription service is an easy way to save money and you control when they arrive.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Original Review with 2-star rating - The brush heads are perfect...exactly the same as what comes with the original toothbrush, and the price is very good on Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li>The Amazon discount is not as great as with many other products, but after looking in many places, one realizes that Sonicare replacement heads just aren&#x27;t cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Arrived fine.</li>
            <li>This kind of teeth brush is better than the normal.</li>
            <li>The brush heads are needed for the electric toothbrush I purchased and it works fine.  </li>
            <li>Yes thy just fit</li>
            <li>The Philips Sonicare HX6013 Proresults Brush Head, Standard, 3 Pack from Philips Sonicare are great brush heads.  </li>
            <li>; connector because its makes the toothbrush easy to clean and maintain.  </li>
            <li>Great toothbrush with lots of options and much smaller than the one it replaces</li>
            <li>I prefer these bristles and hope they continue to be available.</li>
            <li>These Brush Heads fit my Phillips Sonicare HX6972/30</li>
            <li>fit.  </li>
            <li>They fit the brush and they work.</li>
            <li>Both my husband and I have seen improvement in our gums and teeth and this is confirmed on our twice a year trips to the dentist.</li>
            <li>The fast shipment was nice as always.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice anything that made me think that, but they definitely don&#x27;t fit as well as I hoped.</li>
            <li>The brush head bristles fit the contours of your teeth.  </li>
            <li>wife says she has a smaller mouth and these work great anyway.</li>
            <li>no annoying plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li>Fantastic heads.  </li>
            <li>Since these are the original brush heads there can be no better reccommendation than that they work perfectly.</li>
            <li>These replacement heads are identical to the original one that was packaged with my Sonicare brush.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of hard to go into great detail about these.</li>
            <li>My teeth are clean.</li>
            <li>Same good product to replace original brushes.</li>
            <li>Fits perfectly fine on my pro results sonicare toothbrush, and everything price is right.</li>
            <li>Such a good idea that I enrolled in Auto ship.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t fit quite right</li>
            <li>Also, they wear out way too quickly.</li>
            <li>However, they do give good results so I will continue to buy them as long as I have my Sonicare.</li>
            <li>have all tried many many different toothbrushes/heads, and when you find the right one you stick with</li>
            <li>As for these replacement heads, they are exactly like what you get originally with your Sonicare.</li>
            <li>First, there was no &#x27;frustration&#x27; with the original packaging, and</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!!</li>
            <li>My wife and I have been using this product for a few years and we are happy with it.</li>
            <li>They come with different colored rings you snap on so each person can identify their own brush.</li>
            <li>Considering the chocolates in the stocking, its a useful gift.</li>
            <li>Have been using this for more than a year after by old electronic toothbrush stopped charging.  </li>
            <li>I am used to bigger toothbrushes from when I used to buy the disposable, non-electric kind.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are genuine Sonicare heads, and I highly recommend the frustration-free packaging.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy with the performance it gives as I have very little to no tartar and plaque buildup on my dental checkups.</li>
            <li>They work great for me as I usually switch them out every two months anyway to maximize effectiveness.</li>
            <li>Individual wrapped brush heads are nice but it seemed a bit much to put them in a box in order to put it in a shipping box</li>
            <li>Anyhow, I kicked my rating up to 4 stars since the product is good, but cannot fully &#x27;5-star&#x27; rate this product because the packaging leaves you with less than desired storage of brush</li>
            <li>My last checkup was very brief as the hygienist noted that my Sonicare was keeping my mouth, teeth and gums in great shape.  </li>
            <li>I like the frustration free packaging I have seen for many other products, but in this case Amazon missed the mark...</li>
            <li>This was exactly what we needed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Sonicare since they first came out.  </li>
            <li>Purchased as exact replacement.</li>
            <li>I suppose you could only be sure buying through the Philips website or a brick and mortar store.</li>
            <li>Every time it delivers around $1 higher in price.</li>
            <li>Within two weeks, the first one was almost ruined already.  </li>
            <li>Fits the soniccare just like the higher priced fancy boxed units.</li>
            <li>So getting this box, which is super well designed and easy to open, makes replacing your sonicare heads a real pleasure.</li>
            <li>I will be buying the ones in the plastic shrink wrap to be sure to get the real thing next time</li>
            <li>Next time I will get the whole top and not just the brushes.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this seller, the product was exactly as described and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>But what really bugs me is the progressively higher price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure these are official products, but they work just as good as the brushes that came with my sonic care.  </li>
            <li>Good Amazon price, for the usual replacement head.</li>
            <li>so I wanted large replacements since both my husband and I use the Sonicare.</li>
            <li>Generic competition has already begun at about $1 each because there is too much margin priced into the genuine, I think.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t tried it, so cannot say too much about it.</li>
            <li>My teeth always feel so much cleaner</li>
            <li>This works very well.</li>
            <li>They were very concerning.</li>
            <li>Bought from Amazon and these are the real deal.</li>
            <li>The whole system is another story --</li>
            <li>The reason I do not give five star rating is that the brush wears out too fast for my liking.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than buying these at a drug store.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised, although these heads do feel a little more aggressive than the heads which came with our toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>Update - A couple of comments were left on my original review (below) stating I should not reduce the Star rating of this product because of the packaging, so I have updated my rating to 4-stars and provide this additional input.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to buy as long as they are available.</li>
            <li>Each brush is still enclosed in its own package but the three are bundled together in a small box.</li>
            <li>The packaging was more frustrating that the shell packs, which was ironic, as it was supposed to frustration free.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s like getting a whole new toothbrush again</li>
            <li>Price is high when compared to warehouse pricing for package of 5 factory replacement heads.</li>
            <li>But priced too high for a throw-away item.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend any product by Philips.</li>
            <li>Extremely high quality.</li>
            <li>#34;Dang, they are the knock-offs that all those folks were writing about.&amp;#34; HOWEVER, though they just a little different than my original brush, THEY WORK FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li>When previously purchased in retail packaging, I would use a brush and keep the others nicely stored in the retail packaging for future use.  </li>
            <li>Saved 5% and never have to be without new brush heads.</li>
            <li>These brush heads will function as spares for my new Sonicare</li>
            <li>I still don&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;t get when to change to a new one....</li>
            <li>The frustration free packaging doesn&#x27;t apply to the outside packaging that requires a bread knife and poultry shears to open it.</li>
            <li>but they are the EXACT same thing.  </li>
            <li>What Can I say, these are replacements for the original Sonicare brush head or extras for other family members.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used them, they felt different and lower quality.  </li>
            <li>These tooth brush heads arrived quickly and as expected.</li>
            <li>This is the same quality just in easy open packaging not the blister pack that you need a knife to open.</li>
            <li>Now I just wish I could recycle my old brush heads.</li>
            <li>They fit the same, but it was definitely different than the toothbrush head my product initially came with.</li>
            <li>like I&#x27;d just had my teeth professionally cleaned by a dental hygienist.</li>
            <li>Was worried that they might not fit my Sonicare Pro since I don&#x27;t know my model #, but they fit fine.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>definitely keep this seller as they are much cheaper than buying replacement heads from my dentist.</li>
            <li>These are good, but I guess I bought the wrong toothbrush heads for my Philips Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s just wonderful; however,  I hate buying the brush heads.  </li>
            <li>First class, as expected.  </li>
            <li>now I have them mixed up and cannot identify which is new and which is not......</li>
            <li>at least the original packaging had a professional appearance/presentation.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t look closely enough the last time I ordered and ended up bying the much cheaper generic toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li>I am not sure how this happened, but when I put the new head on my toothbrush the vibration felt much stronger!</li>
            <li>Not only do teeth feel cleaner - they apparently are.  </li>
            <li>Apparently these aren&#x27;t actually made by Sonicare?</li>
            <li>The brush heads have, in the past been very difficult to open, but I was offered an easy-open package this time which was wonderful, and is totally recyclable!</li>
            <li>I had to keep hold of the brush head with one finger while using it for the first few months, because otherwise it would fall off in the middle.</li>
            <li>These are not real sonicare brush heads, they are VERY soft.</li>
            <li>As long as you are not buying these brushes as a showpiece in your curio cabinet, this package gets you the same exact brushes for less money.</li>
            <li>These loose fitting replacements do not transmit the pulses resulting in poor performance.</li>

            <li> The box is nice now, frustration free packaging.</li>
            <li> The Philips Sonic care does do a much better job.</li>
            <li> and I LOVE it.  </li>
            <li> I love the results of using it faithfully.  </li>
            <li> I was able to find them cheaper at the warehouse club</li>
            <li> When I brush my teeth, I love how my teeth feel afterwards.</li>
            <li> Make sure you get these with Phillips on the shaft.</li>
            <li> New brushes feels great on teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li> They come in an easy packaging and my wife and I love the tooth brush.</li>
            <li> I love the Amazon Frustration Free Packaging!&lt;br /&gt;Set</li>
            <li> And most don&#x27;t fit on the power pack holder</li>
            <li> I love my Sonicare, and ordering heads every so often is just part of keeping your teeth so superhumanly clean.</li>
            <li> Subscription service is an easy way to save money and you control when they arrive.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Original Review with 2-star rating - The brush heads are perfect...exactly the same as what comes with the original toothbrush, and the price is very good on Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li> The Amazon discount is not as great as with many other products, but after looking in many places, one realizes that Sonicare replacement heads just aren&#x27;t cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Arrived fine.</li>
            <li> This kind of teeth brush is better than the normal.</li>
            <li> The brush heads are needed for the electric toothbrush I purchased and it works fine.  </li>
            <li> Yes thy just fit</li>
            <li> The Philips Sonicare HX6013 Proresults Brush Head, Standard, 3 Pack from Philips Sonicare are great brush heads.  </li>
            <li> ; connector because its makes the toothbrush easy to clean and maintain.  </li>
            <li> Great toothbrush with lots of options and much smaller than the one it replaces</li>
            <li> I prefer these bristles and hope they continue to be available.</li>
            <li> These Brush Heads fit my Phillips Sonicare HX6972/30</li>
            <li> fit.  </li>
            <li> They fit the brush and they work.</li>
            <li> Both my husband and I have seen improvement in our gums and teeth and this is confirmed on our twice a year trips to the dentist.</li>
            <li> The fast shipment was nice as always.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice anything that made me think that, but they definitely don&#x27;t fit as well as I hoped.</li>
            <li> The brush head bristles fit the contours of your teeth.  </li>
            <li> wife says she has a smaller mouth and these work great anyway.</li>
            <li> no annoying plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li> Fantastic heads.  </li>
            <li> Since these are the original brush heads there can be no better reccommendation than that they work perfectly.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads are identical to the original one that was packaged with my Sonicare brush.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of hard to go into great detail about these.</li>
            <li> My teeth are clean.</li>
            <li> Same good product to replace original brushes.</li>
            <li> Fits perfectly fine on my pro results sonicare toothbrush, and everything price is right.</li>
            <li> Such a good idea that I enrolled in Auto ship.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t fit quite right</li>
            <li> Also, they wear out way too quickly.</li>
            <li> However, they do give good results so I will continue to buy them as long as I have my Sonicare.</li>
            <li> have all tried many many different toothbrushes/heads, and when you find the right one you stick with</li>
            <li> As for these replacement heads, they are exactly like what you get originally with your Sonicare.</li>
            <li> First, there was no &#x27;frustration&#x27; with the original packaging, and</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!!</li>
            <li> My wife and I have been using this product for a few years and we are happy with it.</li>
            <li> They come with different colored rings you snap on so each person can identify their own brush.</li>
            <li> Considering the chocolates in the stocking, its a useful gift.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for more than a year after by old electronic toothbrush stopped charging.  </li>
            <li> I am used to bigger toothbrushes from when I used to buy the disposable, non-electric kind.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are genuine Sonicare heads, and I highly recommend the frustration-free packaging.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with the performance it gives as I have very little to no tartar and plaque buildup on my dental checkups.</li>
            <li> They work great for me as I usually switch them out every two months anyway to maximize effectiveness.</li>
            <li> Individual wrapped brush heads are nice but it seemed a bit much to put them in a box in order to put it in a shipping box</li>
            <li> Anyhow, I kicked my rating up to 4 stars since the product is good, but cannot fully &#x27;5-star&#x27; rate this product because the packaging leaves you with less than desired storage of brush</li>
            <li> My last checkup was very brief as the hygienist noted that my Sonicare was keeping my mouth, teeth and gums in great shape.  </li>
            <li> I like the frustration free packaging I have seen for many other products, but in this case Amazon missed the mark...</li>
            <li> This was exactly what we needed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Sonicare since they first came out.  </li>
            <li> Purchased as exact replacement.</li>
            <li> I suppose you could only be sure buying through the Philips website or a brick and mortar store.</li>
            <li> Every time it delivers around $1 higher in price.</li>
            <li> Within two weeks, the first one was almost ruined already.  </li>
            <li> Fits the soniccare just like the higher priced fancy boxed units.</li>
            <li> So getting this box, which is super well designed and easy to open, makes replacing your sonicare heads a real pleasure.</li>
            <li> I will be buying the ones in the plastic shrink wrap to be sure to get the real thing next time</li>
            <li> Next time I will get the whole top and not just the brushes.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this seller, the product was exactly as described and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> But what really bugs me is the progressively higher price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure these are official products, but they work just as good as the brushes that came with my sonic care.  </li>
            <li> Good Amazon price, for the usual replacement head.</li>
            <li> so I wanted large replacements since both my husband and I use the Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Generic competition has already begun at about $1 each because there is too much margin priced into the genuine, I think.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried it, so cannot say too much about it.</li>
            <li> My teeth always feel so much cleaner</li>
            <li> This works very well.</li>
            <li> They were very concerning.</li>
            <li> Bought from Amazon and these are the real deal.</li>
            <li> The whole system is another story --</li>
            <li> The reason I do not give five star rating is that the brush wears out too fast for my liking.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than buying these at a drug store.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised, although these heads do feel a little more aggressive than the heads which came with our toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> Update - A couple of comments were left on my original review (below) stating I should not reduce the Star rating of this product because of the packaging, so I have updated my rating to 4-stars and provide this additional input.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to buy as long as they are available.</li>
            <li> Each brush is still enclosed in its own package but the three are bundled together in a small box.</li>
            <li> The packaging was more frustrating that the shell packs, which was ironic, as it was supposed to frustration free.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s like getting a whole new toothbrush again</li>
            <li> Price is high when compared to warehouse pricing for package of 5 factory replacement heads.</li>
            <li> But priced too high for a throw-away item.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend any product by Philips.</li>
            <li> Extremely high quality.</li>
            <li> #34;Dang, they are the knock-offs that all those folks were writing about.&amp;#34; HOWEVER, though they just a little different than my original brush, THEY WORK FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li> When previously purchased in retail packaging, I would use a brush and keep the others nicely stored in the retail packaging for future use.  </li>
            <li> Saved 5% and never have to be without new brush heads.</li>
            <li> These brush heads will function as spares for my new Sonicare</li>
            <li> I still don&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;t get when to change to a new one....</li>
            <li> The frustration free packaging doesn&#x27;t apply to the outside packaging that requires a bread knife and poultry shears to open it.</li>
            <li> but they are the EXACT same thing.  </li>
            <li> What Can I say, these are replacements for the original Sonicare brush head or extras for other family members.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used them, they felt different and lower quality.  </li>
            <li> These tooth brush heads arrived quickly and as expected.</li>
            <li> This is the same quality just in easy open packaging not the blister pack that you need a knife to open.</li>
            <li> Now I just wish I could recycle my old brush heads.</li>
            <li> They fit the same, but it was definitely different than the toothbrush head my product initially came with.</li>
            <li> like I&#x27;d just had my teeth professionally cleaned by a dental hygienist.</li>
            <li> Was worried that they might not fit my Sonicare Pro since I don&#x27;t know my model #, but they fit fine.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> definitely keep this seller as they are much cheaper than buying replacement heads from my dentist.</li>
            <li> These are good, but I guess I bought the wrong toothbrush heads for my Philips Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just wonderful; however,  I hate buying the brush heads.  </li>
            <li> First class, as expected.  </li>
            <li> now I have them mixed up and cannot identify which is new and which is not......</li>
            <li> at least the original packaging had a professional appearance/presentation.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t look closely enough the last time I ordered and ended up bying the much cheaper generic toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how this happened, but when I put the new head on my toothbrush the vibration felt much stronger!</li>
            <li> Not only do teeth feel cleaner - they apparently are.  </li>
            <li> Apparently these aren&#x27;t actually made by Sonicare?</li>
            <li> The brush heads have, in the past been very difficult to open, but I was offered an easy-open package this time which was wonderful, and is totally recyclable!</li>
            <li> I had to keep hold of the brush head with one finger while using it for the first few months, because otherwise it would fall off in the middle.</li>
            <li> These are not real sonicare brush heads, they are VERY soft.</li>
            <li> As long as you are not buying these brushes as a showpiece in your curio cabinet, this package gets you the same exact brushes for less money.</li>
            <li> These loose fitting replacements do not transmit the pulses resulting in poor performance.</li>
            <li> I dropped a star because as most people note the brush doesn&#x27;t fit as snug to the base as other brushes.  </li>
            <li> brush itself is a little small for my liking, even though it was one of the biggest available.</li>
            <li> It can be really frustrating, especially when you are quickly trying to run out the door in the morning.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush head and am disappointed it has been replaced by the new diamond head type.</li>
            <li> Love that it doesn&#x27;t have so much impossible to open plastic like the regular Philips Sonicare brushes do.</li>
            <li> but this is pretty serious scamming for amazon...</li>
            <li> With my last purchase I am left with using one brush and having the other two exposed in a bathroom drawer.  </li>
            <li> We love the Philips Sonicare and we desperately needed to have brush replacements.  </li>
            <li> I spend twice as long brushing my teeth with the Sonicare.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rather irritating, especially since my wife thinks we must follow the instructions and switch exactly every 3 months.  </li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t had this product very long - and some reviews suggest that it may not have an extremely long lifetime  </li>
            <li> have used it several times and am extremely happy.&lt;br /&gt;Worth the money.</li>
            <li> These are just pieces of plastic no different than any other toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Very hard to install and remove due to hole&#x27;s incorrect size not being exact.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality, and not sure if these are cheap knockoffs or actually made by Phillips.  </li>
            <li> I take off one star only because I feel they are a little overpriced.</li>
            <li> These little brushes must only cost $.50 max to make but there is an 1000% mark up.</li>
            <li> Not a whole lot that you can say about these - they were packed well</li>
            <li> All is in order and they arrived quickly as expected.</li>
            <li> Not much to say about</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m only exaggerating a little!)</li>
            <li> Not sure if I can get my money back</li>
            <li> As other people have mentioned the packaging looks suspect.</li>
            <li> So, knock off or not, I&#x27;m glad they finally got here!</li>
            <li> Surprised she hasn&#x27;t complained sooner!</li>
            <li> It is so hard to cut open those plastic packages.  </li>
            <li> I share the actual Sonicare toothbrush with my boyfriend, and I find it hard to change between brush heads.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> This package costs less than the others because of the bulk packaging.</li>
            <li> The Amazon revised version is the few purchased parts thrown into a small brown box, and overly taped closed.  </li>
            <li> I was a little concerned when ordering these brushes as several reviews suggested that some customers received poor quality merchandise.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use them for anything since the travel case can&#x27;t hold the brush heads with the caps on - what a waste.</li>
            <li> They do not fit my flexcare + toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> The brush head keeps popping up after few seconds</li>
            <li> Makes my teeth feel like I just got a cleaning everyday.</li>
            <li> I change my brush head every few months.  </li>
            <li> Unlike any previous toothbrush that I&#x27;ve had!  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not easy to do.</li>
            <li> After a few months it works alright, so I&#x27;m not sure what</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the occasional rough plastic surface or loose bristles that I&#x27;ve encountered with a few defective brush heads over the years because it&#x27;s a annoying and a waste of money if you have to replace it sooner than expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and if that&#x27;s the case, this somewhat expensive indulgence will pay for itself if it only lasts a year!</li>
            <li> These are not authentic.</li>
            <li> It works perfectly as usually.</li>
            <li> There is a small gap between the bottom of the toothbrush head and the hand held part of the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My Sonicare came with a small replacement brush</li>
            <li> so I am not sure these are manufacturer.</li>
            <li> Bristles are all very stiff and wear indicator doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Although the brush heads are fine, the packaging does leave you without a clean/neat way to store the brushes until use, unless you want to keep them in the &#x27;nasty&#x27; box they were shipped in.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much less expensive than buying them at the drugstore.</li>
            <li> The fact that it took over a month for these to arrive was a little weird, and gave me time to read the reviews.</li>
            <li> However, the plastic clamshell packaging SUCKS!</li>
            <li> Cannot go wrong with \\&quot;Philips Sonicare brush head\\&quot; for the Philips Sonicare.</li>
            <li> They were so useless I had to throw them away.</li>
            <li> too expensive seeing how its just a brush, but it works as it should.</li>
            <li> These are questionable.</li>
            <li> 3 days before it&#x27;s worthless.</li>
            <li> Horrible replacement brushes.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Yes thy just fit and I had done Internet research but Amazon always comes through for me!</li>
            <li> We love the Philips Sonicare and we desperately needed to have brush replacements.  This was exactly what we needed.</li>
            <li> Excellent replacement product!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried it, so cannot say too much about it. however, it looks good. will update after trying it later.</li>
            <li> The Phillips brand is of superior quality.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it several times and am extremely happy.&lt;br /&gt;Worth the money.</li>
            <li> These brushes are just like the ones I&#x27;ve been buying in the store for years, just packaged differently. Better price too.</li>
            <li> What you see is what you get. Fits perfectly fine on my pro results sonicare toothbrush, and everything price is right. What more can you ask for??</li>
            <li> Quality OEM brush heads. I love the Amazon Frustration Free Packaging!&lt;br /&gt;Set these up on Subscribe &amp; Save. Saved 5% and never have to be without new brush heads.</li>
            <li> Love that it doesn&#x27;t have so much impossible to open plastic like the regular Philips Sonicare brushes do. Now I just wish I could recycle my old brush heads. Anyone??</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure these are official products, but they work just as good as the brushes that came with my sonic care.  I don&#x27;t notice a drop off in the cleaning effectiveness at all.  I dropped a star because as most people note the brush doesn&#x27;t fit as snug to the base as other brushes.  But they still work and last the same length of time.  They work great for me as I usually switch them out every two months anyway to maximize effectiveness.</li>
            <li> These were cheaper than buying them in the store or at my dentists office. I love the tooth brush. My teeth always feel so much cleaner and these brushes are simply the best.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of when it fades it has to be changed!</li>
            <li> This works very well. Cleans and stimulates the gums. Glad I bought this in the three pack,  as it saved me money.</li>
            <li> Sonicare makes great brushes.</li>
            <li> These were cheaper but they do not include possibility for color identifying ring!!! And most don&#x27;t fit on the power pack holder</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned when ordering these brushes as several reviews suggested that some customers received poor quality merchandise.  However, I&#x27;m happy to report that the brushes I received are of top quality and have been performing as well as the original brushes included with the Sonicare toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Sonicare since they first came out.  Best I&#x27;ve ever seen. Best part is, if used as directed, in most cases you can stop worrying about flossing, as the bristles push on the edge of the gum to clean below the gum line.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised, although these heads do feel a little more aggressive than the heads which came with our toothbrushes.  I can&#x27;t remember the exact version that came with the Costco package - these are great.</li>
            <li> Purchased as exact replacement. Appears to be Asian knockoff. Very hard to install and remove due to hole&#x27;s incorrect size not being exact. Package contains three pieces. Price is high when compared to warehouse pricing for package of 5 factory replacement heads. THE GADGETEER gadgetnewsandreviews.blogspot.com</li>
            <li> Unlike any previous toothbrush that I&#x27;ve had!  Not only do teeth feel cleaner - they apparently are.  I have a plaque problem - and at last week&#x27;s visit to my dental hygienist she asked what happened!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had this product very long - and some reviews suggest that it may not have an extremely long lifetime  For me, I may be able to reduce the frequency of my visit to my dental hygienst and if that&#x27;s the case, this somewhat expensive indulgence will pay for itself if it only lasts a year!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned my Philips Sonicare for about 3 years now. I&#x27;m really happy with the performance it gives as I have very little to no tartar and plaque buildup on my dental checkups. As for these replacement heads, they are exactly like what you get originally with your Sonicare. I take off one star only because I feel they are a little overpriced. The \\&quot;technology\\&quot; is in the handle of the Sonicare. These are just pieces of plastic no different than any other toothbrush. However, they do give good results so I will continue to buy them as long as I have my Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I ordered these heads for my sonicare toothbrush.  These heads are $40 at walmart.  The only difference is the packaging.  These don&#x27;t come with the fancy packaging but they are the EXACT same thing.  I will continue to buy as long as they are available.</li>
            <li> What Can I say, these are replacements for the original Sonicare brush head or extras for other family members.  They come with different colored rings you snap on so each person can identify their own brush.</li>
            <li> These brush heads will function as spares for my new Sonicare HX6731/02, I like to change the heads every 3 months or so, so now I have a supply on hand.</li>
            <li> Arrived fine. Same good product to replace original brushes. I just don&#x27;t like the plastic cap covers. I don&#x27;t use them for anything since the travel case can&#x27;t hold the brush heads with the caps on - what a waste.</li>
            <li> The Philips Sonicare HX6013 Proresults Brush Head, Standard, 3 Pack from Philips Sonicare are great brush heads.  This product is highly effective at cleaning and maintaining a happy healthy smile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the &amp;#34;Push on&amp;#34; connector because its makes the toothbrush easy to clean and maintain.  I don&#x27;t like the occasional rough plastic surface or loose bristles that I&#x27;ve encountered with a few defective brush heads over the years because it&#x27;s a annoying and a waste of money if you have to replace it sooner than expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product and a great value, each brush head will provide several months of use and preventative care for your teeth.  I also recommend the Philips Sonicare HX6014/30 Pro Results Brush Head, 4 Count from Philips Sonicare depending on price per unit.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product! My family and I are very pleased with the Sonicare toothbrush. I would recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> Individual wrapped brush heads are nice but it seemed a bit much to put them in a box in order to put it in a shipping box</li>
            <li> These are not authentic. They don&#x27;t fit quite right and they don&#x27;t last a week. Not worth it. I will be buying the ones in the plastic shrink wrap to be sure to get the real thing next time</li>
            <li> Sonicare has that name-brand pricing and razor-and-blade pricing model. This is probably the most cost-effective way to buy the &amp;#34;blades&amp;#34;.  Nice packaging, not too wasteful and no sealed plastic nonsense.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush with lots of options and much smaller than the one it replaces so it is easier to travel with.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush head and am disappointed it has been replaced by the new diamond head type. This is a great value and arrived very fast.  I prefer these bristles and hope they continue to be available.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how this happened, but when I put the new head on my toothbrush the vibration felt much stronger! I would recommend this seller, the product was exactly as described and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> These are not real sonicare brush heads, they are VERY soft. They wear out and fan out within 3 uses. Not sure if I can get my money back but this is pretty serious scamming for amazon...</li>
            <li> These parts must be knock-offs. They do not fit my flexcare + toothbrush. These loose fitting replacements do not transmit the pulses resulting in poor performance. Also, they wear out way too quickly. 3 days before it&#x27;s worthless. DO NOT BUY. I suppose you could only be sure buying through the Philips website or a brick and mortar store.</li>
            <li> First class, as expected.  But priced too high for a throw-away item.  Generic competition has already begun at about $1 each because there is too much margin priced into the genuine, I think.</li>
            <li> I will continue to by sonicare and it&#x27;s accessories.  I love this product and have been using it for decades!</li>
            <li> These Brush Heads fit my Phillips Sonicare HX6972/30 Flexicare Plus Tooth Brush perfectly. They make cleaning the teeth alot easier.</li>
            <li> Proresults is the only brush we use. But it&#x27;s like the Printer/Cartridge problem. These little brushes must only cost $.50 max to make but there is an 1000% mark up. It&#x27;s rather irritating, especially since my wife thinks we must follow the instructions and switch exactly every 3 months.  That&#x27;s $100 a year in brush heads, vs the $10 a year one might spend on manual brushes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this product. Next time I will get the whole top and not just the brushes. There&#x27;s no directions for replacing just this part and it&#x27;s not easy to do.</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Great head brush ,if you don&#x27;t have these  you better start stocking on them.</li>
            <li> These replacement brush heads worked great with my sonicare tooth brush.  They come in an easy packaging and my wife and I love the tooth brush.</li>
            <li> Brush heads are working well and I like the color inserts since we share the one handle and use the separate brushes in our family.&lt;br /&gt;Nice fit.  I would buy again.</li>
            <li> What can you say? It&#x27;s kind of hard to go into great detail about these. They fit the brush and they work. My teeth are clean. Yay!</li>
            <li> It is just good. This kind of teeth brush is better than the normal. I like the relatively smaller brush head.</li>
            <li> I have used the Sonicare for years and I love it.  The brush heads have, in the past been very difficult to open, but I was offered an easy-open package this time which was wonderful, and is totally recyclable!</li>
            <li> I have automatic delivery and I love it. Keeps me up to date for changing my brushes on time.</li>
            <li> These are good, but I guess I bought the wrong toothbrush heads for my Philips Sonicare toothbrush. They fit the same, but it was definitely different than the toothbrush head my product initially came with.</li>
            <li> great product, thanks!</li>
            <li> These are factory replacements for the Sonicare electronic toothbrush. This package costs less than the others because of the bulk packaging. Each brush is still enclosed in its own package but the three are bundled together in a small box. As long as you are not buying these brushes as a showpiece in your curio cabinet, this package gets you the same exact brushes for less money.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend any product by Philips. This product was recommended by my dentist. Both my husband and I have seen improvement in our gums and teeth and this is confirmed on our twice a year trips to the dentist. Cannot go wrong with \\&quot;Philips Sonicare brush head\\&quot; for the Philips Sonicare. You will be glad you join all of us that own this product.</li>
            <li> Update - A couple of comments were left on my original review (below) stating I should not reduce the Star rating of this product because of the packaging, so I have updated my rating to 4-stars and provide this additional input.  Although I concede that the star rating is more for the product, which is good, vice packaging, the fact remains that purchase of this product includes both aspects.  Although the brush heads are fine, the packaging does leave you without a clean/neat way to store the brushes until use, unless you want to keep them in the &#x27;nasty&#x27; box they were shipped in.  When previously purchased in retail packaging, I would use a brush and keep the others nicely stored in the retail packaging for future use.  With my last purchase I am left with using one brush and having the other two exposed in a bathroom drawer.  Anyhow, I kicked my rating up to 4 stars since the product is good, but cannot fully &#x27;5-star&#x27; rate this product because the packaging leaves you with less than desired storage of brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original Review with 2-star rating - The brush heads are perfect...exactly the same as what comes with the original toothbrush, and the price is very good on Amazon.com.  However, Amazon&#x27;s frustration free packaging in this case is quite poor.  First, there was no &#x27;frustration&#x27; with the original packaging, and at least the original packaging had a professional appearance/presentation.  The Amazon revised version is the few purchased parts thrown into a small brown box, and overly taped closed.  I like the frustration free packaging I have seen for many other products, but in this case Amazon missed the mark...there was no advantage with the change.</li>
            <li> Horrible replacement brushes. The bristles fall out within weeks. Do not buy these knock offs.</li>
            <li> The fast shipment was nice as always.  But there were only two brush heads instead of the three in the pack.</li>
            <li> Apparently these aren&#x27;t actually made by Sonicare? I didn&#x27;t notice anything that made me think that, but they definitely don&#x27;t fit as well as I hoped. I had to keep hold of the brush head with one finger while using it for the first few months, because otherwise it would fall off in the middle. After a few months it works alright, so I&#x27;m not sure what changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do love this toothbrush though.</li>
            <li> Not a whole lot that you can say about these - they were packed well and they work like a charm!</li>
            <li> The brush head bristles fit the contours of your teeth.  After using this product once it felt like I&#x27;d just had my teeth professionally cleaned by a dental hygienist.</li>
            <li> I have used the Sonicare electronic toothbrush lines for over 5 years and love them.&lt;br /&gt;As the middle blue color on brush begins to fade you know it&#x27;s time to change.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend getting this here pack on Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe and save. Not only are the brush heads cheaper on Amazon ($22-$29) as opposed to retail ($27-$40), if you use subscribe and save the brushes are even cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;We have all tried many many different toothbrushes/heads, and when you find the right one you stick with it.&lt;br /&gt;The brand is tried and true and the brushes ate great. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I buy over 400 items a year from Amazon and always give an honest review in order to help those trying to make a purchase decision.&lt;br /&gt;This product rates 5 stars for use ability, construction and price.</li>
            <li> It works perfectly as usually. But what really bugs me is the progressively higher price. Every time it delivers around $1 higher in price.</li>
            <li> Purchased some time ago for my wife. Surprised she hasn&#x27;t complained sooner! Retaining clip doesn&#x27;t hold brush head on to toothbrush and she had to hold the brush in place. Bristles are all very stiff and wear indicator doesn&#x27;t work. Came back to write a review and found we&#x27;re not the only ones with difficulties. As other people have mentioned the packaging looks suspect. Knock offie Ink jet inserts etc</li>
            <li> These tooth brush heads arrived quickly and as expected. I would recommend them. They fit my Philips Sonicare toothbrush perfect. There is a small gap between the bottom of the toothbrush head and the hand held part of the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> These ARE NOT the same quality as what comes with your Sonicare Toothbrush.  The first time I used them, they felt different and lower quality.  Within two weeks, the first one was almost ruined already.  Bristles at the time are all fanned out and or laid over.  Very poor quality, and not sure if these are cheap knockoffs or actually made by Phillips.  Either way, won&#x27;t buy again.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> The fact that it took over a month for these to arrive was a little weird, and gave me time to read the reviews. They were very concerning. Then the brushes arrived. The packaging was more frustrating that the shell packs, which was ironic, as it was supposed to frustration free. Then the box did not have &amp;#34;Phillips Sonicare&amp;#34; printed on it, so I was thinking, &amp;#34;Dang, they are the knock-offs that all those folks were writing about.&amp;#34; HOWEVER, though they just a little different than my original brush, THEY WORK FANTASTIC. So, knock off or not, I&#x27;m glad they finally got here!</li>
            <li> Fits the soniccare just like the higher priced fancy boxed units. Buy these  and save money.</li>
            <li> This product contained FOUR brush heads.</li>
            <li> Good Amazon price, for the usual replacement head. I get them for our family for stocking stuffers. It prompts everyone to change their brush head. Considering the chocolates in the stocking, its a useful gift.</li>
            <li> Works like it should...I still don&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;t get when to change to a new one....now I have them mixed up and cannot identify which is new and which is not......geez.</li>
            <li> This is our second set of these heads.&lt;br /&gt;They work great every time.&lt;br /&gt;My wife says she has a smaller mouth and these work great anyway.</li>
            <li> My Sonicare came with a small replacement brush so I wanted large replacements since both my husband and I use the Sonicare. Very happy with my order and will order again when I need replacements.</li>
            <li> No complaints, item as described.  Priced lower than what I can find it for locally.</li>
            <li> This is a good way to buy brush heads. The Amazon discount is not as great as with many other products, but after looking in many places, one realizes that Sonicare replacement heads just aren&#x27;t cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are genuine Sonicare heads, and I highly recommend the frustration-free packaging.</li>
            <li> Bought from Amazon and these are the real deal. The color and bristles are holding up. They are the originals. The whole system is another story -- maybe it&#x27;s better brushing, maybe not. I spend twice as long brushing my teeth with the Sonicare. The best method is just to brush after every meal, and you don&#x27;t need to use toothpaste every time. Combined with flossing, you&#x27;re guaranteed no cavities.</li>
            <li> This is the same quality just in easy open packaging not the blister pack that you need a knife to open.</li>
            <li> This model is different from the one /60 that came with the tooth brush. The brush head keeps popping up after few seconds I brush my teeth. They are not compatible with the /90 model.</li>
            <li> The frustration free packaging doesn&#x27;t apply to the outside packaging that requires a bread knife and poultry shears to open it.</li>
            <li> Works and is a better price than I could find even at Costco.  I LOVE THE PHILLIPS SONICARE!  Makes my teeth feel like I just got a cleaning everyday.</li>
            <li> Just like the product you would buy in the store but at a much better price!!  No reason to go anywhere else!</li>
            <li> Since these are the original brush heads there can be no better reccommendation than that they work perfectly. All is in order and they arrived quickly as expected.</li>
            <li> Not much to say about the brush head itself, its a brush head for your toothbrush.  It works.  The box is nice now, frustration free packaging.</li>
            <li> Philips sonicare is the best. Should have started using it years ago.  Will never go back to a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for more than a year after by old electronic toothbrush stopped charging.  The Philips Sonic care does do a much better job. The only draw back I find is the price for replacement brushes.</li>
            <li> Great product, easy packaging. Will be buying this again. The box isn&#x27;t fancy which is actually nice, no annoying plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit. 1/13/13.... I bought these for $13.11 4.5 months ago... and now they are over $35.00?!?!?! What&#x27;s going on here?!</li>
            <li> I love my Sonicare, and ordering heads every so often is just part of keeping your teeth so superhumanly clean. However, the plastic clamshell packaging SUCKS! So getting this box, which is super well designed and easy to open, makes replacing your sonicare heads a real pleasure. (I&#x27;m only exaggerating a little!)</li>
            <li> My wife and I have been using this product for a few years and we are happy with it. The reason I do not give five star rating is that the brush wears out too fast for my liking.</li>
            <li> Was worried that they might not fit my Sonicare Pro since I don&#x27;t know my model #, but they fit fine.&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely keep this seller as they are much cheaper than buying replacement heads from my dentist.</li>
            <li> Decades ago, my dentist recommended I use a Sonicare Toothbrush.  I am on my 3rd one and I LOVE it.  I love the results of using it faithfully.  The model I have uses these smaller brush heads and it&#x27;s just wonderful; however,  I hate buying the brush heads.  Why?  The packaging!  It is so hard to cut open those plastic packages.  I&#x27;ve even cut myself on the plastic trying to get to the brush heads.  Seeing these available on Amazon with the environmentally friendly no hassle packaging is just wonderful.  Such a good idea that I enrolled in Auto ship.  Thanks Amazon!!</li>
            <li> The brush heads are needed for the electric toothbrush I purchased and it works fine.  Good quality.  I was able to find them cheaper at the warehouse club so I will buy it there going forward - assuming they have it in stock.</li>
            <li> When I brush my teeth, I love how my teeth feel afterwards. Definitely feel like I just left the dentist&#x27;s chair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush itself is a little small for my liking, even though it was one of the biggest available. I am used to bigger toothbrushes from when I used to buy the disposable, non-electric kind. I share the actual Sonicare toothbrush with my boyfriend, and I find it hard to change between brush heads. It can be really frustrating, especially when you are quickly trying to run out the door in the morning.</li>
            <li> New brushes feels great on teeth and gums.  Subscription service is an easy way to save money and you control when they arrive.</li>
            <li> Amazon is the place to get refills for your Sonicare toothbrush. It&#x27;s much less expensive than buying them at the drugstore. It&#x27;s a good idea to replace the brush heads often. Each time you do it&#x27;s like getting a whole new toothbrush again and you can feel the difference.</li>
            <li> Just like the store bought ones. I can not tell any difference.</li>
            <li> OEM quality at low cost. Much cheaper than buying these at a drug store.</li>
            <li> fits on great. Works great. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t look closely enough the last time I ordered and ended up bying the much cheaper generic toothbrush heads. They were so useless I had to throw them away. Make sure you get these with Phillips on the shaft.</li>
            <li> Fantastic heads.  Extremely high quality. My last checkup was very brief as the hygienist noted that my Sonicare was keeping my mouth, teeth and gums in great shape.  Very pleased!!!</li>
            <li> too expensive seeing how its just a brush, but it works as it should.</li>
            <li> These are questionable. I get filaments in my teeth so I am not sure these are manufacturer. Have exchanged once.</li>
            <li> Great replacement brushes.</li>
            <li> I change my brush head every few months.  These replacement heads are identical to the original one that was packaged with my Sonicare brush.  I have no complaints.</li>
