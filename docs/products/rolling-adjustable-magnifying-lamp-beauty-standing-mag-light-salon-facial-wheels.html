            <li>I was asked three times for a more detailed explanation of the damage.  </li>
            <li>Each time I replied, they asked for a more detailed description.  </li>
            <li>Easy to assemble and transport.</li>
            <li>It was so easy to assemble.  </li>
            <li>The lamp came very quickly but the quality was not 100%.</li>
            <li>I tried to adjust the positioning and heard a popping sound</li>

            <li>hopefully it will last bright for some time</li>
            <li>Overall it was good.  </li>
            <li>I am impressed for such a low price.  </li>
            <li>It was affordable and arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>I received my order quickly.</li>
            <li>I would love to know where I could get a high quality mag lamp.  </li>
            <li>Very flimsy!!</li>
            <li>if light is too far over it tips easily.  </li>
            <li>So Far the light is fine, no issues whatsoever.</li>
            <li>&amp; if the light is lowered to much the whole light tips over</li>
            <li>The whole thing just feels really cheap.</li>
            <li>right well would of been but</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It took over a week to receive the replacement part, which was also damaged just as the first.  </li>
            <li>In fact she does it better than in the facial salon.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted, fast ship time</li>
            <li>At first everything was fine untill one day it broke while at work after having it for a very short time.</li>
            <li>Only 1 bolt to hold stand easy</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very steady.</li>
            <li>and I really see no difference in them.  </li>
            <li>At the same time I ordered this lamp, I ordered a free standing steamer from another company.  </li>
            <li>Product as described ...extremely fast delivery ...</li>
            <li>I really like it .</li>
            <li>Very affordable.</li>
            <li>My light broke last night..</li>
            <li>Received this product rusted and very flimsy</li>
            <li>but it was very easy to assemble and was ready for use in a few minutes.</li>
            <li>I expected much more distortion in the lens but was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>it was a present for a friend,what else you want to know?&lt;br /&gt;i do not have any more to said ,si this enough information ?</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be of high quality for the price</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend not buying this product or other products from here.</li>
            <li>I sent it right back.</li>
            <li>They did take it right back, though...</li>
            <li>The seller sent a new bulb and now it works.</li>
            <li>The new shipment came&lt;br /</li>
            <li>The light has a bluish tint, but I bet you can go to your local DIY and get a different bulb that isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>The second time the lamp became extremely hot, shut off.</li>
            <li>Their return policy should be clearly stated and it is not.  </li>
            <li>Welding broke and had to have it fixed.</li>
            <li>There was no light,  still burned of burning electricity and sound of over surging.</li>
            <li>just like my professional ones that i spend hundreds of dollars....</li>
            <li>Just spend the extra money and get yourself a decent lamp.</li>
            <li>Ours broke within 3 days of normal use in our facial room.</li>
            <li>I contacted the seller numerous times for a new one.  </li>
            <li>Finally, instead of sending me a new replacement or even a label</li>
            <li>Tends to tip over if u r not careful</li>
            <li>In addition, it&#x27;s top heavy making it extremely easy to tilt over (dangerous when working over someone&#x27;s face).</li>

            <li> Has to purchase new one in less than 3 months</li>
            <li> Expected a new product, looked like it might have been stored in a wet environment.</li>
            <li> Then after it is together - the top light part is just balancing and I&#x27;m afraid will fall on my client!!!</li>
            <li> Yes, there is some small amount of rust on the inside of the base legs, but I am sure this is made overseas, and since this will be in the house, it should be fine.  </li>
            <li> I thought this was new but not sure now.</li>
            <li> Not very steady , mine came in rusty</li>
            <li> Not a very sturdy product..</li>
            <li> Last is too heavy</li>
            <li> it is is very true.&lt;br /&gt;Cheap and poor design on the hinges.</li>
            <li> Packaged carefully arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Not very sturdy.</li>
            <li> I have started to use it for tattooing yet but it help me inspect the other items I received and it helped thankyou</li>
            <li> It had rust on it and other rust bubbles.</li>
            <li> After over a week of responding to their same request for additional information, I was told that they would have to put the item together to see if it was actually damaged (after I had met their demands for pictures for proof it was broken).  </li>
            <li> Putting this together with lack of good directions was bad!!</li>
            <li> magnifying lamp will not stay tightened and flops down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slightly unstable with the arm extended, but I&#x27;m not going to be yanking on it a lot or dragging it around.  </li>
            <li> Screws could be little tighter</li>
            <li> further inspection the magnifier was scratched from factory poor quality all around</li>
            <li> The wheels are NOT smooth.</li>
            <li> the stand on lt had 4 small tack welds which all broke on assembly.</li>
            <li> Just the absolute worst equipment you can possibly get.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not very bright.</li>
            <li> These lamps break in really weak areas that are unrepairable.</li>
            <li> Poorly made.</li>
            <li> However, the base of it and inside of the entire frame was rusty, a slimy film poured out of it when I took it from the box.</li>
            <li> I got the shipment came broken lamp and one of the rolling part, call them and they replace it.</li>
            <li> It broke at the base, had to screw back together and add some metal plates to reinforce it.</li>
            <li> I have a friend who has one of the really expensive version</li>
            <li> The stand has already broken.. not flexible at all!</li>
            <li> Failing eyesight made those projects very difficult.  </li>
            <li> It broke after 2 months. :(</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> The return process is awful and I still have an item that I received damaged, that does not work!!!</li>
            <li> Terrible balance item.</li>
            <li> These things are made horribly.</li>
            <li> Horrible quality..</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The item came dented and the lamp moves around while working in your client !!!</li>
            <li> Love love love this lamp. Awesome. Might buy 2 more.</li>
            <li> Flimsy. I do not recommend.</li>
            <li> Bought for my mother who has vision problems. Has helped a great deal.</li>
            <li> when it came it was kinda rusty, it went out once but then i have&#x27;nt had that happend since all in all it works great.</li>
            <li> Great Product! Easy to assemble and transport.</li>
            <li> I am impressed for such a low price.  I am low vision and have been using magnifiers for over 20 years.  I expected much more distortion in the lens but was pleasantly surprised.  Did it stink?  Yes, but that goes away.  Yes, there is some small amount of rust on the inside of the base legs, but I am sure this is made overseas, and since this will be in the house, it should be fine.  The light has a bluish tint, but I bet you can go to your local DIY and get a different bulb that isn&#x27;t. It was so easy to assemble.  It&#x27;s slightly unstable with the arm extended, but I&#x27;m not going to be yanking on it a lot or dragging it around.  If all of this bothers you, I can recommend a  Dazor, which cost me well over $500 for a floor lamp with a 5&amp;#34; lens but only 2.25 magnification.  I think it&#x27;s great lamp for the price.</li>
            <li> I like it! It is what I need. It is easy to assemble, to use, and it works great. It is easy to adjust, it has good light and I can move it wherever I want.</li>
            <li> These lamps break in really weak areas that are unrepairable. I have had multiple break.</li>
            <li> Screws could be little tighter</li>
            <li> This mag lamp is being used in our spa and met our expectations.  It was affordable and arrived quickly.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Good lamp works gets the job done I use it to see detail in tattoos when placing stencils on skin .</li>
            <li> Not a very sturdy product.. Welding broke and had to have it fixed. Pole doesn&#x27;t support lamp.. Last is too heavy</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for and with this product it is is very true.&lt;br /&gt;Cheap and poor design on the hinges. I tried to adjust the positioning and heard a popping sound and now it won&#x27;t adjust positions.</li>
            <li> Great and easy to assemble</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted, fast ship time</li>
            <li> The lamp I received looks different than the picture and it&#x27;s not very bright.</li>
            <li> Rolling Adjustable MAGNIFYING LAMP BEAUTY...good value for the money  looked at it at a &amp;#34;wholesale&amp;#34; place for professionals and it was almost 200 bucks.  great savings.</li>
            <li> purchased for the spa i work at and so far the light is very bright...hopefully it will last bright for some time</li>
            <li> I think (especially for the money) this is just perfect.  I have a friend who has one of the really expensive version and I really see no difference in them.  Tends to tip over if u r not careful but so does hers.  So Far the light is fine, no issues whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Looked good and undamaged when we opened the box easy assembly. Then the problem started. Only 1 bolt to hold stand easy right well would of been but the stand on lt had 4 small tack welds which all broke on assembly. further inspection the magnifier was scratched from factory poor quality all around</li>
            <li> The item was sent damaged.  I contacted the seller numerous times for a new one.  I was asked three times for a more detailed explanation of the damage.  Each time I replied, they asked for a more detailed description.  After over a week of responding to their same request for additional information, I was told that they would have to put the item together to see if it was actually damaged (after I had met their demands for pictures for proof it was broken).  Finally, instead of sending me a new replacement or even a label so I could return the item, they told me the fastest way to resolve my issue was for them to send a replacement part for the damaged part.  It took over a week to receive the replacement part, which was also damaged just as the first.  At the same time I ordered this lamp, I ordered a free standing steamer from another company.  The steamer has been great with no issues.  I will NEVER order from the seller of this lamp again.  Their return policy should be clearly stated and it is not.  The return process is awful and I still have an item that I received damaged, that does not work!!!</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my  aunt who is in assisted living.... she uses it for writing checks &amp; letters. Failing eyesight made those projects very difficult.  With the lamp....she can see everything clearer!</li>
            <li> for the price its okay.  if light is too far over it tips easily.  have to put weights on feet bar when doing pedicures.</li>
            <li> I used it twice. The second time the lamp became extremely hot, shut off. I lifted the lamp up and the inside blew up, a shattered and over surging noise and smelled of burnt electricity happened. I unplugged it, waited 2 hours, plugged it in and turned it on. There was no light,  still burned of burning electricity and sound of over surging. I would like to return it, I did not receive an invoice in the box.</li>
            <li> Unstable.  Arm with light does not stay up.</li>
            <li> FOR MONEY THIS PRODUCT WAS GOOD, EASY ASSEMBLY, WORKS GOOD, LETS SEE HOW IT HOLDS UP OVER TIME. KEEP U POSTED</li>
            <li> it was a present for a friend,what else you want to know?&lt;br /&gt;i do not have any more to said ,si this enough information ?i want to close this page</li>
            <li> Product as described ...extremely fast delivery ...</li>
            <li> It broke after 2 months. :(</li>
            <li> Came fast and great condition easy to put together</li>
            <li> This is a piece of junk. The material, the construct, the balance...it&#x27;s all junk. I sent it right back.They did take it right back, though...no arguments.</li>
            <li> The magnifying glass is foggy and the rest had rust patches.  Expected a new product, looked like it might have been stored in a wet environment.</li>
            <li> Terrible balance item. Falls over and hinges won&#x27;t adjust to stay!! I totally feel ripped off by this purchase. Has to purchase new one in less than 3 months</li>
            <li> I really like it . I have started to use it for tattooing yet but it help me inspect the other items I received and it helped thankyou</li>
            <li> magnifying lamp will not stay tightened and flops down. I have to hold it up to look through it. Poorly made. Would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> Light weight and functional</li>
            <li> My wife loves this lamp especially because she uses it on my daugther to do facials at home. In fact she does it better than in the facial salon.At the same time with this lamp you save money an time.Very affordable.</li>
            <li> Overall it was good.  The pole needs some type of clamp/bolt to hold it together better.</li>
            <li> Putting this together with lack of good directions was bad!! Then after it is together - the top light part is just balancing and I&#x27;m afraid will fall on my client!!! Needs better construction!!!!</li>
            <li> I used this lamp for work,affordable and serve the purpose that&#x27;s all it matters.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this again to replace,when I need another.</li>
            <li> I received my order quickly. However, the base of it and inside of the entire frame was rusty, a slimy film poured out of it when I took it from the box. It stinks.i emailed the company (the email address on the invoice) I also enclosed photos. I still have not heard from this. I strongly recommend not buying this product or other products from here. The lamp had to have been rusting away before it was even shipped!</li>
            <li> Not very steady , mine came in rusty it comes in 3 pieces very easy to assemble however it wobbles everywhere &amp; if the light is lowered to much the whole light tips over</li>
            <li> I ordered this to help my daughter do eye-lash extensions.  She was able to use it about 4 times before it died.  The seller sent a new bulb and now it works.</li>
            <li> At first everything was fine untill one day it broke while at work after having it for a very short time. You get what you pay for. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s happened to anyone else . I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be of high quality for the price but I did expect it to last longer than it did.</li>
            <li> Very flimsy!! The stand has already broken.. not flexible at all! Could not adjust the lamp without it popping out of the stand. Disappointed. Will def NOT recommend!</li>
            <li> This lamp was a really good buy. The price great! Still breaking it in but it was very easy to assemble and was ready for use in a few minutes. Packaged carefully arrived on time. Does the job. Magnification was pretty good.</li>
            <li> These things are made horribly. Ours broke within 3 days of normal use in our facial room. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product at all!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, the shine light is Perfect.</li>
            <li> Once again.. My light broke last night.. This is the 4th lamp I had from this company.. Horrible quality.. Just the absolute worst equipment you can possibly get.  Just choose this company..!</li>
            <li> The mag lamp is great but the stand came rusted underneath. I thought this was new but not sure now. I got what I paid for. Would not purchase from this company again.</li>
            <li> Amazing lamp...just like my professional ones that i spend hundreds of dollars....just had to change the magnification....A REAL GOOD BUY!!!</li>
            <li> The lamp came very quickly but the quality was not 100%. It had rust on it and other rust bubbles.</li>
            <li> Not very sturdy.Cord loosens and light flops.</li>
            <li> I got the shipment came broken lamp and one of the rolling part, call them and they replace it. The new shipment came&lt;br /&gt; A lot better light is very bright it&#x27;s very steady. Giving 5stars because of the customer service and product.</li>
            <li> It broke after a couple of months.  I would love to know where I could get a high quality mag lamp.  Any advice?</li>
            <li> It produces light, that&#x27;s about all this thing has going for it. The whole thing just feels really cheap. In addition, it&#x27;s top heavy making it extremely easy to tilt over (dangerous when working over someone&#x27;s face). The wheels are NOT smooth. Just spend the extra money and get yourself a decent lamp.</li>
            <li> It broke at the base, had to screw back together and add some metal plates to reinforce it.</li>
            <li> Received this product rusted and very flimsy</li>
            <li> The magnifying lamp works great and I love having it. Thanks for sending me a good product that works great.</li>
