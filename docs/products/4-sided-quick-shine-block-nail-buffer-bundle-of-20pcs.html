            <li>Very cheap</li>
            <li>Since I do my own nails now, this product is fine.  </li>
            <li>sure were a lot of them.  </li>
            <li>I seem to have so many snags in my fingernails</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad I ordered it through Amazon.</li>
            <li>The cheapest emery board at a dollar store is a better value.</li>
            <li>Quality is ok.</li>
            <li>But at the price - per- item it is still more affordable than beauty supply store buffers.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I would pay more than .75</li>
            <li>It made my nails feel more smooth</li>
            <li>The nail buffer does a great job of bringing natural shine to your nails.  </li>
            <li>Makes putting fresh polish on nice and removing it a breeze.</li>
            <li>but they scuff and wrinkle easily while I&#x27;m trying to buff my nails</li>
            <li>These are definitely cheap.</li>
            <li>So overall, I am happy with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>And will quickly make up for all manicure costs.  </li>
            <li>Easy to maintain-needs a quick going over by the &amp;#34;roots&amp;#34; as new fingernail grows in.&lt;br /&gt;Shiny nails that won&#x27;t be hurt by dishwashing or housework -</li>
            <li>This buffer is amazing and it will finally get me to focus, pay attention, stop chewing my nails from time to time.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>but they don&#x27;t tend to last for more than 5-7 uses.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>The foam block is much softer than others I&#x27;ve used, which seems to mean that you can get the block to more easily surround your nail...</li>
            <li>These worked very well for my nails and given the price, it was practically a steal.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t beat the amount you get and the quality was much better than I had expected.  </li>
            <li>no finding one&#x27;s nail polish chipped, looking shabby before that party, important meeting, big date, etc.</li>
            <li>These work really well.  </li>
            <li>really buffs out ridges and gets scrap nail polish off.  </li>
            <li>Wears out fast.</li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast and should be able to use each block for at least 3 or 4 uses.</li>
            <li>These work far better than expected for the price!  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re really cheap which is a huge perk for stocking stuffers &amp; whatnot, but the blocks themselves are pretty cheap and won&#x27;t last more than a few uses, unfortunately</li>
            <li>Lose effectiveness after a few uses, but they all do, and with how many come in this pack, you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>The difference is I can only buff my nails twice with this product before having to get a fresh one.</li>
            <li>The abrasive on these things is weaker than human nails are, so when you rub one against the other you take off more abrasive than nail.</li>
            <li>they are all soft!</li>
            <li>The cube doesn&#x27;t last as long as some I have bought in the past, but with 20 of them for a pretty low price, I&#x27;m happy..</li>
            <li>I no longer have professional manicures or pedicures because of a fungus infection.  </li>
            <li>I figure that this might be good for the nails in the long run, as you are unlikely to remove too much!  </li>
            <li>These work fine, just not as well as similar products I&#x27;ve used previously.</li>
            <li>You need a large package because each one last only one or two uses</li>
            <li>so I have no regrets about this purchase.</li>

            <li> Husband loves them for keeping his nails Buffed and mine while we watch TV.Wont need them for awhile because they last so long.</li>

            <li> The effectiveness of each side doesn&#x27;t last long</li>

            <li> These work as expected.  </li>
            <li> but I think other reviews said that as well.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think these are like other numbered, nail blocks where number one is a file and number 4 is the shiner and buffer and polisher in between.</li>
            <li> What a waste.</li>
            <li> No more, will I spend money for a  manicure.  </li>
            <li> These blocks are so cheap because they&#x27;re worthless, and they&#x27;re no less worthless just because you get 20 of them.</li>
            <li> but it also means you can&#x27;t quite push as hard.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s dumb.</li>
            <li> and they were frustrating to work with.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> For such a great price, these are really a good deal and work great!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price! Even my bf likes to buff his nails now</li>
            <li> Lose effectiveness after a few uses, but they all do, and with how many come in this pack, you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> After paying $2 a piece at the store for some name brand of similar style and getting maybe 5-7 uses out of them, this is a welcomed purchase. They work as well as the name brand I&#x27;ve been buying at the store. As long as they stay affordable, I&#x27;ll be using them.</li>
            <li> These work fine, just not as well as similar products I&#x27;ve used previously.</li>
            <li> Worked as good as pricier ones and they sent tons so I won&#x27;t have to buy these again for a long time.</li>
            <li> sure were a lot of them.  I seem to have so many snags in my fingernails so need these everywhere!</li>
            <li> These worked very well for my nails and given the price, it was practically a steal. Each individual block wont last as long as I would like but I estimate that I would get about 10 uses out each block before I have to throw them out so I have no regrets about this purchase.</li>
            <li> These work as well as the single pack you buy at WalMart, but the price can&#x27;t be beat for this pack!  I&#x27;m really glad I ordered it through Amazon.</li>
            <li> The abrasive on these things is weaker than human nails are, so when you rub one against the other you take off more abrasive than nail. That means one block is good for MAYBE one hand, one time. The cheapest emery board at a dollar store is a better value. I wish I could find a Trim buffing block like I got at a big-box store several years ago. That lasted for years and years and years. These blocks are so cheap because they&#x27;re worthless, and they&#x27;re no less worthless just because you get 20 of them. That&#x27;s dumb.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the amount you get and the quality was much better than I had expected.  Very glad I decided to try them!</li>
            <li> These work far better than expected for the price!  I must say I&#x27;m impressed, and will certainly be buying again!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re really cheap which is a huge perk for stocking stuffers &amp; whatnot, but the blocks themselves are pretty cheap and won&#x27;t last more than a few uses, unfortunately</li>
            <li> Very cheap but I think other reviews said that as well. You need a large package because each one last only one or two uses</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.  Does the job.</li>
            <li> Shiny nails with no smelly chemicals! No chipping! Easy to maintain-needs a quick going over by the &amp;#34;roots&amp;#34; as new fingernail grows in.&lt;br /&gt;Shiny nails that won&#x27;t be hurt by dishwashing or housework - no finding one&#x27;s nail polish chipped, looking shabby before that party, important meeting, big date, etc.</li>
            <li> Quality is ok. But they give you a lot of them.</li>
            <li> The shine achieved with this product is as good as the shine I achieved buying a $10.00 buffer from a beauty supply store.  The difference is I can only buff my nails twice with this product before having to get a fresh one. But at the price - per- item it is still more affordable than beauty supply store buffers.</li>
            <li> These work really well.  The foam block is much softer than others I&#x27;ve used, which seems to mean that you can get the block to more easily surround your nail...but it also means you can&#x27;t quite push as hard.  I figure that this might be good for the nails in the long run, as you are unlikely to remove too much!  They work well, and you can get an amazing shine from them...but they don&#x27;t tend to last for more than 5-7 uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, they are good.  They are great to tuck into gifts.  I see the price has increased since I purchased them.  I don&#x27;t think I would pay more than .75 each for them, so if it ever gets beyond $15 for the 20 pack, I&#x27;d look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> These are not, repeat not, files!!! I have NO idea why there are four sides to the block they are all soft! Don&#x27;t think these are like other numbered, nail blocks where number one is a file and number 4 is the shiner and buffer and polisher in between. Remember, this only a buffer with 4 levels of buffing-?why, who knows?</li>
            <li> This is a great buy! They work as well as the ones I have been buying and paying 5 each for.</li>
            <li> I used it a few times and it worked very well.  It made my nails feel more smooth and it gave them a shine.  Since I received 20 buffers, they will last me a very long time.  For the price, it was a very good deal.</li>
            <li> Husband loves them for keeping his nails Buffed and mine while we watch TV.Wont need them for awhile because they last so long.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised. Shipping was super fast and should be able to use each block for at least 3 or 4 uses.</li>
            <li> Used to by similar block from Sephora but they stopped selling them.  At the time I paid $8.00 for 3.  This is an amazing deal!!! I have given these to all my friends and they agree that they are amazing. Doing both hands, each block lasts me 3-4 manicures.</li>
            <li> perfect - great shine without using polish</li>
            <li> I no longer have professional manicures or pedicures because of a fungus infection.  Since I do my own nails now, this product is fine.  The cube doesn&#x27;t last as long as some I have bought in the past, but with 20 of them for a pretty low price, I&#x27;m happy..</li>
            <li> No more, will I spend money for a  manicure.  This buffer is amazing and it will finally get me to focus, pay attention, stop chewing my nails from time to time.  The buffer/shine, works amazingly well.  For the overall price, comes to about  $.60 each. the 20 item count will last a LONG time.  And will quickly make up for all manicure costs.  Can&#x27;t beat.</li>
            <li> Beats getting a manicure</li>
            <li> very nice buff.  I use it on my toes and my hands.  really buffs out ridges and gets scrap nail polish off.  Makes putting fresh polish on nice and removing it a breeze. I recommend using these.</li>
            <li> The nail buffer does a great job of bringing natural shine to your nails.  It&#x27;s a good price and I recommend!</li>
            <li> These work as expected.  The effectiveness of each side doesn&#x27;t last long but they get the job done.</li>
            <li> What a waste. All four sides are made out of the same material. Do not buy!!!</li>
            <li> Very disappointing. Wears out fast. Will buy other things in the future.</li>
            <li> These are definitely cheap. Got MAYBE two uses each but they scuff and wrinkle easily while I&#x27;m trying to buff my nails and they were frustrating to work with. I won&#x27;t be buying them again.</li>
            <li> These buffing blocks work only 1 or 2x on fingernails or toenails before losing their shine ability, But, they are still a lot of blocks for the price! So overall, I am happy with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this seller and item if you want blocks that work for a very low price.</li>
