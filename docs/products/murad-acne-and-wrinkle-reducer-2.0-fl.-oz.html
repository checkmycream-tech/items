            <li>All I can say is-- SIMPLY AMAZING!</li>
            <li>I got a sample of this product and really liked it!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen remarkable or noticeable improvements regarding wrinkles, though.</li>

            <li>Murad products are amazing.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>have tried a couple of popular creams and they just did not work.</li>
            <li>which is handy in my beauty routine.</li>
            <li>I thought to myself this is lonnnnng overdue in skincare (a product that addresses both wrinkles AND acne) because contrary to popular belief, there are women who exist</li>
            <li>but this one feels nice on my skin and doesn&#x27;t make me breakout.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always on the hunt for effective acne products...</li>
            <li>Strangers are complimenting my skin saying how nice it looks and my boyfriend can&#x27;t believe the difference.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it for the good results!</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant, light scent</li>
            <li>This product makes my skin look much better, and it seems to have reduced the pores on my nose - an added bonus, for sure!</li>
            <li>So far so great!  </li>
            <li>The fine lines and wrinkles around my eyes/forehead are disappearing!</li>
            <li>and I can tell a huge difference in my skin!</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I sell AVON so use mostly their products</li>
            <li>I love all the Murad Products and they don&#x27;t do animal testing.</li>
            <li>Send the wrinkles and zits packing :)  OH, and you save like $19 (no, that&#x27;s not a typo) by buying this product on Amazon versus Sephora, can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li>It is intended for your face, though I was able to find another use for it.</li>
            <li>I have even been able to skip my moisturizer in the morning.</li>
            <li>I should have looked at the ingredients more closely.</li>
            <li>I am not in love with this product.</li>
            <li>I love this and all Murad products.  </li>
            <li>and I thought I&#x27;d have better luck with it.  </li>
            <li>Not gone, but not as prominent.  </li>
            <li>After only 1 month have had excellent results.</li>
            <li>...have used this product for more than 15 years.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this serum.</li>
            <li>Love the Murad system.</li>
            <li>If it works for me, I believe it will work for most anyone.  </li>
            <li>This stuff works much better for me.</li>
            <li>It works ok, but still not a cure.</li>
            <li>I use this in tandem with Dr Lin wipes and those seem to work better than Dr Murad.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll update this review in a week or two to tell how my skin is doing. :-)</li>
            <li>This is the most helpful product I&#x27;ve used for acne.  </li>
            <li>I am 44 and love Murad products.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>It inspired me to buy more Murad face products.</li>
            <li>bought for my daughter, she loves it but can&#x27;t afford to by any more</li>
            <li>I seemed to break out even more with this product.</li>
            <li>I have suffered from acne for more than 8 years--</li>
            <li>I love that it addresses both blemishes and signs of aging.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I was so excited about it too because I liked the ingredients for anti-wrinkle in it.  </li>
            <li>My skin is in pretty good shape now</li>
            <li>Liked it but didn&#x27;t like the price I would have had to pay for the full size to replace it.</li>
            <li>Trust me, suffer through and be patient for about two weeks: it will be worth it!!</li>
            <li>This is worth every penny!!</li>
            <li>and you are able to control the amount that comes out of it easily.</li>
            <li>and I have very fair, ruddy, almost fragile skin...</li>
            <li>My sensitive skin can&#x27;t handle a lot of anti-aging products, but this works great.  </li>
            <li>Feels light and refreshing.</li>
            <li>for me this has smoothed my skin, looks flawless under makeup, and has softened the quickly forming lines dramatically, and made enough of a difference that even my boyfriend noticed...</li>
            <li>It dries very quickly</li>
            <li>it is easy to apply my powder based makeup over.  </li>
            <li>Received item as described and very quick.</li>
            <li>Strongly recommend.</li>
            <li>This stuff works better on my adult acne and redness better than anything ever has !</li>
            <li>I love this product and this whole line!!</li>
            <li>Huge pimples again.</li>
            <li>and my face feels really smooth.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>thank you amazon for making it available.</li>
            <li>Got a sample of this and had to get the big bottle, works great for my skin issues.</li>
            <li>Overall, great product.</li>
            <li>So far so good....</li>
            <li>Super light, creamy, non drying, non greasy.</li>
            <li>I love the whole Murad acne and wrinkle reducer line.</li>
            <li>One day I finally just tried it and loved everything about it.</li>
            <li>my boyfriend told me after a week of use (not knowing I was using anything different) that my skin looked \\&quot;really good and soft.\\</li>
            <li>Within the first 3 days of using this serum, my most stubborn acne-prone area (forehead) cleared up right away</li>
            <li>but this one is the best and quickest with no harsh side effects for acne, sensitive older skin.</li>
            <li>Your skin feels soft, smooth and has a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>but I was impressed with the low salicylic acid content and all the other goods in it to help the fine</li>
            <li>Amazing product that cleared my skin quickly and did NOT dry my skin at all.  </li>
            <li>Fast Shipping too!!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t bother sending back as will cost more!</li>
            <li>It is amazing as an acne RX for that occasional zit that pops up.  </li>
            <li>I put it on at night after washing with a gentle face wash and wake up with smooth, moisturized skin.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin clear without drying it out like products with more salicylic acid do.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s $5.00 a month - totally worth it.</li>
            <li>I love it so far.</li>
            <li>THE WORST;&lt;br /&gt;ANAPHYLAXIS â€” a rare, life-threatening allergic reaction.&lt;br /&gt;Anaphylaxis requires an immediate trip to the emergency department and an injection of epinephrine.</li>
            <li>The price tag is absolutely worth it for the quality of this product.</li>
            <li>Dries pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>Have almost finished the first bottle so quickly ordered another.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t cheap, but I&#x27;m willing to spend more to actually get results.</li>
            <li>I notice a difference right away.</li>
            <li>I am using it, I can&#x27;t see the difference right now, let&#x27;s see after 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>This works in  a great way for any small break-outs that I may have, whether it is from sun or from allergy to foods.  </li>
            <li>Break outs after 30 were not expected, love this product.</li>
            <li>It smells nice and doesn&#x27;t dry up my skin at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since switched to a mild cleanser and a good face mask once a week which has improved my skin much more than all of the fancy expensive products I tried before.</li>
            <li>And I think it helps with the wrinkles some, but I primarily use it to prevent adult acne.</li>
            <li>I first started using this product when I saw it in Sephora and snagged some samples.  </li>
            <li>and I love the texture, but my skin looks exactly the same as when I started using it.</li>
            <li>I was more prone to get pimples and this was a product that minimized my outbreaks, went on sheer and didn&#x27;t leave any greasy shine.</li>
            <li>This is the first treatment system that works for me - it dramatically reduced the breakout frequency and intensity.</li>
            <li>It is the first Murad product that I&#x27;ve ever bought</li>
            <li>because my back and chest much better also</li>
            <li>I think it the micro silver that makes it work since I learned most big pimples are staph and hospitals use silver cream to treat staph infections on the skin.</li>
            <li>Every morning I add a thin layer under my makeup and after a month of use the results have been incredible.</li>
            <li>I first tried this item in the $40 sample kit from Ulta.</li>
            <li>Found a much better price on Amazon so went back to Murad.</li>
            <li>so I am ready to apply moisturizer right away</li>
            <li>My face is far from 100% wrinkle free but the texture and the clarity are much improved.</li>
            <li>I purchasing a full size bottle today cuz for the first time in my adult life</li>
            <li>I began using this with the cleanser about a month ago and have noticed a positive difference.</li>
            <li>after reading hundreds of positive reviews, I decided to try this product.</li>
            <li>I do think it will be a good option if/when I notice small breakouts again.  </li>
            <li>I liked the product for the first few days.  </li>
            <li>Now my skin is almost perfect: just some little spots, no acne, lines are less than they were even before pregnancy.</li>
            <li>I do not notice a considerable difference in my mild to moderate acne or fine lines.</li>
            <li>50% smaller and fine lines are gone.</li>
            <li>originally, I received a sample and was impressed how long the tiny tube lasted because you need so little for complete coverage.  </li>
            <li>I will only use cruelty free products.</li>
            <li>OR they have to much oil-free lotiony stuff that makes my make-up look like a mudslide on my face by the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I REALLY bought a whole bottle in the end though...</li>
            <li>I am very acne-prone too</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t really noticed a ton of wrinkles vanishing as of yet</li>
            <li>Nothing else I have used has really ever worked this fast.</li>
            <li>Well, so much for Acne reducer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really concerned about)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used up almost the whole bottle</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really work well for me.</li>
            <li>The acne and blemishes aren&#x27;t entirely gone, but they ARE entirely smooth and flush with my skin now...</li>
            <li>After using this product for a month or two, I just don&#x27;t think it really did much to remedy the problem.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery</li>
            <li>Using this along with a good makeup remover, cleanser, exfoliator (every other day), and moisturizers has definitely helped to maintain my blemish-free skin.  </li>
            <li>I will be keeping this as part of my regimen for as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li>For the first time, I can see marked improvements.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it!  </li>
            <li>It contained SALICYLIC ACID which the main metabolite of ASPIRIN.</li>
            <li>I started having acne as I got older.  </li>
            <li>I bought it to help my menopausal acne mainly and to&lt;br /&gt;help</li>
            <li>My skin also is losing firmness as I get older.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>All the other products in this line are amazing but this is definitely the standout.</li>
            <li>I had absolutely NO expectations for this product as it was a free sample</li>
            <li>Using together with cleanser and adult acne much improved.</li>
            <li>Really helps clear up my skin.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t cured my acne and wrinkles completely, but it&#x27;s really helped reduce my acne</li>
            <li>I was disappointed after I read so many good reviews.</li>
            <li>This is everyday use most of the year.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m keeping it to use on rare occasions but it will not be a part of my daily skincare routine.</li>
            <li>All I got was more acne or clearing up that took weeks all the while having dry red skin.</li>
            <li>After 5-6 days of use, my skin started feeling thight, dry and was more fragile.  </li>
            <li>But the low percentage of salicylic acid in this cream/serum is just right for me.</li>
            <li>Proactiv, Origins, Aubrey Organics (which have a great line to help rosacea btw), Dead Sea Salt products, Mary Kay, Clinique, Arbonne, Juice Beauty just to name a few.  </li>
            <li>bought the product as I have mild breakouts on sensitive skin due to frequent hot yoga classes in spite of cleaning my face thoroughly before and after class.</li>
            <li>It leaves the skin very soft.  </li>
            <li>but this product helped to clear my skin!</li>
            <li>Greatest price I found, however I quit using it because I broke out like CRAZY!</li>
            <li>It is the only thing that keep my cystic outbreaks under control when used consistently.</li>
            <li>, I think you&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>When I first purchased it I used it for several days, thinking my skin just needed to get used to it.  </li>
            <li>Not sure why it was such a miracle for so many other people, but it sure wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li>I am in fifties,with hormonal issues,and so far this works!</li>
            <li>This line has made my skin feel clean and smooth without overdrying or irritating it.</li>
            <li>The problem with all of these is they either dry and burn my skin to a crisp because they use benzyl peroxide or ridiculously high amounts of salicylic acid</li>
            <li>I am completely addicted to using this every night - if I am not on top of ordering a replacement my skin tells me immediately!</li>
            <li>Does seem to clear up my acne</li>
            <li>I really think this product (along with several others) has helped clear my skin up.  </li>
            <li>Being 37 you want clear skin and no wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>and I can clearly see my wrinkles reduced.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel so soft</li>
            <li>At night I put the murad on and before I go to bed then put the old cream on my face to use it up.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and adult acne.</li>
            <li>I miss the old version.</li>
            <li>I have struggled with my skin since about 13, Ive been to dermatologists and tried just about everything I could get my hands on, and never achieved complete clearance.</li>
            <li>I am 55 years old, and have adult acne, and I think it does help.</li>
            <li>I knew I had developed an allergy to benzoyl peroxide</li>
            <li>Started using Murad 2xday and almost immediately, my chin cleared completely up.</li>
            <li>I use this product every day--it really works and I can definitely tell am improvement in my skin!</li>
            <li>It is also clearing up the acne on my chin and my skin is butter soft.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve only been using this Murad anti-aging acne system (time release cleanser, acne and wrinkle reducer serum, and SPF moisturizer for acne prone skin) for 3.5 days, but I really like it already.</li>
            <li>We are early forties, so we still have to fight pimples, but we want to keep our skin radiant as it ages.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had any adverse reactions with my sometimes sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It worked but was too drying to my 49 year old skin.</li>
            <li>Not a bad product, but not really worth the money.</li>
            <li>When I got the full size however it let me down.</li>
            <li>My skin still has breakouts but not nearly as bad &amp; honestly it would be better if I was consistent with eating clean/drinking tons of water, getting enough sleep (all things that are impossible during the crazy holidays) &amp; also having enough energy to take off any makeup that I wore that day &amp; use the cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream itself goes on smoothly &amp; doesn&#x27;t appear to dry my skin out as some products have done.</li>
            <li>Beware: when you start a new skin are regime, you&#x27;re likely to experience a purge of your pores, resulting in a breakout.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking that next month I&#x27;ll start trying to daily supplements in this line, but I want to see what the topical stuff does alone first.</li>
            <li>and I have to say that i have seen a major change in my skin.</li>
            <li>Very light, soaks in well and isn&#x27;t greasy or irritating.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive, dry skin with lots of small bumps and blackheads and the occasional pimple and have never been able to use spot treatments or full-on acne products because they would burn my skin.</li>
            <li>I used 10% at 1st and now use 20% vit C serum daily and Elta MD Clear spf 46 for acne and redness prone skin.</li>
            <li>I definitely think this product helps with adult acne around the mouth and hairline, without overdrying.  </li>
            <li>Have always had adult cystic acne &amp; this is the only product that works!!!!!!!  </li>
            <li>I would suggest this product to any one and bought the same line for my 16 year old daughter.</li>
            <li>My face is so soft and smooth and the few dark spots i had completely disappeeared.</li>
            <li>My color is so even, I am barely wearing any makeup now.</li>
            <li>but it clears up the skin without over drying it and dry skin does look older.</li>
            <li>Cetyl alcohol is listed in the top five ingredients, not great for acne.</li>
            <li>The seller suppressed my first review (copied below) with the following reason:&amp;#34;Reason for removal:&lt;br /&gt;Feedback submitted was a product review and not related to seller.&amp;#34; The point of these reviews is to inform other potential customers of the effectiveness of the product they are about to purchase, and the experience with this particular seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At first it got a little worse, but after two or so weeks it got much better and has stayed that way for 2 months.  </li>
            <li>It is much cheaper on Amazon than on other makeup stores web sites.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re having skin trouble, this could be worth a shot, it just didn&#x27;t work well enough for me for continued use.</li>
            <li>Plan on continuing with it since it works and does not dry my skin out.</li>
            <li>It cleared up my minor adult acne.</li>
            <li>Seems to really keep my acne down</li>

            <li> Murad products are amazing.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> have tried a couple of popular creams and they just did not work.</li>
            <li> which is handy in my beauty routine.</li>
            <li> I thought to myself this is lonnnnng overdue in skincare (a product that addresses both wrinkles AND acne) because contrary to popular belief, there are women who exist</li>
            <li> but this one feels nice on my skin and doesn&#x27;t make me breakout.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always on the hunt for effective acne products...</li>
            <li> Strangers are complimenting my skin saying how nice it looks and my boyfriend can&#x27;t believe the difference.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it for the good results!</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant, light scent</li>
            <li> This product makes my skin look much better, and it seems to have reduced the pores on my nose - an added bonus, for sure!</li>
            <li> So far so great!  </li>
            <li> The fine lines and wrinkles around my eyes/forehead are disappearing!</li>
            <li> and I can tell a huge difference in my skin!</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I sell AVON so use mostly their products</li>
            <li> I love all the Murad Products and they don&#x27;t do animal testing.</li>
            <li> Send the wrinkles and zits packing :)  OH, and you save like $19 (no, that&#x27;s not a typo) by buying this product on Amazon versus Sephora, can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> It is intended for your face, though I was able to find another use for it.</li>
            <li> I have even been able to skip my moisturizer in the morning.</li>
            <li> I should have looked at the ingredients more closely.</li>
            <li> I am not in love with this product.</li>
            <li> I love this and all Murad products.  </li>
            <li> and I thought I&#x27;d have better luck with it.  </li>
            <li> Not gone, but not as prominent.  </li>
            <li> After only 1 month have had excellent results.</li>
            <li> ...have used this product for more than 15 years.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this serum.</li>
            <li> Love the Murad system.</li>
            <li> If it works for me, I believe it will work for most anyone.  </li>
            <li> This stuff works much better for me.</li>
            <li> It works ok, but still not a cure.</li>
            <li> I use this in tandem with Dr Lin wipes and those seem to work better than Dr Murad.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update this review in a week or two to tell how my skin is doing. :-)</li>
            <li> This is the most helpful product I&#x27;ve used for acne.  </li>
            <li> I am 44 and love Murad products.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> It inspired me to buy more Murad face products.</li>
            <li> bought for my daughter, she loves it but can&#x27;t afford to by any more</li>
            <li> I seemed to break out even more with this product.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from acne for more than 8 years--</li>
            <li> I love that it addresses both blemishes and signs of aging.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I was so excited about it too because I liked the ingredients for anti-wrinkle in it.  </li>
            <li> My skin is in pretty good shape now</li>
            <li> Liked it but didn&#x27;t like the price I would have had to pay for the full size to replace it.</li>
            <li> Trust me, suffer through and be patient for about two weeks: it will be worth it!!</li>
            <li> This is worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> and you are able to control the amount that comes out of it easily.</li>
            <li> and I have very fair, ruddy, almost fragile skin...</li>
            <li> My sensitive skin can&#x27;t handle a lot of anti-aging products, but this works great.  </li>
            <li> Feels light and refreshing.</li>
            <li> for me this has smoothed my skin, looks flawless under makeup, and has softened the quickly forming lines dramatically, and made enough of a difference that even my boyfriend noticed...</li>
            <li> It dries very quickly</li>
            <li> it is easy to apply my powder based makeup over.  </li>
            <li> Received item as described and very quick.</li>
            <li> Strongly recommend.</li>
            <li> This stuff works better on my adult acne and redness better than anything ever has !</li>
            <li> I love this product and this whole line!!</li>
            <li> Huge pimples again.</li>
            <li> and my face feels really smooth.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> thank you amazon for making it available.</li>
            <li> Got a sample of this and had to get the big bottle, works great for my skin issues.</li>
            <li> Overall, great product.</li>
            <li> So far so good....</li>
            <li> Super light, creamy, non drying, non greasy.</li>
            <li> I love the whole Murad acne and wrinkle reducer line.</li>
            <li> One day I finally just tried it and loved everything about it.</li>
            <li> my boyfriend told me after a week of use (not knowing I was using anything different) that my skin looked \\&quot;really good and soft.\\</li>
            <li> Within the first 3 days of using this serum, my most stubborn acne-prone area (forehead) cleared up right away</li>
            <li> but this one is the best and quickest with no harsh side effects for acne, sensitive older skin.</li>
            <li> Your skin feels soft, smooth and has a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> but I was impressed with the low salicylic acid content and all the other goods in it to help the fine</li>
            <li> Amazing product that cleared my skin quickly and did NOT dry my skin at all.  </li>
            <li> Fast Shipping too!!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t bother sending back as will cost more!</li>
            <li> It is amazing as an acne RX for that occasional zit that pops up.  </li>
            <li> I put it on at night after washing with a gentle face wash and wake up with smooth, moisturized skin.</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin clear without drying it out like products with more salicylic acid do.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s $5.00 a month - totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I love it so far.</li>
            <li> THE WORST;&lt;br /&gt;ANAPHYLAXIS â€” a rare, life-threatening allergic reaction.&lt;br /&gt;Anaphylaxis requires an immediate trip to the emergency department and an injection of epinephrine.</li>
            <li> The price tag is absolutely worth it for the quality of this product.</li>
            <li> Dries pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Have almost finished the first bottle so quickly ordered another.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t cheap, but I&#x27;m willing to spend more to actually get results.</li>
            <li> I notice a difference right away.</li>
            <li> I am using it, I can&#x27;t see the difference right now, let&#x27;s see after 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> This works in  a great way for any small break-outs that I may have, whether it is from sun or from allergy to foods.  </li>
            <li> Break outs after 30 were not expected, love this product.</li>
            <li> It smells nice and doesn&#x27;t dry up my skin at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since switched to a mild cleanser and a good face mask once a week which has improved my skin much more than all of the fancy expensive products I tried before.</li>
            <li> And I think it helps with the wrinkles some, but I primarily use it to prevent adult acne.</li>
            <li> I first started using this product when I saw it in Sephora and snagged some samples.  </li>
            <li> and I love the texture, but my skin looks exactly the same as when I started using it.</li>
            <li> I was more prone to get pimples and this was a product that minimized my outbreaks, went on sheer and didn&#x27;t leave any greasy shine.</li>
            <li> This is the first treatment system that works for me - it dramatically reduced the breakout frequency and intensity.</li>
            <li> It is the first Murad product that I&#x27;ve ever bought</li>
            <li> because my back and chest much better also</li>
            <li> I think it the micro silver that makes it work since I learned most big pimples are staph and hospitals use silver cream to treat staph infections on the skin.</li>
            <li> Every morning I add a thin layer under my makeup and after a month of use the results have been incredible.</li>
            <li> I first tried this item in the $40 sample kit from Ulta.</li>
            <li> Found a much better price on Amazon so went back to Murad.</li>
            <li> so I am ready to apply moisturizer right away</li>
            <li> My face is far from 100% wrinkle free but the texture and the clarity are much improved.</li>
            <li> I purchasing a full size bottle today cuz for the first time in my adult life</li>
            <li> I began using this with the cleanser about a month ago and have noticed a positive difference.</li>
            <li> after reading hundreds of positive reviews, I decided to try this product.</li>
            <li> I do think it will be a good option if/when I notice small breakouts again.  </li>
            <li> I liked the product for the first few days.  </li>
            <li> Now my skin is almost perfect: just some little spots, no acne, lines are less than they were even before pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I do not notice a considerable difference in my mild to moderate acne or fine lines.</li>
            <li> 50% smaller and fine lines are gone.</li>
            <li> originally, I received a sample and was impressed how long the tiny tube lasted because you need so little for complete coverage.  </li>
            <li> I will only use cruelty free products.</li>
            <li> OR they have to much oil-free lotiony stuff that makes my make-up look like a mudslide on my face by the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I REALLY bought a whole bottle in the end though...</li>
            <li> I am very acne-prone too</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t really noticed a ton of wrinkles vanishing as of yet</li>
            <li> Nothing else I have used has really ever worked this fast.</li>
            <li> Well, so much for Acne reducer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really concerned about)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used up almost the whole bottle</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work well for me.</li>
            <li> The acne and blemishes aren&#x27;t entirely gone, but they ARE entirely smooth and flush with my skin now...</li>
            <li> After using this product for a month or two, I just don&#x27;t think it really did much to remedy the problem.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery</li>
            <li> Using this along with a good makeup remover, cleanser, exfoliator (every other day), and moisturizers has definitely helped to maintain my blemish-free skin.  </li>
            <li> I will be keeping this as part of my regimen for as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li> For the first time, I can see marked improvements.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it!  </li>
            <li> It contained SALICYLIC ACID which the main metabolite of ASPIRIN.</li>
            <li> I started having acne as I got older.  </li>
            <li> I bought it to help my menopausal acne mainly and to&lt;br /&gt;help</li>
            <li> My skin also is losing firmness as I get older.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> All the other products in this line are amazing but this is definitely the standout.</li>
            <li> I had absolutely NO expectations for this product as it was a free sample</li>
            <li> Using together with cleanser and adult acne much improved.</li>
            <li> Really helps clear up my skin.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t cured my acne and wrinkles completely, but it&#x27;s really helped reduce my acne</li>
            <li> I was disappointed after I read so many good reviews.</li>
            <li> This is everyday use most of the year.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m keeping it to use on rare occasions but it will not be a part of my daily skincare routine.</li>
            <li> All I got was more acne or clearing up that took weeks all the while having dry red skin.</li>
            <li> After 5-6 days of use, my skin started feeling thight, dry and was more fragile.  </li>
            <li> But the low percentage of salicylic acid in this cream/serum is just right for me.</li>
            <li> Proactiv, Origins, Aubrey Organics (which have a great line to help rosacea btw), Dead Sea Salt products, Mary Kay, Clinique, Arbonne, Juice Beauty just to name a few.  </li>
            <li> bought the product as I have mild breakouts on sensitive skin due to frequent hot yoga classes in spite of cleaning my face thoroughly before and after class.</li>
            <li> It leaves the skin very soft.  </li>
            <li> but this product helped to clear my skin!</li>
            <li> Greatest price I found, however I quit using it because I broke out like CRAZY!</li>
            <li> It is the only thing that keep my cystic outbreaks under control when used consistently.</li>
            <li> , I think you&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> When I first purchased it I used it for several days, thinking my skin just needed to get used to it.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why it was such a miracle for so many other people, but it sure wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> I am in fifties,with hormonal issues,and so far this works!</li>
            <li> This line has made my skin feel clean and smooth without overdrying or irritating it.</li>
            <li> The problem with all of these is they either dry and burn my skin to a crisp because they use benzyl peroxide or ridiculously high amounts of salicylic acid</li>
            <li> I am completely addicted to using this every night - if I am not on top of ordering a replacement my skin tells me immediately!</li>
            <li> Does seem to clear up my acne</li>
            <li> I really think this product (along with several others) has helped clear my skin up.  </li>
            <li> Being 37 you want clear skin and no wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> and I can clearly see my wrinkles reduced.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel so soft</li>
            <li> At night I put the murad on and before I go to bed then put the old cream on my face to use it up.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and adult acne.</li>
            <li> I miss the old version.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with my skin since about 13, Ive been to dermatologists and tried just about everything I could get my hands on, and never achieved complete clearance.</li>
            <li> I am 55 years old, and have adult acne, and I think it does help.</li>
            <li> I knew I had developed an allergy to benzoyl peroxide</li>
            <li> Started using Murad 2xday and almost immediately, my chin cleared completely up.</li>
            <li> I use this product every day--it really works and I can definitely tell am improvement in my skin!</li>
            <li> It is also clearing up the acne on my chin and my skin is butter soft.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve only been using this Murad anti-aging acne system (time release cleanser, acne and wrinkle reducer serum, and SPF moisturizer for acne prone skin) for 3.5 days, but I really like it already.</li>
            <li> We are early forties, so we still have to fight pimples, but we want to keep our skin radiant as it ages.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had any adverse reactions with my sometimes sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> It worked but was too drying to my 49 year old skin.</li>
            <li> Not a bad product, but not really worth the money.</li>
            <li> When I got the full size however it let me down.</li>
            <li> My skin still has breakouts but not nearly as bad &amp; honestly it would be better if I was consistent with eating clean/drinking tons of water, getting enough sleep (all things that are impossible during the crazy holidays) &amp; also having enough energy to take off any makeup that I wore that day &amp; use the cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream itself goes on smoothly &amp; doesn&#x27;t appear to dry my skin out as some products have done.</li>
            <li> Beware: when you start a new skin are regime, you&#x27;re likely to experience a purge of your pores, resulting in a breakout.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking that next month I&#x27;ll start trying to daily supplements in this line, but I want to see what the topical stuff does alone first.</li>
            <li> and I have to say that i have seen a major change in my skin.</li>
            <li> Very light, soaks in well and isn&#x27;t greasy or irritating.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive, dry skin with lots of small bumps and blackheads and the occasional pimple and have never been able to use spot treatments or full-on acne products because they would burn my skin.</li>
            <li> I used 10% at 1st and now use 20% vit C serum daily and Elta MD Clear spf 46 for acne and redness prone skin.</li>
            <li> I definitely think this product helps with adult acne around the mouth and hairline, without overdrying.  </li>
            <li> Have always had adult cystic acne &amp; this is the only product that works!!!!!!!  </li>
            <li> I would suggest this product to any one and bought the same line for my 16 year old daughter.</li>
            <li> My face is so soft and smooth and the few dark spots i had completely disappeeared.</li>
            <li> My color is so even, I am barely wearing any makeup now.</li>
            <li> but it clears up the skin without over drying it and dry skin does look older.</li>
            <li> Cetyl alcohol is listed in the top five ingredients, not great for acne.</li>
            <li> The seller suppressed my first review (copied below) with the following reason:&amp;#34;Reason for removal:&lt;br /&gt;Feedback submitted was a product review and not related to seller.&amp;#34; The point of these reviews is to inform other potential customers of the effectiveness of the product they are about to purchase, and the experience with this particular seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At first it got a little worse, but after two or so weeks it got much better and has stayed that way for 2 months.  </li>
            <li> It is much cheaper on Amazon than on other makeup stores web sites.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re having skin trouble, this could be worth a shot, it just didn&#x27;t work well enough for me for continued use.</li>
            <li> Plan on continuing with it since it works and does not dry my skin out.</li>
            <li> It cleared up my minor adult acne.</li>
            <li> Seems to really keep my acne down</li>
            <li> Not sure if any anti aging products really do a whole lot</li>
            <li> I spent the next several weeks squeezing every last drop out of it.</li>
            <li> Searched the web for something for adult breakouts and found that products created for teens are not good for older skin - but Murad is made for this purpose.</li>
            <li> I like the results that I am getting; Soft skin with less pimples.</li>
            <li> At a certain age, you may be plagued with acne and wrinkles at the same time (so not fair).  </li>
            <li> but it just does, give it a shot as long as you aren&#x27;t allergic to any of the ingredients</li>
            <li> I have no idea how this would work long term.  </li>
            <li> This review is long overdue.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a product line that fights acne and reduces wrinkles for a long time</li>
            <li> Reactions generally occur within a few hours of putting the cream on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 months &amp; have half of the bottle left.</li>
            <li> Layers well over other acne treatments - if you have other favorites or want to double up.</li>
            <li> Once I purchased the larger bottle I started to use it around my lips to reduce those pesky little lines and in between my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product at first, but I will probably continue to use this!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few months now and I am now on my second bottle.  </li>
            <li> When products worked a little I usually had new pimples by the time others were gone.</li>
            <li> I mean not get rid of it completely</li>
            <li> Since you need very little I can see it lasting a year.....</li>
            <li> I still want botox for the angry lines though ;)</li>
            <li> Women may find their acne clears up immensely, with the exception of small breakouts around their time of the month</li>
            <li> It can dry out skin a little bit</li>
            <li> It has made a huge difference on my bad skin.  </li>
            <li> And it also make my dark spots fade...</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> My skin is smoother and my breakouts have all but disappeared plus the dark spots look to be fading.</li>
            <li> but at least slow/shrink it down or help prevent future breakouts, it did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> It is slightly drying</li>
            <li> Lines are noticeably less visable.  </li>
            <li> seem to be less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s been a few weeks and less breakouts.  </li>
            <li> I can use it with any cleanser, moisturizer, toner and that one little product does all the work.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a little over a week</li>
            <li> Only reason I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it&#x27;s not fighting my tough hormonal pregnancy breakouts.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I am 49 (F) and started breaking out a few years ago.</li>
            <li> have even tried the Murad line for acne prone teens and it was WAY to harsh, just like the others...</li>
            <li> I might have found the missing link in skincare.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday to prevent.</li>
            <li> My skin dried out, itched, and burned.</li>
            <li> and I just rubbed it into my skin a few times.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t remember it being this way, but it felt heavy on my skin, made my pores feel congested and actually made my acne worse</li>
            <li> but if u increase the frequency of use gradually and use the right lotion with it, it isn&#x27;t too bad</li>
            <li> I had to review this product because it has made such a dramatic difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> And in very little time, you can see a softening of wrinkles and reduced breakouts - except when I&#x27;m preggers.</li>
            <li> It is expensive and I almost bought it on Amazon but decided to return some products that were so-so and had enough $ to buy this.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t usually have allot of breakouts.  </li>
            <li> I used to get small bumps on my forehead and since using this product they have not returned.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is Murad or my condition ))</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the typical products and facials, but they seem to make it worse.</li>
            <li> It was too hard on my skin.</li>
            <li> But hardly anything can.</li>
            <li> At least I would!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got this to use with the Acne Complex Kit.  </li>
            <li> I am now in my late sixties.  </li>
            <li> I have used it for a few years, it has made such a difference on my face, I no longer get the painful bumps.</li>
            <li> I mean EVERYTHING that has ever existed for acne.  </li>
            <li> I bought it on the second month when my face was awful as never before damaged with hard painful acne and fine lines.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve seen subtle results for my wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Sometimes very painful and large spots.  </li>
            <li> Despite some of the bad reviews I read, I went ahead and ordered this product with hopes that for me would be different.</li>
            <li> although I never had a really bad acne, I always suffered with some occasional break out stages.</li>
            <li> However, I was getting giant painful pimples, which I&#x27;ve never had before.  </li>
            <li> Those were his exact manly words...words that every woman would drop $49 on a bottle of face crap to hear!  </li>
            <li> My skin was worse after using it.</li>
            <li> I been using it and haven&#x27;t broken out</li>
            <li> I recommend for anyone who is in their mid 40&#x27;s and is still having that annoying acne break out...</li>
            <li> This made me break out a lot worse than I ever did.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not wanting to waste so much expensive product, I started to use it on my shoulderblades and arms where my skin has been breaking out bad lately.</li>
            <li> bought this product as a part of Murad Adult Acne Treatment which I have terrible reactions to.</li>
            <li> So completely frustrating!</li>
            <li> I tried products from drug stores, expensive department stores, pharmacies and had prescriptions for medications.</li>
            <li> which unfortunately will break out on my chin and jaw area if my hormones change even an ounce in my body (we are talking one instance of stress and BOOM...</li>
            <li> Its extremely frustrating when I want to help the effects of acne but also wrinkles which I am now getting!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sorry to say this has done nothing for my skin.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> Too expensive and did not provide results, promised.</li>
            <li> I went through a period where I was obsessed with skincare and trying tons of products in an attempt to fix my periodic breakouts.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this made me break out like crazy with cystic acne.</li>
            <li> I still get hormonal blemishes, but they aren&#x27;t nearly as bad as they used to.  </li>
            <li> it was NOT helping me at all :(</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> It was a horrible cycle.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Greatest price I found, however I quit using it because I broke out like CRAZY! it was NOT helping me at all :(</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is the only thing that keep my cystic outbreaks under control when used consistently.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel so soft</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few months now and I am now on my second bottle.  This product works good for acne.  It is much cheaper on Amazon than on other makeup stores web sites.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It keeps my skin clear without drying it out like products with more salicylic acid do. And I think it helps with the wrinkles some, but I primarily use it to prevent adult acne.</li>
            <li> Great product! I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have used it over a month and my skin is smoother. Use it twice a day. Sometimes my skin  feels irritated but not for long.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a couple of popular creams and they just did not work. At night I put the murad on and before I go to bed then put the old cream on my face to use it up. Oh yes... I use the Murad for wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin that is prone to breakouts. I notice a difference right away. I use it morning and night. It dries very quickly so I am ready to apply moisturizer right away which is handy in my beauty routine. It is slightly drying but I just use a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I love the whole Murad acne and wrinkle reducer line. I have sensitive skin and adult acne. I began using this with the cleanser about a month ago and have noticed a positive difference.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It does what it says and it feels good on the skin.  I only give it 4 stars because of the price, but over all I would get again.</li>
            <li> This does not help at all for acne and for controlling acne.  I was disappointed after I read so many good reviews.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It clears acne quicker than ANYTHING else I&#x27;ve tried. I am 49 (F) and started breaking out a few years ago. So completely frustrating! I tried products from drug stores, expensive department stores, pharmacies and had prescriptions for medications. All I got was more acne or clearing up that took weeks all the while having dry red skin. When products worked a little I usually had new pimples by the time others were gone. It was a horrible cycle. I got this free sample tube of Acne and Wrinkle Reducer but never tried it because I was not happy with Murad&#x27;s acne concealer stick. One day I finally just tried it and loved everything about it. I couldn&#x27;t believe it. I spent the next several weeks squeezing every last drop out of it. It is expensive and I almost bought it on Amazon but decided to return some products that were so-so and had enough $ to buy this. Since you need very little I can see it lasting a year.....that&#x27;s $5.00 a month - totally worth it. I can use it with any cleanser, moisturizer, toner and that one little product does all the work. I sell AVON so use mostly their products but this one is the best and quickest with no harsh side effects for acne, sensitive older skin.</li>
            <li> I love all the Murad Products and they don&#x27;t do animal testing. I will only use cruelty free products. I use several of the Murad lines depending on time of year and where I am. A week at the beach, the Vitamin C line is great! This is everyday use most of the year.</li>
            <li> I had received a sample from a friend who works at Saks.  It is amazing as an acne RX for that occasional zit that pops up.  Once I purchased the larger bottle I started to use it around my lips to reduce those pesky little lines and in between my eyebrows.  My face is far from 100% wrinkle free but the texture and the clarity are much improved.</li>
            <li> Ok. I miss the old version.</li>
            <li> I first started using this product when I saw it in Sephora and snagged some samples.  I thought to myself this is lonnnnng overdue in skincare (a product that addresses both wrinkles AND acne) because contrary to popular belief, there are women who exist that have both of those things!  I am 28 and I have very fair, ruddy, almost fragile skin...which unfortunately will break out on my chin and jaw area if my hormones change even an ounce in my body (we are talking one instance of stress and BOOM...zit).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried everything...I mean EVERYTHING that has ever existed for acne.  Proactiv, Origins, Aubrey Organics (which have a great line to help rosacea btw), Dead Sea Salt products, Mary Kay, Clinique, Arbonne, Juice Beauty just to name a few.  The problem with all of these is they either dry and burn my skin to a crisp because they use benzyl peroxide or ridiculously high amounts of salicylic acid OR they have to much oil-free lotiony stuff that makes my make-up look like a mudslide on my face by the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have even tried the Murad line for acne prone teens and it was WAY to harsh, just like the others...red face and skin peelies anyone?  So there was some hesitance to try this line again...but I was impressed with the low salicylic acid content and all the other goods in it to help the fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I REALLY bought a whole bottle in the end though...my boyfriend told me after a week of use (not knowing I was using anything different) that my skin looked \\&quot;really good and soft.\\&quot;  Those were his exact manly words...words that every woman would drop $49 on a bottle of face crap to hear!  At least I would!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line...for me this has smoothed my skin, looks flawless under makeup, and has softened the quickly forming lines dramatically, and made enough of a difference that even my boyfriend noticed...and if he noticed, EVERYONE must be noticing.  SOLD!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sidenote: If you can afford the face wash, getit...more power to you!  Send the wrinkles and zits packing :)  OH, and you save like $19 (no, that&#x27;s not a typo) by buying this product on Amazon versus Sephora, can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> I love it so far. I have been using it for a little over a week and I can tell a huge difference in my skin! I will continue to purchase!</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this product and really liked it! When I got the full size however it let me down. I didn&#x27;t remember it being this way, but it felt heavy on my skin, made my pores feel congested and actually made my acne worse I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not wanting to waste so much expensive product, I started to use it on my shoulderblades and arms where my skin has been breaking out bad lately. And wouldnt you know it?! It works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soooo, I gave this one star because it did not work for the intended purpose. It is intended for your face, though I was able to find another use for it.</li>
            <li> Love this product, makes my skin feel amazing!  Lines are noticeably less visable.  Murad products are amazing.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I might have found the missing link in skincare. This product has erased 80% of my blackheads and bumps after only 3 days of use. I have extremely sensitive, dry skin with lots of small bumps and blackheads and the occasional pimple and have never been able to use spot treatments or full-on acne products because they would burn my skin. But the low percentage of salicylic acid in this cream/serum is just right for me. I put it on at night after washing with a gentle face wash and wake up with smooth, moisturized skin. I have even been able to skip my moisturizer in the morning.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful.  My sensitive skin can&#x27;t handle a lot of anti-aging products, but this works great.  I am very acne-prone too so this treats both well at once.  It leaves the skin very soft.  The pump works well and you are able to control the amount that comes out of it easily.</li>
            <li> DO NOT USE THIS MURAD PRODUCT IF YOU ARE ALLERGIC TO ASPIRIN OR ANY OF ITS INGRIDIENTS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product as a part of Murad Adult Acne Treatment which I have terrible reactions to. It contained SALICYLIC ACID which the main metabolite of ASPIRIN. I only used it for a month. Reactions generally occur within a few hours of putting the cream on. The reaction includes;&lt;br /&gt;HIVES,&lt;br /&gt;ITCHY SKIN,&lt;br /&gt;SWELLING OF MY LIPS, MY TONGUE AND MY FACE,&lt;br /&gt;COUGHING, WHEEZING AND SHORTNESS OF BREATH&lt;br /&gt;AND THE WORST;&lt;br /&gt;ANAPHYLAXIS â€” a rare, life-threatening allergic reaction.&lt;br /&gt;Anaphylaxis requires an immediate trip to the emergency department and an injection of epinephrine. I was hospitilised 4 times in a month. Several blood samples and at the end doctors finally found why?? SALICYLIC ACID in the MURAD PRODUCTS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Murad should obliged to WARN CUSTOMERS WHO ARE ALLERGIC TO ASPIRIN SHOULD AVOID from this product line which ANY OF ITS INGRIDIENTS is SALICYLIC ACID.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT USE THIS MURAD PRODUCT IF YOU ARE ALLERGIC TO ASPIRIN OR ANY OF ITS INGRIDIENTS.</li>
            <li> Does seem to clear up my acne haven&#x27;t really noticed a ton of wrinkles vanishing as of yet</li>
            <li> I have struggled with my skin since about 13, Ive been to dermatologists and tried just about everything I could get my hands on, and never achieved complete clearance. This WORKS! I don&#x27;t know how or why but it just does, give it a shot as long as you aren&#x27;t allergic to any of the ingredients, I think you&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised! (I can&#x27;t attest to the wrinkle reducing claims, as that is not a concern for me at this time)</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this made me break out like crazy with cystic acne. My skin was worse after using it. I was so excited about it too because I liked the ingredients for anti-wrinkle in it.  I should have looked at the ingredients more closely. Cetyl alcohol is listed in the top five ingredients, not great for acne. This has always made me break out, I just cannot believe that they include it in an acne serum. UGH!</li>
            <li> Perfect! Fast Shipping too!!</li>
            <li> I have only had this for a week.  But it seems to be helping my acne.  I am 55 years old, and have adult acne, and I think it does help.</li>
            <li> Great product. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.  It arrived on time. I like the results that I am getting; Soft skin with less pimples.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s &amp; still break out from stress/hormones/pms like I&#x27;m 13! Its extremely frustrating when I want to help the effects of acne but also wrinkles which I am now getting! This helps both! I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 months &amp; have half of the bottle left. I use this with an acne/wrinkle face wash with my clarisonic brush head. My skin still has breakouts but not nearly as bad &amp; honestly it would be better if I was consistent with eating clean/drinking tons of water, getting enough sleep (all things that are impossible during the crazy holidays) &amp; also having enough energy to take off any makeup that I wore that day &amp; use the cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream itself goes on smoothly &amp; doesn&#x27;t appear to dry my skin out as some products have done. I still want botox for the angry lines though ;)</li>
            <li> I really think this product (along with several others) has helped clear my skin up.  I am in my 30s and I suffer from acne on my chin almost all the time.  Sometimes very painful and large spots.  I started using this during the day underneath my daily moisturizer.  If I am breaking out I use it both day and night.  Using this along with a good makeup remover, cleanser, exfoliator (every other day), and moisturizers has definitely helped to maintain my blemish-free skin.  I still get hormonal blemishes, but they aren&#x27;t nearly as bad as they used to.  I was skeptical about this product at first, but I will probably continue to use this!</li>
            <li> Within the first 3 days of using this serum, my most stubborn acne-prone area (forehead) cleared up right away and my face feels really smooth. Nothing else I have used has really ever worked this fast. It smells nice and doesn&#x27;t dry up my skin at all. I don&#x27;t know about the wrinkle reducer part of it as I don&#x27;t have wrinkles yet, but prevention never hurts!</li>
            <li> I used to get acne all the time but this product helped to clear my skin! I use it everyday to prevent. It can dry out skin a little bit but it&#x27;s worth it for the good results!</li>
            <li> It reduced my acne, and minized wrinkles</li>
            <li> I definitely think this product helps with adult acne around the mouth and hairline, without overdrying.  I would recommend this to anyone who is struggling in combination with Gaia vitex berry capsules.  Women may find their acne clears up immensely, with the exception of small breakouts around their time of the month</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly. Can&#x27;t wait to see results.</li>
            <li> It was too hard on my skin. My skin dried out, itched, and burned. Back to the drawing board. I knew I had developed an allergy to benzoyl peroxide but I guess I can&#x27;t use salicylic acid as well</li>
            <li> I am not in love with this product. I do not notice a considerable difference in my mild to moderate acne or fine lines. Not a bad product, but not really worth the money.</li>
            <li> This works in  a great way for any small break-outs that I may have, whether it is from sun or from allergy to foods.  It is a great product to be sure.</li>
            <li> I started having acne as I got older.  Nothing worked until I found this product.  I love this and all Murad products.  Strongly recommend.</li>
            <li> Well, so much for Acne reducer.  I have no idea how this would work long term.  When I first purchased it I used it for several days, thinking my skin just needed to get used to it.  However, I was getting giant painful pimples, which I&#x27;ve never had before.  So I quit using it.  Then a couple months later I decided to try it again thinking maybe it was just a fluke.  My skin is in pretty good shape now and I thought I&#x27;d have better luck with it.  Nope, one use was all it took.  Huge pimples again.</li>
            <li> I got this to use with the Acne Complex Kit.  I use the wrinkle reducer in the morning instead of their exfoliating gel which I use at night.  So far so great!  My skin feels great and the creases on my forehead (which is all I&#x27;m really concerned about) seem to be less noticeable.  Not gone, but not as prominent.  I would definitely suggest this product if you are looking for an aging and acne solution.</li>
            <li> No difference what so ever</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used up almost the whole bottle and I&#x27;m sorry to say this has done nothing for my skin. It has a pleasant, light scent and I love the texture, but my skin looks exactly the same as when I started using it. It didn&#x27;t help with my age spots or wrinkles or occasional acne. Not sure why it was such a miracle for so many other people, but it sure wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> Have always had adult cystic acne &amp; this is the only product that works!!!!!!!  After only 1 month have had excellent results.</li>
            <li> ...have used this product for more than 15 years.  originally, I received a sample and was impressed how long the tiny tube lasted because you need so little for complete coverage.  in my 30&#x27;s I was more prone to get pimples and this was a product that minimized my outbreaks, went on sheer and didn&#x27;t leave any greasy shine. it is easy to apply my powder based makeup over.  now, at 52, I still use it but not every day, maybe 3-4x per week. I do not use it around my eyes at all. every mural product that I&#x27;ve tried has been great and lived up to it&#x27;s name.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this serum. I have noticed a difference in the clarity of my skin. Feels light and refreshing. Dries pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> I got a sample for this with my Ulta order about 5 days ago, and starting yesterday morning, I woke up to clearer and softer skin. I had absolutely NO expectations for this product as it was a free sample and I just rubbed it into my skin a few times. I purchasing a full size bottle today cuz for the first time in my adult life (I am 34) I have NO blemishes. And it also make my dark spots fade...in 5 days. What?? Yep, sign me up for more of this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love the Murad system. Great service</li>
            <li> This product makes my skin look much better, and it seems to have reduced the pores on my nose - an added bonus, for sure!</li>
            <li> At 76 years of age, I began to get white heads on my chin. Searched the web for something for adult breakouts and found that products created for teens are not good for older skin - but Murad is made for this purpose. Started using Murad 2xday and almost immediately, my chin cleared completely up. Have almost finished the first bottle so quickly ordered another.  Won&#x27;t be without it..</li>
            <li> I use this product every day--it really works and I can definitely tell am improvement in my skin! The fine lines and wrinkles around my eyes/forehead are disappearing!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work well for me.</li>
            <li> I been using it and haven&#x27;t broken out but I don&#x27;t usually have allot of breakouts.  Where u can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s working is on the wrinkle reduction part.</li>
            <li> I bought it to help my menopausal acne mainly and to&lt;br /&gt;help soften my wrinkles around my eyes and mouth.&lt;br /&gt;My wrinkles have improved some, but my acne is still a&lt;br /&gt;problem, so I guess I&#x27;ll be paying a dermatologist a&lt;br /&gt;visit afterall.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting a miracle but some signs that this product was actually doing something. The wrinkle part I know takes time...but the acne I was hoping it would some how help. I mean not get rid of it completely but at least slow/shrink it down or help prevent future breakouts, it did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> Save $60. and buy Burts Bees for $13,  does same thing! Not impressed. Too expensive and did not provide results, promised. Still have acne where it was and have used for almost a month. Can&#x27;t bother sending back as will cost more! Never again.</li>
            <li> This product was ordered for my daughter.  She raves about it daily.  Says its the best product she ever uses and uses it twice a day cause it works so well.</li>
            <li> Life saver for over 40 skin!</li>
            <li> Using together with cleanser and adult acne much improved. Finally a product that works without overly drying.</li>
            <li> Amazing product that cleared my skin quickly and did NOT dry my skin at all.  Being 37 you want clear skin and no wrinkles.  This product delivers that for me.  I would suggest this product to any one and bought the same line for my 16 year old daughter.</li>
            <li> Murad should be called &amp;#34;Miraculous&amp;#34; because it is just that good! I&#x27;ve been using it about 8 weeks. I almost immediately saw an improvement in my skin.  I&#x27;ve had skin problems since I was a teenager.  I am now in my late sixties.  For the first time, I can see marked improvements.  White heads have stopped developing and my skin looks smoother.  If it works for me, I believe it will work for most anyone.  Try it!  You have nothing to lose but skin breakouts, etc. It&#x27;s a &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; for me.</li>
            <li> I was seeing a dermatologist for almost 10 years and using 3 different prescriptions. This stuff works much better for me. It isn&#x27;t cheap, but I&#x27;m willing to spend more to actually get results.</li>
            <li> I am using it, I can&#x27;t see the difference right now, let&#x27;s see after 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> The seller suppressed my first review (copied below) with the following reason:&amp;#34;Reason for removal:&lt;br /&gt;Feedback submitted was a product review and not related to seller.&amp;#34; The point of these reviews is to inform other potential customers of the effectiveness of the product they are about to purchase, and the experience with this particular seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original Feedback:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Your feedback comment:&lt;br /&gt;I bought the product as I have mild breakouts on sensitive skin due to frequent hot yoga classes in spite of cleaning my face thoroughly before and after class. It works ok, but still not a cure. I use this in tandem with Dr Lin wipes and those seem to work better than Dr Murad.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Not worth it. See a dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Best stuff out there!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing! I have only been using it a week and I can clearly see my wrinkles reduced. It is also clearing up the acne on my chin and my skin is butter soft. I am sold and will be a customer for life if this keeps up!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I am over 40, but still have only skin with occasional breakouts. My skin also is losing firmness as I get older. This stuff is a miracle - my skin looks better now than when I was 25!</li>
            <li> Use it every day morning and night.  Seems to really keep my acne down and I like that it has something for aging. Very light, soaks in well and isn&#x27;t greasy or irritating.</li>
            <li> it is the only product that has help with rosacea and aging at the same time.  thank you amazon for making it available.</li>
            <li> I love this product and this whole line!! It has made a huge difference on my bad skin.  I get complements on my skin now all the time.  I will continue using this product and the rest of the line!!</li>
            <li> Got a sample of this and had to get the big bottle, works great for my skin issues. Break outs after 30 were not expected, love this product.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve only been using this Murad anti-aging acne system (time release cleanser, acne and wrinkle reducer serum, and SPF moisturizer for acne prone skin) for 3.5 days, but I really like it already. I have hormonal cystic and under the skin acne that nothing works on. I&#x27;ve tried all the typical products and facials, but they seem to make it worse. This line has made my skin feel clean and smooth without overdrying or irritating it. The acne and blemishes aren&#x27;t entirely gone, but they ARE entirely smooth and flush with my skin now... no longer bumpy or inflamed. I&#x27;m hopeful that over the next 4 or 5 days the blemishes will fade away. I&#x27;m thinking that next month I&#x27;ll start trying to daily supplements in this line, but I want to see what the topical stuff does alone first. I&#x27;ll update this review in a week or two to tell how my skin is doing. :-)</li>
            <li> A friend of mine and I both use this product.  We are early forties, so we still have to fight pimples, but we want to keep our skin radiant as it ages.  I use it as part of my daily regimen.</li>
            <li> I went through a period where I was obsessed with skincare and trying tons of products in an attempt to fix my periodic breakouts. After using this product for a month or two, I just don&#x27;t think it really did much to remedy the problem. I&#x27;ve since switched to a mild cleanser and a good face mask once a week which has improved my skin much more than all of the fancy expensive products I tried before. If you&#x27;re having skin trouble, this could be worth a shot, it just didn&#x27;t work well enough for me for continued use.</li>
            <li> This is the most helpful product I&#x27;ve used for acne.  Really helps clear up my skin.</li>
            <li> I am 44 and love Murad products. I recommend for anyone who is in their mid 40&#x27;s and is still having that annoying acne break out...</li>
            <li> I never had a problem with acne when I was younger, but once I hit 40 I started getting hormonal acne.  This is the first treatment system that works for me - it dramatically reduced the breakout frequency and intensity. At first it got a little worse, but after two or so weeks it got much better and has stayed that way for 2 months.  I use this and the Time Release Acne Cleanser and Anti-aging Moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is the first Murad product that I&#x27;ve ever bought and I could feel a change in my skin after just a week. It inspired me to buy more Murad face products.</li>
            <li> This is perfect because every anti agony product has made me breakout. Not sure if any anti aging products really do a whole lot but this one feels nice on my skin and doesn&#x27;t make me breakout.</li>
            <li> I liked the product for the first few days.  My face had gotten in a cycle of breaking-out when I moved to a different climate.  After 5-6 days of use, my skin started feeling thight, dry and was more fragile.  I do think it will be a good option if/when I notice small breakouts again.  I&#x27;m keeping it to use on rare occasions but it will not be a part of my daily skincare routine.</li>
            <li> This review is long overdue. I have been using this product since July 2012 and I have to say that i have seen a major change in my skin. I used to get small bumps on my forehead and since using this product they have not returned. My face is so soft and smooth and the few dark spots i had completely disappeeared.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve become a Murad loyalist because of their anti-aging / acne-prone skin line, and this serum is a &#x27;must have&#x27; item for me.</li>
            <li> I chose this product based on the recommendation of a wonderful spa I visited. It works well and feels great on my skin.</li>
            <li> bought for my daughter, she loves it but can&#x27;t afford to by any more</li>
            <li> My skin has never looked so good! Completely delighted with all aspects of transaction: delivery, product, and results. Beware: when you start a new skin are regime, you&#x27;re likely to experience a purge of your pores, resulting in a breakout. Trust me, suffer through and be patient for about two weeks: it will be worth it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 4 days and it&#x27;s already made a difference.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I have found that works for me.  I thought it would be too drying thru the winter but no.  I am in fifties,with hormonal issues,and so far this works!</li>
            <li> Despite some of the bad reviews I read, I went ahead and ordered this product with hopes that for me would be different. Unfortunately I was wrong. This made me break out a lot worse than I ever did. I am 28 and although I never had a really bad acne, I always suffered with some occasional break out stages. I would buy neutrogena and olay any time over this product.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for me.  I will not use it again.  I seemed to break out even more with this product.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from acne for more than 8 years-- I have tried everything! I have finally controlled my breakouts, but now am dealing with enlarged pores and blackheads. I&#x27;m always on the hunt for effective acne products... after reading hundreds of positive reviews, I decided to try this product. All I can say is-- SIMPLY AMAZING! After just 2 days of use, my pores are 50% smaller and fine lines are gone. I can&#x27;t even imagine what my skin will look like in a week! My color is so even, I am barely wearing any makeup now. This is worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Murad products for years and this is one of my favorites.  I love that it addresses both blemishes and signs of aging. I&#x27;ve never had any adverse reactions with my sometimes sensitive skin.  I will be keeping this as part of my regimen for as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen improvements on the smaller acne bumps that would tend to be within the &amp;#34;T&amp;#34; zone. I haven&#x27;t seen remarkable or noticeable improvements regarding wrinkles, though.</li>
            <li> I have used it for a few years, it has made such a difference on my face, I no longer get the painful bumps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using murad products for almost 2 years haven&#x27;t come across any of the products that I don&#x27;t like. Fast delivery</li>
            <li> I am on my 5th month of pregnancy. I bought it on the second month when my face was awful as never before damaged with hard painful acne and fine lines. Now my skin is almost perfect: just some little spots, no acne, lines are less than they were even before pregnancy. However, the improvement just started 1-2 weeks ago. Not sure if it is Murad or my condition )) because my back and chest much better also and I do not use Murad there. But I am happy to look at mirror.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Only reason I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because it&#x27;s not fighting my tough hormonal pregnancy breakouts. But hardly anything can. Otherwise it is wonderful. Super light, creamy, non drying, non greasy. Layers well over other acne treatments - if you have other favorites or want to double up. Your skin feels soft, smooth and has a healthy glow. And in very little time, you can see a softening of wrinkles and reduced breakouts - except when I&#x27;m preggers. Oh well.</li>
            <li> This stuff works better on my adult acne and redness better than anything ever has ! I think it the micro silver that makes it work since I learned most big pimples are staph and hospitals use silver cream to treat staph infections on the skin. The probiotics also probably help since our skin uses them too. I used it with Clinique rosacea lotion at 1st to help with the redness. Does not however provide any anti-aging benefits but it clears up the skin without over drying it and dry skin does look older. May burn at 1st but if u increase the frequency of use gradually and use the right lotion with it, it isn&#x27;t too bad and it goes away. I add a vitamin C serum underneath for anti-aging. I used 10% at 1st and now use 20% vit C serum daily and Elta MD Clear spf 46 for acne and redness prone skin.</li>
            <li> Received item as described and very quick. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> So far so good....it&#x27;s been a few weeks and less breakouts.  I find that I have to use it only once at night because if used twice daily, my skin tends to peel a bit so once a day works for me.  Overall, great product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! It hasn&#x27;t cured my acne and wrinkles completely, but it&#x27;s really helped reduce my acne and I&#x27;ve seen subtle results for my wrinkles. I think it also helps to do a glycolic peel every couple of weeks while using this product daily.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it!  At a certain age, you may be plagued with acne and wrinkles at the same time (so not fair).  I am completely addicted to using this every night - if I am not on top of ordering a replacement my skin tells me immediately! Murad products across the board are the best.</li>
            <li> I had to review this product because it has made such a dramatic difference in my skin. I had been looking for a product line that fights acne and reduces wrinkles for a long time so thank you Murad! Every morning I add a thin layer under my makeup and after a month of use the results have been incredible. My skin is smoother and my breakouts have all but disappeared plus the dark spots look to be fading. I have been struggling with cystic acne for over 10 years and have tried EVERY product you can imagine. The price tag is absolutely worth it for the quality of this product. Strangers are complimenting my skin saying how nice it looks and my boyfriend can&#x27;t believe the difference. All the other products in this line are amazing but this is definitely the standout.</li>
            <li> I first tried this item in the $40 sample kit from Ulta. It cleared up my minor adult acne. Liked it but didn&#x27;t like the price I would have had to pay for the full size to replace it. So, I tried a Neutrogena brand. It worked but was too drying to my 49 year old skin. Found a much better price on Amazon so went back to Murad. Plan on continuing with it since it works and does not dry my skin out.</li>
