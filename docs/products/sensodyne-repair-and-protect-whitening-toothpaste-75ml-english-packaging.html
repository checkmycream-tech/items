    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This the best toothpaste on the market today.</li>
            <li>, perhaps the best thing for enamel anywhere.</li>
            <li>Our wonderful government office, the FDA will not approve NovaMin in the United State.</li>
            <li>In my opinion it&#x27;s not the best tasting toothpaste in the world</li>
            <li>Works great!</li>
            <li>This item was recommended to me by my dentist and it turns out to be one of the  best products on market.</li>
            <li>Excellent.</li>
            <li>Excellent toothpaste for improving tooth sensitivity and whitening</li>
            <li>The best thing I&#x27;ve ever found for dental sensitivity is novamine, and this has it.  </li>
            <li>Great!</li>
            <li>-sensitivity &#x3D; excellent, no sensitivity since the breakin period.    </li>
            <li>Recommendation: use crest 3d in mornings to whiten, novamin at night to maintain enamel &#x3D; best balance of price and performance.    </li>
            <li>Works great!!!</li>
            <li>Excellent product as described and used.  </li>
            <li>Good stuff!</li>
            <li>but this is good toothpaste as it is best for enamel.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for a week or two and haven&#x27;t experienced any pain or discomfort.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen reviews of this where people complain of pain, but I experienced none of that, and am on my 5th tube of it.</li>
            <li>(also greatly whitens your teeth and disinfects your mouth).</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li>Also something additional which is great; I have one tooth that has a receding gum line.</li>
            <li>I was really happy about this.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>This is a really great product.</li>
            <li>I know of, do it is great on my teeth</li>
            <li>Enjoy the taste; leaves teeth and mouth with an excellent feeling.</li>
            <li>Seven dollars and free shipping is the best deal on Amazon seeing that this product will save you and yours thousands of dollars in dental bills.  </li>
            <li>Novamin is the best mineral adjuvant technology available to date.  </li>
            <li>So good that the ADA lobbied to get it off the US</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s vastly superior to Dr. Collins formula in taste and mouth-feel.</li>
            <li>This product is superior.</li>
            <li>On time delivery and seller did a good job.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too good for the US.</li>
            <li>It worked fairly quickly fairly well.</li>
            <li>Good</li>
            <li>price for a toothpaste, but I&#x27;m more than happy to pay a premium for the benefit Novamin provides.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and the shipper has been great.</li>
            <li>It has a very refreshing mint taste that lasts for a while after brushing.</li>
            <li>I love this product and will continue using it!</li>
            <li>Gotta love science!</li>
            <li>Works nicely.</li>
            <li>I noticed the difference when I switched to another kind of tooth paste for a while</li>
            <li>kind of like an investment on my teeth.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s working or if my mouth healed on its own.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s some kind of miracle calcium/glass/silica formula that when it mixes with your saliva will penetrate your exposed dentin and form a layer of protection over and in the exposed dentin, in a sense remineralizing them.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say this toothpaste works.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You can do your own research and find out what the product does and how it works, and whether there may be any side effects.</li>
            <li>this toothpaste is the real deal, and great for your teeth!</li>
            <li>best toothpaste i have used so far.</li>
            <li>Regardless, 1450 ppm of fluoride is shown to be MORE effective than Novamin alone (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20546825) at preventing demineralization of teeth.</li>
            <li>After researching my options, I concluded that the Sensodyne product that contains Novamin is safe and effective</li>
            <li>Great stuff, I liked it so much</li>
            <li>I went ahead and bought more.</li>
            <li>Novamin seriously is better than the US version.  </li>
            <li>I just buy 10 at a time and stock up. :)</li>
            <li>Are they scientifically better?</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know, but do they feel better?</li>
            <li>This is my favorite toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I was glad to find the Sensodyne with Novamin.</li>
            <li>I sure wish that Sensodyne would sell the toothpaste with Novamin in the USA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Novamin has been found to make enamel stronger</li>
            <li>This toothpaste is amazing and unlike anything available on store shelves.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy again, but I will make sure I get the best price (which may not be Amazon)</li>
            <li>but I buy Sensodyne Repair from the UK because it is better with the fluoride.  </li>
            <li>My teeth are feeling better.  </li>
            <li>There is nothing better, even the dentist prescriptions don&#x27;t help.  </li>
            <li>I have had the product for about a month, maybe more.</li>
            <li>price to get it shipped from the UK is a bit steep, but I&#x27;m ordering more.</li>
            <li>I went to order more</li>
            <li>then Dr. Collins was and has a better mouth feel when you are using it.  </li>
            <li>it make anything magical happen to my teeth?</li>
            <li>Love this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>As many reviewers have already said, Novamin works!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>to many of usâ€¦</li>
            <li>love the price and toothpaste even better</li>
            <li>This is just toothpaste, you should be okay if you use it.</li>
            <li>This is just toothpaste, you should be okay if you use it.</li>
            <li>So I had to do a bit more work to find a source that wasn&#x27;t going to gouge me.</li>
            <li>NCBI, the most trusted source link is provided in the comment section.</li>
            <li>Idea: since this reacts with water: apply THEN moisten to keep most novamin on the teeth.    </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m hoping that it will strengthen my teeth and make them more resistant to decay.  </li>
            <li>Immediately, I felt even more protection.</li>
            <li>I love this item and will buy again.</li>
            <li>Of course she could also be resisting because of its superior cleaning power (I evidently can&#x27;t be trusted in this area).</li>
            <li>The mint taste is pretty good...</li>
            <li>This product has Novamin in it as well as fluoride which is nice anything to help protect my sensitive teeth is good.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s better than any of the US-sensitive-tooth formulas I&#x27;ve tried, but not quite as good as classic colgate mint flavor.</li>
            <li>use to be able to get Dr. Collins (fluoride free)</li>
            <li>Novamin is the most exciting thing to happen to toothpaste, well since, the invention of toothpaste!</li>
            <li>your teeth feeling incredibly clean and &#x27;protected&#x27; (for lack of a better word)&lt;br /&gt;-Quick</li>
            <li>Make sure its warm water so it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much.  </li>
            <li>There are no randomized controlled studies, so as with most health products, it may not be true.  </li>
            <li>fine</li>
            <li>Super satisfied</li>
            <li>/&gt;However if you don&#x27;t want to or can&#x27;t do that, don&#x27;t need prescription-strength toothpaste, or don&#x27;t want to risk being exposed to very high levels of fluoride, this product, apparently, combines both a higher-than-average level of fluoride (good) and Novamin (also good).</li>

            <li>I don&#x27;t take to writing this lightly, and took a &amp;#34;scientific&amp;#34; approach to testing this product out.  </li>
            <li>it may be time to switch to an SLS free toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>My teeth do feel smooth.</li>
            <li>Available with Novamin, as indicated.</li>
            <li>Wish it were easily available on this side of the pond.</li>
            <li>It has been speculated that FDA approval could not be had for \\&quot;repair\\&quot; toothpaste (despite the fact that the drugstore is filled with products that promise to \\&quot;restore\\&quot; your teeth).</li>
            <li>but I also learned that the makers were not making it available here in the U.S.</li>
            <li>You will also learn that GlaxoSmithKline, who owns the rights to Novamin, decided not to make it available in their toothpaste in the U.S.</li>
            <li>It works great and is the only stuff that helps me with tooth sensitivity.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It also came in very useful when I had toothache</li>
            <li>/&gt;The boxes are factory sealed (glued securely) and the tubes have the familiar foil seal.</li>
            <li>Higher ppm is even better</li>
            <li>NovaMin is a calcium sodium phosphosilicate dentifrice which reduces sensitivity significantly.</li>
            <li>It has a higher level of fluoride than most toothpastes, which is what my dentist recommended.  </li>
            <li>Very significant sensitivity and pain relief after first use.</li>
            <li>Absolutely astounding service, cannot possibly recommend them more.  </li>
            <li>I brought 3 different toothpastes for a trial run on seeing which would offer me the best protection for my sensitive teeth and dentin lost.</li>
            <li>Especially good for extra sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>I believe (I am neither a dentist or a materials scientist) that Novamin is more effective at -covering- exposed areas than fluoride, as it is deposited (in my understanding) as a bioglass particle which binds to teeth containing the ions necessary to form hydroxyapatite (which are then released at the tooth surface).</li>

            <li>Most certainly.</li>
            <li>Taste is nothing special, but it&#x27;s toothpaste, so who cares.  </li>
            <li>After using these for 6 months, I can tell you for sure that my teeth feel and are much stronger.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pricey toothpaste, but worth every penny in its restorative effects and benefits until it&#x27;s available here in the States.</li>
            <li>It appears that Novamin will simultaneously whiten teeth by causing fresh hydroxyapatite (the primary mineral in tooth enamel -</li>
            <li>It appears that Novamin will simultaneously whiten teeth by causing fresh hydroxyapatite (the primary mineral in tooth enamel -</li>
            <li>My teeth feel and look much brighter and a more pearl shine.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not bad either</li>
            <li>I have done a lot of reading about the properties of Novamin and came to the conclusion that it is worth the extra cash add to my arsenal of mouthwashes and floss picks to keep my teeth in good health.</li>
            <li>The product arrived quickly and in tact.  </li>
            <li>Item arrived quickly from overseas and has Novamin in it.</li>
            <li>and I do use the regular Sensodyne and really like it, it helps greatly.</li>
            <li>this tooth paste may cause some pain as it has a very strong mint, but if your teeth are not severely sensitive i would recommend this tooth paste to any one.</li>
            <li>: Sensitivity of too many teeth can be caused by high blood pressure, like 140/90.</li>
            <li>) Study by Nat inst of Health concluded NovaMin provided more substantial and significant improvements at the early time points, compared to potassium nitrate or stannous fluoride.</li>
            <li>On your very first time using this product you will feel the product building up on your teeth.  </li>
            <li>After using this toothpaste, my floss glided much more easily than normal and my teeth felt very smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Right product&lt;br /&gt;Arrived quickly from UK</li>
            <li>They also have a fresh breath version that may be better for super sensitive teeth as it doesn&#x27;t have whitening stuff.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very grateful for this product and for the retailer making it available to us here in the U.S.</li>
            <li>The amazing part is Amazon does not sell any toothpaste in US with S&amp;S since Amazon can not compete with big box stores.</li>
            <li>*are* whiter, which is a plus, but the sensitivity isn&#x27;t worth it.  </li>
            <li>It is a powerful irritant, and is a mouth culprit for pain, redness, and ulcers.  </li>
            <li>It took about a week to arrive, but it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li>I held the popsicle for a good minute or so with no real discomfort.</li>
            <li>i would make sure you buy the uk version from the seller direct cart as the us version does not contain novamin.</li>
            <li>That is, the particle creates a local covering of hydroxyapatite, as opposed to the fluoride which is kind of just floating around</li>
            <li>That is, the particle creates a local covering of hydroxyapatite, as opposed to the fluoride which is kind of just floating around</li>
            <li>I bought the non &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; fresh breath version because it is gentler on enamel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The British version of this product (containing Novamin) is a pleasant change from normal &amp;#34;sensitive teeth&amp;#34; toothpaste in the US.</li>
            <li>It worked pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>If that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for you&#x27;ve come to the right place.</li>
            <li>Can feel it working right away.  </li>
            <li>(I do wish GlaxoSmithKline would hurry up and payoff the right politician so the competition could come up with some milder</li>
            <li>I have noticed a positive difference since I&#x27;ve started using this product, and it does in fact contain NovaMin!</li>
            <li>This is far superior to the American release.  </li>
            <li>Regenerate Enamel Science Advanced Toothpaste is the new formula patented by Unilever which sells for more money with the same concept.</li>
            <li>Tooth was fine, so if I was in pain, I&#x27;d need a root canal or maybe some sensitive toothpaste.</li>
            <li>This has been my first week of using this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>At first I was reluctant to even try to do it, but I tried and to my amazement I had no pain, except for where I have a metal filling which made sense because the conductivity.</li>
            <li>I bought three more tubes last night from the UK.</li>
            <li>You should have been able to go to your local CVS and buy it</li>
            <li>The Repair and Protect is more solid</li>
            <li>Hurt my teeth at first</li>
            <li>This is the first time I tried NOVAMIN formula (which is Calcium-Sodium Phosphosilicate) &amp; I intend to continue using it.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Glaxosmithkline has no trouble overcharging for the US version, despite not containing any advanced bioglass technology.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical, but after three weeks of use, my sugar sensitivity is gone, and my hot/cold sensitivity is greatly reduced!</li>
            <li>immediately felt a noticeable difference on my teeth after the first use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using toothpaste with Novamin since it first came out</li>
            <li>I use to get it directly from the company that originally invented and produced it.  </li>
            <li>I brush and floss twice a day, so I am very aware of how my teeth normally feel after brushing.</li>
            <li>though apparently Novamin is available to dentist&#x27;s offices as part of a cleaning agent, just not to the &amp;#34;general public&amp;#34; anymore.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m bothered that it&#x27;s not available directly here in the US, so make sure you select a UK seller to make sure you get the correct product.  </li>
            <li>I was really nervous before I used it for the first time, because of these reviews.</li>
            <li>Let me make on thing real clear - to get the right product you have to order it from Europe or specifically the United Kingdom to get the NOVAMIN ingredient.</li>
            <li>I was surprised how quickly my order arrived.</li>
            <li>After using this, it&#x27;s made my teeth super sensitive.</li>
            <li>and my dentist recommended that I should rub a large amount of it into my tooth and gum whilst I was waiting for the antibiotics to kick in.</li>
            <li>Christmas Eve, I was eating a hershey kiss and about jumped out of my skin from the pain to a molar with a rather large filling.</li>
            <li>Another reviewer were absolutely correct in the &amp;#34;gritty&amp;#34; feeling afterwards, and the taste leaves a lot to be desired.</li>
            <li>really seems that the US government/industrial/system wants to stop availability of&lt;br /&gt;products</li>
            <li>This is the REAL stuff, with NovaMin.  </li>
            <li>It has taken about a month or so for me to realize the product is really working.</li>
            <li>that I have seen some real results.</li>
            <li>and this has REALLY helped with the sensitivity.</li>
            <li>It worked very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict:</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Do this for two to three minutes and it will really speed up the process.  </li>
            <li>I really like this toothpaste.</li>
            <li>If you have a real problem, go to the dentist and don&#x27;t try to self-treat any conditions with this stuff.ave</li>
            <li>If you have a real problem, go to the dentist and don&#x27;t try to self-treat any conditions with this stuff.</li>
            <li>And it seems to be widely available outside of the U.S.</li>
            <li>a real bummer GlaxoSmithKline bought the patent to Novamin</li>
            <li>The protective layer it creates is immediately noticeable and something like that will lose the multibillion dollar industry too much</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you so much for selling this from the UK.</li>
            <li>I think the gums around the teeth next to that tooth had been suffering for a while from inadequate brushing and now with more tooth exposed, were quite sensitive.  </li>
            <li>Look closely at the pictures of the product and be sure it says that it contains Novamin, and only purchase where other buyers have confirmed the Novamin.</li>
            <li>Look closely at the pictures of the product and be sure it says that it contains Novamin, and only purchase where other buyers have confirmed the Novamin.</li>
            <li>I was at a point where my teeth were extremely brittle due to tmj, but now they&#x27;re much stronger and the dentist says my teeth look great.</li>
            <li>hey, 7 bucks a tube is a small price to pay for being able to remineralize my teeth!</li>
            <li>The only thing I do not like about this product is that although I like mint the mint flavor in this product can be very intense but its still worth using.</li>
            <li>This will go a long way towards your goal of a pain free mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a white, sweet opaque paste.&lt;br /&gt;(3</li>
            <li>My hands were full and I also had a big popsicle I was eating.</li>
            <li>After a bit more than a week of use, my teeth have calmed down.  </li>
            <li>Other negative reviews surprised me as I had the best results I could have hoped for.</li>
            <li>I had no serious sensitivity issues, but I study materials engineering and understand how this stuff works on a molecular level, so I made the purchase;</li>
            <li>Per performance:  -taste &#x3D; meh, middle of the pack, certainly not as bad as the new colgates,  -foam &#x3D;</li>
            <li>If you brush twice, first time to get your saliva off the teeth, the second time seems to become more active.  </li>
            <li>Price aside, it&#x27;s a very soothing toothpaste for my sensitive gums.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste is very helpful for sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the extra cost.  </li>
            <li>I used to use the normal sensodyne acid protection that they sell here in the states, and while they helped with sensitivity they never helped rebuild my enamel.</li>
            <li>This is great toothpaste which I now have to order from Europe,  where they are better than us,  medically speaking,  because Big Pharma and a-hole dentists want to wring every last dime and dollar from poor Americans.  </li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li>I thought maybe I ate something to make my teeth more sensitive and it was just a fluke, but I tried again the next day and the pain immediately came back.  </li>
            <li>So far only a mild reduction in sensitivity.</li>
            <li>It is a little early to tell for sure whether it will reduce sensitivity as advertised.  </li>
            <li>I live in the USA and for some reason this Sensodyne with Novamin is not offered here.</li>
            <li>But, I bought this new Sensodyne and as soon as I started to brush my teeth</li>
            <li>So I saw this as a &#x27;new&#x27; Sensodyne formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The area of the tooth that was uncovered by gum was always very sensitive if i scratched it with my fingernail or anything.</li>
            <li>She has very sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>if you have very sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>Had very sensitive teeth and that feeling has subsided substantially.</li>
            <li>Compared to every US toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used the tube plastic feels paper-thin, and the screw-top doesn&#x27;t thread on very far.  </li>
            <li>so, if you have been using sensodyne as a crutch, there will be a period where pain comes back while the novamin does its dance, use the sensitivity paste first then the novamin,</li>
            <li>This is also relatively cheap ($7.98/tube shipped is not cheap, but it&#x27;s not ridiculous</li>
            <li>I will keep using the old Sensodyne, but this new stuff is heading for the trash can.</li>
            <li>It tastes much better than the usual &amp;#34;stannous fluoride&amp;#34; toothpaste sold for sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>So in a scramble to find a new sensitive toothpaste before I completely ran out I stumbled upon the UK version of Sensodynes Repair and Protect Whitening with Novamin.  </li>
            <li>and, ultimately, it was purely a business decision.</li>
            <li>Got this on Amazon because of the stupid FDA not allowing them to sell the Sensodyne with Novimin in the U.S., and have read wonderful things about it.  </li>
            <li>There has been a marked increase in teeth sensitivity over the 3 week period.</li>
            <li>Sodium Lauryl Sulfate is a foaming agent that&#x27;s used in all non natural or non sensitive  toothpastes.</li>
            <li>which actually help people (e.g. Novamin), and instead wants to make&lt;br /&gt;available</li>
            <li>While I can&#x27;t tell you if it is actually restoring or repairing my teeth and enamel, it absolutely helps with sensitivity.  </li>
            <li>I have not had any pain whatsoever associated with sensitive teeth since I started using this product.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t rinse my mouth fast enough.  </li>
            <li>(it was for sensitive teeth as well though).</li>
            <li>I never had sensitive teeth until I had a wisdom tooth removed as an adult.  </li>
            <li>I will not be continuing use of this product since it doesn&#x27;t provide sensitive teeth protection for me.</li>
            <li>No issues so far.  </li>
            <li>Some people are sensitive to fluoride, but I&#x27;m not and wanted to benefit from both fluoride and Novamin.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>I could not get this stuff off of my teeth fast enough.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth (some fillings &amp; crowns too) &amp; as soon as I used it</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t have the money for extras these days - I can&#x27;t even afford any medical or dental bills.</li>
            <li>I have used this for about a month and it still doesn&#x27;t seem to work for me, but maybe I just have too sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>No where it is claimed for sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s never been this sensitive in my life.</li>
            <li>I find that it works better when the toothpaste is applied directly to the sensitive spots for a few seconds prior to beginning to brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Original Sensodyne for years and it helps a little with tooth sensitivity.  </li>
            <li>, it just doesn&#x27;t leave my breath as fresh as other toothpastes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Also, it contains SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate) which maybe harsh for some people, specially those prone to canker</li>
            <li>/&gt;Novamin is available in very few toothpaste formulas in the U.S., I was purchasing  </li>
            <li>According to GSK the new enamel can last up to 28 days https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;x0uIt2XYXNM#t&#x3D;147</li>
            <li>I hate big pharma and would advise we all do the best we can to get away from those jerks.  </li>
            <li>My teeth are usually very sensitive (even with using traditional sensodyne here in the states).  </li>
            <li>In that case, I feel the initial pain would be well worth the investment for a massive reduction in sensitivity in the long run.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because my teeth are sensitive and not as white as I would like them to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After only adding a pea sized amount into my tooth brush and brushing as normal</li>
            <li>I have to say I did not notice any whitening so far, tooth shade is the same.</li>
            <li>product definitely helps with my sensitivity, although doesn&#x27;t completely eliminate it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But again, I&#x27;m not a medical professional.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But again, I&#x27;m not a medical professional.</li>
            <li>This made a very big improvement to my sensitive molars.  </li>
            <li>The key question is whether Novamin is a major advance in toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I think it works better than other types, but it&#x27;s hard to do a scientific comparison.</li>
            <li>However, it made teeth that were NOT sensitive, become sensitive.  </li>
            <li>First few brushes with this hurt.</li>
            <li>I never considered myself as having super sensitive teeth and used to use Pronamel for weak enamel.</li>
            <li>It did not take very long to receive this in the mail though the way it was packed in an envelope the product was completely smashed but still useable.  </li>
            <li>The first few weeks, my teeth actually hurt.  </li>
            <li>I felt no negative sensations and the toothpaste felt like any other</li>
            <li>Be very careful when purchasing this particular product that you are getting the product that actually contains Novamin.</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> This the best toothpaste on the market today.</li>
            <li> , perhaps the best thing for enamel anywhere.</li>
            <li> Our wonderful government office, the FDA will not approve NovaMin in the United State.</li>
            <li> In my opinion it&#x27;s not the best tasting toothpaste in the world</li>
            <li> Works great!</li>
            <li> This item was recommended to me by my dentist and it turns out to be one of the  best products on market.</li>
            <li> Excellent.</li>
            <li> Excellent toothpaste for improving tooth sensitivity and whitening</li>
            <li> The best thing I&#x27;ve ever found for dental sensitivity is novamine, and this has it.  </li>
            <li> Great!</li>
            <li> -sensitivity &#x3D; excellent, no sensitivity since the breakin period.    </li>
            <li> Recommendation: use crest 3d in mornings to whiten, novamin at night to maintain enamel &#x3D; best balance of price and performance.    </li>
            <li> Works great!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product as described and used.  </li>
            <li> Good stuff!</li>
            <li> but this is good toothpaste as it is best for enamel.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for a week or two and haven&#x27;t experienced any pain or discomfort.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen reviews of this where people complain of pain, but I experienced none of that, and am on my 5th tube of it.</li>
            <li> (also greatly whitens your teeth and disinfects your mouth).</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> Also something additional which is great; I have one tooth that has a receding gum line.</li>
            <li> I was really happy about this.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> This is a really great product.</li>
            <li> I know of, do it is great on my teeth</li>
            <li> Enjoy the taste; leaves teeth and mouth with an excellent feeling.</li>
            <li> Seven dollars and free shipping is the best deal on Amazon seeing that this product will save you and yours thousands of dollars in dental bills.  </li>
            <li> Novamin is the best mineral adjuvant technology available to date.  </li>
            <li> So good that the ADA lobbied to get it off the US</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s vastly superior to Dr. Collins formula in taste and mouth-feel.</li>
            <li> This product is superior.</li>
            <li> On time delivery and seller did a good job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too good for the US.</li>
            <li> It worked fairly quickly fairly well.</li>
            <li> Good</li>
            <li> price for a toothpaste, but I&#x27;m more than happy to pay a premium for the benefit Novamin provides.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and the shipper has been great.</li>
            <li> It has a very refreshing mint taste that lasts for a while after brushing.</li>
            <li> I love this product and will continue using it!</li>
            <li> Gotta love science!</li>
            <li> Works nicely.</li>
            <li> I noticed the difference when I switched to another kind of tooth paste for a while</li>
            <li> kind of like an investment on my teeth.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s working or if my mouth healed on its own.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s some kind of miracle calcium/glass/silica formula that when it mixes with your saliva will penetrate your exposed dentin and form a layer of protection over and in the exposed dentin, in a sense remineralizing them.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say this toothpaste works.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can do your own research and find out what the product does and how it works, and whether there may be any side effects.</li>
            <li> this toothpaste is the real deal, and great for your teeth!</li>
            <li> best toothpaste i have used so far.</li>
            <li> Regardless, 1450 ppm of fluoride is shown to be MORE effective than Novamin alone (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20546825) at preventing demineralization of teeth.</li>
            <li> After researching my options, I concluded that the Sensodyne product that contains Novamin is safe and effective</li>
            <li> Great stuff, I liked it so much</li>
            <li> I went ahead and bought more.</li>
            <li> Novamin seriously is better than the US version.  </li>
            <li> I just buy 10 at a time and stock up. :)</li>
            <li> Are they scientifically better?</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know, but do they feel better?</li>
            <li> This is my favorite toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I was glad to find the Sensodyne with Novamin.</li>
            <li> I sure wish that Sensodyne would sell the toothpaste with Novamin in the USA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Novamin has been found to make enamel stronger</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is amazing and unlike anything available on store shelves.</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy again, but I will make sure I get the best price (which may not be Amazon)</li>
            <li> but I buy Sensodyne Repair from the UK because it is better with the fluoride.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are feeling better.  </li>
            <li> There is nothing better, even the dentist prescriptions don&#x27;t help.  </li>
            <li> I have had the product for about a month, maybe more.</li>
            <li> price to get it shipped from the UK is a bit steep, but I&#x27;m ordering more.</li>
            <li> I went to order more</li>
            <li> then Dr. Collins was and has a better mouth feel when you are using it.  </li>
            <li> it make anything magical happen to my teeth?</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> As many reviewers have already said, Novamin works!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> to many of usâ€¦</li>
            <li> love the price and toothpaste even better</li>
            <li> This is just toothpaste, you should be okay if you use it.</li>
            <li> This is just toothpaste, you should be okay if you use it.</li>
            <li> So I had to do a bit more work to find a source that wasn&#x27;t going to gouge me.</li>
            <li> NCBI, the most trusted source link is provided in the comment section.</li>
            <li> Idea: since this reacts with water: apply THEN moisten to keep most novamin on the teeth.    </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m hoping that it will strengthen my teeth and make them more resistant to decay.  </li>
            <li> Immediately, I felt even more protection.</li>
            <li> I love this item and will buy again.</li>
            <li> Of course she could also be resisting because of its superior cleaning power (I evidently can&#x27;t be trusted in this area).</li>
            <li> The mint taste is pretty good...</li>
            <li> This product has Novamin in it as well as fluoride which is nice anything to help protect my sensitive teeth is good.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s better than any of the US-sensitive-tooth formulas I&#x27;ve tried, but not quite as good as classic colgate mint flavor.</li>
            <li> use to be able to get Dr. Collins (fluoride free)</li>
            <li> Novamin is the most exciting thing to happen to toothpaste, well since, the invention of toothpaste!</li>
            <li> your teeth feeling incredibly clean and &#x27;protected&#x27; (for lack of a better word)&lt;br /&gt;-Quick</li>
            <li> Make sure its warm water so it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much.  </li>
            <li> There are no randomized controlled studies, so as with most health products, it may not be true.  </li>
            <li> fine</li>
            <li> Super satisfied</li>
            <li> /&gt;However if you don&#x27;t want to or can&#x27;t do that, don&#x27;t need prescription-strength toothpaste, or don&#x27;t want to risk being exposed to very high levels of fluoride, this product, apparently, combines both a higher-than-average level of fluoride (good) and Novamin (also good).</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t take to writing this lightly, and took a &amp;#34;scientific&amp;#34; approach to testing this product out.  </li>
            <li> it may be time to switch to an SLS free toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> My teeth do feel smooth.</li>
            <li> Available with Novamin, as indicated.</li>
            <li> Wish it were easily available on this side of the pond.</li>
            <li> It has been speculated that FDA approval could not be had for \\&quot;repair\\&quot; toothpaste (despite the fact that the drugstore is filled with products that promise to \\&quot;restore\\&quot; your teeth).</li>
            <li> but I also learned that the makers were not making it available here in the U.S.</li>
            <li> You will also learn that GlaxoSmithKline, who owns the rights to Novamin, decided not to make it available in their toothpaste in the U.S.</li>
            <li> It works great and is the only stuff that helps me with tooth sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It also came in very useful when I had toothache</li>
            <li> /&gt;The boxes are factory sealed (glued securely) and the tubes have the familiar foil seal.</li>
            <li> Higher ppm is even better</li>
            <li> NovaMin is a calcium sodium phosphosilicate dentifrice which reduces sensitivity significantly.</li>
            <li> It has a higher level of fluoride than most toothpastes, which is what my dentist recommended.  </li>
            <li> Very significant sensitivity and pain relief after first use.</li>
            <li> Absolutely astounding service, cannot possibly recommend them more.  </li>
            <li> I brought 3 different toothpastes for a trial run on seeing which would offer me the best protection for my sensitive teeth and dentin lost.</li>
            <li> Especially good for extra sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I believe (I am neither a dentist or a materials scientist) that Novamin is more effective at -covering- exposed areas than fluoride, as it is deposited (in my understanding) as a bioglass particle which binds to teeth containing the ions necessary to form hydroxyapatite (which are then released at the tooth surface).</li>

            <li> Most certainly.</li>
            <li> Taste is nothing special, but it&#x27;s toothpaste, so who cares.  </li>
            <li> After using these for 6 months, I can tell you for sure that my teeth feel and are much stronger.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pricey toothpaste, but worth every penny in its restorative effects and benefits until it&#x27;s available here in the States.</li>
            <li> It appears that Novamin will simultaneously whiten teeth by causing fresh hydroxyapatite (the primary mineral in tooth enamel -</li>
            <li> It appears that Novamin will simultaneously whiten teeth by causing fresh hydroxyapatite (the primary mineral in tooth enamel -</li>
            <li> My teeth feel and look much brighter and a more pearl shine.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not bad either</li>
            <li> I have done a lot of reading about the properties of Novamin and came to the conclusion that it is worth the extra cash add to my arsenal of mouthwashes and floss picks to keep my teeth in good health.</li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly and in tact.  </li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly from overseas and has Novamin in it.</li>
            <li> and I do use the regular Sensodyne and really like it, it helps greatly.</li>
            <li> this tooth paste may cause some pain as it has a very strong mint, but if your teeth are not severely sensitive i would recommend this tooth paste to any one.</li>
            <li> : Sensitivity of too many teeth can be caused by high blood pressure, like 140/90.</li>
            <li> ) Study by Nat inst of Health concluded NovaMin provided more substantial and significant improvements at the early time points, compared to potassium nitrate or stannous fluoride.</li>
            <li> On your very first time using this product you will feel the product building up on your teeth.  </li>
            <li> After using this toothpaste, my floss glided much more easily than normal and my teeth felt very smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Right product&lt;br /&gt;Arrived quickly from UK</li>
            <li> They also have a fresh breath version that may be better for super sensitive teeth as it doesn&#x27;t have whitening stuff.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very grateful for this product and for the retailer making it available to us here in the U.S.</li>
            <li> The amazing part is Amazon does not sell any toothpaste in US with S&amp;S since Amazon can not compete with big box stores.</li>
            <li> *are* whiter, which is a plus, but the sensitivity isn&#x27;t worth it.  </li>
            <li> It is a powerful irritant, and is a mouth culprit for pain, redness, and ulcers.  </li>
            <li> It took about a week to arrive, but it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li> I held the popsicle for a good minute or so with no real discomfort.</li>
            <li> i would make sure you buy the uk version from the seller direct cart as the us version does not contain novamin.</li>
            <li> That is, the particle creates a local covering of hydroxyapatite, as opposed to the fluoride which is kind of just floating around</li>
            <li> That is, the particle creates a local covering of hydroxyapatite, as opposed to the fluoride which is kind of just floating around</li>
            <li> I bought the non &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; fresh breath version because it is gentler on enamel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The British version of this product (containing Novamin) is a pleasant change from normal &amp;#34;sensitive teeth&amp;#34; toothpaste in the US.</li>
            <li> It worked pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> If that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for you&#x27;ve come to the right place.</li>
            <li> Can feel it working right away.  </li>
            <li> (I do wish GlaxoSmithKline would hurry up and payoff the right politician so the competition could come up with some milder</li>
            <li> I have noticed a positive difference since I&#x27;ve started using this product, and it does in fact contain NovaMin!</li>
            <li> This is far superior to the American release.  </li>
            <li> Regenerate Enamel Science Advanced Toothpaste is the new formula patented by Unilever which sells for more money with the same concept.</li>
            <li> Tooth was fine, so if I was in pain, I&#x27;d need a root canal or maybe some sensitive toothpaste.</li>
            <li> This has been my first week of using this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> At first I was reluctant to even try to do it, but I tried and to my amazement I had no pain, except for where I have a metal filling which made sense because the conductivity.</li>
            <li> I bought three more tubes last night from the UK.</li>
            <li> You should have been able to go to your local CVS and buy it</li>
            <li> The Repair and Protect is more solid</li>
            <li> Hurt my teeth at first</li>
            <li> This is the first time I tried NOVAMIN formula (which is Calcium-Sodium Phosphosilicate) &amp; I intend to continue using it.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Glaxosmithkline has no trouble overcharging for the US version, despite not containing any advanced bioglass technology.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but after three weeks of use, my sugar sensitivity is gone, and my hot/cold sensitivity is greatly reduced!</li>
            <li> immediately felt a noticeable difference on my teeth after the first use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using toothpaste with Novamin since it first came out</li>
            <li> I use to get it directly from the company that originally invented and produced it.  </li>
            <li> I brush and floss twice a day, so I am very aware of how my teeth normally feel after brushing.</li>
            <li> though apparently Novamin is available to dentist&#x27;s offices as part of a cleaning agent, just not to the &amp;#34;general public&amp;#34; anymore.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m bothered that it&#x27;s not available directly here in the US, so make sure you select a UK seller to make sure you get the correct product.  </li>
            <li> I was really nervous before I used it for the first time, because of these reviews.</li>
            <li> Let me make on thing real clear - to get the right product you have to order it from Europe or specifically the United Kingdom to get the NOVAMIN ingredient.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how quickly my order arrived.</li>
            <li> After using this, it&#x27;s made my teeth super sensitive.</li>
            <li> and my dentist recommended that I should rub a large amount of it into my tooth and gum whilst I was waiting for the antibiotics to kick in.</li>
            <li> Christmas Eve, I was eating a hershey kiss and about jumped out of my skin from the pain to a molar with a rather large filling.</li>
            <li> Another reviewer were absolutely correct in the &amp;#34;gritty&amp;#34; feeling afterwards, and the taste leaves a lot to be desired.</li>
            <li> really seems that the US government/industrial/system wants to stop availability of&lt;br /&gt;products</li>
            <li> This is the REAL stuff, with NovaMin.  </li>
            <li> It has taken about a month or so for me to realize the product is really working.</li>
            <li> that I have seen some real results.</li>
            <li> and this has REALLY helped with the sensitivity.</li>
            <li> It worked very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict:</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Do this for two to three minutes and it will really speed up the process.  </li>
            <li> I really like this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> If you have a real problem, go to the dentist and don&#x27;t try to self-treat any conditions with this stuff.ave</li>
            <li> If you have a real problem, go to the dentist and don&#x27;t try to self-treat any conditions with this stuff.</li>
            <li> And it seems to be widely available outside of the U.S.</li>
            <li> a real bummer GlaxoSmithKline bought the patent to Novamin</li>
            <li> The protective layer it creates is immediately noticeable and something like that will lose the multibillion dollar industry too much</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thank you so much for selling this from the UK.</li>
            <li> I think the gums around the teeth next to that tooth had been suffering for a while from inadequate brushing and now with more tooth exposed, were quite sensitive.  </li>
            <li> Look closely at the pictures of the product and be sure it says that it contains Novamin, and only purchase where other buyers have confirmed the Novamin.</li>
            <li> Look closely at the pictures of the product and be sure it says that it contains Novamin, and only purchase where other buyers have confirmed the Novamin.</li>
            <li> I was at a point where my teeth were extremely brittle due to tmj, but now they&#x27;re much stronger and the dentist says my teeth look great.</li>
            <li> hey, 7 bucks a tube is a small price to pay for being able to remineralize my teeth!</li>
            <li> The only thing I do not like about this product is that although I like mint the mint flavor in this product can be very intense but its still worth using.</li>
            <li> This will go a long way towards your goal of a pain free mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a white, sweet opaque paste.&lt;br /&gt;(3</li>
            <li> My hands were full and I also had a big popsicle I was eating.</li>
            <li> After a bit more than a week of use, my teeth have calmed down.  </li>
            <li> Other negative reviews surprised me as I had the best results I could have hoped for.</li>
            <li> I had no serious sensitivity issues, but I study materials engineering and understand how this stuff works on a molecular level, so I made the purchase;</li>
            <li> Per performance:  -taste &#x3D; meh, middle of the pack, certainly not as bad as the new colgates,  -foam &#x3D;</li>
            <li> If you brush twice, first time to get your saliva off the teeth, the second time seems to become more active.  </li>
            <li> Price aside, it&#x27;s a very soothing toothpaste for my sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is very helpful for sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the extra cost.  </li>
            <li> I used to use the normal sensodyne acid protection that they sell here in the states, and while they helped with sensitivity they never helped rebuild my enamel.</li>
            <li> This is great toothpaste which I now have to order from Europe,  where they are better than us,  medically speaking,  because Big Pharma and a-hole dentists want to wring every last dime and dollar from poor Americans.  </li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li> I thought maybe I ate something to make my teeth more sensitive and it was just a fluke, but I tried again the next day and the pain immediately came back.  </li>
            <li> So far only a mild reduction in sensitivity.</li>
            <li> It is a little early to tell for sure whether it will reduce sensitivity as advertised.  </li>
            <li> I live in the USA and for some reason this Sensodyne with Novamin is not offered here.</li>
            <li> But, I bought this new Sensodyne and as soon as I started to brush my teeth</li>
            <li> So I saw this as a &#x27;new&#x27; Sensodyne formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The area of the tooth that was uncovered by gum was always very sensitive if i scratched it with my fingernail or anything.</li>
            <li> She has very sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> if you have very sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> Had very sensitive teeth and that feeling has subsided substantially.</li>
            <li> Compared to every US toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used the tube plastic feels paper-thin, and the screw-top doesn&#x27;t thread on very far.  </li>
            <li> so, if you have been using sensodyne as a crutch, there will be a period where pain comes back while the novamin does its dance, use the sensitivity paste first then the novamin,</li>
            <li> This is also relatively cheap ($7.98/tube shipped is not cheap, but it&#x27;s not ridiculous</li>
            <li> I will keep using the old Sensodyne, but this new stuff is heading for the trash can.</li>
            <li> It tastes much better than the usual &amp;#34;stannous fluoride&amp;#34; toothpaste sold for sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> So in a scramble to find a new sensitive toothpaste before I completely ran out I stumbled upon the UK version of Sensodynes Repair and Protect Whitening with Novamin.  </li>
            <li> and, ultimately, it was purely a business decision.</li>
            <li> Got this on Amazon because of the stupid FDA not allowing them to sell the Sensodyne with Novimin in the U.S., and have read wonderful things about it.  </li>
            <li> There has been a marked increase in teeth sensitivity over the 3 week period.</li>
            <li> Sodium Lauryl Sulfate is a foaming agent that&#x27;s used in all non natural or non sensitive  toothpastes.</li>
            <li> which actually help people (e.g. Novamin), and instead wants to make&lt;br /&gt;available</li>
            <li> While I can&#x27;t tell you if it is actually restoring or repairing my teeth and enamel, it absolutely helps with sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> I have not had any pain whatsoever associated with sensitive teeth since I started using this product.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t rinse my mouth fast enough.  </li>
            <li> (it was for sensitive teeth as well though).</li>
            <li> I never had sensitive teeth until I had a wisdom tooth removed as an adult.  </li>
            <li> I will not be continuing use of this product since it doesn&#x27;t provide sensitive teeth protection for me.</li>
            <li> No issues so far.  </li>
            <li> Some people are sensitive to fluoride, but I&#x27;m not and wanted to benefit from both fluoride and Novamin.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> I could not get this stuff off of my teeth fast enough.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth (some fillings &amp; crowns too) &amp; as soon as I used it</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t have the money for extras these days - I can&#x27;t even afford any medical or dental bills.</li>
            <li> I have used this for about a month and it still doesn&#x27;t seem to work for me, but maybe I just have too sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> No where it is claimed for sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s never been this sensitive in my life.</li>
            <li> I find that it works better when the toothpaste is applied directly to the sensitive spots for a few seconds prior to beginning to brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Original Sensodyne for years and it helps a little with tooth sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> , it just doesn&#x27;t leave my breath as fresh as other toothpastes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Also, it contains SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate) which maybe harsh for some people, specially those prone to canker</li>
            <li> /&gt;Novamin is available in very few toothpaste formulas in the U.S., I was purchasing  </li>
            <li> According to GSK the new enamel can last up to 28 days https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;x0uIt2XYXNM#t&#x3D;147</li>
            <li> I hate big pharma and would advise we all do the best we can to get away from those jerks.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are usually very sensitive (even with using traditional sensodyne here in the states).  </li>
            <li> In that case, I feel the initial pain would be well worth the investment for a massive reduction in sensitivity in the long run.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because my teeth are sensitive and not as white as I would like them to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After only adding a pea sized amount into my tooth brush and brushing as normal</li>
            <li> I have to say I did not notice any whitening so far, tooth shade is the same.</li>
            <li> product definitely helps with my sensitivity, although doesn&#x27;t completely eliminate it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But again, I&#x27;m not a medical professional.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But again, I&#x27;m not a medical professional.</li>
            <li> This made a very big improvement to my sensitive molars.  </li>
            <li> The key question is whether Novamin is a major advance in toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I think it works better than other types, but it&#x27;s hard to do a scientific comparison.</li>
            <li> However, it made teeth that were NOT sensitive, become sensitive.  </li>
            <li> First few brushes with this hurt.</li>
            <li> I never considered myself as having super sensitive teeth and used to use Pronamel for weak enamel.</li>
            <li> It did not take very long to receive this in the mail though the way it was packed in an envelope the product was completely smashed but still useable.  </li>
            <li> The first few weeks, my teeth actually hurt.  </li>
            <li> I felt no negative sensations and the toothpaste felt like any other</li>
            <li> Be very careful when purchasing this particular product that you are getting the product that actually contains Novamin.</li>
            <li> The product IS being sold in the U.S. without the Novamin, and it appears to me that there are a number of unscrupulous sellers out there, particularly on ebay, taking advantage of the fact that the specific product WITH Novamin is not available here in the U.S.</li>
            <li> I live in Maryland, USA, it came in about a week and a half, as it ships from England.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It actually increased how sensitive my teeth were, and gave me a slight chemical-burn type condition on my lips.</li>
            <li> My teeth are more sensitive and painful since I switched to this product from regular sensodyne.&lt;br /&gt;NO, NO, NO is my recommendation.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little expensive, but honestly, the cost of a single dentist visit will buy you enough to last for years -- let alone</li>
            <li> It will actually rebuild the enamel of your teeth, unlike the US version of this toothpaste, which will only give you fluoride like any other toothpaste will.</li>
            <li> toothpaste is flavored with Limonene (Lemon instead of mint).&lt;br /&gt;Drawbacks: more expensive than other toothpastes.</li>
            <li> Novamin forms a bone like structure in the minor pits in your teeth and insulates the nerve in the dentin.</li>
            <li> I hope it continues to work long term.</li>
            <li> When my teeth became sensitive to hot and cold substances several years ago, I began using regular Sensodyne and it worked.</li>
            <li> But a few months ago, my teeth became sensitive again despite my continued use of the toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I had used other Sensodyne toothpaste in the past and never had much improvement with the problem of sensitivity.</li>
            <li> So, for the past three weeks, I&#x27;ve used a combination of the UK Version of Sensodyne Repair &amp; Protect, and the US Version (a 50/50 mix of each), for the same 3-4 daily brushings, with continued Listerine use prior to brushing.  </li>
            <li> The other day I was outside and was putting stuff into my car to go somewhere.</li>
            <li> Sensodyne is a subsidiary of gsk and the toothpaste formula of US and EU are completely different due to FDA rules in US.</li>
            <li> I have kind of sensitive teeth, especially to cold stuff, so after reading other reviews I&#x27;m surprised that it didn&#x27;t hurt me at all.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is marketed overseas as containing both fluoride and NovaMin, however in the US the only active ingredient is Stannous Fluoride.</li>
            <li> There is a slight crunch that might be the Novamin particles, but I&#x27;m not sure how large they&#x27;re supposed to be.</li>
            <li> Second place is a long way down.</li>
            <li> If you leave the brushed toothpaste in your mouth and thin it with a half oz of water you can swish it directly into your effected sensitive area.  </li>
            <li> We HAD this in America until evil big pharma decided they  could get more out of us by making it necessary to go to a dentist and buy it &amp;#34;special.&amp;#34;  What would have been,  say ,  three dollars,  ended up being marked up to one hundred dollars.  </li>
            <li> I had previously used Sensodyne Repair &amp; Product for several *years</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a little over a month and haven&#x27;t noticed any increased sensitivity when eating different things</li>
            <li> It may be expensive for the size but the 6$ for a 3 month supply was worth it to me.</li>
            <li> and I began noticing a difference after only a few days.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It DOES have novamin, have only been using it for a day, I&#x27;ll try to review again in a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li> minimal, keep mouth closed or it will run off,  -whitening &#x3D; acceptable</li>
            <li> After using it for roughly 2 months, I&#x27;m about to junk it and regret stocking up.</li>
            <li> hydroxyapatite deposits are only supposed to be a few microns thick (my interpretation based on this http://www.repairandprotect.ca/pdf/NovaMin_JCD_2011_Clinical_Summaries_HR_EN.pdf), so this won&#x27;t regrade your teeth and fill in potholes (go to the dentist!), but it should prevent sensitivity and protect against future damage with regular use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> hydroxyapatite deposits are only supposed to be a few microns thick (my interpretation based on this http://www.repairandprotect.ca/pdf/NovaMin_JCD_2011_Clinical_Summaries_HR_EN.pdf), so this won&#x27;t regrade your teeth and fill in potholes (go to the dentist!), but it should prevent sensitivity and protect against future damage with regular use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The US version of this toothpaste doesn&#x27;t include NovaMin, allegedly due to some sort of FDA approval nonsense.  </li>
            <li> I also tried the US version and the Japanese version of Sensodyne in the past but they didn&#x27;t work as well as this UK product  which contains Novamin.</li>
            <li> come to find out that due to GKS Dr. Collins and other brands that had Novamin had to stop production of their products.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, my girlfriend will not use it because she tells e that the nano-particles will create barnacles on her teeth, not sure if that&#x27;s a potential side effect, but shes the scientist.</li>
            <li> I used to use Dr Collins, which just stopped using novamine one day due to a licensing agreement.  </li>
            <li> This is in contrast to other toothpastes which remove stains with hydrogen peroxide and abrasives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is in contrast to other toothpastes which remove stains with hydrogen peroxide and abrasives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (My sensitivity was exacerbated due to my nighttime teeth grinding)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got a mouthguard and Pronamel.</li>
            <li> I will say that my mouth does feel cleaner when using this compared to other toothpaste brands.</li>
            <li> Like everyone else who uses it, I wish that it was still sold in the U.S. and that it was in other toothpaste products other than just the EU Sensodyne brand.</li>
            <li> Then I read that the active ingredient can cause surface staining to teeth.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste definitely met my expectations, and has reduced my sensitivity to cold and the hairline cracks in several teeth do not seem to be as apparent as before.</li>
            <li> Just too bad that it isn&#x27;t available in the US with Novamin...</li>
            <li> Average flavor, texture,</li>
            <li> The lower wisdom tooth was buried down in my gum and it required some...</li>
            <li> And had tried other senstive toothpaste and they helped a little.</li>
            <li> okay, expensive mediocre product.</li>
            <li> I typically use it before I go to sleep and sometimes in the morning.</li>
            <li> After a week or two, that spot experiences much less pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Should take less than a week to stop the sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> I noticed less pain &amp; a bit whiter teeth.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t store it with the cap off or the bioglass will absorb water and become less effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used other Sensodyne toothpaste products in the past with no problems.  </li>
            <li> The Sensodyne was used last and is the worse out of all three.</li>
            <li> Dentist says they can be whitened in a few months, but I don&#x27;t blame the product--yet.</li>
            <li> of October 2014, if you are looking for Novamin, Sensodyne is the only game in town</li>
            <li> ITH Novamin is not available here in the U.S.</li>
            <li> It is beyond me why, as is often the case, that Novamin is not available in the U.S.  </li>
            <li> However, I found this product to be too harsh.  </li>
            <li> if your teeth can be saved the pain goes away after a few days and you can stick to this paste.    </li>
            <li> I got this abroad from an Amazon UK seller and from a pharmacy in HK since it&#x27;s not available in the US.</li>
            <li> Earlier that morning I went outside and the cold air hurt my teeth, as it usually did.</li>
            <li> Hope this review helps other people at least give this toothpaste a try ,and see what novamin can do for you.</li>
            <li> Instead I started noticing that my lips kept feeling chapped, and the inside of my cheeks kept feeling like they had been rubbed raw.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth it!!</li>
            <li> Prior to purchasing this product I was using Dr. Collins Restore unfortunately as my stash ran out</li>
            <li> and I have a small crack that goes to the root.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like blowing cold air on your sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li> Still not sure how well this works.</li>
            <li> I use a very small amount (about the size of a pea) as well to make the product last longer since it is so expensive.</li>
            <li> I will definitely continue to use it and see if my sensitiveness to cold drinks and foods improves any, not sure yet.</li>
            <li> Repair what you have, or at least keep whats</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using ANY toothpaste that contains NovaMin for at least 5 years.</li>
            <li> Provided you brush for at least 3 minutes.  </li>
            <li> But my teeth were making me crazy and it seemed to only be a sensitivity issue.</li>
            <li> When the toothpaste arrived, I brushed with it, then went outside again, but the cold air did not hurt my teeth at all!!</li>
            <li> I scheduled an appointment with my Dentist and the prognosis was not good:</li>
            <li> , it was very hard to find any products with it now :</li>
            <li> Quite frustrating.</li>
            <li> I was not happy with that statement at all.  </li>
            <li> I hate GSK for buying Novamine and making Dr. Collins Restore disappear, but at least they didn&#x27;t sit on the Novamine formula and let it go to waste....</li>
            <li> Since it has to ship from the UK, it&#x27;s quite expensive, but it does contain Novamin.</li>
            <li> The weird flavor you&#x27;re experiencing is probably the abundance of fluoride which is way beyond what you can buy from a store in the US.  </li>
            <li> This toothpaste arrived on a cold April day.</li>
            <li> Within two weeks of use my sensitivity to cold is returning.</li>
            <li> I was using Colgate before this and still had sensitivity when I would eat cold foods.</li>
            <li> i have sensitivity to cold water and cold food.</li>
            <li> US version contains stannous (tin) fluoride (you know, Fluoristan, from the &#x27;60s), which isn&#x27;t bad, but it won&#x27;t \\&quot;repair\\&quot; the teeth like Novamin is supposed to.</li>
            <li> This stuff works like crazy!</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t terrible either.  </li>
            <li> Horrible, horrible pain!  </li>
            <li> and they have either priced it outrageously</li>

            <li> As described. prompt shipping.</li>
            <li> Enjoy the taste; leaves teeth and mouth with an excellent feeling.</li>
            <li> This the best toothpaste on the market today. It contains Novamin, that the domestic product, still called repair and Protect, does not contain. Novamin forms a bone like structure in the minor pits in your teeth and insulates the nerve in the dentin. Result your teeth lose sensitivity, and the coating restores the surface enamel. Great stuff, I liked it so much I went ahead and bought more.</li>
            <li> I wish we could access Novamin here in the US.  Sensodyne *with* Novamin seriously is better than the US version.  It&#x27;s worth the extra cost.  I just buy 10 at a time and stock up. :)</li>
            <li> I used to use the normal sensodyne acid protection that they sell here in the states, and while they helped with sensitivity they never helped rebuild my enamel. After using these for 6 months, I can tell you for sure that my teeth feel and are much stronger. I was at a point where my teeth were extremely brittle due to tmj, but now they&#x27;re much stronger and the dentist says my teeth look great. Are they scientifically better? I don&#x27;t know, but do they feel better? Most certainly.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite toothpaste.  I was glad to find the Sensodyne with Novamin.I sure wish that Sensodyne would sell the toothpaste with Novamin in the USA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Novamin has been found to make enamel stronger, perhaps the best thing for enamel anywhere.</li>
            <li> Our wonderful government office, the FDA will not approve NovaMin in the United State. Quite frustrating. This toothpaste is amazing and unlike anything available on store shelves.</li>
            <li> Like this product a lot!</li>
            <li> The US version of this toothpaste doesn&#x27;t include NovaMin, allegedly due to some sort of FDA approval nonsense.  This stuff lists NovaMin as the third ingredient and also has 1.08% fluoride.  I just checked a US tube of Sensodyne and it only has 0.15% fluoride.  Since it ships from the UK, delivery took about a week.</li>
            <li> The five stars is specifically for the seller. Ordered two tubes on Monday evening a couple weeks ago. Were *delivered* that Thursday. 2 Business Days shipping, from the UK. Absolutely astounding service, cannot possibly recommend them more.  As for the product.....It actually increased how sensitive my teeth were, and gave me a slight chemical-burn type condition on my lips. I don&#x27;t take to writing this lightly, and took a &amp;#34;scientific&amp;#34; approach to testing this product out.  I had previously used Sensodyne Repair &amp; Product for several *years*, 3-4 times daily. Brushing was done 10 minutes after each meal, and Listerine was used prior to brushing (so as to not wash away the Flouride).  So, for the past three weeks, I&#x27;ve used a combination of the UK Version of Sensodyne Repair &amp; Protect, and the US Version (a 50/50 mix of each), for the same 3-4 daily brushings, with continued Listerine use prior to brushing.  There has been a marked increase in teeth sensitivity over the 3 week period. My teeth *are* whiter, which is a plus, but the sensitivity isn&#x27;t worth it.  Obviously, YMMV, everyone&#x27;s teeth are different. Another reviewer were absolutely correct in the &amp;#34;gritty&amp;#34; feeling afterwards, and the taste leaves a lot to be desired. Technically others have noted the PPM of flouride is 1450, but it&#x27;s based in w/w (I&#x27;m assuming weight/weight), where as the US version is 1100ppm w/v (which is well defined as weight / volume).</li>
            <li> I am in Europe so I bought this at the store for 6$ (with novamin). I have been using it for a week or two and haven&#x27;t experienced any pain or discomfort. In my opinion it&#x27;s not the best tasting toothpaste in the world but it&#x27;s not bad either, it just doesn&#x27;t leave my breath as fresh as other toothpastes I&#x27;ve tried. I have kind of sensitive teeth, especially to cold stuff, so after reading other reviews I&#x27;m surprised that it didn&#x27;t hurt me at all. I will definitely continue to use it and see if my sensitiveness to cold drinks and foods improves any, not sure yet. I have to say I did not notice any whitening so far, tooth shade is the same.</li>
            <li> Repair what you have, or at least keep whats left.&lt;br /&gt;If your mouth gums, or tounge get irritated, or sores pop up it may be time to switch to an SLS free toothpaste. Sodium Lauryl Sulfate is a foaming agent that&#x27;s used in all non natural or non sensitive  toothpastes. It is a powerful irritant, and is a mouth culprit for pain, redness, and ulcers.  This will go a long way towards your goal of a pain free mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Active Ingredients - Potassium Nitrate 5% - Purpose - Antihypersensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;Sodium Fluoride 0.15% w/v Fluoride Ion - Anticavity.&lt;br /&gt;Inactive Ingredients Water, Sorbitol, Hydrated Silica, Glycerin, Flavor, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Xanthan Gum, Sodium Saccharin, Mica, Titanium Dioxide, Sodium Hydroxide.</li>
            <li> Very significant sensitivity and pain relief after first use.</li>
            <li> This has been my first week of using this toothpaste. I have noticed a positive difference since I&#x27;ve started using this product, and it does in fact contain NovaMin! If that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for you&#x27;ve come to the right place. It took about a week to arrive, but it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li> okay, expensive mediocre product.</li>
            <li> Think of the coral reefs leaching out into the ocean.  Now, think of them being restored.  This is your mouth on Novamin.</li>
            <li> Works nicely. I wish it sold in the US though.</li>
            <li> I had used other Sensodyne toothpaste in the past and never had much improvement with the problem of sensitivity. When I tried the Repair &amp; Protect Sensodyne I was amazed at the improvement . I do only use it in the morning. Other negative reviews surprised me as I had the best results I could have hoped for.</li>
            <li> Since it has to ship from the UK, it&#x27;s quite expensive, but it does contain Novamin. Price aside, it&#x27;s a very soothing toothpaste for my sensitive gums.</li>
            <li> This product contains the poison fluoride.&lt;br /&gt;I can now only get toothpaste containing Novamin from UK.&lt;br /&gt;I use to be able to get Dr. Collins (fluoride free) Restore toothpaste containing Novamin.&lt;br /&gt;It really seems that the US government/industrial/system wants to stop availability of&lt;br /&gt;products in the US which actually help people (e.g. Novamin), and instead wants to make&lt;br /&gt;available only things that do not help people or actually harm them (e.g. fluoride).</li>
            <li> This is the REAL stuff, with NovaMin.  It will actually rebuild the enamel of your teeth, unlike the US version of this toothpaste, which will only give you fluoride like any other toothpaste will.</li>
            <li> The first few weeks, my teeth actually hurt.  After a month, no sensation whatsoever.  This is far superior to the American release.  Give it time and let it sit on your teeth for 30 seconds after a brush.  Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> Got this on Amazon because of the stupid FDA not allowing them to sell the Sensodyne with Novimin in the U.S., and have read wonderful things about it.  While I can&#x27;t tell you if it is actually restoring or repairing my teeth and enamel, it absolutely helps with sensitivity.  Taste is nothing special, but it&#x27;s toothpaste, so who cares.  Isn&#x27;t terrible either.  I&#x27;ve seen reviews of this where people complain of pain, but I experienced none of that, and am on my 5th tube of it.</li>
            <li> Good stuff! I will definitely buy again, but I will make sure I get the best price (which may not be Amazon)</li>
            <li> Seven dollars and free shipping is the best deal on Amazon seeing that this product will save you and yours thousands of dollars in dental bills.  I have worked in the dental materials industry and specifically in the area of remineralization/desensitizing as a research chemist.  Novamin is the best mineral adjuvant technology available to date.  So good that the ADA lobbied to get it off the US Market.&lt;br /&gt;I still have tubes of Restore left in my refrigerator but I buy Sensodyne Repair from the UK because it is better with the fluoride.  In my opinion to save thousands in dental bills:  Before going to bed, place one pearl size bead of  Sensodyne Repair (UK) along with one pearl of Colgate Total on the same toothbrush, brush, spit out, Don&#x27;t Rinse.  I do this every night  (also greatly whitens your teeth and disinfects your mouth).</li>
            <li> This toothpaste arrived on a cold April day. Earlier that morning I went outside and the cold air hurt my teeth, as it usually did. When the toothpaste arrived, I brushed with it, then went outside again, but the cold air did not hurt my teeth at all!! I can&#x27;t believe that using this toothpaste only one time made such a difference, but it did. I hope it continues to work long term.</li>
            <li> The weird flavor you&#x27;re experiencing is probably the abundance of fluoride which is way beyond what you can buy from a store in the US.  My teeth are usually very sensitive (even with using traditional sensodyne here in the states).  I have not had any pain whatsoever associated with sensitive teeth since I started using this product.</li>
            <li> You have to buy from British goodies to get the Novamin. The U.S. version does not have it. Works great!</li>
            <li> Actually has Novamine in it!  I hate GSK for buying Novamine and making Dr. Collins Restore disappear, but at least they didn&#x27;t sit on the Novamine formula and let it go to waste....</li>
            <li> Fifteen seconds was enough for me to decide I will never try this product again.  I have no cavities, but have had some tooth sensitivity recently.  So I bought this product thinking it will help a bit.  Two swipes with the toothbrush across the front of my teeth and it felt like the nerves in my teeth were exposed to arctic winds.  I couldn&#x27;t rinse my mouth fast enough.  Then I read that the active ingredient can cause surface staining to teeth.</li>
            <li> I live in the USA and for some reason this Sensodyne with Novamin is not offered here. I have done a lot of reading about the properties of Novamin and came to the conclusion that it is worth the extra cash add to my arsenal of mouthwashes and floss picks to keep my teeth in good health.</li>
            <li> I recommend the Sensodyne Repair &amp; Protect Whitening toothpaste 75 ml from seller on Amazon,  RangePlus, which was shipped from UK. It contains the NovaMin. This version of Sensodyne is sold in the UK but NOT in the USA.&lt;br /&gt;Below are some info on this Sensodyne Repair :&lt;br /&gt;(1) It contains calcium sodium phosphosilicate (tradename Novamin) and 1.08% by weight of sodium monofluorophosphate.&lt;br /&gt;(2) It is a white, sweet opaque paste.&lt;br /&gt;(3) Study by Nat inst of Health concluded NovaMin provided more substantial and significant improvements at the early time points, compared to potassium nitrate or stannous fluoride. After 12 weeks, the reduction in sensitivity is about the same for all 3.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21207920&lt;br /&gt;(4) My tooth sensitivity disappears after using this toothpaste for 2 weeks and after taking losartan, a blood pressure lowering drug.&lt;br /&gt;Warning : Sensitivity of too many teeth can be caused by high blood pressure, like 140/90. My friend&#x27;s tooth sensitivity disappears after taking blood pressure lowering drugs like metoprolol.&lt;br /&gt;Please click &amp;#34;Yes&amp;#34; below if this review was helpful to you.</li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly and in tact.  It is a little early to tell for sure whether it will reduce sensitivity as advertised.  So far only a mild reduction in sensitivity.</li>
            <li> I bought it based on the studies suggesting it can remineralize enamel surface. There are no randomized controlled studies, so as with most health products, it may not be true.  But it does reduce discomfort after whitening.</li>
            <li> I have been using this toothpaste for about a month.  My teeth are feeling better.  It wasn&#x27;t instant.  It took about 2 weeks for them to stop hurting.  My teeth do feel smooth.</li>
            <li> I love this product and will continue using it! I noticed the difference when I switched to another kind of tooth paste for a while (it was for sensitive teeth as well though). I also tried the US version and the Japanese version of Sensodyne in the past but they didn&#x27;t work as well as this UK product  which contains Novamin.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Contains novamin&lt;br /&gt;-Leaves your teeth feeling incredibly clean and &#x27;protected&#x27; (for lack of a better word)&lt;br /&gt;-Quick shipping&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-High price for a toothpaste, but I&#x27;m more than happy to pay a premium for the benefit Novamin provides.</li>
            <li> After a bit more than a week of use, my teeth have calmed down.  I never had sensitive teeth until I had a wisdom tooth removed as an adult.  The lower wisdom tooth was buried down in my gum and it required some...well, forget the details.  I think the gums around the teeth next to that tooth had been suffering for a while from inadequate brushing and now with more tooth exposed, were quite sensitive.  Things continue to improve each day with this toothpaste containing NovaMin.  I have ordered the 4 Pak now since it takes a while to receive the product.</li>
            <li> I was having a sensitivity after a filling so I picked up a tube of this and had it shipped from England - the prime ingredient cannot be bought in the US -Sensodyne produced here is ramped up flouride, fine I guess but this formula does the job.  I didn&#x27;t have to use the entire tube. It worked pretty quickly.  So I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> I brought 3 different toothpastes for a trial run on seeing which would offer me the best protection for my sensitive teeth and dentin lost. The Sensodyne was used last and is the worse out of all three. Within two weeks of use my sensitivity to cold is returning. I will not be continuing use of this product since it doesn&#x27;t provide sensitive teeth protection for me. I would not recommend this product at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using ANY toothpaste that contains NovaMin for at least 5 years. This toothpaste, from the UK, is the only one that has it anymore. I love this stuff and the shipper has been great. If you are having any issues with sensitivity, skip the stuff at the drug store, and buy this. There is nothing better, even the dentist prescriptions don&#x27;t help.  I don&#x27;t know what I would do without it.</li>
            <li> I like the product a lot. Let me make on thing real clear - to get the right product you have to order it from Europe or specifically the United Kingdom to get the NOVAMIN ingredient. It has a very refreshing mint taste that lasts for a while after brushing. I have had the product for about a month, maybe more. I typically use it before I go to sleep and sometimes in the morning. I supplement a regular toothpaste so I can make this product last longer. I use a very small amount (about the size of a pea) as well to make the product last longer since it is so expensive. It has taken about a month or so for me to realize the product is really working. I had no serious sensitivity issues, but I study materials engineering and understand how this stuff works on a molecular level, so I made the purchase; kind of like an investment on my teeth. The other day I was outside and was putting stuff into my car to go somewhere. My hands were full and I also had a big popsicle I was eating. To open my car doors and start loading and unloading stuff into my car I had to hold the popsicle in my mouth. My mouth froze up, so then I had to hold the popsicle between my teeth. At first I was reluctant to even try to do it, but I tried and to my amazement I had no pain, except for where I have a metal filling which made sense because the conductivity. I held the popsicle for a good minute or so with no real discomfort. I am sold on this product now that I have seen some real results. Also something additional which is great; I have one tooth that has a receding gum line. The area of the tooth that was uncovered by gum was always very sensitive if i scratched it with my fingernail or anything. Last night I tried scratching it and I had no pain. I was really happy about this. The product is doing what its supposed to do. I bought three more tubes last night from the UK. Two for me and one for my girlfriend for a birthday gift. She has very sensitive teeth and this product should help her immensely. She has already tried the product at my house and it caused her no discomfort; I have read reviews where this product has caused some discomfort to people that have severe sensitivity issues. In that case, I feel the initial pain would be well worth the investment for a massive reduction in sensitivity in the long run. Gotta love science!</li>
            <li> We HAD this in America until evil big pharma decided they  could get more out of us by making it necessary to go to a dentist and buy it &amp;#34;special.&amp;#34;  What would have been,  say ,  three dollars,  ended up being marked up to one hundred dollars.  I hate big pharma and would advise we all do the best we can to get away from those jerks.  This is great toothpaste which I now have to order from Europe,  where they are better than us,  medically speaking,  because Big Pharma and a-hole dentists want to wring every last dime and dollar from poor Americans.  Screw Big Pharma but this is good toothpaste as it is best for enamel.  You should have been able to go to your local CVS and buy it but NOOOO.....</li>
            <li> The British version of this product (containing Novamin) is a pleasant change from normal &amp;#34;sensitive teeth&amp;#34; toothpaste in the US. It tastes much better than the usual &amp;#34;stannous fluoride&amp;#34; toothpaste sold for sensitive teeth here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product definitely helps with my sensitivity, although doesn&#x27;t completely eliminate it. I think it works better than other types, but it&#x27;s hard to do a scientific comparison. I find that it works better when the toothpaste is applied directly to the sensitive spots for a few seconds prior to beginning to brush. After a week or two, that spot experiences much less pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price to get it shipped from the UK is a bit steep, but I&#x27;m ordering more.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth and this has REALLY helped with the sensitivity. I was using Colgate before this and still had sensitivity when I would eat cold foods.</li>
            <li> Prior to purchasing this product I was using Dr. Collins Restore unfortunately as my stash ran out and I was running low on my last tube I went to order more come to find out that due to GKS Dr. Collins and other brands that had Novamin had to stop production of their products.  So in a scramble to find a new sensitive toothpaste before I completely ran out I stumbled upon the UK version of Sensodynes Repair and Protect Whitening with Novamin.  It did not take very long to receive this in the mail though the way it was packed in an envelope the product was completely smashed but still useable.  This product has Novamin in it as well as fluoride which is nice anything to help protect my sensitive teeth is good.  The Repair and Protect is more solid then Dr. Collins was and has a better mouth feel when you are using it.  I have been using this product for a little over a month and haven&#x27;t noticed any increased sensitivity when eating different things so I guess its working well.  The only thing I do not like about this product is that although I like mint the mint flavor in this product can be very intense but its still worth using.</li>
            <li> This item was recommended to me by my dentist and it turns out to be one of the  best products on market.</li>
            <li> Great product. Available with Novamin, as indicated.</li>
            <li> First few brushes with this hurt. I thought I would persevere, maybe I just needed to get use to it. Just brushed again and the pain was unbearable. I just touched my front teach with the paste and could not take the pain. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> So I like tool techie stuff so why not try Novamin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it make anything magical happen to my teeth? No. Do I have any tooth pain or sensitivity as a result of using it? No.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, my girlfriend will not use it because she tells e that the nano-particles will create barnacles on her teeth, not sure if that&#x27;s a potential side effect, but shes the scientist. Of course she could also be resisting because of its superior cleaning power (I evidently can&#x27;t be trusted in this area).</li>
            <li> Just another toothpaste to me. I didn&#x27;t notice any sort of difference.  Wasn&#x27;t worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li> My teeth are more sensitive and painful since I switched to this product from regular sensodyne.&lt;br /&gt;NO, NO, NO is my recommendation.</li>
            <li> best toothpaste i have used so far. i have sensitivity to cold water and cold food. And had tried other senstive toothpaste and they helped a little. but after two weeks with this toothpast its almost completly gone, even when using whiting gels on my teeth that use to make my teeth sore. if you have very sensitive teeth this tooth paste may cause some pain as it has a very strong mint, but if your teeth are not severely sensitive i would recommend this tooth paste to any one. i would make sure you buy the uk version from the seller direct cart as the us version does not contain novamin. They also have a fresh breath version that may be better for super sensitive teeth as it doesn&#x27;t have whitening stuff.  It may be expensive for the size but the 6$ for a 3 month supply was worth it to me. Hope this review helps other people at least give this toothpaste a try ,and see what novamin can do for you.</li>
            <li> Especially good for extra sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> Hurt my teeth at first but that stopped after about 4 days.  Love this toothpaste.  Had very sensitive teeth and that feeling has subsided substantially.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste definitely met my expectations, and has reduced my sensitivity to cold and the hairline cracks in several teeth do not seem to be as apparent as before. Just too bad that it isn&#x27;t available in the US with Novamin...though apparently Novamin is available to dentist&#x27;s offices as part of a cleaning agent, just not to the &amp;#34;general public&amp;#34; anymore.</li>
            <li> Leaves some staining on your teeth after a while; which says may happen.  Dentist says they can be whitened in a few months, but I don&#x27;t blame the product--yet.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Product works as advertised.</li>
            <li> No issues so far.  Can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s working or if my mouth healed on its own.  I don&#x27;t want to find out.  I&#x27;ll keep using this.  Wish it were easily available on this side of the pond.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because my teeth are sensitive and not as white as I would like them to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After only adding a pea sized amount into my tooth brush and brushing as normal I found that it made a noticeable difference to the whiteness of my teeth and their sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also came in very useful when I had toothache and my dentist recommended that I should rub a large amount of it into my tooth and gum whilst I was waiting for the antibiotics to kick in. It worked very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: Excellent toothpaste for improving tooth sensitivity and whitening</li>
            <li> Novamin is the most exciting thing to happen to toothpaste, well since, the invention of toothpaste! It&#x27;s some kind of miracle calcium/glass/silica formula that when it mixes with your saliva will penetrate your exposed dentin and form a layer of protection over and in the exposed dentin, in a sense remineralizing them. This layer conveniently also protects teeth from tooth sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Novamin is available in very few toothpaste formulas in the U.S., I was purchasing  [[ASIN:B001792Y02 Dr. Collins  Restore Toothpaste, 4-Ounce Box]], but was concerned because Restore doesn&#x27;t have any fluoride. Some people are sensitive to fluoride, but I&#x27;m not and wanted to benefit from both fluoride and Novamin. No U.S. based toothpaste contains both ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yay for Sensodyne&#x27;s Repair and Protect. Sensodyne just bought the patent to Novamin here in the U.S., but has been marketing it for some time in Europe and the UK. This shipped from Sweden and took about 3 weeks to arrive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s vastly superior to Dr. Collins formula in taste and mouth-feel. It&#x27;s a veritable blast of minty goodness and is a solid toothpaste as opposed to Dr. Collins goopey formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pricey toothpaste, but worth every penny in its restorative effects and benefits until it&#x27;s available here in the States. Super satisfied and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Can feel it working right away.  This is a stronger sensodyne and I have a small crack that goes to the root.  I have a trick you guys can do.  If you leave the brushed toothpaste in your mouth and thin it with a half oz of water you can swish it directly into your effected sensitive area.  Do this for two to three minutes and it will really speed up the process.  Make sure its warm water so it doesn&#x27;t hurt as much.  Should take less than a week to stop the sensitivity.  This product is superior.</li>
            <li> As many reviewers have already said, Novamin works!&lt;br /&gt;This brand burns like hell, but a bit of baking soda under the toothpaste helps.&lt;br /&gt;As of October 2014, if you are looking for Novamin, Sensodyne is the only game in town and you must still order it from outside the US. (I do wish GlaxoSmithKline would hurry up and payoff the right politician so the competition could come up with some milder flavors.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Important to many of usâ€¦&lt;br /&gt;The boxes are factory sealed (glued securely) and the tubes have the familiar foil seal.</li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly from overseas and has Novamin in it.</li>
            <li> love the price and toothpaste even better</li>
            <li> This stuff hurts!!!!  I&#x27;ve used Original Sensodyne for years and it helps a little with tooth sensitivity.  However, Sensodyne Repair and Protect toothpaste hurts!  It&#x27;s like blowing cold air on your sensitive teeth.  If you brush for two minutes, by the time you&#x27;re finished, the pain does subside.  However, it made teeth that were NOT sensitive, become sensitive.  Also, on the back of the box, it warns that \\&quot;this toothpaste may cause staining of the teeth, which can removed by your dentist\\&quot;.  I was not happy with that statement at all.  I have also heard that silica actually scratches your teeth.  So, I won&#x27;t be using this anymore.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive teeth and I do use the regular Sensodyne and really like it, it helps greatly. But, I bought this new Sensodyne and as soon as I started to brush my teeth I could not get this stuff off of my teeth fast enough. It felt as if I was brushing my teeth with acid. Horrible, horrible pain!  I thought maybe I ate something to make my teeth more sensitive and it was just a fluke, but I tried again the next day and the pain immediately came back.  I will keep using the old Sensodyne, but this new stuff is heading for the trash can.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say this toothpaste works. I have sensitive teeth (some fillings &amp; crowns too) &amp; as soon as I used it I noticed less pain &amp; a bit whiter teeth. This is the first time I tried NOVAMIN formula (which is Calcium-Sodium Phosphosilicate) &amp; I intend to continue using it.&lt;br /&gt;This toothpaste is flavored with Limonene (Lemon instead of mint).&lt;br /&gt;Drawbacks: more expensive than other toothpastes. Also, it contains SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate) which maybe harsh for some people, specially those prone to canker sores.&lt;br /&gt;Toothpaste came from &amp;#34;DirectKart&amp;#34;: prompt delivery (took 4 days to deliver locally in UK).</li>
            <li> I used to use Dr Collins, which just stopped using novamine one day due to a licensing agreement.  The best thing I&#x27;ve ever found for dental sensitivity is novamine, and this has it.  I am grateful such a thing exists.  Second place is a long way down.</li>
            <li> Now this is the only tooth paste that contains Novamin, which I have been using now several years.  I use to get it directly from the company that originally invented and produced it.  But GSK bought the rights to it and now you can only get it from Sensodyne.  If you brush twice, first time to get your saliva off the teeth, the second time seems to become more active.  On your very first time using this product you will feel the product building up on your teeth.  Provided you brush for at least 3 minutes.  It isn&#x27;t a race, and the reaction takes time.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is marketed overseas as containing both fluoride and NovaMin, however in the US the only active ingredient is Stannous Fluoride. Some reviewers are apparently unaware of this difference. Please refer to the label on the box and look at the Sensodyne website to see how it is marketed differently in this country compared to others.</li>
            <li> Great! I really like this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Purchased from and shipped to the United States.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product is the UK Sensodyne Repair and Protect (75 ml) containing BOTH NovaMin and Fluoride (as per the ingredients listed on the package). As I said, THIS IS THE ONE YOU WANT. This is also relatively cheap ($7.98/tube shipped is not cheap, but it&#x27;s not ridiculous either).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The US version contains stannous (tin) fluoride (you know, Fluoristan, from the &#x27;60s), which isn&#x27;t bad, but it won&#x27;t \\&quot;repair\\&quot; the teeth like Novamin is supposed to. Glaxosmithkline has no trouble overcharging for the US version, despite not containing any advanced bioglass technology. In short, the US version was engineered to drain your bank account, not to repair your tooth enamel repair. Avoid the US version like the plague.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a toothpaste, it&#x27;s fairly standard. Average flavor, texture, whatever. There is a slight crunch that might be the Novamin particles, but I&#x27;m not sure how large they&#x27;re supposed to be. Don&#x27;t store it with the cap off or the bioglass will absorb water and become less effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now some background on Novamin? Keeping in mind I&#x27;m not a medical professional:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For whatever reason, Novamin is not sold in the US. It has been speculated that FDA approval could not be had for \\&quot;repair\\&quot; toothpaste (despite the fact that the drugstore is filled with products that promise to \\&quot;restore\\&quot; your teeth). I believe since Glaxosmithkline purchased Novamin, no Novamin products are sold in the US (this includes all of the hippie fluoride-free toothpastes that were available).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product contains 1450 ppm fluoride (as 1.08% w/w sodium monofluorophosphate). I have found claims that the maximum ppm fluoride in the US is either 1100 or 1500 ppm. Regardless, 1450 ppm of fluoride is shown to be MORE effective than Novamin alone (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20546825) at preventing demineralization of teeth. Higher ppm is even better so if you need it, ask your dentist if you can have a prescription for the 5000 ppm fluoride toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However if you don&#x27;t want to or can&#x27;t do that, don&#x27;t need prescription-strength toothpaste, or don&#x27;t want to risk being exposed to very high levels of fluoride, this product, apparently, combines both a higher-than-average level of fluoride (good) and Novamin (also good). It appears that Novamin will simultaneously whiten teeth by causing fresh hydroxyapatite (the primary mineral in tooth enamel - also happens to be white) to be formed on the tooth surface. This is in contrast to other toothpastes which remove stains with hydrogen peroxide and abrasives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With continuous use, Novamin is supposed to build up a layer of hydroxyapatite on your enamel, covering up any exposed dentin and causing sensitivity to decrease. I believe (I am neither a dentist or a materials scientist) that Novamin is more effective at -covering- exposed areas than fluoride, as it is deposited (in my understanding) as a bioglass particle which binds to teeth containing the ions necessary to form hydroxyapatite (which are then released at the tooth surface). That is, the particle creates a local covering of hydroxyapatite, as opposed to the fluoride which is kind of just floating around everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hydroxyapatite deposits are only supposed to be a few microns thick (my interpretation based on this http://www.repairandprotect.ca/pdf/NovaMin_JCD_2011_Clinical_Summaries_HR_EN.pdf), so this won&#x27;t regrade your teeth and fill in potholes (go to the dentist!), but it should prevent sensitivity and protect against future damage with regular use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But again, I&#x27;m not a medical professional. This is just toothpaste, you should be okay if you use it. If you have a real problem, go to the dentist and don&#x27;t try to self-treat any conditions with this stuff.ave a prescription for the 5000 ppm fluoride toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However if you don&#x27;t want to or can&#x27;t do that, don&#x27;t need prescription-strength toothpaste, or don&#x27;t want to risk being exposed to very high levels of fluoride, this product, apparently, combines both a higher-than-average level of fluoride (good) and Novamin (also good).

            <li> I&#x27;m very grateful for this product and for the retailer making it available to us here in the U.S. When my teeth became sensitive to hot and cold substances several years ago, I began using regular Sensodyne and it worked. But a few months ago, my teeth became sensitive again despite my continued use of the toothpaste. After researching my options, I concluded that the Sensodyne product that contains Novamin is safe and effective but I also learned that the makers were not making it available here in the U.S. So I had to do a bit more work to find a source that wasn&#x27;t going to gouge me. I really don&#x27;t have the money for extras these days - I can&#x27;t even afford any medical or dental bills. But my teeth were making me crazy and it seemed to only be a sensitivity issue. I was surprised how quickly my order arrived. Amazon indicated it could take up to one month and I was on pins and needles but it arrived within one week! I use the toothpaste twice every day and I began noticing a difference after only a few days. What a relief!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can do your own research and find out what the product does and how it works, and whether there may be any side effects. You will also learn that GlaxoSmithKline, who owns the rights to Novamin, decided not to make it available in their toothpaste in the U.S. I do not know why that is but I suspect it has to do with the FDA&#x27;s substance classifications and the politics involved with that and, ultimately, it was purely a business decision. I could find no indication that this product might be unsafe or that it doesn&#x27;t do what it purports to do. And it seems to be widely available outside of the U.S. Be very careful when purchasing this particular product that you are getting the product that actually contains Novamin. The product IS being sold in the U.S. without the Novamin, and it appears to me that there are a number of unscrupulous sellers out there, particularly on ebay, taking advantage of the fact that the specific product WITH Novamin is not available here in the U.S. and they have either priced it outrageously and/or they are attempting to make you think you are getting the product that contains Novamin when, in fact, you are not. Look closely at the pictures of the product and be sure it says that it contains Novamin, and only purchase where other buyers have confirmed the Novamin.ITH Novamin is not available here in the U.S. and they have either priced it outrageously and/or they are attempting to make you think you are getting the product that contains Novamin when, in fact, you are not.

            <li> The key question is whether Novamin is a major advance in toothpaste.  I do not know if there is enough data yet.  The product works for hypersensitivity.  I am hoping that it also helps to strengthen teeth.  It is beyond me why, as is often the case, that Novamin is not available in the U.S.  As of this writing, if you want it, you need to purchase this product from outside the U.S.</li>
            <li> This is a really great product. I&#x27;m bothered that it&#x27;s not available directly here in the US, so make sure you select a UK seller to make sure you get the correct product.  Verify the novamin labeling on the box/tube when you get it. This made a very big improvement to my sensitive molars.  It&#x27;s a little expensive, but honestly, the cost of a single dentist visit will buy you enough to last for years -- let alone any repair work you would do without it.  Compared to every US toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used the tube plastic feels paper-thin, and the screw-top doesn&#x27;t thread on very far.  The mint taste is pretty good... it&#x27;s better than any of the US-sensitive-tooth formulas I&#x27;ve tried, but not quite as good as classic colgate mint flavor.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but after three weeks of use, my sugar sensitivity is gone, and my hot/cold sensitivity is greatly reduced!</li>
            <li> Loves it makes your teeth feel like you just came from the dentist</li>
            <li> I have used this for about a month and it still doesn&#x27;t seem to work for me, but maybe I just have too sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I have used other Sensodyne toothpaste products in the past with no problems.  However, I found this product to be too harsh.  I did not experience the acid like burning that some users commented about.  Instead I started noticing that my lips kept feeling chapped, and the inside of my cheeks kept feeling like they had been rubbed raw.  After ruling out my allergy medication, I finally realized it was the toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Right product&lt;br /&gt;Arrived quickly from UK</li>
            <li> 1. Amazon does not specify, but this is the EU version toothpaste not US version since it contains NovaMin which does not have FDA approval, sold by third parties in US. NCBI, the most trusted source link is provided in the comment section. NovaMin is a calcium sodium phosphosilicate dentifrice which reduces sensitivity significantly. It is a patented formula, owned and produced only by GlaxoSmithKline (gsk) in UK. Sensodyne is a subsidiary of gsk and the toothpaste formula of US and EU are completely different due to FDA rules in US. gsk sells the NovaMin in Canada and Mexico,&lt;br /&gt;2. No where it is claimed for sensitive teeth so it may cause discomfort depending to your teeth sensitivity,&lt;br /&gt;3. Amazon sells this for 3 British Pound with S&amp;S in UK. The amazing part is Amazon does not sell any toothpaste in US with S&amp;S since Amazon can not compete with big box stores. Sellers on Amazon are from EU so you need to check their customer satisfaction rating,&lt;br /&gt;4. Regenerate Enamel Science Advanced Toothpaste is the new formula patented by Unilever which sells for more money with the same concept. The two key ingredients in the toothpaste are calcium silicate and sodium phosphate. Calcium silicate is most commonly derived from limestone and is used heavily in the production of building materials such as cement. It is also found in table salt and used as an antacid to treat heartburn. Sodium phosphate is a term for a variety of salts used in processed food to control acid levels and help soften bread. They feature in medicines such as treatments for constipation.</li>
            <li> I live in Maryland, USA, it came in about a week and a half, as it ships from England.&lt;br /&gt;It DOES have novamin, have only been using it for a day, I&#x27;ll try to review again in a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Its a real bummer GlaxoSmithKline bought the patent to Novamin, it was very hard to find any products with it now :(&lt;br /&gt;But hey, 7 bucks a tube is a small price to pay for being able to remineralize my teeth!</li>
            <li> Genuine product not to be confused with the US knockoff.    There are no stain warnings, this is regular fluoride, the US knockoff will discolor plaque which will need to be removed with power tools.    This paste does not appear to have any painkillers so, if you have been using sensodyne as a crutch, there will be a period where pain comes back while the novamin does its dance, use the sensitivity paste first then the novamin, if your teeth can be saved the pain goes away after a few days and you can stick to this paste.    Per performance:  -taste &#x3D; meh, middle of the pack, certainly not as bad as the new colgates,  -foam &#x3D; minimal, keep mouth closed or it will run off,  -whitening &#x3D; acceptable, don&#x27;t expect pearly whites but will maintain a shade,  -sensitivity &#x3D; excellent, no sensitivity since the breakin period.    Recommendation: use crest 3d in mornings to whiten, novamin at night to maintain enamel &#x3D; best balance of price and performance.    Idea: since this reacts with water: apply THEN moisten to keep most novamin on the teeth.    According to GSK the new enamel can last up to 28 days https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;x0uIt2XYXNM#t&#x3D;147</li>
            <li> Prevents excess sensitivity and prevents plaque buildup which I tend to have a lot of. I keep this in stock in my house at all times you cant get this in the US.</li>
            <li> Almost two years using the novamin now.  Would not be without it.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is very helpful for sensitive teeth and I&#x27;m hoping that it will strengthen my teeth and make them more resistant to decay.  It has a higher level of fluoride than most toothpastes, which is what my dentist recommended.  If you stop using it the sensitivity will return however.</li>
            <li> Works great!!! Big improvement in sensitivity!!!</li>
            <li> Last place for novamin I know of, do it is great on my teeth</li>
            <li> Why doesn&#x27;t Sensodyne sell Repair &amp; Protect Whitening toothpaste in the U.S. with Novamin in it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s almost like we&#x27;re being discriminated against.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For readers who don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m talking about, there was a scientific breakthrough several years ago for dental care. A scientist discovered a &amp;#34;bioglass&amp;#34; compound, now called Novamin, that actually redeposits hydroxyapatite (the mineral teeth are made of) back into any cracks or imperfections in teeth and so truly repairs them! For some reason, the Sensodyne sold in the U.S. omits this bioglass, while the Sensodyne sold in the U.K. and Europe has it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this toothpaste is the real deal, and great for your teeth!</li>
            <li> Excellent product as described and used.  On time delivery and seller did a good job.</li>
            <li> I bought the non &amp;#34;whitening&amp;#34; fresh breath version because it is gentler on enamel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have any idea how this toothpaste burns some people&#x27;s gums. I was really nervous before I used it for the first time, because of these reviews. I felt no negative sensations and the toothpaste felt like any other toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I immediately felt a noticeable difference on my teeth after the first use. I brush and floss twice a day, so I am very aware of how my teeth normally feel after brushing. After using this toothpaste, my floss glided much more easily than normal and my teeth felt very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now understand why this product can&#x27;t be found in the United States anymore. It&#x27;s too good for the US. The protective layer it creates is immediately noticeable and something like that will lose the multibillion dollar industry too much money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much for selling this from the UK.</li>
            <li> So I saw this as a &#x27;new&#x27; Sensodyne formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Christmas Eve, I was eating a hershey kiss and about jumped out of my skin from the pain to a molar with a rather large filling. Fearing that it cracked (again) I scheduled an appointment with my Dentist and the prognosis was not good: Tooth was fine, so if I was in pain, I&#x27;d need a root canal or maybe some sensitive toothpaste. (My sensitivity was exacerbated due to my nighttime teeth grinding)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got a mouthguard and Pronamel. It worked fairly quickly fairly well. I also experience some senstiivity to a crown I have (just heat and cold)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I saw this stuff and gave it a try. Immediately, I felt even more protection. The heat/cold senstiviity is gone. I didn&#x27;t realize that I drink such that ice never hits my front teeth from sensitivity when they were coming in when I was a kid. I don&#x27;t worry about it at all. Good Stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full disclosure: I brush twice a day for 2 timed minutes each time, and use Sensodyne Pronamel mouthwash, or no rinse at all.</li>
            <li> This stuff works like crazy!</li>
            <li> Works? Maybe...still testing.  Updated: Still not sure how well this works. I will say that my mouth does feel cleaner when using this compared to other toothpaste brands.</li>
            <li> I got this abroad from an Amazon UK seller and from a pharmacy in HK since it&#x27;s not available in the US. After using it for roughly 2 months, I&#x27;m about to junk it and regret stocking up. I never considered myself as having super sensitive teeth and used to use Pronamel for weak enamel. After using this, it&#x27;s made my teeth super sensitive. It&#x27;s never been this sensitive in my life. It&#x27;s not worth it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using toothpaste with Novamin since it first came out and I had to buy it from my dentist.  It works great and is the only stuff that helps me with tooth sensitivity.  Like everyone else who uses it, I wish that it was still sold in the U.S. and that it was in other toothpaste products other than just the EU Sensodyne brand.</li>
            <li> I have used whitening toothpastes for years, however, Sensodyne Repair &amp; Protect is a cut above. My teeth feel and look much brighter and a more pearl shine. I love this item and will buy again. I had not ever considered the mineralization of my teeth.</li>
