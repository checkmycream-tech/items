            <li>As others have said this is a great deodorant to help you with odor, however it doesn&#x27;t have antiperspirant so it doesn&#x27;t do anything for the wetness.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Workes GREAT and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>Works great for those days</li>
            <li>Great price and does the job.</li>
            <li>Just switched to this from Degree and love it!!</li>
            <li>The silver content is very nice.</li>
            <li>A very nice addition to the Dove line up\\&quot; -</li>
            <li>This one serves its purpose - it is a good quality antiperspirant with a pleasant smell, it doesn&#x27;t seem to irritate skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s always good to use deodorant.</li>
            <li>the product is good.. but its a softer formula than say &amp;#34;old spice sport&amp;#34; .. that being said..</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have any aluminum in it (good in my book).</li>
            <li>Lasts a good while as well.</li>
            <li>This is a good deodorant</li>
            <li>good smell ..</li>
            <li>Loved this deodorant when I bought it, after a week my skin started getting irritated and could not use it anymore.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because it was on sale and it ended up being really good.</li>
            <li>Price is good.</li>
            <li>Smells good.</li>
            <li>Smells good.</li>
            <li>And not in a good way.  </li>
            <li>Remember, a deodorant doesn&#x27;t keep you from sweating, it just makes you smell good.</li>
            <li>I have become fairly picky when it comes to my deodorant.</li>
            <li>Good deodorant.  </li>
            <li>The test of a good deodorant is: Is there any under your arms when you get your shower at night?  </li>
            <li>and it keeps me smelling good,</li>
            <li>If you are in the market for a deodorant without an antiperspirant, this is a good choice.</li>
            <li>It kept him smelling good throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Still, the quality is good.</li>
            <li>my wife is a good sport, but even she has limits.</li>
            <li>Not too strong, but very pleasant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been very pleased with this product and have no complaints with the application.</li>
            <li>good product and effective</li>
            <li>I love this deodorant!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Seller was great and price was cheap compared to walmart.</li>
            <li>Has a nice scent and doesn&#x27;t make me itchy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not kidding about my girlfriend loving it though.</li>
            <li>Nice fragrance</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m kind of picky when it comes to deodorant.</li>
            <li>The moisturizer is a really nice touch.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t cause irritation and has a nice scent.</li>
            <li>Smells nice.</li>
            <li>but, it does a fairly good job at protecting you within 24 hrs of the day when you need it most.</li>
            <li>The scent has a laid-back mystery kind of metallic tones to it.</li>
            <li>This deodorant has a nice fragrance and it worked well for my husband.  </li>
            <li>Almay Hypoallergenic deodorant and/or antiperspirant had been best in terms of being smell free &amp; rash free; don&#x27;t remember the duration of its effectiveness.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s has a good price walmart cost more than here.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just my own ignorance, but I assumed all these had antiperspirants this</li>
            <li>Until that point I liked it but the burning rash is a deal killer.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice smell.  </li>
            <li>does the job and has a nice smell.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>Great scent, very effective, not irritating.</li>
            <li>This deodorant has a great smell to it and lasts a full day.</li>
            <li>The Dove Men+Care Cool Silver deodorant is attractively packaged, has an attractive scent, feels cool when you put it on, and works well for controlling armpit odor.</li>
            <li>It does smell good but not to strong.</li>
            <li>great price and quick delivery</li>
            <li>This is my husband&#x27;s favorite deodorant and I&#x27;m so glad I can Subscribe &amp; Save to this!</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s been the best deoderant I have used.</li>
            <li>This is more of a gel kind.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall: For a more effective beat-the-heat stick for your pits, I would suggest getting the Antiperspirant, but if you&#x27;re shopping exclusively for a Deodorant, this gets my seal of approval.</li>
            <li>It is not overpowering, so this proves to be a great deodorant to use because it also works as it should.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t sticky, applies easily, and works!</li>
            <li>It was great at the beginning, but like others that have reviewed the product, it too caused some irritation by the end of the first week.  </li>
            <li>This Dove \\&quot;Cool Silver Deodorant\\&quot; is effective at controlling body-odor, while have a pleasant light scent of</li>
            <li>It glides on very smoothly.</li>
            <li>My favorite is their talc roll on vs this one that is a moisturizing roll on.  </li>
            <li>The scent is better on this one, but the talc stops sweat considerably better.</li>
            <li>I tend to get rash from many deodorants.  </li>
            <li>I love the Dove Men deodorant.</li>
            <li>This scent is refreshing.</li>
            <li>Love this deodorant.  </li>
            <li>only use deoderant and this is the best I&#x27;ve ever bought.  </li>
            <li>but I love Dover shower products.  </li>
            <li>but I still like Mitchem better.</li>
            <li>Outstanding odor protection.</li>
            <li>It stays on quite some time, and while you can feel that its on (which I love it</li>
            <li>My favorite deodorant now.  </li>
            <li>I purposely sought out a product that was designed to combat this most annoying-all-day affliction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One of the better deodorants I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Love the smell of this deodorant</li>
            <li>My review is more about the price.</li>
            <li>, I think it would be a much better product.</li>
            <li>deodorant/anti-perspirant don&#x27;t leave that residue that use to stain your dress shirt&#x27;s underarm area as they were famous for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Men&#x27;s</li>
            <li>The truth is, women&#x27;s deodorants are made better and stronger.  </li>
            <li>Bought 10 as filler items, they were okay.</li>
            <li>My hubby and I love the scent.  </li>
            <li>The white stuff that stays on the surface is probably the best since it doesn&#x27;t seem to block your pores.</li>
            <li>He was unwilling to put the claim of 48 hour protection to the test - a decision I was secretly glad for.  </li>
            <li>They are his favorite products to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, he recommends this product, along with most all of the Dove Men products.</li>
            <li>for most men.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, not to mention my GF does, too.</li>
            <li>I love dove</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d pay $4 to $5 at the most.</li>
            <li>When I exercise I put on more after I</li>
            <li>Every deodorant should do two things in order to be a success: it should smell good and it should make you not stink.</li>
            <li>That earns it a top rating in my book.</li>
            <li>This product seems OK.</li>
            <li>Protects for 24 hours for sure, and smells great!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a nice clean waterish smell to it.</li>
            <li>This keeps me smelling pretty good and doesn&#x27;t irritate, but it also reinforced to me that even in the winter, I perspire.  </li>
            <li>Products with the Dove name are usually pretty good.</li>
            <li>Price is pretty fair here.</li>
            <li>Dove mens care product have proven to be pretty good.</li>
            <li>, feeling pretty good about the chemistry, how does it work?</li>
            <li>The cool silver deodorant from Dove Men has a nice scent, although I personally don&#x27;t love it, the application goes on smooth and I haven&#x27;t had any irritation.</li>
            <li>It claims 48 hour protection, and I have not tested that, but after 24 hours I still feel and smell clean!</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;2- able to keep underarms comfortable during the summer heat wave&lt;br /&gt;3-</li>
            <li>Biggest bonus is the Dove for Men deodorants are all really great with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>stuff is like an incredible foam party about ten minutes after applying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The rash was gone within days, this holds up all day as you&#x27;d expect, smells generically &amp;#34;man&#x27;s deodorant&amp;#34;-ish and, most importantly for me,</li>
            <li>Better than some of the &amp;#34;Natural&amp;#34; products available.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m pretty impressed.</li>
            <li>The Cool Silver deodorant has a nice, clean smell to it and is able to keep me smelling fine all day.</li>
            <li>My additions: Silver as an ingredient is very nice because it&#x27;s naturally antibacterial, and bacteria is often the cause of odors.</li>
            <li>I think that&#x27;s the most straightforward title I can give</li>
            <li>really impressed me is the very discreet but masculine smell.  </li>
            <li>So it may take some time to compare with Dove Clean Comfort if presence of the silver  compound is meaningful.</li>
            <li>While strong, I still found the scent to be pleasing.</li>
            <li>Strong deodorant and</li>
            <li>Degree so slimy and itches my armpit and smell soooooo strong</li>
            <li>The product itself had a strong distinctive, yet not overpowering scent.</li>
            <li>both love how Cool Silver works and smells.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice at first, but eventually disappears like it should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>has successfully re-branded itself as a masculine line as well.</li>
            <li>really not bad, and no concentration that I could discern of that dreaded aluminum that is found in so many antiperspirants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve had some good chances to try out this new \\&quot;Men+Care\\&quot; deodorant from Dove.</li>
            <li>I am allergic to the antiperspirant so just the deodorant works fine for me.</li>
            <li>Perhaps best of all, I was never consciously aware that I was actually wearing deodorant, so it worked very effectively in an unobtrusive manner.</li>
            <li>Other than that the scent is pleasant (of course it better be for $5 @#$%ing deodorant!).</li>
            <li>I added this item on to qualify for free shipping.</li>
            <li>Comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>smooth keeps me</li>
            <li>The fragrance is kind of intense.</li>
            <li>It felt like I was wearing a cheap cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It runs on smooth.</li>
            <li>Has a great smell and comes in a blue stick form.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;A nice, gentle citrusy scent in this deodorant.</li>
            <li>It went on smooth, was nonirritating and protected well.  </li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s cheap for a reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The gel applies smoothly and there was no sign of irritation or dissipation of fragrance throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and didn&#x27;t to good</li>
            <li>either so this is a really good product for men with sensitive underarms.</li>
            <li>Smells good, doesn&#x27;t leave marks, no little white hanging balls, hubby&#x27;s happy with it.</li>
            <li>deodorant did not irritate my skin, and has a nice smell - not overly powerful, but there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worked as intended, and like all the other Dove products I&#x27;ve tried or purchased over the years I would happily recommend this one as well.</li>
            <li>I love this deodorant, doesn&#x27;t leave any mark on the clothes, it&#x27;s not sticky even when you wet it or try to clean and works great in preventing odors and sweat.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re looking for something with more of a straight edge scent that doesn&#x27;t have an overwhelming smell give this cool silver a try.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t give me a rash, goes on smooth and smells clean without being overly perfumed.</li>
            <li>I had been looking for new deodorant, and this stuff fit the bill nicely.  </li>
            <li>The smell is kind of strong, but just smells like soap, slightly masculine though.</li>
            <li>Keeps me so fresh and so clean, clean!</li>
            <li>I feel safe in saying that Dove really has cornered the market on great personal care products at an affordable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great smell and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Works great, all day long!</li>
            <li>Great deodorant that really works and offers protection like it is supposed too.</li>
            <li>Although I have not tested the &amp;#34;48h powerful protection&amp;#34; claim (which I really have no intentions of doing), it keeps me smelling nice throughout the day.</li>
            <li>deodorant works great when I wear it a work or other events with light activity.  </li>
            <li>Speed Stick Ocean Surf &amp; Dove Clean Comfort have milder &amp; preferable fragrance than Dove Cool Silver.</li>
            <li>Switched to the new Degree &#x27;dry spray&#x27; which I&#x27;ve been really impressed by.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t mind, people just say I smell clean, way better than smelling like funk.</li>
            <li>I will wear it to my job because it is safer than other deodorant options (and it does smell nice), but I will have to look elsewhere for a safe and strong deodorant.</li>
            <li>It does nor cause me to break out with an underarm rash as many of the anti-antiperspirants do, and the deodorant effect lasts for a reasonable time.  </li>
            <li>This product has a nice masculine smell, I like it and my girlfriend likes it too.  </li>
            <li>Silver has natural odor repelling properties and I find that the fragrance is also nice.  </li>
            <li>Cool Silver Antiperspirant  2.7 Oz]], which I prefer,</li>
            <li>If you only want a Deodorant, however, this seems like a good bet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since</li>
            <li>That reminds me that I have 3 unused sticks of Dove Cool Silver.</li>
            <li>Cool Silver Deodorant will eventually make you break out in rash regardless of the \\&quot;non-irritating\\&quot; claim.  </li>
            <li>Dove+Care Cool Silver products are designed to be work well but still be non-irritating and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>The container/applicator is nice, it is easy to raise the level, I would use it again, perhaps in a different scent.</li>
            <li>The scent of this deodorant is pretty strong and probably will mask a lot of odors.</li>
            <li>I will buy this again in fact I am going to buy more haha thanks !!</li>
            <li>This deodorant smells fresh and keeps me feeling clean all day, even in the sun.</li>
            <li>too - like a mild after-shave cologne.</li>
            <li>I have been impressed with all of the different Dove Men products, especially this deodorant line.</li>
            <li>Even after soaking my (polyester) shirt (that dries quickly)</li>
            <li>I like that it is aluminum free, too, which is what turned me onto this product in the first place.  </li>
            <li>far, it is gentle, effective, lightly scented and affordable.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave deodorant stains on his shirts and he still smells good after a long day at work.</li>
            <li>I think it is because this certain gel brand, or formula is not that strong.  </li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t leave any stains on my clothes, it lasts a very long time, it smells amazing, and cheap.</li>
            <li>I purchased from Amazon without smelling first, so was kind of taking a chance, but the stuff smells good, not overpowering but not too subtle either.  </li>
            <li>At the end of a 20 hour day my underarms get to stinking a bit, though a quick mid-day reapplication solves that quickly, but took one star away for the &amp;#34;48h Powerful Protection&amp;#34; claim, since there is no way someone could go that long and the deodorant still be having any kind of effect.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, free shipping eligible.</li>
            <li>This product does go on more clearly and keep a fresh smell, so I&#x27;ll probably use it after an evening shower to ensure I don&#x27;t wake up already in a funk.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth buying.</li>
            <li>And it actually smells really nice</li>
            <li>It keeps me smelling fresh all day without any pit smells.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried (Fresh, Aqua, Silver).</li>
            <li>feeling fresh all day.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s what it&#x27;s supposed to do, so overall I rate this as a product that is effective and as-advertised with ONE EXCEPTION.  </li>
            <li>have no interest in testing the claim of \\&quot;48 hour Powerful Protection\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I would like to find something that lasts longer throughout the day, but I&#x27;m pleased with this one thus far.</li>
            <li>Beauty products for men is kind of a recent phenomenon but one that has seemed to have taken root in our culture and consciousness.</li>
            <li>I will tell you straight away that I like the antiperspirant more (though not by much).</li>
            <li>Once you apply it, it dries pretty quickly and you don&#x27;t have any issues with it</li>
            <li>The good smell is gone after a few hours at most, and there&#x27;s a high chance you will have sweat stains on your shirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this since other Dove products I have used have always been good.</li>
            <li>, right?</li>
            <li>products,\\&quot; right?)</li>
            <li>what the right word</li>
            <li>Great value - holds up well, and performing as expected in normal as well as workout use.</li>
            <li>I stopped using \\&quot;Speed Stick\\&quot; solid to try out this Dove \\&quot;Men&#x27;s Care: Cool Silver Deodorant\\&quot; and I love what we have</li>
            <li>It is also great for women and not overwhelming &amp;#34;cologne-y&amp;#34; or musky.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have that slimy, wet feel that most clear deodorants have, and the scent is nice.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is a strong, masculine scent.</li>
            <li>I tend to sweat in above-average amounts, so I think I best stick with the antiperspirant, but so far I have at least not caught myself smelling</li>
            <li>A great buy. will become my favorite for a few more months at least.</li>
            <li>I left the house in a tank top.</li>
            <li>Not expensive and does the job.</li>
            <li>works pretty well</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a distinct scent, but not so intense that it haunts you like a shadow.</li>
            <li>Although, I always like the way he smells after using the various Dove products, too! :)</li>
            <li>Initially I had detested the smell of Dove Cool Silver as it stronger and smelt of cheap after shave/cologne just after applying.</li>
            <li>Make sure it dries thoroughly before you put on your shirt though, otherwise it will leave some white residue.</li>
            <li>Haha!</li>
            <li>There is nothing I am aware of I</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and clear without an overpowering scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This has a masculine smell rather than a perfume smell which is important to me.</li>
            <li>Altogether a very pleasing product and well worth your consideration.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although the smell is fantastic and it goes on smooth and dry.</li>
            <li>the smell is pleasant but not overwhelming and it doesnt seem to have any chemicals that irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>Initially I had tried Dove \\&quot;Clean Comfort\\&quot;, to be followed by Dove \\&quot;Cool Silver\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;Cool Silver\\&quot; smell is a classic sport fragrance that doesn&#x27;t try to go too intense or be overbearing.</li>
            <li>It smells good and is OK for an ordinary day without physical activity.</li>
            <li>My husband loves this deodorant and now won&#x27;t buy any other kind.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not exactly sensitive to deodorant fragrances, but this one felt over the top.  </li>
            <li>First deodorant I&#x27;ve switch since high school!</li>
            <li>It worked, fairly well in fact, just not the deodorant for me, and it didn&#x27;t wow me enough to change brands from Old Spice.</li>
            <li>This deodorant provides lasting protection against odor, and it has a clean, fresh scent.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t stop smelling it the entire day -- way too strong.  </li>
            <li>Was advertised as non-irritating but it certain was for me.</li>
            <li>and I found that after a couple of weeks I had pimples and large bumps under my arms.</li>
            <li>Only reason why it is not 1-star is because it actually smells pretty nice.</li>
            <li>It can be hard to find but they have really good scents and no burning pits.</li>
            <li>As someone who gets itchy armpits, I needed a gentle deodorant.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear cologne anymore because she likes the smell of this stuff so much.</li>
            <li>Real 24hr protection even thru workouts and yard work.  </li>
            <li>so I can be reassured, haha)</li>
            <li>I really like it all, application, feel, and of course smell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sounds like I&#x27;m all ready to go off to work for the day</li>
            <li>is gentle on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After using it for about a week my skin became very irritated.</li>
            <li>The scent is very yummy and manly, but not for every day or usage for &amp;#34;tough jobs.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>, the scent is very neutral</li>
            <li>eventually u will become adjusted to it and really feel it working.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for the pimples</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t sweat that much, but after about 6 hours I feel sweaty and can smell the perspiration.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>not too much else a man can ask for.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s like deotrant much? ?</li>
            <li>I think $7 is too much for this product.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s learned he really needs both an antipersperant and a deodorant both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Deodorant is one of those things where you don&#x27;t really think about it - until somebody tells you that it&#x27;s not working!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I alternated between this and my Speed Stick, and Dove is absolutely my preference.</li>
            <li>I think you could get away with two days if you really needed to, but I don&#x27;t know that you should try.</li>
            <li>it is a better option than a majority of other</li>
            <li>Wow! Works really well!</li>
            <li>I could not use Alum due to many practical problems.</li>
            <li>but most deodorants contain aluminum and other metals anymore.</li>
            <li>I have not tried Dove Clean Comfort recently as that lacks silver, though that may be just a placebo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>the typically last me a full day.</li>
            <li>Coming to the personal conclusion that deodorants are the preferred care, rather than antiperspirants, Dove Men+Care Cool Silver Deodorant works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wear very well on men, it leave a great smell, it last all day at least 48 hrs.</li>
            <li>But again, not a BAD deodorant, necessarily.</li>
            <li>the main goal of a simple deodorant is to keep you smelling good, I&#x27;ll spend a little time commenting on the fragrance.</li>
            <li>Smoothly glides on and keeps me dry.</li>
            <li>After enjoying previous Dove Men+Care products (face lotion, face wash, shampoo), I decided to get this.</li>
            <li>The Super Bowl commercial does not lie!</li>
            <li>Smells good upon application, but it doesn&#x27;t last long enough.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It does a great job at that, having a non-overpowering scent that can complement, not overpower, your expensive cologne.  </li>
            <li>Has a great scent, does the job and doesn&#x27;t feel weird</li>
            <li>I t has replaced my normal brand of deodorant.</li>
            <li>This deodorant is a clear, cool blue and does not leave a tale tell residue that gets on your clothes and can stain undershirts.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Those range from musky to clean scents and it&#x27;s tough sometimes to find deodorant that still holds strong without clashing or fading.</li>
            <li>and I believe it might live up to its hype.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, it’s not an antiperspirant—which means it won’t prevent you from sweating (which is natural and necessary—you should sweat when your body needs to sweat)—but</li>
            <li>My husband has very sensitive underarms.</li>
            <li>This is the first mens deodorant that can actually compete with some of the women&#x27;s deodorants on the market.  </li>
            <li>He usually just wears a women&#x27;s deodorant/antiperspirant because they seem to be milder than most men&#x27;s products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I worked outside doing a lot of yard work and got pretty dirtied up, but I could still smell the Dove scent.</li>
            <li>I just love all their products; with very few exceptions, their products are outstanding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Without going into the full chemistry of every ingredient it is helpful to note the following not-so-familiar chemicals used in Men+Care, especially the touted \\&quot;silver\\&quot; component:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Silver</li>
            <li>Scent variety is limited, but the silver and fresh are acceptable.</li>
            <li>The scent seems to last long enough that you feel \\&quot;protected\\&quot; most of the day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Using this Dove deodorant, I came to the realization that it was not bad, but I still do not prefer it to my other Old Spice ones.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Effective and goes on and dries clear.</li>
            <li>So far it has kept the body odor at bay</li>
            <li>The Silver is a plus, no harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>This stuff seems to go the extra mile and really kills or prevents any undesired smell.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised the makers of Dove haven&#x27;t corrected that yet.</li>
            <li>Dove continues that trend of just keeping the natural scent at bay all day until you shower after work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It says it offers 48 hour protection which I haven&#x27;t tried</li>
            <li>After years of using Old Spice&#x27;s deodorant, I decided to move on.</li>
            <li>Now, I&#x27;m not a heavy sweater, so I didn&#x27;t need antiperspirant.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I did not have any irritations or rashes, but then my armpits have never been sensitive to anything before.</li>
            <li>The smell is very fresh and not cheap like those AXE sprays.</li>
            <li>It has a refreshing mild smell, goes on smooth and leaves no residue or annoying white flakes.</li>
            <li>usually use Speed Stick, which is fine.</li>
            <li>Smells decent, but then again that&#x27;s a matter of personal taste.</li>
            <li>It really stays put for at least a full day (24 hours).</li>
            <li>Speed Stick does not remain as effective as long, which I use now when there is about less than 24 hours between a low intensity activity &amp; the next shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My sweat alone never ruins shirts, all my gym clothes are pristine because I don&#x27;t even bother wearing deodorant; it wouldn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li>The last few years the only deodorant I have been able to use with out irritation is Adidas.  </li>
            <li>It is large enough to hold sufficient product to last quite awhile.</li>
            <li>but it left large red itchy welts on both underarms.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried several ones and this is really the only one which is not sticky or leave a mark.</li>
            <li>I also have very sensitive pits and Dove gives me no problems and last through out the day.</li>
            <li>took forever to dry even following the exact application instructions.</li>
            <li>I typically keep my shirt off until right before I walk out the door, since it&#x27;s mid-summer in the oh-so-humid Houston.</li>
            <li>I switched to the silver from the extra fresh due to the offer at the time</li>
            <li>Goes on clear, doesn&#x27;t leave residue, and I don&#x27;t end up with itchy armpits later on.  </li>
            <li>I sweat so much that it doesn&#x27;t matter what I use, I&#x27;m going to be soaking wet regardless.</li>
            <li>truly offers 48 hour protection and actually eliminates the smell of body odor.</li>
            <li>Bouquets of men&#x27;s locker rooms, evoking barely dressed septuagenarians drying themselves with the electric hand dryers.</li>
            <li>But overall I like the protection and smell this offers.</li>
            <li>So far, though, you can definitely call me a fan.</li>
            <li>With the Dove Cool Silver Deodorant there is no more yucky, sweaty boy smell in my house.</li>
            <li>/&gt;He felt that this deodorant was stronger smelling than most of the other Dove products, but still not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I have tried many men&#x27;s deodorants in the past, and have usually stuck with the Old Spice Anti-Perspirant/Deodorant line.</li>
            <li>Dove a brand long known for its soap and skin care products for women ( its name even sounds soft and feminine...)</li>
            <li>After trying numerous other deodorants, it was with much relief that I finally found a deodorant that:&lt;br /&gt;1- did not cause an increase in irritation</li>
            <li>not last anywhere near as long as advertized.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and have to be careful which antiperspirants</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Just switched to this from Degree and love it!!</li>
            <li> The silver content is very nice.</li>
            <li> A very nice addition to the Dove line up\\&quot; -</li>
            <li> This one serves its purpose - it is a good quality antiperspirant with a pleasant smell, it doesn&#x27;t seem to irritate skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always good to use deodorant.</li>
            <li> the product is good.. but its a softer formula than say &amp;#34;old spice sport&amp;#34; .. that being said..</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have any aluminum in it (good in my book).</li>
            <li> Lasts a good while as well.</li>
            <li> This is a good deodorant</li>
            <li> good smell ..</li>
            <li> Loved this deodorant when I bought it, after a week my skin started getting irritated and could not use it anymore.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because it was on sale and it ended up being really good.</li>
            <li> Price is good.</li>
            <li> Smells good.</li>
            <li> Smells good.</li>
            <li> And not in a good way.  </li>
            <li> Remember, a deodorant doesn&#x27;t keep you from sweating, it just makes you smell good.</li>
            <li> I have become fairly picky when it comes to my deodorant.</li>
            <li> Good deodorant.  </li>
            <li> The test of a good deodorant is: Is there any under your arms when you get your shower at night?  </li>
            <li> and it keeps me smelling good,</li>
            <li> If you are in the market for a deodorant without an antiperspirant, this is a good choice.</li>
            <li> It kept him smelling good throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Still, the quality is good.</li>
            <li> my wife is a good sport, but even she has limits.</li>
            <li> Not too strong, but very pleasant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very pleased with this product and have no complaints with the application.</li>
            <li> good product and effective</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Seller was great and price was cheap compared to walmart.</li>
            <li> Has a nice scent and doesn&#x27;t make me itchy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not kidding about my girlfriend loving it though.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kind of picky when it comes to deodorant.</li>
            <li> The moisturizer is a really nice touch.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cause irritation and has a nice scent.</li>
            <li> Smells nice.</li>
            <li> but, it does a fairly good job at protecting you within 24 hrs of the day when you need it most.</li>
            <li> The scent has a laid-back mystery kind of metallic tones to it.</li>
            <li> This deodorant has a nice fragrance and it worked well for my husband.  </li>
            <li> Almay Hypoallergenic deodorant and/or antiperspirant had been best in terms of being smell free &amp; rash free; don&#x27;t remember the duration of its effectiveness.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s has a good price walmart cost more than here.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just my own ignorance, but I assumed all these had antiperspirants this</li>
            <li> Until that point I liked it but the burning rash is a deal killer.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice smell.  </li>
            <li> does the job and has a nice smell.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> Great scent, very effective, not irritating.</li>
            <li> This deodorant has a great smell to it and lasts a full day.</li>
            <li> The Dove Men+Care Cool Silver deodorant is attractively packaged, has an attractive scent, feels cool when you put it on, and works well for controlling armpit odor.</li>
            <li> It does smell good but not to strong.</li>
            <li> great price and quick delivery</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite deodorant and I&#x27;m so glad I can Subscribe &amp; Save to this!</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s been the best deoderant I have used.</li>
            <li> This is more of a gel kind.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall: For a more effective beat-the-heat stick for your pits, I would suggest getting the Antiperspirant, but if you&#x27;re shopping exclusively for a Deodorant, this gets my seal of approval.</li>
            <li> It is not overpowering, so this proves to be a great deodorant to use because it also works as it should.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t sticky, applies easily, and works!</li>
            <li> It was great at the beginning, but like others that have reviewed the product, it too caused some irritation by the end of the first week.  </li>
            <li> This Dove \\&quot;Cool Silver Deodorant\\&quot; is effective at controlling body-odor, while have a pleasant light scent of</li>
            <li> It glides on very smoothly.</li>
            <li> My favorite is their talc roll on vs this one that is a moisturizing roll on.  </li>
            <li> The scent is better on this one, but the talc stops sweat considerably better.</li>
            <li> I tend to get rash from many deodorants.  </li>
            <li> I love the Dove Men deodorant.</li>
            <li> This scent is refreshing.</li>
            <li> Love this deodorant.  </li>
            <li> only use deoderant and this is the best I&#x27;ve ever bought.  </li>
            <li> but I love Dover shower products.  </li>
            <li> but I still like Mitchem better.</li>
            <li> Outstanding odor protection.</li>
            <li> It stays on quite some time, and while you can feel that its on (which I love it</li>
            <li> My favorite deodorant now.  </li>
            <li> I purposely sought out a product that was designed to combat this most annoying-all-day affliction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One of the better deodorants I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this deodorant</li>
            <li> My review is more about the price.</li>
            <li> , I think it would be a much better product.</li>
            <li> deodorant/anti-perspirant don&#x27;t leave that residue that use to stain your dress shirt&#x27;s underarm area as they were famous for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Men&#x27;s</li>
            <li> The truth is, women&#x27;s deodorants are made better and stronger.  </li>
            <li> Bought 10 as filler items, they were okay.</li>
            <li> My hubby and I love the scent.  </li>
            <li> The white stuff that stays on the surface is probably the best since it doesn&#x27;t seem to block your pores.</li>
            <li> He was unwilling to put the claim of 48 hour protection to the test - a decision I was secretly glad for.  </li>
            <li> They are his favorite products to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, he recommends this product, along with most all of the Dove Men products.</li>
            <li> for most men.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, not to mention my GF does, too.</li>
            <li> I love dove</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d pay $4 to $5 at the most.</li>
            <li> When I exercise I put on more after I</li>
            <li> Every deodorant should do two things in order to be a success: it should smell good and it should make you not stink.</li>
            <li> That earns it a top rating in my book.</li>
            <li> This product seems OK.</li>
            <li> Protects for 24 hours for sure, and smells great!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a nice clean waterish smell to it.</li>
            <li> This keeps me smelling pretty good and doesn&#x27;t irritate, but it also reinforced to me that even in the winter, I perspire.  </li>
            <li> Products with the Dove name are usually pretty good.</li>
            <li> Price is pretty fair here.</li>
            <li> Dove mens care product have proven to be pretty good.</li>
            <li> , feeling pretty good about the chemistry, how does it work?</li>
            <li> The cool silver deodorant from Dove Men has a nice scent, although I personally don&#x27;t love it, the application goes on smooth and I haven&#x27;t had any irritation.</li>
            <li> It claims 48 hour protection, and I have not tested that, but after 24 hours I still feel and smell clean!</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;2- able to keep underarms comfortable during the summer heat wave&lt;br /&gt;3-</li>
            <li> Biggest bonus is the Dove for Men deodorants are all really great with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> stuff is like an incredible foam party about ten minutes after applying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The rash was gone within days, this holds up all day as you&#x27;d expect, smells generically &amp;#34;man&#x27;s deodorant&amp;#34;-ish and, most importantly for me,</li>
            <li> Better than some of the &amp;#34;Natural&amp;#34; products available.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m pretty impressed.</li>
            <li> The Cool Silver deodorant has a nice, clean smell to it and is able to keep me smelling fine all day.</li>
            <li> My additions: Silver as an ingredient is very nice because it&#x27;s naturally antibacterial, and bacteria is often the cause of odors.</li>
            <li> I think that&#x27;s the most straightforward title I can give</li>
            <li> really impressed me is the very discreet but masculine smell.  </li>
            <li> So it may take some time to compare with Dove Clean Comfort if presence of the silver  compound is meaningful.</li>
            <li> While strong, I still found the scent to be pleasing.</li>
            <li> Strong deodorant and</li>
            <li> Degree so slimy and itches my armpit and smell soooooo strong</li>
            <li> The product itself had a strong distinctive, yet not overpowering scent.</li>
            <li> both love how Cool Silver works and smells.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice at first, but eventually disappears like it should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> has successfully re-branded itself as a masculine line as well.</li>
            <li> really not bad, and no concentration that I could discern of that dreaded aluminum that is found in so many antiperspirants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve had some good chances to try out this new \\&quot;Men+Care\\&quot; deodorant from Dove.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to the antiperspirant so just the deodorant works fine for me.</li>
            <li> Perhaps best of all, I was never consciously aware that I was actually wearing deodorant, so it worked very effectively in an unobtrusive manner.</li>
            <li> Other than that the scent is pleasant (of course it better be for $5 @#$%ing deodorant!).</li>
            <li> I added this item on to qualify for free shipping.</li>
            <li> Comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> smooth keeps me</li>
            <li> The fragrance is kind of intense.</li>
            <li> It felt like I was wearing a cheap cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It runs on smooth.</li>
            <li> Has a great smell and comes in a blue stick form.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;A nice, gentle citrusy scent in this deodorant.</li>
            <li> It went on smooth, was nonirritating and protected well.  </li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s cheap for a reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The gel applies smoothly and there was no sign of irritation or dissipation of fragrance throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and didn&#x27;t to good</li>
            <li> either so this is a really good product for men with sensitive underarms.</li>
            <li> Smells good, doesn&#x27;t leave marks, no little white hanging balls, hubby&#x27;s happy with it.</li>
            <li> deodorant did not irritate my skin, and has a nice smell - not overly powerful, but there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worked as intended, and like all the other Dove products I&#x27;ve tried or purchased over the years I would happily recommend this one as well.</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant, doesn&#x27;t leave any mark on the clothes, it&#x27;s not sticky even when you wet it or try to clean and works great in preventing odors and sweat.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re looking for something with more of a straight edge scent that doesn&#x27;t have an overwhelming smell give this cool silver a try.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t give me a rash, goes on smooth and smells clean without being overly perfumed.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for new deodorant, and this stuff fit the bill nicely.  </li>
            <li> The smell is kind of strong, but just smells like soap, slightly masculine though.</li>
            <li> Keeps me so fresh and so clean, clean!</li>
            <li> I feel safe in saying that Dove really has cornered the market on great personal care products at an affordable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great smell and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Works great, all day long!</li>
            <li> Great deodorant that really works and offers protection like it is supposed too.</li>
            <li> Although I have not tested the &amp;#34;48h powerful protection&amp;#34; claim (which I really have no intentions of doing), it keeps me smelling nice throughout the day.</li>
            <li> deodorant works great when I wear it a work or other events with light activity.  </li>
            <li> Speed Stick Ocean Surf &amp; Dove Clean Comfort have milder &amp; preferable fragrance than Dove Cool Silver.</li>
            <li> Switched to the new Degree &#x27;dry spray&#x27; which I&#x27;ve been really impressed by.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t mind, people just say I smell clean, way better than smelling like funk.</li>
            <li> I will wear it to my job because it is safer than other deodorant options (and it does smell nice), but I will have to look elsewhere for a safe and strong deodorant.</li>
            <li> It does nor cause me to break out with an underarm rash as many of the anti-antiperspirants do, and the deodorant effect lasts for a reasonable time.  </li>
            <li> This product has a nice masculine smell, I like it and my girlfriend likes it too.  </li>
            <li> Silver has natural odor repelling properties and I find that the fragrance is also nice.  </li>
            <li> Cool Silver Antiperspirant  2.7 Oz]], which I prefer,</li>
            <li> If you only want a Deodorant, however, this seems like a good bet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since</li>
            <li> That reminds me that I have 3 unused sticks of Dove Cool Silver.</li>
            <li> Cool Silver Deodorant will eventually make you break out in rash regardless of the \\&quot;non-irritating\\&quot; claim.  </li>
            <li> Dove+Care Cool Silver products are designed to be work well but still be non-irritating and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> The container/applicator is nice, it is easy to raise the level, I would use it again, perhaps in a different scent.</li>
            <li> The scent of this deodorant is pretty strong and probably will mask a lot of odors.</li>
            <li> I will buy this again in fact I am going to buy more haha thanks !!</li>
            <li> This deodorant smells fresh and keeps me feeling clean all day, even in the sun.</li>
            <li> too - like a mild after-shave cologne.</li>
            <li> I have been impressed with all of the different Dove Men products, especially this deodorant line.</li>
            <li> Even after soaking my (polyester) shirt (that dries quickly)</li>
            <li> I like that it is aluminum free, too, which is what turned me onto this product in the first place.  </li>
            <li> far, it is gentle, effective, lightly scented and affordable.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave deodorant stains on his shirts and he still smells good after a long day at work.</li>
            <li> I think it is because this certain gel brand, or formula is not that strong.  </li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t leave any stains on my clothes, it lasts a very long time, it smells amazing, and cheap.</li>
            <li> I purchased from Amazon without smelling first, so was kind of taking a chance, but the stuff smells good, not overpowering but not too subtle either.  </li>
            <li> At the end of a 20 hour day my underarms get to stinking a bit, though a quick mid-day reapplication solves that quickly, but took one star away for the &amp;#34;48h Powerful Protection&amp;#34; claim, since there is no way someone could go that long and the deodorant still be having any kind of effect.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, free shipping eligible.</li>
            <li> This product does go on more clearly and keep a fresh smell, so I&#x27;ll probably use it after an evening shower to ensure I don&#x27;t wake up already in a funk.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth buying.</li>
            <li> And it actually smells really nice</li>
            <li> It keeps me smelling fresh all day without any pit smells.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried (Fresh, Aqua, Silver).</li>
            <li> feeling fresh all day.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what it&#x27;s supposed to do, so overall I rate this as a product that is effective and as-advertised with ONE EXCEPTION.  </li>
            <li> have no interest in testing the claim of \\&quot;48 hour Powerful Protection\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I would like to find something that lasts longer throughout the day, but I&#x27;m pleased with this one thus far.</li>
            <li> Beauty products for men is kind of a recent phenomenon but one that has seemed to have taken root in our culture and consciousness.</li>
            <li> I will tell you straight away that I like the antiperspirant more (though not by much).</li>
            <li> Once you apply it, it dries pretty quickly and you don&#x27;t have any issues with it</li>
            <li> The good smell is gone after a few hours at most, and there&#x27;s a high chance you will have sweat stains on your shirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this since other Dove products I have used have always been good.</li>
            <li> , right?</li>
            <li> products,\\&quot; right?)</li>
            <li> what the right word</li>
            <li> Great value - holds up well, and performing as expected in normal as well as workout use.</li>
            <li> I stopped using \\&quot;Speed Stick\\&quot; solid to try out this Dove \\&quot;Men&#x27;s Care: Cool Silver Deodorant\\&quot; and I love what we have</li>
            <li> It is also great for women and not overwhelming &amp;#34;cologne-y&amp;#34; or musky.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have that slimy, wet feel that most clear deodorants have, and the scent is nice.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is a strong, masculine scent.</li>
            <li> I tend to sweat in above-average amounts, so I think I best stick with the antiperspirant, but so far I have at least not caught myself smelling</li>
            <li> A great buy. will become my favorite for a few more months at least.</li>
            <li> I left the house in a tank top.</li>
            <li> Not expensive and does the job.</li>
            <li> works pretty well</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a distinct scent, but not so intense that it haunts you like a shadow.</li>
            <li> Although, I always like the way he smells after using the various Dove products, too! :)</li>
            <li> Initially I had detested the smell of Dove Cool Silver as it stronger and smelt of cheap after shave/cologne just after applying.</li>
            <li> Make sure it dries thoroughly before you put on your shirt though, otherwise it will leave some white residue.</li>
            <li> Haha!</li>
            <li> There is nothing I am aware of I</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and clear without an overpowering scent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This has a masculine smell rather than a perfume smell which is important to me.</li>
            <li> Altogether a very pleasing product and well worth your consideration.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although the smell is fantastic and it goes on smooth and dry.</li>
            <li> the smell is pleasant but not overwhelming and it doesnt seem to have any chemicals that irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> Initially I had tried Dove \\&quot;Clean Comfort\\&quot;, to be followed by Dove \\&quot;Cool Silver\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;Cool Silver\\&quot; smell is a classic sport fragrance that doesn&#x27;t try to go too intense or be overbearing.</li>
            <li> It smells good and is OK for an ordinary day without physical activity.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this deodorant and now won&#x27;t buy any other kind.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not exactly sensitive to deodorant fragrances, but this one felt over the top.  </li>
            <li> First deodorant I&#x27;ve switch since high school!</li>
            <li> It worked, fairly well in fact, just not the deodorant for me, and it didn&#x27;t wow me enough to change brands from Old Spice.</li>
            <li> This deodorant provides lasting protection against odor, and it has a clean, fresh scent.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t stop smelling it the entire day -- way too strong.  </li>
            <li> Was advertised as non-irritating but it certain was for me.</li>
            <li> and I found that after a couple of weeks I had pimples and large bumps under my arms.</li>
            <li> Only reason why it is not 1-star is because it actually smells pretty nice.</li>
            <li> It can be hard to find but they have really good scents and no burning pits.</li>
            <li> As someone who gets itchy armpits, I needed a gentle deodorant.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear cologne anymore because she likes the smell of this stuff so much.</li>
            <li> Real 24hr protection even thru workouts and yard work.  </li>
            <li> so I can be reassured, haha)</li>
            <li> I really like it all, application, feel, and of course smell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sounds like I&#x27;m all ready to go off to work for the day</li>
            <li> is gentle on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After using it for about a week my skin became very irritated.</li>
            <li> The scent is very yummy and manly, but not for every day or usage for &amp;#34;tough jobs.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> , the scent is very neutral</li>
            <li> eventually u will become adjusted to it and really feel it working.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for the pimples</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t sweat that much, but after about 6 hours I feel sweaty and can smell the perspiration.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> not too much else a man can ask for.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s like deotrant much? ?</li>
            <li> I think $7 is too much for this product.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s learned he really needs both an antipersperant and a deodorant both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Deodorant is one of those things where you don&#x27;t really think about it - until somebody tells you that it&#x27;s not working!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I alternated between this and my Speed Stick, and Dove is absolutely my preference.</li>
            <li> I think you could get away with two days if you really needed to, but I don&#x27;t know that you should try.</li>
            <li> it is a better option than a majority of other</li>
            <li> Wow! Works really well!</li>
            <li> I could not use Alum due to many practical problems.</li>
            <li> but most deodorants contain aluminum and other metals anymore.</li>
            <li> I have not tried Dove Clean Comfort recently as that lacks silver, though that may be just a placebo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> the typically last me a full day.</li>
            <li> Coming to the personal conclusion that deodorants are the preferred care, rather than antiperspirants, Dove Men+Care Cool Silver Deodorant works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wear very well on men, it leave a great smell, it last all day at least 48 hrs.</li>
            <li> But again, not a BAD deodorant, necessarily.</li>
            <li> the main goal of a simple deodorant is to keep you smelling good, I&#x27;ll spend a little time commenting on the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Smoothly glides on and keeps me dry.</li>
            <li> After enjoying previous Dove Men+Care products (face lotion, face wash, shampoo), I decided to get this.</li>
            <li> The Super Bowl commercial does not lie!</li>
            <li> Smells good upon application, but it doesn&#x27;t last long enough.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It does a great job at that, having a non-overpowering scent that can complement, not overpower, your expensive cologne.  </li>
            <li> Has a great scent, does the job and doesn&#x27;t feel weird</li>
            <li> I t has replaced my normal brand of deodorant.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is a clear, cool blue and does not leave a tale tell residue that gets on your clothes and can stain undershirts.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Those range from musky to clean scents and it&#x27;s tough sometimes to find deodorant that still holds strong without clashing or fading.</li>
            <li> and I believe it might live up to its hype.</li>
            <li> Most importantly, it’s not an antiperspirant—which means it won’t prevent you from sweating (which is natural and necessary—you should sweat when your body needs to sweat)—but</li>
            <li> My husband has very sensitive underarms.</li>
            <li> This is the first mens deodorant that can actually compete with some of the women&#x27;s deodorants on the market.  </li>
            <li> He usually just wears a women&#x27;s deodorant/antiperspirant because they seem to be milder than most men&#x27;s products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I worked outside doing a lot of yard work and got pretty dirtied up, but I could still smell the Dove scent.</li>
            <li> I just love all their products; with very few exceptions, their products are outstanding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Without going into the full chemistry of every ingredient it is helpful to note the following not-so-familiar chemicals used in Men+Care, especially the touted \\&quot;silver\\&quot; component:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Silver</li>
            <li> Scent variety is limited, but the silver and fresh are acceptable.</li>
            <li> The scent seems to last long enough that you feel \\&quot;protected\\&quot; most of the day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Using this Dove deodorant, I came to the realization that it was not bad, but I still do not prefer it to my other Old Spice ones.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Effective and goes on and dries clear.</li>
            <li> So far it has kept the body odor at bay</li>
            <li> The Silver is a plus, no harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> This stuff seems to go the extra mile and really kills or prevents any undesired smell.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised the makers of Dove haven&#x27;t corrected that yet.</li>
            <li> Dove continues that trend of just keeping the natural scent at bay all day until you shower after work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It says it offers 48 hour protection which I haven&#x27;t tried</li>
            <li> After years of using Old Spice&#x27;s deodorant, I decided to move on.</li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;m not a heavy sweater, so I didn&#x27;t need antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I did not have any irritations or rashes, but then my armpits have never been sensitive to anything before.</li>
            <li> The smell is very fresh and not cheap like those AXE sprays.</li>
            <li> It has a refreshing mild smell, goes on smooth and leaves no residue or annoying white flakes.</li>
            <li> usually use Speed Stick, which is fine.</li>
            <li> Smells decent, but then again that&#x27;s a matter of personal taste.</li>
            <li> It really stays put for at least a full day (24 hours).</li>
            <li> Speed Stick does not remain as effective as long, which I use now when there is about less than 24 hours between a low intensity activity &amp; the next shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My sweat alone never ruins shirts, all my gym clothes are pristine because I don&#x27;t even bother wearing deodorant; it wouldn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> The last few years the only deodorant I have been able to use with out irritation is Adidas.  </li>
            <li> It is large enough to hold sufficient product to last quite awhile.</li>
            <li> but it left large red itchy welts on both underarms.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried several ones and this is really the only one which is not sticky or leave a mark.</li>
            <li> I also have very sensitive pits and Dove gives me no problems and last through out the day.</li>
            <li> took forever to dry even following the exact application instructions.</li>
            <li> I typically keep my shirt off until right before I walk out the door, since it&#x27;s mid-summer in the oh-so-humid Houston.</li>
            <li> I switched to the silver from the extra fresh due to the offer at the time</li>
            <li> Goes on clear, doesn&#x27;t leave residue, and I don&#x27;t end up with itchy armpits later on.  </li>
            <li> I sweat so much that it doesn&#x27;t matter what I use, I&#x27;m going to be soaking wet regardless.</li>
            <li> truly offers 48 hour protection and actually eliminates the smell of body odor.</li>
            <li> Bouquets of men&#x27;s locker rooms, evoking barely dressed septuagenarians drying themselves with the electric hand dryers.</li>
            <li> But overall I like the protection and smell this offers.</li>
            <li> So far, though, you can definitely call me a fan.</li>
            <li> With the Dove Cool Silver Deodorant there is no more yucky, sweaty boy smell in my house.</li>
            <li> /&gt;He felt that this deodorant was stronger smelling than most of the other Dove products, but still not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I have tried many men&#x27;s deodorants in the past, and have usually stuck with the Old Spice Anti-Perspirant/Deodorant line.</li>
            <li> Dove a brand long known for its soap and skin care products for women ( its name even sounds soft and feminine...)</li>
            <li> After trying numerous other deodorants, it was with much relief that I finally found a deodorant that:&lt;br /&gt;1- did not cause an increase in irritation</li>
            <li> not last anywhere near as long as advertized.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have to be careful which antiperspirants</li>
            <li> Dove brand is more expensive, but I prefer the scent - other reviews have noted it has a masculine, cologne scent</li>
            <li> It is to be individually determined of how long it really last by which activity you are involved in during the day/night.</li>
            <li> It certainly won&#x27;t replace my usual (Arrid XX)</li>
            <li> Last for long time ..</li>
            <li> Long lasting.</li>
            <li> My husband didn&#x27;t care for this product because while it relieves the smell, it still left him wet with big sweat marks on his shirts.  </li>
            <li> I switched to this deodorant randomly because I didn&#x27;t like the strong scent of the deodorant I was using.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have any of these problems with my usual brand (Old Spice Red Zone).  </li>
            <li> I like the smell too and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> hope that this deodorant stays around a long long time as I plan to keep using it.</li>
            <li> Kinda strange reviewing a $4 deodorant but</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no Degree by a long shot</li>
            <li> but I havent gone without for that long.</li>
            <li> But, minor issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would need to use this longterm before changing products, but because of the preferred scent, this is one I would think about.</li>
            <li> I purchased this on Amazon as an add-on item, and usually don&#x27;t see much of a difference in other brands to make an influence on my decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does not leave skin itchy or dry, and lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> I stopped using antiperspirant a while back due to the aluminium.</li>
            <li> Really sharp and without the machismo of regular</li>
            <li> you post a picture of 2 sticks and every other Dove deodorant Amazon proper sells is a twin pack, one would deduce they are getting a twin pack.</li>
            <li> The 48-hour protection is definitely not true, not for me at least, but I didn&#x27;t really expect it to last THAT long.</li>
            <li> It goes on dry and protects all day.</li>
            <li> Dry underarms are the goal and this accomplishes the goal.</li>
            <li> It also keeps him dry in the sweltering heat.</li>
            <li> It helps that armpits dry after sweating.</li>
            <li> recommend the green version, it has antiperspirant, smells better, and doesn&#x27;t have some weird ingredient that gives people rashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it gets used up faster, but the occasional &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; happens less often&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Because we all know half an inch of white foam under the armpits is</li>
            <li> Hard clear gell bar.</li>
            <li> only negative is that the pictures shows 2 items but you only get one.</li>
            <li> Used Old Spice products for years, but they started irritating, and leaving red rashes... found this non-irritant deodorant, and all is well again, no redness.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a casual sweater, this should keep you smelling fresh.</li>
            <li> My main complaint about deodorants is the white streaking they seem to leave on my clothes, no matter how hard I try to keep then off of my underarm area when I put them on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not strong enough.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> at first it feels weird but</li>
            <li> I’m not sure what “Silver Technology” is, but it definitely seems to work.</li>
            <li> Dove lasts all day with an active lifestyle (competitive runner).  </li>
            <li> I typically have issues with the anti-perspirant/deodorant in the clearish (blue-ish) products due to irritation.  </li>
            <li> why not ... if you have skin issues, and typically itch with other products, then this might be for you.</li>
            <li> Else, deodorants will be rendered useless fast.  </li>
            <li> Still far behind from models that have aluminium.</li>
            <li> Switched from Old Spice gel to this - it was mildly irritating to my skin.</li>
            <li> Keeps body odor down all day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;If Dove toned down the scent a bit</li>
            <li> Obviously this is just my experience and difficult to generalize to the entire population.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t keep me from sweating at all, but I feel like I sweat less when I&#x27;m not intentionally clogging my pits with the chemicals in antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not an outdoor worker, but typically any deodorant I&#x27;ve tried leaves me with some odor come bed time.  </li>
            <li> I like it, but probably will not buy it, as I would rather sweat less, and so would get the antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> whatever reason, be it the miserable Northeast winter and its accompanying dry air or a change in armpit temperament, my longtime deodorant, Right Guard Clear Gel, started giving me a rash.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoother, nicer, and less heavy.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t have  a strong cologne smell, which I hate, and</li>
            <li> Little to say about it.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few that doesn&#x27;t give me a rash.  </li>
            <li> I wore it for a few weeks, deciding to not care about the lack of antiperspirant, and boy what a mistake.</li>
            <li> The few times I&#x27;ve used it I applied the deodorant and continued with my morning ritual.</li>
            <li> I think the silver goes into your skin with harsh chemicals and blocks your pores.</li>
            <li> but I am not brave enough to test it).</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t really like the turning base that&#x27;s almost like a big corkscrew.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband and he told me that half way through the day he starts to smell himself!  </li>
            <li> I like this deodrant, lasts longer with no strong smell.</li>
            <li> No strong scent and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much less expensive than in our local stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dove products regard themselves as being less caustic than some other competitive brands.  </li>
            <li> will not refrain from ordering the extra fresh again, but the silver is terrible stuff, avoid at all costs!</li>
            <li> I usually use Mitchem</li>
            <li> Almost unbelievable, I know.</li>
            <li> I usually buy 2 to 3 at a time.</li>
            <li> The small amount of silver chloride in the product may have something to do with its effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I usually need to re-apply again around then.</li>
            <li> reliable (not sure</li>
            <li> as my usual.</li>
            <li> The base rotates to raise the product just the right amount as it is used.  </li>
            <li> Most guys are blind to this concept and continue to smear the same useless crap under their arms.  </li>
            <li> My poor husband had horrible irritation problems using various products, including all natural (Toms of Maine).</li>
            <li> For a person who takes shower daily, this claim is impossible to test.</li>
            <li> kidding, 10 minutes of walking around the *air-conditioned* house, just a little damp under the arms, and this stuff starts to foam like crazy.</li>
            <li> Not a great item for me.</li>
            <li> I hate that the only thing that could mask the body odor was antiperspirants, which ruined all my shirts.</li>
            <li> In other words you will sweat but you won&#x27;t smell as bad.</li>
            <li> What went wrong with this Dove product??</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I tossed the rest of it.</li>
            <li> This is NOT to be used if you are wearing a sleeveless shirt, it makes a horrible white foamy residue under your arms.</li>
            <li> Weird,</li>
            <li> Wrong.</li>
            <li> Sorry folks,</li>
            <li> ; but I&#x27;ve unfortunately yet to find it!</li>
            <li> it will prevent you from smelling unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Looks ugly.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s on sticky or annoying in any way.</li>
            <li> It does, however, work for about a day (effectiveness over longer period is severely doubtful).</li>
            <li> This is an awful deodorant.</li>
            <li> deodorant is terrible to the point where Dove products should be embarrassed to carry this in its inventory.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Dove makes some excellent deodorant.  My favorite is their talc roll on vs this one that is a moisturizing roll on.  The scent is better on this one, but the talc stops sweat considerably better.</li>
            <li> Smells great and lasts all day, including scent and perspiration protection. My girlfriend loves the smell of it. Does not leave a stain under the arms, which is a plus.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always good to use deodorant.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t stand this smell- its too chemical-ish. What went wrong with this Dove product??</li>
            <li> I always have the best results with this deodorant.</li>
            <li> I could never stand deodorants until this</li>
            <li> I typically have issues with the anti-perspirant/deodorant in the clearish (blue-ish) products due to irritation.  Tried this and it seems to tell me the irritation comes from the anti-perspirant portion.  This keeps me smelling pretty good and doesn&#x27;t irritate, but it also reinforced to me that even in the winter, I perspire.  My optimal product is the Dove white solid anti-perspirant/deodorant that neither irritates nor allows for the creation of the rain forrest under the arms.  This product does go on more clearly and keep a fresh smell, so I&#x27;ll probably use it after an evening shower to ensure I don&#x27;t wake up already in a funk.</li>
            <li> Great value - holds up well, and performing as expected in normal as well as workout use.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great..and provides great protection all day.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t leave any stains on my clothes, it lasts a very long time, it smells amazing, and cheap. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Really like this product as it is getting harder and harder to find &amp;#34;just deodorant&amp;#34; at the local store. It also works for everyone in the house as it doesn&#x27;t have an overly manly fragrance or feminine fragrance.</li>
            <li> As someone who gets itchy armpits, I needed a gentle deodorant.  Has a nice scent and doesn&#x27;t make me itchy.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just the size to put in my bag.It&#x27;s definitely worth buying.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves the smell of this deodorant. I like the smell too and it lasts a long time. I&#x27;m not kidding about my girlfriend loving it though. She compliments me every time she smells it. I don&#x27;t wear cologne anymore because she likes the smell of this stuff so much.</li>
            <li> I asked my son if this worked and he said &amp;#34;Here, Mom, smell my armpits and you tell me&amp;#34;  Well I didn&#x27;t actually sniff his pits, but I haven&#x27;t noticed any  pungent or offensive odors coming from him either  (no matter what his sister says)</li>
            <li> the product is good.. but its a softer formula than say &amp;#34;old spice sport&amp;#34; .. that being said.. it gets used up faster, but the occasional &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; happens less often&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i would like to see it in a multipack with assorted scents</li>
            <li> I tend to get rash from many deodorants.  This is one of the few that doesn&#x27;t give me a rash.  Still works well</li>
            <li> It smells good and is OK for an ordinary day without physical activity. Still far behind from models that have aluminium.</li>
            <li> I love the Dove Men deodorant. This scent is refreshing. I am allergic to the antiperspirant so just the deodorant works fine for me.</li>
            <li> Smells good, doesn&#x27;t leave marks, no little white hanging balls, hubby&#x27;s happy with it.</li>
            <li> Been using Dove Deodorant products for some time now and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  They don&#x27;t have  a strong cologne smell, which I hate, and the typically last me a full day.</li>
            <li> Great deodorant. Keeps body odor down all day. Doesn&#x27;t have any aluminum in it (good in my book). Lasts a good while as well.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and didn&#x27;t to good research.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The deodorant smells great. It&#x27;s only deodorant, not antiperspirant. I wore it for a few weeks, deciding to not care about the lack of antiperspirant, and boy what a mistake. The good smell is gone after a few hours at most, and there&#x27;s a high chance you will have sweat stains on your shirt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the smell not really lasting, on multiple occasions it irritated my armpits and made them itchy and red. Needless to say, I tossed the rest of it.</li>
            <li> Products with the Dove name are usually pretty good. Their deodorant container is especially nice. It is large enough to hold sufficient product to last quite awhile. The base rotates to raise the product just the right amount as it is used.  It does nor cause me to break out with an underarm rash as many of the anti-antiperspirants do, and the deodorant effect lasts for a reasonable time.  However, some of their deodorants have, to me, a quite offensive smell.  This &amp;#34;Cool Silver&amp;#34; version works for me,</li>
            <li> My poor husband had horrible irritation problems using various products, including all natural (Toms of Maine). But after using the Dove Men&#x27;s for about a month now, the irritation is gone. And it actually smells really nice too - like a mild after-shave cologne. Not too strong, but very pleasant. Recommended!!</li>
            <li> I have tried many men&#x27;s deodorants in the past, and have usually stuck with the Old Spice Anti-Perspirant/Deodorant line. I purchased this on Amazon as an add-on item, and usually don&#x27;t see much of a difference in other brands to make an influence on my decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this Dove deodorant, I came to the realization that it was not bad, but I still do not prefer it to my other Old Spice ones. It does not offer 48 hour protection for me, I tested it out. But yet again, I didn&#x27;t expect it to. But again, not a BAD deodorant, necessarily. It worked, fairly well in fact, just not the deodorant for me, and it didn&#x27;t wow me enough to change brands from Old Spice.</li>
            <li> Love this deodorant.  Keeps me so fresh and so clean, clean!</li>
            <li> The commercials don&#x27;t lie!</li>
            <li> Best deoderant ever.  I don&#x27;t use anti-perspirants because of the chemicals.  They never stop me from sweating and gave me metallic smelling under arms&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only use deoderant and this is the best I&#x27;ve ever bought.  Real 24hr protection even thru workouts and yard work.  A+++</li>
            <li> Not a great item for me. took forever to dry even following the exact application instructions. Leaves a sticky feeling for hours.</li>
            <li> It keeps me smelling fresh all day without any pit smells. Biking from and to class every day in 85 degree weather and I do not even stink.</li>
            <li> This product has a nice masculine smell, I like it and my girlfriend likes it too.  So far it has kept the body odor at bay and I am happy with it.  I also like that it doesn&#x27;t contain aluminum, so it is a better option than a majority of other deodorants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated review:&lt;br /&gt;This deodorant works great when I wear it a work or other events with light activity.  I have found that it doesn&#x27;t quite get the job done for sports or yard work or etc.  So I am knocking a star off (from 5 to 4).  I will wear it to my job because it is safer than other deodorant options (and it does smell nice), but I will have to look elsewhere for a safe and strong deodorant.</li>
            <li> I usually use Mitchem but I love Dover shower products.  This is a good deodorant but I still like Mitchem better.</li>
            <li> Wow! Works really well!</li>
            <li> After trying numerous other deodorants, it was with much relief that I finally found a deodorant that:&lt;br /&gt;1- did not cause an increase in irritation&lt;br /&gt;2- able to keep underarms comfortable during the summer heat wave&lt;br /&gt;3- no aluminum&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be the only deodorant I use from now on.  I only hope that the formula never changes.</li>
            <li> Very impressed with this product, would thoroughly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I added this item on to qualify for free shipping. I had never used this before, but saw it advertised. I t has replaced my normal brand of deodorant. Outstanding odor protection.</li>
            <li> Used Old Spice products for years, but they started irritating, and leaving red rashes... found this non-irritant deodorant, and all is well again, no redness. Scent variety is limited, but the silver and fresh are acceptable.</li>
            <li> This has the nicest smell of the 3 Dove for Men deodorants I&#x27;ve tried (Fresh, Aqua, Silver). This became my &amp;#34;go out&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;impress&amp;#34; go-to choice of the 3 I purchased at the same time. It did complimented my 3 scents well: Tommy Bahama&#x27;s St. Barts, Nautica&#x27;s Discovery and the Bath and Body Works Midnight for Men. Those range from musky to clean scents and it&#x27;s tough sometimes to find deodorant that still holds strong without clashing or fading. Biggest bonus is the Dove for Men deodorants are all really great with my sensitive skin. Never had any hint of an issue with any of these.</li>
            <li> Just switched to this from Degree and love it!! Goes on smoother, nicer, and less heavy. It stays on quite some time, and while you can feel that its on (which I love it so I can be reassured, haha), it&#x27;s on sticky or annoying in any way. I really like it all, application, feel, and of course smell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, also, I&#x27;m a female, if that helps. It is also great for women and not overwhelming &amp;#34;cologne-y&amp;#34; or musky.</li>
            <li> Comfortable to use.Use of fragrence ..good smell .. Last for long time .. Recommened for use by every man a must</li>
            <li> This is an awful deodorant. Not only it does not do what it is supposed to do, it irritates the skin and stings a lot. Only reason why it is not 1-star is because it actually smells pretty nice. That said, the cons override the pros all day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s deodorant. What is there to say? Price was great.</li>
            <li> It was great at the beginning, but like others that have reviewed the product, it too caused some irritation by the end of the first week.  Seems my skin got used to it but sometimes I still feel the irritation.  This is NOT to be used if you are wearing a sleeveless shirt, it makes a horrible white foamy residue under your arms. Looks ugly.  I always use Dove products and this one is on the lower end of the quality spectrum.</li>
            <li> Loved this deodorant when I bought it, after a week my skin started getting irritated and could not use it anymore.  Obviously this is just my experience and difficult to generalize to the entire population.  However, never have had this problem with any skin product.</li>
            <li> It FOAMS. Almost unbelievable, I know. I&#x27;ve tried this deodorant several times in the same conditions--exit shower, wait ten minutes, apply deodorant, etc etc. Sounds like I&#x27;m all ready to go off to work for the day, right? No.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is like an incredible foam party about ten minutes after applying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to be caused by combination of the lotion in the product and excess moisture.  The few times I&#x27;ve used it I applied the deodorant and continued with my morning ritual. I typically keep my shirt off until right before I walk out the door, since it&#x27;s mid-summer in the oh-so-humid Houston. But I digress...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No kidding, 10 minutes of walking around the *air-conditioned* house, just a little damp under the arms, and this stuff starts to foam like crazy. I could not imagine how embarrassed I would have been had I left the house in a tank top. Because we all know half an inch of white foam under the armpits is oh so sexy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This deodorant is terrible to the point where Dove products should be embarrassed to carry this in its inventory.</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant! It goes on dry and protects all day. And it smells SO GOOD!</li>
            <li> My favorite deodorant now.  I don&#x27;t use antiperspirant as it makes my under-arms break out, but this is awesome.  I don&#x27;t stink after running in this.  Silver has natural odor repelling properties and I find that the fragrance is also nice.  I get complements on my deodorant fragrance.  Weird, but I&#x27;ll take it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope that this deodorant stays around a long long time as I plan to keep using it.</li>
            <li> I think that&#x27;s the most straightforward title I can give you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For whatever reason, be it the miserable Northeast winter and its accompanying dry air or a change in armpit temperament, my longtime deodorant, Right Guard Clear Gel, started giving me a rash. I purposely sought out a product that was designed to combat this most annoying-all-day affliction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This did the job, and in short order. The rash was gone within days, this holds up all day as you&#x27;d expect, smells generically &amp;#34;man&#x27;s deodorant&amp;#34;-ish and, most importantly for me, is gentle on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Says what it does, does what it says.  Non-irritant, as advertised, in fact.</li>
            <li> One of the better deodorants I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Not the best smelling product, dont plan on buying again</li>
            <li> Best deodorant I have used in a while! I stopped using antiperspirant a while back due to the aluminium. The Silver is a plus, no harsh chemicals.Goes on smooth keeps me feeling fresh all day. Better than some of the &amp;#34;Natural&amp;#34; products available.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance but it left large red itchy welts on both underarms.  Was advertised as non-irritating but it certain was for me.</li>
            <li> Loved it !! A great buy. will become my favorite for a few more months at least. Will recommend this.</li>
            <li> Awesome deodorant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Effective and goes on and dries clear.</li>
            <li> I bought this since other Dove products I have used have always been good. This deodorant however is not. After using it for about a week my skin became very irritated.</li>
            <li> I sweat so much that it doesn&#x27;t matter what I use, I&#x27;m going to be soaking wet regardless. I hate that the only thing that could mask the body odor was antiperspirants, which ruined all my shirts. My sweat alone never ruins shirts, all my gym clothes are pristine because I don&#x27;t even bother wearing deodorant; it wouldn&#x27;t work anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This truly offers 48 hour protection and actually eliminates the smell of body odor. It doesn&#x27;t keep me from sweating at all, but I feel like I sweat less when I&#x27;m not intentionally clogging my pits with the chemicals in antiperspirant. The smell is kind of strong, but just smells like soap, slightly masculine though. I really don&#x27;t mind, people just say I smell clean, way better than smelling like funk. Now I have something to wear when I work out to prevent me from clearing the room. Truly a winner.</li>
            <li> Really happy with this stuff. I&#x27;m kind of picky when it comes to deodorant. I bought this because it was on sale and it ended up being really good.</li>
            <li> Love it! Doesn&#x27;t give me a rash, goes on smooth and smells clean without being overly perfumed. Provides all day protection from sweat and odors.</li>
            <li> Excellent and the scent isn&#x27;t overpowering great for work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very pleased with this product and have no complaints with the application. Does not leave skin itchy or dry, and lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for new deodorant, and this stuff fit the bill nicely.  I purchased from Amazon without smelling first, so was kind of taking a chance, but the stuff smells good, not overpowering but not too subtle either.  At the end of a 20 hour day my underarms get to stinking a bit, though a quick mid-day reapplication solves that quickly, but took one star away for the &amp;#34;48h Powerful Protection&amp;#34; claim, since there is no way someone could go that long and the deodorant still be having any kind of effect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not an outdoor worker, but typically any deodorant I&#x27;ve tried leaves me with some odor come bed time.  This stuff seems to go the extra mile and really kills or prevents any undesired smell.  I like that it is aluminum free, too, which is what turned me onto this product in the first place.  Not expensive and does the job.</li>
            <li> i like it but something i shouldn&#x27;t be buying on amazon.</li>
            <li> I like this deodrant, lasts longer with no strong smell. Price is good.</li>
            <li> Bouquets of men&#x27;s locker rooms, evoking barely dressed septuagenarians drying themselves with the electric hand dryers.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is one of the hardest to find in my area. Price is pretty fair here. I usually buy 2 to 3 at a time. Smells good. My boyfriend loves it.</li>
            <li> Smells decent, but then again that&#x27;s a matter of personal taste. Warning: this stick won&#x27;t stop you from sweating! The moisturizer is a really nice touch.&lt;br /&gt;Nice container. Blue solid stick.</li>
            <li> This deodorant does it&#x27;s job well. Little to say about it. Smoothly glides on and keeps me dry. Smells good.</li>
            <li> Dove mens care product have proven to be pretty good. Definitely in rotation. Great smell, no stains, not irritation.</li>
            <li> Goes on clear, doesn&#x27;t leave residue, and I don&#x27;t end up with itchy armpits later on.  So far it&#x27;s been the best deoderant I have used.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this deodorant but I realize with a coupon I can get it cheaper at Target or Walmart.  This works wonderful for me though.  My review is more about the price.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband and he told me that half way through the day he starts to smell himself!  I think it is because this certain gel brand, or formula is not that strong.  The scent is very yummy and manly, but not for every day or usage for &amp;#34;tough jobs.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> works pretty well, the scent is very neutral</li>
            <li> Kinda strange reviewing a $4 deodorant but why not ... if you have skin issues, and typically itch with other products, then this might be for you. the smell is pleasant but not overwhelming and it doesnt seem to have any chemicals that irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> Just as described. Arrived on time.</li>
            <li> This deodorant has a great smell to it and lasts a full day. I work ten hour days and have never had an issue with odor.</li>
            <li> Dry underarms are the goal and this accomplishes the goal.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is kind of intense. Not a big fan.</li>
            <li> Great scent, very effective, not irritating.</li>
            <li> Switched from Old Spice gel to this - it was mildly irritating to my skin. Switched to the new Degree &#x27;dry spray&#x27; which I&#x27;ve been really impressed by.</li>
            <li> Makes my stinky pits smell like a gentlemen&#x27;s pits</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not exactly sensitive to deodorant fragrances, but this one felt over the top.  I couldn&#x27;t stop smelling it the entire day -- way too strong.  And not in a good way.  It felt like I was wearing a cheap cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Dove toned down the scent a bit, I think it would be a much better product.</li>
            <li> If you have a teen boy you know just what boy smell I&#x27;m talking about. With the Dove Cool Silver Deodorant there is no more yucky, sweaty boy smell in my house. Works great, all day long!</li>
            <li> If you read the ingredients used in deodorants you would probably never use them. It gets scarier if you look at the ingredients in \\&quot;antiperspirants\\&quot;.  Dove products regard themselves as being less caustic than some other competitive brands.  Without going into the full chemistry of every ingredient it is helpful to note the following not-so-familiar chemicals used in Men+Care, especially the touted \\&quot;silver\\&quot; component:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Silver chloride - used to make photographic, photochromic lenses, bandages and wound healing products and long-term preservation of drinking water in water tanks.&lt;br /&gt;Poloxamine - reduces surface tension&lt;br /&gt;Aminomethyl propanol - reduces Ph levels&lt;br /&gt;Titanium dioxide - pigment (used a lot in sunscreens)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All really not bad, and no concentration that I could discern of that dreaded aluminum that is found in so many antiperspirants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, feeling pretty good about the chemistry, how does it work? Remember, a deodorant doesn&#x27;t keep you from sweating, it just makes you smell good. It does a great job at that, having a non-overpowering scent that can complement, not overpower, your expensive cologne.  The scent seems to last long enough that you feel \\&quot;protected\\&quot; most of the day. That&#x27;s what it&#x27;s supposed to do, so overall I rate this as a product that is effective and as-advertised with ONE EXCEPTION.  Someone provided an illustration that shows two containers, leading to the obvious conclusion that is what you are getting. Wrong. You get ONE container of product. I&#x27;m surprised the makers of Dove haven&#x27;t corrected that yet.</li>
            <li> I switched to this deodorant randomly because I didn&#x27;t like the strong scent of the deodorant I was using.  I switched to another brand and immediately regretted it.  I&#x27;m a fan!  No strong scent and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I stopped using \\&quot;Speed Stick\\&quot; solid to try out this Dove \\&quot;Men&#x27;s Care: Cool Silver Deodorant\\&quot; and I love what we have here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the deodorants and/or deodorant/anti-perspirant don&#x27;t leave that residue that use to stain your dress shirt&#x27;s underarm area as they were famous for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Men&#x27;s Dove continues that trend of just keeping the natural scent at bay all day until you shower after work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What really impressed me is the very discreet but masculine smell.  Really sharp and without the machismo of regular deodorants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a cut above the rest.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is gel based. It is a solid blue gel. It glides on very smoothly. The fragrance is a strong, masculine scent. A little goes a long way. While strong, I still found the scent to be pleasing.</li>
            <li> I purchased this deodorant on the basis that I was getting 2 for $4.99. Surprise! It&#x27;s is only 1...&lt;br /&gt;When you post a picture of 2 sticks and every other Dove deodorant Amazon proper sells is a twin pack, one would deduce they are getting a twin pack. Other than that the scent is pleasant (of course it better be for $5 @#$%ing deodorant!).</li>
            <li> Smells good upon application, but it doesn&#x27;t last long enough. It&#x27;s just not strong enough. Switching back to Mitchum for full-day protection.</li>
            <li> I have become fairly picky when it comes to my deodorant. I don&#x27;t like the kinds that flake off and discolor your clothes. This is more of a gel kind. Once you apply it, it dries pretty quickly and you don&#x27;t have any issues with it flaking onto your clothes. It has a nice clean waterish smell to it. I have bought it multiple times and would recommend!</li>
            <li> Good deodorant.  Doesn&#x27;t cause irritation and has a nice scent.</li>
            <li> Smells great lasts all day</li>
            <li> I like the aroma, and that it is just deodorant, so it will not block your skin from breathing.  In other words you will sweat but you won&#x27;t smell as bad.</li>
            <li> This is deodorant. It runs on smooth. Smells nice. Attracts the ladies. Watch out Axe.</li>
            <li> I have been impressed with all of the different Dove Men products, especially this deodorant line. It is the only deodorant I have found that works 12+ hours. I don&#x27;t use anti-persperent because I want to avoid the aluminum in them.</li>
            <li> Coming to the personal conclusion that deodorants are the preferred care, rather than antiperspirants, Dove Men+Care Cool Silver Deodorant works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus far, it is gentle, effective, lightly scented and affordable.</li>
            <li> As others have said this is a great deodorant to help you with odor, however it doesn&#x27;t have antiperspirant so it doesn&#x27;t do anything for the wetness. For me I need both, deodorant and antiperspirant so I have to say this is a pass for me.</li>
            <li> This is the first mens deodorant that can actually compete with some of the women&#x27;s deodorants on the market.  The truth is, women&#x27;s deodorants are made better and stronger.  Most guys are blind to this concept and continue to smear the same useless crap under their arms.  Dove has hit a home run here.  The test of a good deodorant is: Is there any under your arms when you get your shower at night?  If you notice that it is still there, it is still working.  I am not talking about caking it on either.  I am talking about one or two swipes.  Dove lasts all day with an active lifestyle (competitive runner).  Excellent product!</li>
            <li> Great deodorant that really works and offers protection like it is supposed too. Has a great smell and comes in a blue stick form. It says it offers 48 hour protection which I haven&#x27;t tried but I know it is still working after 15-17 hours. I can&#x27;t go longer without a shower unless camping or something. But overall I like the protection and smell this offers. Great product.</li>
            <li> Bought 10 as filler items, they were okay.</li>
            <li> The Dove Men+Care Cool Silver deodorant is attractively packaged, has an attractive scent, feels cool when you put it on, and works well for controlling armpit odor. The small amount of silver chloride in the product may have something to do with its effectiveness. Give it a try and you may be impressed.</li>
            <li> I was not expecting it to be the gel version.</li>
            <li> My hubby and I love the scent.  It also keeps him dry in the sweltering heat. Will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> at first it feels weird but eventually u will become adjusted to it and really feel it working.  i would and will buy again and recommend it.</li>
            <li> Reviewed by my husband, John: \\&quot;A nice, gentle citrusy scent in this deodorant. The silver content is very nice. It isn&#x27;t sticky, applies easily, and works! It claims 48 hour protection, and I have not tested that, but after 24 hours I still feel and smell clean! A very nice addition to the Dove line up\\&quot; - My additions: Silver as an ingredient is very nice because it&#x27;s naturally antibacterial, and bacteria is often the cause of odors.</li>
            <li> First deodorant I&#x27;ve switch since high school! Now that&#x27;s saying quite a lot for me. It&#x27;s no Degree by a long shot but, it does a fairly good job at protecting you within 24 hrs of the day when you need it most. However I don&#x27;t give into the 48 hrs they claim it be. It is to be individually determined of how long it really last by which activity you are involved in during the day/night. Everybody perspires differently. The scent has a laid-back mystery kind of metallic tones to it. So if you&#x27;re looking for something with more of a straight edge scent that doesn&#x27;t have an overwhelming smell give this cool silver a try.</li>
            <li> After years of using Old Spice&#x27;s deodorant, I decided to move on. After enjoying previous Dove Men+Care products (face lotion, face wash, shampoo), I decided to get this. Now, I&#x27;m not a heavy sweater, so I didn&#x27;t need antiperspirant. The Cool Silver deodorant has a nice, clean smell to it and is able to keep me smelling fine all day. Although I have not tested the &amp;#34;48h powerful protection&amp;#34; claim (which I really have no intentions of doing), it keeps me smelling nice throughout the day. Dove Men+Care delivers once again.</li>
            <li> I switched to the silver from the extra fresh due to the offer at the time and I found that after a couple of weeks I had pimples and large bumps under my arms. This has never happened, EVER. Dove should do some more testing when they get bored with their lineup and feel the need to get hip with product designs. The white stuff that stays on the surface is probably the best since it doesn&#x27;t seem to block your pores. I think the silver goes into your skin with harsh chemicals and blocks your pores. The bumps hurt, but they are going away after washing with olive oil soap - treating my pits now like my face. Thanks for the pimples Dove!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not refrain from ordering the extra fresh again, but the silver is terrible stuff, avoid at all costs!</li>
            <li> good product and effective</li>
            <li> Bought this for the second time. The smell is very fresh and not cheap like those AXE sprays. It really stays put for at least a full day (24 hours). It says it will stay put for 48 hours but I havent gone without for that long.</li>
            <li> Workes GREAT and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant, doesn&#x27;t leave any mark on the clothes, it&#x27;s not sticky even when you wet it or try to clean and works great in preventing odors and sweat.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried several ones and this is really the only one which is not sticky or leave a mark.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;I like the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Does not last anywhere near as long as advertized.  I don&#x27;t sweat that much, but after about 6 hours I feel sweaty and can smell the perspiration.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I have used this once a day for about two weeks, and my armpits are starting to feel dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have any of these problems with my usual brand (Old Spice Red Zone).  I&#x27;m switching back.</li>
            <li> Phoenix has already been heating up to near-record highs so I&#x27;ve had some good chances to try out this new \\&quot;Men+Care\\&quot; deodorant from Dove. So far, I&#x27;m pretty impressed. I also tried their [[ASIN:B00AO379NE Dove Men+Care Cool Silver Antiperspirant  2.7 Oz]], which I prefer, because I like to prevent sweat whenever possible. If you only want a Deodorant, however, this seems like a good bet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the main goal of a simple deodorant is to keep you smelling good, I&#x27;ll spend a little time commenting on the fragrance. The \\&quot;Cool Silver\\&quot; smell is a classic sport fragrance that doesn&#x27;t try to go too intense or be overbearing. It&#x27;s a distinct scent, but not so intense that it haunts you like a shadow. If you&#x27;re a casual sweater, this should keep you smelling fresh. I tend to sweat in above-average amounts, so I think I best stick with the antiperspirant, but so far I have at least not caught myself smelling bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: For a more effective beat-the-heat stick for your pits, I would suggest getting the Antiperspirant, but if you&#x27;re shopping exclusively for a Deodorant, this gets my seal of approval. I like the scent and it keeps me smelling good, not too much else a man can ask for.</li>
            <li> This deodorant has a nice fragrance and it worked well for my husband.  It went on smooth, was nonirritating and protected well.  It also did not leave any marks on his clothes after application.  He was unwilling to put the claim of 48 hour protection to the test - a decision I was secretly glad for.  If you are in the market for a deodorant without an antiperspirant, this is a good choice.</li>
            <li> My main complaint about deodorants is the white streaking they seem to leave on my clothes, no matter how hard I try to keep then off of my underarm area when I put them on. This deodorant is a clear, cool blue and does not leave a tale tell residue that gets on your clothes and can stain undershirts.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is that of a spicy &#x60;man&#x27; scent. It is not overpowering, so this proves to be a great deodorant to use because it also works as it should.</li>
            <li> My husband loves the Dove Men line! They are his favorite products to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This review is his opinion, not mine. Although, I always like the way he smells after using the various Dove products, too! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He felt that this deodorant was stronger smelling than most of the other Dove products, but still not overwhelming. It smells manly! It kept him smelling good throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, he recommends this product, along with most all of the Dove Men products.</li>
            <li> Wear very well on men, it leave a great smell, it last all day at least 48 hrs. for most men.</li>
            <li> I have been using Speed Stick \\&quot;Ocean Surf\\&quot; deodorant for a while now. Wanting to change to another deodorant in terms of scent &amp; effectiveness, I came upon Dove deodorants. Initially I had tried Dove \\&quot;Clean Comfort\\&quot;, to be followed by Dove \\&quot;Cool Silver\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both Speed Stick Ocean Surf &amp; Dove Clean Comfort have milder &amp; preferable fragrance than Dove Cool Silver. Initially I had detested the smell of Dove Cool Silver as it stronger and smelt of cheap after shave/cologne just after applying. After some months use, smell does not bother me. The smell does mellow out over 1-2 hours. I have not tried Dove Clean Comfort recently as that lacks silver, though that may be just a placebo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no interest in testing the claim of \\&quot;48 hour Powerful Protection\\&quot;. It does, however, work for about a day (effectiveness over longer period is severely doubtful). I use it when I will be sweating or won&#x27;t have a  shower until next day. Even after soaking my (polyester) shirt (that dries quickly) after playing tennis, armpits do not reek. Speed Stick does not remain as effective as long, which I use now when there is about less than 24 hours between a low intensity activity &amp; the next shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;( Before and/or along with Speed Stick, I had tried Tom&#x27;s of Maine and Micthum deodorants and/or antiperspirants, which were itchy. I could not use Alum due to many practical problems. Almay Hypoallergenic deodorant and/or antiperspirant had been best in terms of being smell free &amp; rash free; don&#x27;t remember the duration of its effectiveness. It helps that armpits dry after sweating. Else, deodorants will be rendered useless fast.  That reminds me that I have 3 unused sticks of Dove Cool Silver. So it may take some time to compare with Dove Clean Comfort if presence of the silver  compound is meaningful. Also will try Almay deodorant again. )</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started using this deodorant as of somewhat recent. I love the smell, not to mention my GF does, too. I find that after applying initially around 7:30, it ends up fading away by around 5pm or so. I usually need to re-apply again around then. The 48-hour protection is definitely not true, not for me at least, but I didn&#x27;t really expect it to last THAT long. I would like to find something that lasts longer throughout the day, but I&#x27;m pleased with this one thus far. I&#x27;m always experimenting with deodorants until I find that &amp;#34;perfect one,&amp;#34; but I&#x27;ve unfortunately yet to find it!</li>
            <li> The Super Bowl commercial does not lie! This Dove product exceeded my expectations. It has a refreshing mild smell, goes on smooth and leaves no residue or annoying white flakes. The protection lasts all day (possibly 2 as it claims but I am not brave enough to test it). Will buy this again.</li>
            <li> This deodorant provides lasting protection against odor, and it has a clean, fresh scent. Most importantly, it’s not an antiperspirant—which means it won’t prevent you from sweating (which is natural and necessary—you should sweat when your body needs to sweat)—but it will prevent you from smelling unpleasant. Perhaps best of all, I was never consciously aware that I was actually wearing deodorant, so it worked very effectively in an unobtrusive manner. I’m not sure what “Silver Technology” is, but it definitely seems to work.</li>
            <li> Strong deodorant and it works well. Make sure it dries thoroughly before you put on your shirt though, otherwise it will leave some white residue.This deodorant smells fresh and keeps me feeling clean all day, even in the sun.</li>
            <li> I love dove cuz it&#x27;s spills bomb and it don&#x27;t get sticky or all slippery or itchy. It does smell good but not to strong. And it don&#x27;t bother me like degree. Degree so slimy and itches my armpit and smell soooooo strong it&#x27;s like deotrant much? ? Haha! And it&#x27;s has a good price walmart cost more than here. I will buy this again in fact I am going to buy more haha thanks !!</li>
            <li> Gave me a rash as one of the questions mentioned. There is nothing I am aware of I am alergic to, I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend the green version, it has antiperspirant, smells better, and doesn&#x27;t have some weird ingredient that gives people rashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also this didn&#x27;t make my score lower it&#x27;s just my own ignorance, but I assumed all these had antiperspirants this however does not.</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite deodorant and I&#x27;m so glad I can Subscribe &amp; Save to this! It&#x27;s so much less expensive than in our local stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We both love how Cool Silver works and smells. Doesn&#x27;t leave deodorant stains on his shirts and he still smells good after a long day at work.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff all the time and is the best for me.</li>
            <li> very good item and very good price</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and clear without an overpowering scent. Not a big fan of all of the chemicals in it but most deodorants contain aluminum and other metals anymore. I think $7 is too much for this product. I&#x27;d pay $4 to $5 at the most.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin Dove Men+Care Cool Silver Deodorant will eventually make you break out in rash regardless of the \\&quot;non-irritating\\&quot; claim.  Dove took about three weeks before the rash came on.  Until that point I liked it but the burning rash is a deal killer.  The last few years the only deodorant I have been able to use with out irritation is Adidas.  It can be hard to find but they have really good scents and no burning pits.</li>
            <li> I feel safe in saying that Dove really has cornered the market on great personal care products at an affordable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This deodorant did not irritate my skin, and has a nice smell - not overly powerful, but there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worked as intended, and like all the other Dove products I&#x27;ve tried or purchased over the years I would happily recommend this one as well.</li>
            <li> This does the job. It has a nice smell.  I don&#x27;t feel it once I put it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has a masculine smell rather than a perfume smell which is important to me. It has not bothered my skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this in the morning and it has done the job the entire day. I have not tested the 48 hour protection and instead use it every day.  When I exercise I put on more after I shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does the job and has a nice smell.</li>
            <li> My husband didn&#x27;t care for this product because while it relieves the smell, it still left him wet with big sweat marks on his shirts.  He&#x27;s learned he really needs both an antipersperant and a deodorant both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the smell is fantastic and it goes on smooth and dry.</li>
            <li> Works great for those days and/or weeks between showers.</li>
            <li> Great smell and lasts a long time. This is the 3rd time in a row I bought the same product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only recently started using Dove&#x27;s personal care products for men. (I guess you can&#x27;t still call them \\&quot;beauty products,\\&quot; right?) So far, though, you can definitely call me a fan. Every deodorant should do two things in order to be a success: it should smell good and it should make you not stink. This one does both! That earns it a top rating in my book.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Price is right&amp;#34; This product does not have aluminum in it. I also have very sensitive pits and Dove gives me no problems and last through out the day. I have been using this product for years since it came out because there is no side effects like I get with Axe products.  Seller was great and price was cheap compared to walmart. Will order again! 5 big ones!</li>
            <li> Deodorant is one of those things where you don&#x27;t really think about it - until somebody tells you that it&#x27;s not working!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually use Speed Stick, which is fine. But it&#x27;s a phony chemical smell, and I notice the streaky staining on t-shirts. So it&#x27;s cheap for a reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Dove brand is more expensive, but I prefer the scent - other reviews have noted it has a masculine, cologne scent and I agree. I like it! But it doesn&#x27;t follow me around. It&#x27;s nice at first, but eventually disappears like it should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for protection, I teach a college class and I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed any flopsweat at 8 a.m. nor students trying to cross the hallway away from me. But I can&#x27;t say that&#x27;s ever been a problem anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really like the turning base that&#x27;s almost like a big corkscrew. I sort of like the easier, smaller knob. But, minor issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would need to use this longterm before changing products, but because of the preferred scent, this is one I would think about. I alternated between this and my Speed Stick, and Dove is absolutely my preference.</li>
            <li> This product seems OK. It certainly won&#x27;t replace my usual (Arrid XX) but it&#x27;s not bad. It doesn&#x27;t have that slimy, wet feel that most clear deodorants have, and the scent is nice. But it doesn&#x27;t feel as...reliable (not sure what the right word is)...as my usual. Your mileage may vary.</li>
            <li> What is there to say about a deodorant? This one serves its purpose - it is a good quality antiperspirant with a pleasant smell, it doesn&#x27;t seem to irritate skin. As for 48 hour claim, who would actually expect and need that? For a person who takes shower daily, this claim is impossible to test. Still, the quality is good.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this deodorant and now won&#x27;t buy any other kind.  Has a great scent, does the job and doesn&#x27;t feel weird (his words) when he puts it on.</li>
            <li> great price and quick delivery</li>
            <li> Great price and does the job.</li>
            <li> Did not like it at all it bothered my underarms</li>
            <li> Almost non scented. Long lasting. Non rash causing. Hard clear gell bar.</li>
            <li> The cool silver deodorant from Dove Men has a nice scent, although I personally don&#x27;t love it, the application goes on smooth and I haven&#x27;t had any irritation. It lasts all day with no need for reapplication. The container/applicator is nice, it is easy to raise the level, I would use it again, perhaps in a different scent.</li>
            <li> My husband has very sensitive underarms. He usually just wears a women&#x27;s deodorant/antiperspirant because they seem to be milder than most men&#x27;s products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Dove+Care Cool Silver products are designed to be work well but still be non-irritating and moisturizing. Dove has always nailed the moisturizing with their products. I just love all their products; with very few exceptions, their products are outstanding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband has been using this for a couple of weeks now and has had no irritation but hasn&#x27;t had problems with odor either so this is a really good product for men with sensitive underarms.</li>
            <li> Beauty products for men is kind of a recent phenomenon but one that has seemed to have taken root in our culture and consciousness. Dove a brand long known for its soap and skin care products for women ( its name even sounds soft and feminine...) has successfully re-branded itself as a masculine line as well. The product itself had a strong distinctive, yet not overpowering scent. The gel applies smoothly and there was no sign of irritation or dissipation of fragrance throughout the day. It claims to give 24 hour protection from odor and I believe it might live up to its hype. Altogether a very pleasing product and well worth your consideration.</li>
            <li> This Dove \\&quot;Cool Silver Deodorant\\&quot; is effective at controlling body-odor, while have a pleasant light scent of it&#x27;s own. I have very sensitive skin and have to be careful which antiperspirants I use, but this one has not bothered me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very good deodorant that works well and smells great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CFH</li>
            <li> I will tell you straight away that I like the antiperspirant more (though not by much). The scent of this deodorant is pretty strong and probably will mask a lot of odors. Remember, it is not an antiperspirant. It did not reduce my sweating. I worked outside doing a lot of yard work and got pretty dirtied up, but I could still smell the Dove scent. Sorry folks, but I wasn&#x27;t going to stay sweaty for 48 hours....my wife is a good sport, but even she has limits. I think you could get away with two days if you really needed to, but I don&#x27;t know that you should try. I like it, but probably will not buy it, as I would rather sweat less, and so would get the antiperspirant. I did not have any irritations or rashes, but then my armpits have never been sensitive to anything before.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, free shipping eligible. Protects for 24 hours for sure, and smells great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative is that the pictures shows 2 items but you only get one. So should be updated not to misinform customers.</li>
