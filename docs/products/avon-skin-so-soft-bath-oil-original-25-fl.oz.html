            <li>/&gt;May be good for diaper changes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works great and the smell is okay even for me, a perfume hater.</li>
            <li>Best of all no pest problems; so it seems to be doing it&#x27;s job ;-)</li>
            <li>Huge bottle,  great buy,  </li>
            <li>I use to keep the mosquitos off me AND to smell amazing- add some vanilla oil</li>
            <li>I am thrilled I can now purchase it at Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It smells really nice</li>

            <li>Mixes in bath water or great for applying right after showering.</li>
            <li>But thought I&#x27;d try it on myself first, worked great.</li>
            <li>Love this bath oil</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for so, so many years.</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>Perfect in the Jacuzzi for dry winter skin.</li>
            <li>It easily lasts the duration of the 30 to 40 minute walk.</li>
            <li>Not as strong as before.  </li>
            <li>I put it in a spritzer bottle so it mists out a mild amount and that works much better for me.  </li>
            <li>shipped quick!</li>
            <li>I love the fragrance and it makes their coats nice and soft and it stays on through sweat.  </li>
            <li>Works great mixed with water to repel Mosquito&#x27;s and Sand Gnats</li>
            <li>so soft I bought, thought given the avon name it would be good</li>
            <li>As usual the best product for mosquito control skin care</li>
            <li>I live in a place that&#x27;s abundant with mosquitoes.</li>
            <li>Came quickly, and it&#x27;s a huge bottle.</li>
            <li>ok - doesn&#x27;t really do the job like the skin</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not bad,</li>
            <li>I love this in my bath water, it smells nice and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry.</li>
            <li>Economical and very effective for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been told I have soft skin, so perhaps it really does work that good.</li>
            <li>Right after a shower I use it all over my body</li>
            <li>I love being able to purchase the larger size at such a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>Fast ship.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and it arrived intact with no leaking.</li>
            <li>If you use too much, it gets greasy.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>sure who or why it&#x27;s being done or if it is,but is not the same as the old stuff.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t keep the mosquitos off as well as the older, stronger smelling stuff.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s NOT the classic.</li>
            <li>I have the old bottles from 80s and these seem very watered down?&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li>was such a large bottle.</li>
            <li>It keeps our skin soft</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>so soft does, (probably not designed to)</li>
            <li>I refused to put DDT on my body every day, skin so soft does the trick.  </li>
            <li>Leaves skin so soft.  </li>
            <li>the skin between my toes is soft.</li>
            <li>..and makes your skin soft.</li>
            <li>While designed to be used in bathwater, it is the ABSOLUTE BEST insect repellent.</li>
            <li>I have always loved this product but its been hard to keep a sales person.so now that I can get this from Amazon.i&#x27;m good.shipped quickly no problems,.</li>
            <li>It works very well for dry skin.</li>
            <li>Definitely run a bath and shave your legs - soft forever!</li>
            <li>- i usually put 1-2 cap full into the bath tub.</li>
            <li>But as a product to keep sand flies and mosquitos away (with about 90%) efficiency, I much prefer it over deet and other smelly products.</li>
            <li>I use this in Belize as a bug repellent and it really works great.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Makes my skin feel SO good....pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li> As usual the best product for mosquito control skin care</li>
            <li> I love this in my bath water, it smells nice and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry.</li>
            <li> Love this bath oil - i usually put 1-2 cap full into the bath tub. It works very well for dry skin. I use it for myself and for my kids. It keeps our skin soft so we don&#x27;t need to put the  body lotion after the bath.</li>
            <li> Perfect in the Jacuzzi for dry winter skin.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over 24 years.  I am thrilled I can now purchase it at Amazon.  Thank you for making life just a tad easier.</li>
            <li> As described. Fast ship. Would use again.</li>
            <li> Not as strong as before.  Doesn&#x27;t keep the mosquitos off as well as the older, stronger smelling stuff.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how big the bottle is for the price!  It smells really nice but I didn&#x27;t get a chance to see how well it repels bugs.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t receive what was in the picture.  It&#x27;s NOT the classic.</li>
            <li> Use to mix our own bug spray, affordable and we don&#x27;t have to order via people</li>
            <li> I use this to keep the flies off my dog&#x27;s ears.  works great.</li>
            <li> I have the old bottles from 80s and these seem very watered down?&lt;br /&gt;Not sure who or why it&#x27;s being done or if it is,but is not the same as the old stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for so, so many years. I can&#x27;t imagine being without it. Right after a shower I use it all over my body and it feels great. No allergic reaction ever and it smells really good. Leaves my skin so soft. I&#x27;ve always been told I have soft skin, so perhaps it really does work that good.</li>
            <li> I tried this item because it was bundled with the skin so soft I bought, thought given the avon name it would be good, it&#x27;s .. eh?.. ok - doesn&#x27;t really do the job like the skin so soft does, (probably not designed to) but it&#x27;s not bad, just likely I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Good stuff  I put it on me when I mow the lawn and no bugs no mosquitoes. I initially bought it just spray on my pigs. But thought I&#x27;d try it on myself first, worked great.</li>
            <li> I live in a place that&#x27;s abundant with mosquitoes. No way to take an evening walk with the dog without some type of coverage. I refused to put DDT on my body every day, skin so soft does the trick.  It easily lasts the duration of the 30 to 40 minute walk.</li>
            <li> I use this for fly spray for my horses.  I hate putting chemicals on them so I use this mixed with some essentials oils.  I love the fragrance and it makes their coats nice and soft and it stays on through sweat.  I love being able to purchase the larger size at such a reasonable price.  Shipping was fast and it arrived intact with no leaking.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin so soft.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> the skin between my toes is soft. this stuff is great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of the smell...</li>
            <li> Had no idea 24 ozs. was such a large bottle. We use this in south Louisiana as mosquito repellant. Works great and the smell is okay even for me, a perfume hater. This amount should last me for about the next 30 years!</li>
            <li> Opened the bottle, took a whiff, had a flashback to the &#x27;80s.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this oil brings the bugs to me and I wake up bitten whenever I put it on. Finally once I realized this I stopped putting it on and gave it to a friend!</li>
            <li> buy volume and use on my horses to keep flys off them and they smell so good!</li>
            <li> My dog trainer recommended this as a great flea/tick preventative alternative... So far so good! My furry friend&#x27;s coat is shiny and he smells amazing! Best of all no pest problems; so it seems to be doing it&#x27;s job ;-)</li>
            <li> I use this in Belize as a bug repellent and it really works great.  While others are swatting at their legs for those pesty sand flies, I stand relatively still with an all day application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only down-fall is that it is oil based. I put it in a spritzer bottle so it mists out a mild amount and that works much better for me.  But as a product to keep sand flies and mosquitos away (with about 90%) efficiency, I much prefer it over deet and other smelly products.</li>
            <li> ..and makes your skin soft. If you use too much, it gets greasy.</li>
            <li> Awesome deal for this wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I have always loved this product but its been hard to keep a sales person.so now that I can get this from Amazon.i&#x27;m good.shipped quickly no problems,.</li>
            <li> great as a repellent for bugs on your skin!</li>
            <li> Got it. Came quickly, and it&#x27;s a huge bottle.</li>
            <li> This has turned out to be the perfect preventer of the extra-dry skin that winter always brings to me.  At the end of my shower, I put a splash on the washcloth and wipe over the areas that used to itch and break out.</li>
            <li> Great service!  Great product.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Switched to this product over Keri oil.  Economical and very effective for dry skin.  Mixes in bath water or great for applying right after showering.</li>
            <li> Ok. But did&#x27; work for what I wanted it for.</li>
            <li> 1/3 of the reviewers  said that they used THIS product as an insect repellent. Apparently they don&#x27;t spend time in south Florida, because the mosquitoes merely snicker at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May be good for diaper changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Returned for refund.</li>
            <li> Huge bottle,  great buy,  well packaged,  shipped quick!</li>
            <li> I like the scent. The oil itself seems thin compared to other body oils I&#x27;ve used, and it just didn&#x27;t seem to moisturize as well.</li>
            <li> While designed to be used in bathwater, it is the ABSOLUTE BEST insect repellent. Apply it on your legs, arms, back, chest, neck, everywhere and you can forget about worrying about tics, chiggers, mosquito, and other biting bugs.&lt;br /&gt;Working in the fields or hiking in the backwoods, take Skin-So-Soft with you and escape the biting insects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it for at least 20 years. IT WORKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I use to keep the mosquitos off me AND to smell amazing- add some vanilla oil and you are good!</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best! Definitely run a bath and shave your legs - soft forever!</li>
            <li> it did its job keeping the bugs from bitting.</li>
            <li> Works great mixed with water to repel Mosquito&#x27;s and Sand Gnats</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I swear by it in the summer to keep the bugs away.  It does an excellent job.  I don&#x27;t know if the other scents are a bug repellent.</li>
