            <li>This product delivers results fast, it removed my most of spots and blemish.  </li>
            <li>I had to look up it up to see if this is good because mine didn&#x27;t come in English.</li>
            <li>The first couple of uses was fine</li>
            <li>He ask me everyday if I have makeup on when I don&#x27;t (lol).  </li>
            <li>, I have used other fading creams that didn&#x27;t work,caro white lightening cream is very good!</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable and the shipping was  fast and free from the seller.  </li>
            <li>and I thought the cream would be more creamier - not an issue and just my personal assumption.  </li>
            <li>Since I just got it today, I have nothing much to say than to wait for weeks or month to see the result, hopefully it will do what it suppose to do.</li>
            <li>So I decided to give the cream with carrot oil a try and did not see much difference in the consistency.</li>
            <li>and it works very well</li>
            <li>was very irritated</li>
            <li>I have been using it and don&#x27;t see much of a difference...</li>
            <li>This has worked really well so far.</li>
            <li>As for the lightening component, I have not been consistent enough to tell.</li>
            <li>Yes this cream has met my expectations By far !</li>
            <li>Not to oily, not too dry or harsh and has a nice smell.  </li>
            <li>Not for people who are sensitive to smell.</li>
            <li>I use this cream on my arms to clear away uneven skin tone, and it really work on clear it up.</li>
            <li>I like the results I got from the kojic acid soap and aveeno natural brightening facial scrub.</li>
            <li>Exactly how I expected to be, even bigger.</li>
            <li>it is that I find it a little bit greasy for me but not that that much though I just hate even the slightest grease on me lol.</li>

            <li> Love it&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great!!!</li>
            <li> OMG! Y&#x27;all like bleaching. lol</li>
            <li> Exactly how I expected to be, even bigger. The best so far.</li>
            <li> This product does make your skin soo soft, but I sweat bad after usage as though its clogging my pores.  This happens on any part on my body i use it on. As for the lightening component, I have not been consistent enough to tell. I like the results I got from the kojic acid soap and aveeno natural brightening facial scrub. As for now i am using cerave facial foaming cleanser and for moisturizer I use oil of olay 7 in 1 face cream with spf 30. The crave is really proving to be a wonderful choice, especially if you have eczema.</li>
            <li> it takes about 2-3 weeks before u start to see a change in skin tone but... it works fine... I like it!</li>
            <li> Purchased the lotion first and it was very good.  Not to oily, not too dry or harsh and has a nice smell.  So I decided to give the cream with carrot oil a try and did not see much difference in the consistency. The lotion is not as heavy as the cream and I thought the cream would be more creamier - not an issue and just my personal assumption.  I have a dark mark on my leg and I am applying it everyday.  I am seeing a difference in the color, and it is getting lighter.  I plan to experiment with placing a little on my face for a dark spot and see how that works too.  Hopefully it will work like it did for my leg discoloration. Overall it is a good product and I would order it again.  The price is reasonable and the shipping was  fast and free from the seller.  For under $20 and with consistent use I believe you will be pleased with the results. I use it in the morning and in the evening, the routine/consistent use may play a role in its overall effectiveness.</li>
            <li> Great seller, excellent product, fast delivery. Would reorder.</li>
            <li> I use this cream on my arms to clear away uneven skin tone, and it really work on clear it up.</li>

The good thing about it as well u can track your package.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this products to all women/girls who ant to acquire young looking and great skin looking. I love it so much and I ma yet to order another one soon.&lt;br /&gt;I have used the product less than a month but the outcome is extremely amazing. Sincerely, this product made my expectation and I am so happy that I was able to get it online.</li>
            <li> Was ok for the price and met my expectations</li>
            <li> The product was delivered on time shipping was free great price I will buy from them again. I have been using this caro white lightening cream for a while and it works very well, I have used other fading creams that didn&#x27;t work,caro white lightening cream is very good!</li>
            <li> smells great!!! ive used this for about a week and some days....and its amazing! this clears spots, tones and lightens as well.... its nice.... I ordered four of it so it will last me forever!!!</li>
            <li> The cream is thick and moisturizing. The smell is kind of strong, but pleasant. Would recommend to mix with caro white lotion.</li>
            <li> This product delivers results fast, it removed my most of spots and blemish.  While making my skin looking younger and refreshed.  Thanks for making a great affordable product.</li>
            <li> Very bad smell to this product. I wanted to vomit every time Its opened. I don&#x27;t like it. Not for people who are sensitive to smell.</li>
            <li> The smell was way too strong . Wouldnt purchase again , just wasted my money &amp; seen no results .</li>
            <li> I can see the lighting in my face but it&#x27;s also making my face brake out. I had to look up it up to see if this is good because mine didn&#x27;t come in English. But you include that will make your your face brake out and cause rashes.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I must say I am a mac shade nc45 but I am trying to get rid of a permatan and get a shade or two lighter. This has worked really well so far. My complexion is brighter and blemish free all over. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that I find it a little bit greasy for me but not that that much though I just hate even the slightest grease on me lol. It does work though!!  Either way I will purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ps: If you are wondering this is by dreams caro white not angel but it works the same.</li>
            <li> Yes this cream has met my expectations By far ! It has been a month and it has began to work on my darker areas around my mouth and my neck . I seen results after the first 2 weeks !!!  My goal was to lighten the dark ares so that my skin can be even , My child notice the change and so did my husband . He ask me everyday if I have makeup on when I don&#x27;t (lol).  I plan to stop In a few weeks once I reach my goal . I recommend this cream for anyone that want to lighten their skin or simply lighten dark areas . 🌟🌟🌟🌟</li>
            <li> The standard of Caro White is falling. This cream , orange colour was deeper, now it&#x27;s lighter than before.</li>
            <li> The first couple of uses was fine but then I started itching and my face started breaking out my skin was very irritated</li>
            <li> This cleared my acne and made my skin glow. all my acne scars are gone and I no longer need make up</li>
            <li> Its the strongest product ever.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work. I have been using it and don&#x27;t see much of a difference...</li>
            <li> It is the best. Go for it.</li>
