            <li>Great, spicy, and long-lasting.</li>
            <li>One of the best fragrances I own, bar none.  </li>
            <li>Smells great.</li>
            <li>Eau de Toilette is a scent that is unforgettable.</li>
            <li>Very nice fragrance.</li>
            <li>it smells really good</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve loved the Eau Sauvage cologne since I was a teenager.</li>
            <li>The price tag did not feel good at all at that moment.  </li>
            <li>It gets you those good looks.</li>
            <li>Its subtlety lasts all day and I feel good with it.  </li>
            <li>delicious duration of 6 to 7 hours good projection and fixing a special smell</li>
            <li>I just simply Love it!</li>
            <li>To my surprise, the perfume has its own personality.</li>
            <li>is supposed to be a more concentrated form of EDT.</li>
            <li>is I read an article that Hedione contains a smell that is scientifically proven to trigger sexual attraction in women which Sauvage EDT contains</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>Glad to have in my collection.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>remember it&#x27;s way, way more concentrated that the cologne and must be applied sparingly or its scent will fill the room for hours.</li>
            <li>You may end up in love with this fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Then you&#x27;ll be sure, which is what I should have done, before plopping 75 singles on the table.  </li>
            <li>Lands in my top 5 of colognes.</li>
            <li>Outstanding perfume for a man.  </li>
            <li>Unlike so many cheaper colognes, no one will smell you from five feet away.</li>
            <li>It adds a warm spice that the original does not have.  </li>
            <li>Great, classic.  </li>
            <li>Fine seller, great packaging, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I have worn Eau Sauvage in its original formula for many many years.  </li>
            <li>so if you think it is a more concentrated version of the original, it is not.</li>
            <li>It goes great with a suit and tie, is awesome for nights out, and does well casually.  </li>
            <li>Not too strong, doesn&#x27;t wear off within 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Contrary to the opinions of some others who love the original Eau Sauvage, I think this is a fantastic &amp;#34;flanker&amp;#34; of that timeless masterpiece.  </li>
            <li>This cologne smells fine</li>
            <li>and I still enjoy it after all this time.</li>
            <li>and it is unique people will ask you all the time what are you wearing</li>
            <li>Smells great but not for long.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not the original</li>
            <li>I thought I would try a new scent.&lt;br /&gt;It is nice, but not what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>If it was good enough for Steve McQueen, it is good enough for moi!</li>
            <li>Smells good, but very different from the Eau de toilette.</li>
            <li>I got this rather quickly....</li>
            <li>This fragrance is definitely the most elegant citrus I have ever worn.</li>
            <li>Fun fact: The cap contains a magnet that makes replacing it with a solid click very satisfying.</li>
            <li>It opens up with a similar fresh citrus as the original, backed up by a crisp, fresh vetiver, but the silky smooth myrrh note is what really puts this one in a league of its own.  </li>
            <li>worth noting</li>
            <li>the original has a clean and fresh feeling from the citrus essence, which the new bergamot neutralizes ,its too perfumy for men ...</li>
            <li>It is a fine Dior product, but is isn&#x27;t the classic formula.</li>
            <li>The only time I have found it to feel a bit &amp;#34;out of place&amp;#34; is in the sweltering hot summers we get here in North Carolina, but even then it is nice with just one spray.  </li>
            <li>The perfume has more emphasis on the woodsy, chypre notes like sandalwood, yet it would still be just the right scent to wear to a beach restaurant or garden partyâ€”and would be equally at home around a winter fireplace or at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This for cooler weather, the original Eau Sauvage (or Guerlain Vetiver) for refreshment on hot days, and a sweet gourmand scent (Hanae Mori HM or HiM, or Mugler Pure Malt are my picks) and you are COVERED for a complete fragrance wardrobe.  </li>
            <li>I have heard people say the formulation has changed since the 60&#x27;s or 70&#x27;s, but I only know it in this formulation and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Such a simple composition - it really shows you do not need a ton of notes to make a great fragrance.  </li>
            <li>The issue I see though is that most firms have still to rearrange the cologne in such a novel and radical way as in the case of Eau Sauvage.</li>
            <li>As a scent this is a classic, sort of the equivalent of a dapper blue sportcoat: fresh, well-crafted, appropriate in almost any context.</li>
            <li>A masterpiece for sure, but be careful, this perfume is not anything like the original, is a completely new fragrance</li>
            <li>Whether or not the Hedione in the EDT version actually has enough Hedione to actually make any kind of impact can surely be debated, but make no mistake</li>
            <li>The sillage is great, lasts all day on me and on clothing it will last about a day and a half.  </li>
            <li>It is a classic!</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s a reason this cologne has lasted decades and admired so much that women began wearing it themselves.</li>
            <li>Very manly smell.  </li>
            <li>Zesty citrus and very smokey on my skin.</li>
            <li>Very distinguished and emphatic smell.</li>
            <li>I like the &amp;#34;Eau de Toilette&amp;#34; and this is just too much spice for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Having said all the above, I will also submit to the readers that every one has a unique taste in all they rate, be it movies, eateries, cars, etc.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very versatile and a classic</li>
            <li>The bergamot notes in the perfume are less prominent than in the cologne.</li>
            <li>The manufacturer here is miss leading you into thinking this is the same Sauvage only a more concentrated form.</li>
            <li>Dior Eau Savage Partum is a classic ....</li>
            <li>It comes straight out of the days of classic, masculine, powerhouse fragrances, even though it was made in 2012.  </li>
            <li>Major disappointment immediately ensued, when I popped the top!!!  </li>
            <li>When this might be over powering or too aggressive I will switch to Bleu de chanel parfume (gret for everything) or grey flannel by geoffrey bean (clean scent, old school like sauvage).</li>
            <li>I would say it is a little less fresh, and more woody.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, the aroma of the recent years in E.S has not been true to the original 60&#x27;s vintage.  </li>
            <li>Most of the expensive ones just use high quality materials but lack in imagination.</li>
            <li>It is not and they both clearly smell different and have mostly different ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll probably love it if you don&#x27;t know the original, but if you do, you&#x27;ll likely be disappointed.</li>
            <li>Which is actually not too bad with a good perfume like Eau Sauvage.</li>

            <li> Which is actually not too bad with a good perfume like Eau Sauvage.</li>
            <li> the other is way too complex and reminds me of so many other scents that you can&#x27;t remember but run from.  </li>
            <li> I know that sometimes we feel obliged to buy modern fragrances either because there is a change of times or reformulations have made past juices smell a lot different.</li>
            <li> But when I rationalized (or tried to, any way), in a self consoling attempt, I concluded that a parallel would be, Ford restyling the Mustang after a few years of production with a new moniker, under the Mustang umbrella.  </li>
            <li> The scent does not last for long at all.  </li>
            <li> AS wrtten before the perfume flsk arrived totqlly empty, The cause coild have been a leak because the outside of the flask was all greasy from evaporation.</li>
            <li> I wish it could last a little longer.</li>
            <li> The real meaning behind EDT (eau de toilette)</li>
            <li> In short, and not so sweet, I am gravely disappointed in the aroma, but not disenchanted with CD for trying a different set of ingredients.  </li>
            <li> One the other hand, Eau Sauvage still remains sublime.</li>
            <li> Another man&#x27;s two and a half Cent..iments.</li>
            <li> that will the last I will buy it not happy</li>
            <li> sorry Dior its not the same and a its not better, from a user since 1969</li>
            <li> I have worn ES since the 70&#x27;s and was quite disappointed in the Parfum.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> If it was good enough for Steve McQueen, it is good enough for moi!</li>
            <li> Excellent. I&#x27;ve worn this fragence for over 35 years and I still enjoy it after all this time.</li>
            <li> This cologne smells fine but this IS NOT a stronger version of Suavage EDT. The real meaning behind EDT (eau de toilette) and parfum is parfum is supposed to be a more concentrated form of EDT. The manufacturer here is miss leading you into thinking this is the same Sauvage only a more concentrated form. It is not and they both clearly smell different and have mostly different ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also worth noting is I read an article that Hedione contains a smell that is scientifically proven to trigger sexual attraction in women which Sauvage EDT contains but Sauvage parfum does not. Whether or not the Hedione in the EDT version actually has enough Hedione to actually make any kind of impact can surely be debated, but make no mistake there&#x27;s a reason this cologne has lasted decades and admired so much that women began wearing it themselves. My suggestion is to buy the EDT version, it&#x27;s a lighter smell but it&#x27;s very versatile and a classic</li>
            <li> The sillage is great, lasts all day on me and on clothing it will last about a day and a half.  Very manly smell.  I have heard people say the formulation has changed since the 60&#x27;s or 70&#x27;s, but I only know it in this formulation and I love it.  This is my current favourite.  When this might be over powering or too aggressive I will switch to Bleu de chanel parfume (gret for everything) or grey flannel by geoffrey bean (clean scent, old school like sauvage).</li>
            <li> Great, spicy, and long-lasting.</li>
            <li> AS wrtten before the perfume flsk arrived totqlly empty, The cause coild have been a leak because the outside of the flask was all greasy from evaporation.</li>
            <li> Excellent fragrance. A masterpiece for sure, but be careful, this perfume is not anything like the original, is a completely new fragrance so if you think it is a more concentrated version of the original, it is not.</li>
            <li> I thought I would try a new scent.&lt;br /&gt;It is nice, but not what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> it smells really good and it is unique people will ask you all the time what are you wearing and I love it</li>
            <li> Great, classic.  Glad to have in my collection. sfs s fsf ss fs sf ssfss fsf ssd fssd fss f</li>
            <li> Very nice fragrance. Will buy it over and over again.</li>
            <li> One of the best fragrances I own, bar none.  It comes straight out of the days of classic, masculine, powerhouse fragrances, even though it was made in 2012.  Contrary to the opinions of some others who love the original Eau Sauvage, I think this is a fantastic &amp;#34;flanker&amp;#34; of that timeless masterpiece.  It opens up with a similar fresh citrus as the original, backed up by a crisp, fresh vetiver, but the silky smooth myrrh note is what really puts this one in a league of its own.  It adds a warm spice that the original does not have.  Such a simple composition - it really shows you do not need a ton of notes to make a great fragrance.  I find it quite versatile, and it has all the strength and lasting power you could ever wish for.  Two sprays and you will smell it all day!  It goes great with a suit and tie, is awesome for nights out, and does well casually.  The only time I have found it to feel a bit &amp;#34;out of place&amp;#34; is in the sweltering hot summers we get here in North Carolina, but even then it is nice with just one spray.  This for cooler weather, the original Eau Sauvage (or Guerlain Vetiver) for refreshment on hot days, and a sweet gourmand scent (Hanae Mori HM or HiM, or Mugler Pure Malt are my picks) and you are COVERED for a complete fragrance wardrobe.  Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Fun fact: The cap contains a magnet that makes replacing it with a solid click very satisfying. As a scent this is a classic, sort of the equivalent of a dapper blue sportcoat: fresh, well-crafted, appropriate in almost any context. (It was created in 1966; Don Draper would probably wear it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve loved the Eau Sauvage cologne since I was a teenager. To my surprise, the perfume has its own personality. The bergamot notes in the perfume are less prominent than in the cologne. The perfume has more emphasis on the woodsy, chypre notes like sandalwood, yet it would still be just the right scent to wear to a beach restaurant or garden partyâ€”and would be equally at home around a winter fireplace or at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just remember it&#x27;s way, way more concentrated that the cologne and must be applied sparingly or its scent will fill the room for hours. Which is actually not too bad with a good perfume like Eau Sauvage.</li>
            <li> Smells great but not for long.  The scent does not last for long at all.  May be the shortest life I&#x27;ve ever gotten from a scent.  I do like the beginning smell a lot.</li>
            <li> I have worn Eau Sauvage in its original formula for many many years.  Unfortunately, the aroma of the recent years in E.S has not been true to the original 60&#x27;s vintage.  When I saw this, I thought I&#x27;d try it.  Major disappointment immediately ensued, when I popped the top!!!  The price tag did not feel good at all at that moment.  I was initially flabbergasted that CD calls this E.S !!! But when I rationalized (or tried to, any way), in a self consoling attempt, I concluded that a parallel would be, Ford restyling the Mustang after a few years of production with a new moniker, under the Mustang umbrella.  In short, and not so sweet, I am gravely disappointed in the aroma, but not disenchanted with CD for trying a different set of ingredients.  This formula just does not work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said all the above, I will also submit to the readers that every one has a unique taste in all they rate, be it movies, eateries, cars, etc.  I never paid any attention to Siskel &amp; Ebert about their movie reviews.  I went to a movie to see and rate it for myself.  You will be the final judge, not every one else.  You may end up in love with this fragrance.  My suggestion is go to your local mall Sepora or Dep&#x27;t store and give it a test smell.  Then you&#x27;ll be sure, which is what I should have done, before plopping 75 singles on the table.  There you have it.  Another man&#x27;s two and a half Cent..iments.</li>
            <li> Smells good, but very different from the Eau de toilette. I would say it is a little less fresh, and more woody.</li>
            <li> This perfum don&#x27;t have the same smell I don&#x27;t know why very different  that will the last I will buy it not happy</li>
            <li> Smells great. Not too strong, doesn&#x27;t wear off within 10 minutes. Lands in my top 5 of colognes. Awesome deal.</li>
            <li> One of the best men&#x27;s perfumes out there.</li>
            <li> This is masterpiece from Dior!! Zesty citrus and very smokey on my skin. Beast mode projection on my skin and it last 12 hours!!</li>
            <li> Like I said. It is a classic! Very distinguished and emphatic smell. It gets you those good looks. I just simply Love it!</li>
            <li> I got this rather quickly....no problems ....Dior Eau Savage Partum is a classic ....no it&#x27;s not the original but this reformation is a winner!!!</li>
            <li> Outstanding perfume for a man.  Its subtlety lasts all day and I feel good with it.  Unlike so many cheaper colognes, no one will smell you from five feet away.</li>
            <li> What a badass scent Eau Sauvage is, Roudnitska is a genius. This fragrance is definitely the most elegant citrus I have ever worn. I know that sometimes we feel obliged to buy modern fragrances either because there is a change of times or reformulations have made past juices smell a lot different. The issue I see though is that most firms have still to rearrange the cologne in such a novel and radical way as in the case of Eau Sauvage. Most of the expensive ones just use high quality materials but lack in imagination. One the other hand, Eau Sauvage still remains sublime. Citrus, jasmine, vetiver, some fruits, a touch of cumin and a herbal-chypre element adding tons of sophistication. This is a masterpiece of style. I wish it could last a little longer.</li>
            <li> It is a fine Dior product, but is isn&#x27;t the classic formula. I bought this for my husband for our anniversary and it won&#x27;t work for him.  You&#x27;ll probably love it if you don&#x27;t know the original, but if you do, you&#x27;ll likely be disappointed. Guess this bottle will go on eBay and I&#x27;ll be watching for vintage Eau Sauvage. Fine seller, great packaging, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I like the &amp;#34;Eau de Toilette&amp;#34; and this is just too much spice for me. I have worn ES since the 70&#x27;s and was quite disappointed in the Parfum. But that was my fault as I thought I was taking a step up and I took a step back. You can&#x27;t compare the Eau de Toilette to the Parfum. But, if I had too I would say, one is distinguished and aromatic the other is way too complex and reminds me of so many other scents that you can&#x27;t remember but run from.  Eau de Toilette is a scent that is unforgettable.</li>
            <li> delicious duration of 6 to 7 hours good projection and fixing a special smell</li>
            <li> the original has a clean and fresh feeling from the citrus essence, which the new bergamot neutralizes ,its too perfumy for men ...sorry Dior its not the same and a its not better, from a user since 1969</li>
            <li> satisfied/give it five six stars !!</li>
