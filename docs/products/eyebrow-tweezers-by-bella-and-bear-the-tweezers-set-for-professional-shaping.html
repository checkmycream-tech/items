            <li>I love this tweezer set!</li>
            <li>I love my Bella and Bear tweezers set!</li>
            <li>Love them!</li>
            <li>Great packaging and easy to handle.</li>
            <li>What an amazing idea...</li>
            <li>They arrived two days after I placed my order, and they work amazingly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so nice to have everything in one package.</li>
            <li>nice set.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s nice to know</li>
            <li>Once you own and use these Tweezers, trust me when I say they will change your life!♡</li>
            <li>It is nice to have 3 options for getting all types of stubborn hairs.</li>
            <li>They grip the hairs, and pluck nicely.</li>
            <li>I looked at Revlon and Tweezerman Bella and Bear was the best deal I wasn&#x27;t expecting much for the price</li>
            <li>these are really nice</li>
            <li>For the price, you get good, sturdy products with a variety that fills all your tweezing needs plus they&#x27;re just really cute.</li>
            <li>This is a must have for anyone that plucks their own eyebrows and any crafters.  </li>
            <li>So all three shapes come in handy.</li>
            <li>The pointed ones are also good for certian kinds of splinters that you need a bit more precision for.</li>
            <li>this is my 100% honest opinion.</li>
            <li>This would make a nice gift.</li>
            <li>Works great and looks super cute!</li>
            <li>The pouch is very nice and sturdy in my opinion and very pretty.  </li>
            <li>These are by far the best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>And these are fantastic, and the price is good considering the set is for 3 of them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s stylish while effective.</li>
            <li>These tweezers are by far the best I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Super cute packaging and great quality .</li>
            <li>The color is super cute and the customer service has been great.</li>
            <li>I am super happy I was able to pick these up during a promotion.</li>
            <li>This would be a really great kit to add to a first aid kit to give it a splash of color.</li>
            <li>Works great and the bag is pretty.</li>
            <li>The 3 pack means you will always have the right tool for the right job, which is awesome.</li>
            <li>Very precise.</li>
            <li>figured three for the price was better than one</li>
            <li>I love these tweezers.  </li>
            <li>Love the angles of the tweezers and they are so fancy.</li>
            <li>plus they are really cute</li>
            <li>I love the packaging.</li>
            <li>They work okay but not as well as Tweezerman premium tweezers.</li>
            <li>These are really cute and they work.  </li>
            <li>I have not tried the others, but I am sure they work, the case is cute.</li>
            <li>Love these tweezers.</li>
            <li>The case is adorable.</li>
            <li>As soon as I received this trio I went in on my brows specifically on a week when they were growing without touching them &#x27;till I received this set.</li>
            <li>Yay so glad I purchased these.</li>
            <li>Not only are the tweezers the best I have used , the craftsmanship exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>Cute holder too.</li>
            <li>Great price, fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Love it bought 2..</li>

            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>I love these tweezers.</li>
            <li>I received these free, not in exchange for my review, and all the opinions expressed are 100% my own.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE ALL THE TWEEZERS AND THE CUTE CASE THAT CAME WITH</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S A MUST BUY PEOPLE :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I took the risk and went with these and not tweezerman that I&#x27;m used to.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love these tweezers.</li>
            <li>And the case is adorable.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love it and love it.  </li>
            <li>He said he wished they came in a more manly case so he can take them when he travels for work.  </li>
            <li>I fell in love.</li>
            <li>The different size tweezers were absolutely awesome.</li>
            <li>I really love the pointed tweezers the most.</li>
            <li>I also love the Bella and Bear name on the tweezers.</li>
            <li>and I really love knowing how they came up with the name using inspiration from their fur babies.</li>
            <li>You will learn so much more about them once you join the site and all their beauty products they have.</li>
            <li>Lovely tweezer set.</li>
            <li>Extremely pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>I love the variety and the packaging is adorable.</li>
            <li>They would make a cute gift or stocking stuffer as well. :)</li>
            <li>All items come in the lovely vintage floral design that I have come to know as bella &amp; bear.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s nice to be able to clean them up in between eye brow waxes.</li>
            <li>The case is super cute too!  </li>
            <li>love the cute case on these, but more importantly, the tweezers work well.</li>
            <li>these are the best tweezers I have used in a long time</li>
            <li>It is completely worth it!!</li>
            <li>The slant and flat tweezers are both great to keep your eyebrows nice and groomed.</li>
            <li>These are the best tweezers ever:  3 tweezers in a convenient package (which is nice for me, because it hides them from my husband and kids who, if they don&#x27;t see them out in plain site, won&#x27;t use them!).  </li>
            <li>These are very good especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I love anything Bella and Bear when I see it because all their products are super cute.</li>
            <li>It would definitely make a good gift for a girl that loves beauty!</li>
            <li>Not only are they adorable, they also work GREAT.</li>
            <li>Easily met my expectations.</li>
            <li>The floral pattern makes it easy to carry around so that if it topples out of my bag, no one questions what it is or why I have it.</li>
            <li>It comes in a pretty case and is nice quality.  </li>
            <li>I was browsing tweezers at first so that I could groom my own eyebrows, but then I noticed that there were tweezers with the ability to take out ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>This super adorable tweezer set is an eyebrows dream come true!</li>
            <li>While they are super cute, they are not precision tools.</li>
            <li>Super cute set.</li>
            <li>I like the precision tweezers, and the look of them are super cute.</li>
            <li>The case is super cute and well made.</li>
            <li>I love this they pick up hair fast and easy really love them</li>
            <li>Works great for all the stubborn little hairs its an amazing value</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this beautiful Tweezer Trio to anyone who also plucks their own eyebrows and is looking forward to re-shaping or simply arching them in a better/different way.</li>
            <li>Comfortable to grip and precise.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stand cheap  tweezers that don&#x27;t work well</li>
            <li>Lol Eventually, I learned that if you plucked them, it got the root, which means it takes longer to grow back!!!</li>
            <li>lol I would definitely recommend this set!</li>
            <li>These tweezers are accustomed to fit any type of situation.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used them a couple of times and pulls out the unwanted hair smoothly.</li>
            <li>great set, each tweezer does something different and fits all needs.  </li>
            <li>I got these tweezers for free* to try and review.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*regardless of getting this tweezer set for free</li>
            <li>This is a adorable cute set that is really fashionable.</li>
            <li>The set comes with a beautiful carrying case and the tweezers are easy to handle due to the wider handles.  </li>
            <li>They grab the hair easily and rip it out quickly.</li>
            <li>They are the kind of thing that&#x27;s super practical but also looks very gift-worthy.</li>
            <li>and it was gifted to me by my Best Friend who knows how obsessed I am with beauty, but most of all maintenance on my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>So cute and pretty floral packaging but</li>
            <li>Really cute &amp; works really well!</li>
            <li>I was very surprised when I opened my package to see a beautiful feminine case  housing my new tweezers.</li>
            <li>As someone who only plucks her eyebrows, nothing else, good tweezers are important.</li>
            <li>Different shapes sure do come in handy.</li>
            <li>love the packaging and the tweezers are overall pretty good.</li>
            <li>Each one has a special use to your need.</li>
            <li>I have used store brands and they always seemed to be dull, but this Tweezer Set is perfect!!</li>
            <li>Plus the pluckers are good quality: you definitely can get hold of those stubborn hairs.</li>
            <li>I love the packaging design and they really work.</li>
            <li>I loved everything about it from the color to the different precision tips.</li>
            <li>I really like these and the cute case they come in...</li>
            <li>I love this tweezer set, and for the price, you really can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re super cute and very durable.</li>
            <li>Just the right size to fit in any purse or makeup bag.  </li>
            <li>They grip the hair tightly, no slipping, for a nice clean pluck every time.</li>
            <li>Nice little set, nice case, precision tools</li>
            <li>These are seriously the BEST tweezers ever!</li>
            <li>Love and highly recommend.</li>
            <li>ALSO LOVE HOW THEY USED HIGH QUALITY MATERIALS.</li>
            <li>Very high quality, with 3 different tweezers to choose from AND super cute and handy storage.  </li>
            <li>I was very interested in this set for a while</li>
            <li>Very pleased, except for the fact I have to continually take them back from my husband.</li>
            <li>These are cheap tweezers in a pretty box.</li>
            <li>I was one of the lucky ones that received this for review and i am very thankful!!</li>
            <li>You can see a big difference and how nice and clean my brows looked.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love my new tweezers.</li>
            <li>first try!  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite set of tweezers thus far!</li>
            <li>Having several choices are good depending on what kind of hair and how long.</li>
            <li>All of them are all very well made and provide accurate precision.</li>
            <li>I am more than pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>The 3 different sized tweezers are able to fit into just about any place making it easier to pluck those unwanted hairs or remove splinters.  </li>
            <li>I am able to completely pull the hair out at the root.</li>
            <li>They are sturdy, high-quality tweezers and worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Fun right?</li>
            <li>I also forgot to mention these cute floral sharp tweezers come in a cute flip wallet holder with a flower print to match the tweezers.</li>
            <li>Purchased this because the price was right</li>
            <li>She is a makeup artist and having the right tools make all the difference.</li>
            <li>It took a while for me to get the right shape</li>
            <li>I got it for $5 and that was about the right price for this product.</li>
            <li>The tweezers can travel with you anywhere thanks to a decorative travel case, which keeps them clean and from getting lost in your luggage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received these from Bella and Bear for testing purposes, and for an honest review on my blog, and I only had to go for the hair the FIRST time.</li>
            <li>The case is beautiful and I like that you get three different tweezers for different purposes.</li>
            <li>This set comes with a cute little case that keeps them clean and well protected for easy travel.</li>
            <li>Like all of their products Bella &amp; Bears “Pluckers” set is made of high quality materials, and arrives at your door in a beautiful little box.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these if you are in the Market for a high quality tweezer for not alot of money:)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great having the 3 different types of tweezers all for different jobs.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product, but definitely not worth the original price of over $20...for 3 different tweezers and a holding kit</li>
            <li>It is so hard to get tweezers that pulll the hair out, and the slanted ones work great.  </li>
            <li>They are exactly what they are advertised to be.  </li>
            <li>They grab the first time and the splinters are no match for the pointed pair.  </li>
            <li>The pretty mint color with the girly print.</li>
            <li>So pretty to just put in your makeup bag to have on the go.</li>
            <li>They are exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I recently order these tweezers because I gave up looking for my lost favorite pair of Tweezerman slant tweezers.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure these will last me a while.</li>
            <li>So pretty</li>
            <li>and she absolutely loves it too!</li>
            <li>Pluckers\\&quot; Tweezer set by Bella and Bear and first thing</li>
            <li>I have bought similar items from Tweezerman and never gotten a case to put them in as cute as this one.</li>
            <li>I love that I found this company and will continue to shop and purchase items from here in the future.</li>
            <li>I want to get several more to give out as bridesmaid gifts when i get married.</li>
            <li>I have something called PCOS, it&#x27;s a hormone imbalance that causes me to have extra testosterone which means my body can grow more hair in unwanted places.</li>
            <li>They really work!</li>
            <li>everyone has raged about these tweezers, but I have tried all 3 and so far not one has tweezed a hair on the first or second even sometimes more try!</li>
            <li>They close tightly, the grip is comfortable, and you can pull more than one hair at once.</li>
            <li>Thismakes it easy to keep all three tweezers in the same place.</li>
            <li>Tweezing is never fun, but having the right tools makes the process a whole lot better.</li>
            <li>Not only do they come in a super cute pouch, they actually do the job!</li>
            <li>These are as good or better than any other tweezers I have bought in the past.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cure little set, and the holder is nice, but this just doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>I thought that the due to good reviews, these are good ones; but compare to my professional one that had cost me $30.00, these are not good at all.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re also great for splinters and little tiny pieces of glass.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find tweezers that have good grip.</li>
            <li>The tweezers themselves work very well also.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re made of very sturdy metal and grasp all the hairs I need them to.</li>
            <li>These tweezers work really well.  </li>
            <li>This set has been a breeze to use, it&#x27;s helped arch them so much easier than before</li>
            <li>My brows grow fast</li>
            <li>I really like the color, the packaging and the variety.</li>
            <li>The three points are angled, flat(or straight) and pointed.</li>
            <li>I really like these tweezers.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the travel case and the fact it has three different sets of tweezers to use for a variety of things.</li>
            <li>Oh I also want to mention you will also receive instructions and how to join their club where you will save 25% straight away and also be the first to know about their giveaways and promotions on all their new products.</li>
            <li>Other top brands can dig in to isolate a microscopic hair, but can&#x27;t hold on.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these for anyone who wants to maintain their brows at home.</li>
            <li>so I was a little hesitant buying these because three pairs are cheaper than one pair of my old ones, but I am glad I did!</li>
            <li>I used all three, the pointy ones for ingrown or tiny to reach hairs, the slanted ones for the bottom of my brows and the regular straight tweezer for the top of my brows.</li>
            <li>Pretty heavy duty for a cheap price &amp; honestly better than I expected.</li>
            <li>The are great for plucking eyebrows, getting splinters out, poking the hard plastic that covers packages to help you open them (instead of using a knife or scissors ...</li>
            <li>Cute case &amp; three different types of ends for different tweezing needs.</li>
            <li>Decent quality for the money.</li>
            <li>&amp; I love having the 3 different ones for different uses.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that this set has three different types of tweezers in it; slanted, pointed, and flat.</li>
            <li>If they could dig the little hairs out a bit, they&#x27;d be able to hang on while you pull it out.  </li>
            <li>The tweezers and the little travel case they come in are absolutely adorable.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this set to those looking for a new set or maybe a gift.</li>
            <li>They are accurate and sharp.</li>
            <li>They are also very sharp and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Thanks Bella and Bear for saving my eyebrows and my much needed extra cash !  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>The sharp pointed ones are great for those tiny little hairs and ingrown ones.</li>
            <li>These come in a cute fabric case and there are 3 tips to choose from but not sure why they have such a high rating?</li>
            <li>I had a professional tweezers and I lost it.</li>
            <li>I ended up using my old Revlon tweezer.</li>
            <li>I must admit I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>but I love them just the same as a plain color.</li>
            <li>These tweezers definitely aren&#x27;t Tweezerman but are decent at their price.</li>
            <li>All of the products in this kit are definitely made using high quality material.</li>
            <li>The three different style of tweezers make it easy to tame your brows at home.</li>
            <li>They are sturdy and grip single hairs firmly and easily.</li>
            <li>These tweezers are the best choice for precision use for those really fine small or those nasty ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>They are so pretty and match several other Bella and Bear items I have.</li>
            <li>the tweezing edges are too clumsy to grab fine hair or short stubble.</li>
            <li>....and a pretty little case as well.</li>
            <li>Now, let me first say, I usually buy the $1.00 pair, and I always have to go for the hair more than once, and it seriously irritates me!</li>
            <li>From daily maintenance to the fine, hard to get hairs, these tweezers get the job done!.</li>
            <li>I like the cute little case to keep the tweezers in, although the quality is slightly less than I expected.  </li>

            <li> I love this tweezer set!</li>
            <li> I love my Bella and Bear tweezers set!</li>
            <li> Love them!</li>
            <li> Great packaging and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> What an amazing idea...</li>
            <li> They arrived two days after I placed my order, and they work amazingly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so nice to have everything in one package.</li>
            <li> nice set.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s nice to know</li>
            <li> Once you own and use these Tweezers, trust me when I say they will change your life!♡</li>
            <li> It is nice to have 3 options for getting all types of stubborn hairs.</li>
            <li> They grip the hairs, and pluck nicely.</li>
            <li> I looked at Revlon and Tweezerman Bella and Bear was the best deal I wasn&#x27;t expecting much for the price</li>
            <li> these are really nice</li>
            <li> For the price, you get good, sturdy products with a variety that fills all your tweezing needs plus they&#x27;re just really cute.</li>
            <li> This is a must have for anyone that plucks their own eyebrows and any crafters.  </li>
            <li> So all three shapes come in handy.</li>
            <li> The pointed ones are also good for certian kinds of splinters that you need a bit more precision for.</li>
            <li> this is my 100% honest opinion.</li>
            <li> This would make a nice gift.</li>
            <li> Works great and looks super cute!</li>
            <li> The pouch is very nice and sturdy in my opinion and very pretty.  </li>
            <li> These are by far the best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> And these are fantastic, and the price is good considering the set is for 3 of them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s stylish while effective.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are by far the best I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> Super cute packaging and great quality .</li>
            <li> The color is super cute and the customer service has been great.</li>
            <li> I am super happy I was able to pick these up during a promotion.</li>
            <li> This would be a really great kit to add to a first aid kit to give it a splash of color.</li>
            <li> Works great and the bag is pretty.</li>
            <li> The 3 pack means you will always have the right tool for the right job, which is awesome.</li>

            <li> I love the packaging.</li>

            <li> The different size tweezers were absolutely awesome.</li>
            <li> I really love the pointed tweezers the most.</li>
            <li> I also love the Bella and Bear name on the tweezers.</li>
            <li> and I really love knowing how they came up with the name using inspiration from their fur babies.</li>

            <li> so it&#x27;s nice to be able to clean them up in between eye brow waxes.</li>
            <li> The case is super cute too!  </li>
            <li> love the cute case on these, but more importantly, the tweezers work well.</li>
            <li> these are the best tweezers I have used in a long time</li>
            <li> It is completely worth it!!</li>
            <li> The slant and flat tweezers are both great to keep your eyebrows nice and groomed.</li>
            <li> These are the best tweezers ever:  3 tweezers in a convenient package (which is nice for me, because it hides them from my husband and kids who, if they don&#x27;t see them out in plain site, won&#x27;t use them!).  </li>
            <li> These are very good especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I love anything Bella and Bear when I see it because all their products are super cute.</li>
            <li> It would definitely make a good gift for a girl that loves beauty!</li>
            <li> Not only are they adorable, they also work GREAT.</li>
            <li> Easily met my expectations.</li>
            <li> The floral pattern makes it easy to carry around so that if it topples out of my bag, no one questions what it is or why I have it.</li>
            <li> It comes in a pretty case and is nice quality.  </li>
            <li> I was browsing tweezers at first so that I could groom my own eyebrows, but then I noticed that there were tweezers with the ability to take out ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> This super adorable tweezer set is an eyebrows dream come true!</li>
            <li> While they are super cute, they are not precision tools.</li>
            <li> Super cute set.</li>
            <li> I like the precision tweezers, and the look of them are super cute.</li>
            <li> The case is super cute and well made.</li>
            <li> I love this they pick up hair fast and easy really love them</li>
            <li> Works great for all the stubborn little hairs its an amazing value</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this beautiful Tweezer Trio to anyone who also plucks their own eyebrows and is looking forward to re-shaping or simply arching them in a better/different way.</li>
            <li> Comfortable to grip and precise.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand cheap  tweezers that don&#x27;t work well</li>
            <li> Lol Eventually, I learned that if you plucked them, it got the root, which means it takes longer to grow back!!!</li>
            <li> lol I would definitely recommend this set!</li>
            <li> These tweezers are accustomed to fit any type of situation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them a couple of times and pulls out the unwanted hair smoothly.</li>
            <li> great set, each tweezer does something different and fits all needs.  </li>
            <li> I got these tweezers for free* to try and review.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*regardless of getting this tweezer set for free</li>
            <li> This is a adorable cute set that is really fashionable.</li>
            <li> The set comes with a beautiful carrying case and the tweezers are easy to handle due to the wider handles.  </li>
            <li> They grab the hair easily and rip it out quickly.</li>
            <li> They are the kind of thing that&#x27;s super practical but also looks very gift-worthy.</li>
            <li> and it was gifted to me by my Best Friend who knows how obsessed I am with beauty, but most of all maintenance on my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> So cute and pretty floral packaging but</li>
            <li> Really cute &amp; works really well!</li>
            <li> I was very surprised when I opened my package to see a beautiful feminine case  housing my new tweezers.</li>
            <li> As someone who only plucks her eyebrows, nothing else, good tweezers are important.</li>
            <li> Different shapes sure do come in handy.</li>
            <li> love the packaging and the tweezers are overall pretty good.</li>
            <li> Each one has a special use to your need.</li>
            <li> I have used store brands and they always seemed to be dull, but this Tweezer Set is perfect!!</li>
            <li> Plus the pluckers are good quality: you definitely can get hold of those stubborn hairs.</li>
            <li> I love the packaging design and they really work.</li>
            <li> I loved everything about it from the color to the different precision tips.</li>
            <li> I really like these and the cute case they come in...</li>
            <li> I love this tweezer set, and for the price, you really can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re super cute and very durable.</li>
            <li> Just the right size to fit in any purse or makeup bag.  </li>
            <li> They grip the hair tightly, no slipping, for a nice clean pluck every time.</li>
            <li> Nice little set, nice case, precision tools</li>
            <li> These are seriously the BEST tweezers ever!</li>
            <li> Love and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> ALSO LOVE HOW THEY USED HIGH QUALITY MATERIALS.</li>
            <li> Very high quality, with 3 different tweezers to choose from AND super cute and handy storage.  </li>
            <li> I was very interested in this set for a while</li>
            <li> Very pleased, except for the fact I have to continually take them back from my husband.</li>
            <li> These are cheap tweezers in a pretty box.</li>
            <li> I was one of the lucky ones that received this for review and i am very thankful!!</li>
            <li> You can see a big difference and how nice and clean my brows looked.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my new tweezers.</li>
            <li> first try!  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite set of tweezers thus far!</li>
            <li> Having several choices are good depending on what kind of hair and how long.</li>
            <li> All of them are all very well made and provide accurate precision.</li>
            <li> I am more than pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> The 3 different sized tweezers are able to fit into just about any place making it easier to pluck those unwanted hairs or remove splinters.  </li>
            <li> I am able to completely pull the hair out at the root.</li>
            <li> They are sturdy, high-quality tweezers and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Fun right?</li>
            <li> I also forgot to mention these cute floral sharp tweezers come in a cute flip wallet holder with a flower print to match the tweezers.</li>
            <li> Purchased this because the price was right</li>
            <li> She is a makeup artist and having the right tools make all the difference.</li>
            <li> It took a while for me to get the right shape</li>
            <li> I got it for $5 and that was about the right price for this product.</li>
            <li> The tweezers can travel with you anywhere thanks to a decorative travel case, which keeps them clean and from getting lost in your luggage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received these from Bella and Bear for testing purposes, and for an honest review on my blog, and I only had to go for the hair the FIRST time.</li>
            <li> The case is beautiful and I like that you get three different tweezers for different purposes.</li>
            <li> This set comes with a cute little case that keeps them clean and well protected for easy travel.</li>
            <li> Like all of their products Bella &amp; Bears “Pluckers” set is made of high quality materials, and arrives at your door in a beautiful little box.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these if you are in the Market for a high quality tweezer for not alot of money:)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great having the 3 different types of tweezers all for different jobs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product, but definitely not worth the original price of over $20...for 3 different tweezers and a holding kit</li>
            <li> It is so hard to get tweezers that pulll the hair out, and the slanted ones work great.  </li>
            <li> They are exactly what they are advertised to be.  </li>
            <li> They grab the first time and the splinters are no match for the pointed pair.  </li>
            <li> The pretty mint color with the girly print.</li>
            <li> So pretty to just put in your makeup bag to have on the go.</li>
            <li> They are exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I recently order these tweezers because I gave up looking for my lost favorite pair of Tweezerman slant tweezers.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure these will last me a while.</li>
            <li> So pretty</li>
            <li> and she absolutely loves it too!</li>
            <li> Pluckers\\&quot; Tweezer set by Bella and Bear and first thing</li>
            <li> I have bought similar items from Tweezerman and never gotten a case to put them in as cute as this one.</li>
            <li> I love that I found this company and will continue to shop and purchase items from here in the future.</li>
            <li> I want to get several more to give out as bridesmaid gifts when i get married.</li>
            <li> I have something called PCOS, it&#x27;s a hormone imbalance that causes me to have extra testosterone which means my body can grow more hair in unwanted places.</li>
            <li> They really work!</li>
            <li> everyone has raged about these tweezers, but I have tried all 3 and so far not one has tweezed a hair on the first or second even sometimes more try!</li>
            <li> They close tightly, the grip is comfortable, and you can pull more than one hair at once.</li>
            <li> Thismakes it easy to keep all three tweezers in the same place.</li>
            <li> Tweezing is never fun, but having the right tools makes the process a whole lot better.</li>
            <li> Not only do they come in a super cute pouch, they actually do the job!</li>
            <li> These are as good or better than any other tweezers I have bought in the past.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cure little set, and the holder is nice, but this just doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I thought that the due to good reviews, these are good ones; but compare to my professional one that had cost me $30.00, these are not good at all.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re also great for splinters and little tiny pieces of glass.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find tweezers that have good grip.</li>
            <li> The tweezers themselves work very well also.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re made of very sturdy metal and grasp all the hairs I need them to.</li>
            <li> These tweezers work really well.  </li>
            <li> This set has been a breeze to use, it&#x27;s helped arch them so much easier than before</li>
            <li> My brows grow fast</li>
            <li> I really like the color, the packaging and the variety.</li>
            <li> The three points are angled, flat(or straight) and pointed.</li>
            <li> I really like these tweezers.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the travel case and the fact it has three different sets of tweezers to use for a variety of things.</li>
            <li> Oh I also want to mention you will also receive instructions and how to join their club where you will save 25% straight away and also be the first to know about their giveaways and promotions on all their new products.</li>
            <li> Other top brands can dig in to isolate a microscopic hair, but can&#x27;t hold on.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these for anyone who wants to maintain their brows at home.</li>
            <li> so I was a little hesitant buying these because three pairs are cheaper than one pair of my old ones, but I am glad I did!</li>
            <li> I used all three, the pointy ones for ingrown or tiny to reach hairs, the slanted ones for the bottom of my brows and the regular straight tweezer for the top of my brows.</li>
            <li> Pretty heavy duty for a cheap price &amp; honestly better than I expected.</li>
            <li> The are great for plucking eyebrows, getting splinters out, poking the hard plastic that covers packages to help you open them (instead of using a knife or scissors ...</li>
            <li> Cute case &amp; three different types of ends for different tweezing needs.</li>
            <li> Decent quality for the money.</li>
            <li> &amp; I love having the 3 different ones for different uses.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this set has three different types of tweezers in it; slanted, pointed, and flat.</li>
            <li> If they could dig the little hairs out a bit, they&#x27;d be able to hang on while you pull it out.  </li>
            <li> The tweezers and the little travel case they come in are absolutely adorable.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this set to those looking for a new set or maybe a gift.</li>
            <li> They are accurate and sharp.</li>
            <li> They are also very sharp and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Thanks Bella and Bear for saving my eyebrows and my much needed extra cash !  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> The sharp pointed ones are great for those tiny little hairs and ingrown ones.</li>
            <li> These come in a cute fabric case and there are 3 tips to choose from but not sure why they have such a high rating?</li>
            <li> I had a professional tweezers and I lost it.</li>
            <li> I ended up using my old Revlon tweezer.</li>
            <li> I must admit I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> but I love them just the same as a plain color.</li>
            <li> These tweezers definitely aren&#x27;t Tweezerman but are decent at their price.</li>
            <li> All of the products in this kit are definitely made using high quality material.</li>
            <li> The three different style of tweezers make it easy to tame your brows at home.</li>
            <li> They are sturdy and grip single hairs firmly and easily.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are the best choice for precision use for those really fine small or those nasty ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> They are so pretty and match several other Bella and Bear items I have.</li>
            <li> the tweezing edges are too clumsy to grab fine hair or short stubble.</li>
            <li> ....and a pretty little case as well.</li>
            <li> Now, let me first say, I usually buy the $1.00 pair, and I always have to go for the hair more than once, and it seriously irritates me!</li>
            <li> From daily maintenance to the fine, hard to get hairs, these tweezers get the job done!.</li>
            <li> I like the cute little case to keep the tweezers in, although the quality is slightly less than I expected.  </li>
            <li> You have a choice of three different pair which are slant, flat, and pointed tweezers.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are very sharp so be careful and gentle when you are using them.</li>
            <li> Growing up i would just cut them, but these suckers grow fast, so I started ripping them out!</li>
            <li> I think these will last a long time and withstand the bending that some tweezers have an issue with.</li>
            <li> There are three pair of tweezers in this set: slant, pointed and flat.</li>
            <li> You will always have a flat tip, a slanted tip, and a pointy tip with you at all times!</li>
            <li> The tweezers are sharp and tight and work very well.</li>
            <li> I bought this set not too long ago.  </li>
            <li> First, I am a sucker for packaging!</li>
            <li> and I like have 3 different &amp;#34;tips&amp;#34; right on hand to address whatever difficult situation</li>
            <li> (The little &amp;#34;belt&amp;#34; on the front of the case was bent/folded funny when I received it so it can be a little difficult to close the flap, rather, insert the flap, into the &amp;#34;belt.&amp;#34;)  </li>
            <li> These are not high quality tweezers.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are much too thick at the ends and do not grab the chin hairs I need to pluck at all!  </li>
            <li> I have an obsession with tweezers and constantly tweezing my eyebrows even when there&#x27;s just a little hair or two.</li>
            <li> I personally prefer a pointed tweezer for my everyday use</li>
            <li> In addition, while I&#x27;m not certain of this, it does seem that the time to regrowth is longer than with conventional tweezers.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had really thin eyebrows almost all my life from over plucking, but I decided to let them grow out and only pluck  below carefully designing the shape month by month.</li>
            <li> Use the two flat tipped ones for me and the pointy one for ticks on my dogs (seems silly, but why spend extra money on another).</li>
            <li> I tweezed with the pointy ones and they were like a little knife</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> The yank the hairs right out, but they&#x27;re not that painful.</li>
            <li> but they have stray BLACK hairs coming out of them, ever since forever!</li>
            <li> If you have trouble getting a hold on small objects</li>
            <li> My only real disappointment is that I paid $25 for this set and now it is so much cheaper.  </li>
            <li> I only go for the hair one time now versus 3 or 4 times, getting angry and pinching skin.</li>
            <li> :-/  </li>
            <li> I was never able to do that before with drug store tweezers.</li>
            <li> I seriously cannot think of anything negative to say about this tweezer set other than I wish I had them sooner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to believe that for decades I have used inferior tweezers</li>
            <li> The metal is supple and not &amp;#34;loose&amp;#34;, which is my number 1 complaint about tweezers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ALWAYS been the person in charge of my eyebrows from day 1, from the shape to how thick I would like them.</li>
            <li> Not good for delicate tweezing.</li>
            <li> I am beyond obsessed with this tweezer set from Bella and Bear.</li>
            <li> Was I wrong</li>
            <li> Sorry, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> Very frustrating.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was wrong!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get serious ingrown hairs, but knowing that i have some is very annoying, so I purchased these.</li>
            <li> I go through tweezers like crazy!</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> love the packaging and the tweezers are overall pretty good.</li>
            <li> I love this set! It&#x27;s so nice to have everything in one package. I was one of the lucky ones that received this for review and i am very thankful!!</li>
            <li> What an amazing idea... three specialized tweezers in a cute carrying case! Not only are they adorable, they also work GREAT. This is a must have for any woman to help keep up with those pesky hairs.</li>
            <li> I love the packaging, the carry case is wonderful. It&#x27;s great having the 3 different types of tweezers all for different jobs. I highly recommend these if you are in the Market for a high quality tweezer for not alot of money:)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to believe that for decades I have used inferior tweezers - I thought all were created equal, until now!  Purchased this because the price was right and there were three different styles of tweezer.  Had no idea why I needed those but figured three for the price was better than one so I purchased.  These tweezers are efficient enough to remove even the tiniest hair growth.  In addition, while I&#x27;m not certain of this, it does seem that the time to regrowth is longer than with conventional tweezers. Great product!</li>
            <li> I bought these as a gift for a friend of mine and she loved them! She is a makeup artist and having the right tools make all the difference.</li>
            <li> This tweezer set is great quality and the tweezers performed well for me.  The pouch is very nice and sturdy in my opinion and very pretty.  I like that there are 3 different heads on the tweezers for specific needs.</li>
            <li> I love these tweezers.  They are exactly what they are advertised to be.  They grab the first time and the splinters are no match for the pointed pair.  I would recommend this set to anyone</li>
            <li> Love the angles of the tweezers and they are so fancy.</li>
            <li> I love this set! It comes in a pretty case and is nice quality.  The set has everything you need for tweezing!  I&#x27;m giving it to my daughter as a gift and I know she will love it!</li>
            <li> Not knowing anything about this brand, I decided to try it out. I am more than pleasantly surprised. Each of them are excellent quality and I use each one equally. .</li>
            <li> I love this they pick up hair fast and easy really love them plus they are really cute</li>
            <li> I LOVE this set!! I use it all the time! they get at the teeniest tiny hairs and I am so grateful for them!</li>
            <li> Like all of their products Bella &amp; Bears “Pluckers” set is made of high quality materials, and arrives at your door in a beautiful little box. The tweezers can travel with you anywhere thanks to a decorative travel case, which keeps them clean and from getting lost in your luggage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the cute case on these, but more importantly, the tweezers work well. They grip the hair tightly, no slipping, for a nice clean pluck every time. The 3 pack means you will always have the right tool for the right job, which is awesome. These are a beauty queen dream, lol. The travel case means i can toss them in my purse, overnight bag, or makeup bag and always be prepared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received &amp;#34;The Pluckers&amp;#34; set from Bella &amp; Bear to review.</li>
            <li> I love the packaging. The pretty mint color with the girly print. So pretty to just put in your makeup bag to have on the go. Or just have it at home. I like that it has multiple styles for whatever your need is. Makes a great gift as well.</li>
            <li> These are not high quality tweezers. While they are super cute, they are not precision tools. the tweezing edges are too clumsy to grab fine hair or short stubble.</li>
            <li> These come in a cute fabric case and there are 3 tips to choose from but not sure why they have such a high rating? They work okay but not as well as Tweezerman premium tweezers.</li>
            <li> nice set.  I hope they last.  I go through tweezers like crazy!</li>
            <li> I love anything Bella and Bear when I see it because all their products are super cute. This tweezer set is no exception. I love the fact that this set has three different types of tweezers in it; slanted, pointed, and flat. I personally prefer a pointed tweezer for my everyday use but it&#x27;s nice to know I have all three on hand if I need them. This is a great set for traveling or keeping in your purse as well because it comes with a case. The case is so cute with a beautiful floral print. I wish the tweezers had the same print but I love them just the same as a plain color. The tweezers themselves work very well also. They&#x27;re made of very sturdy metal and grasp all the hairs I need them to. I have had no issues plucking even the smallest eyebrow hair. Because of the case and cuteness of these I do think they&#x27;d make a great gift for any woman. I did purchase these for no cost with a discount although I did so without any expectations.</li>
            <li> Nice little set, nice case, precision tools</li>
            <li> Love it! Finally decided to buy a &amp;#34;big girl&amp;#34; set of tweezers instead of constantly buying the dollar store tweezers that never worked. So glad I did! Cute case &amp; three different types of ends for different tweezing needs. Love this purchase!</li>
            <li> These are by far the best tweezers I&#x27;ve ever tried. I keep the set in my makeup bag all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
            <li> Decent quality for the money.</li>
            <li> Works great for all the stubborn little hairs its an amazing value</li>
            <li> I figured finding 5-star tweezers was probably wishful thinking. However, this set is definitely 5 stars. All three tweezers are magic!  They grip even the finest hairs first try!  The case is super cute too!  Love and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Superior grip. Wish the pointy-ness was as good as the grip. If they could dig the little hairs out a bit, they&#x27;d be able to hang on while you pull it out.  Other top brands can dig in to isolate a microscopic hair, but can&#x27;t hold on.</li>
            <li> These tweezers work great &amp; I love having the 3 different ones for different uses. The case is very nice also. A great buy for the money!</li>
            <li> Great set of tweezers in a lovely package to keep them organized and in pristine condition. Tweezing is never fun, but having the right tools makes the process a whole lot better.</li>
            <li> Love them! They are exactly what I was expecting. Comfortable to grip and precise.</li>
            <li> These are really cute and they work.  It is so hard to get tweezers that pulll the hair out, and the slanted ones work great.  I have not tried the others, but I am sure they work, the case is cute.</li>
            <li> ....and a pretty little case as well.</li>
            <li> I really loved these tweezers, they were all good quality and work great. They&#x27;re case was also very nice to put them away and take them on the go if needed.</li>
            <li> Definitely get your bang for the buck with this kit. As an esthetician, these are awesome for home use or at a spa with a. Perfect kit so you never lose them!</li>
            <li> Awesome 3 piece Tweezers Set</li>
            <li> Love these tweezers. Use the two flat tipped ones for me and the pointy one for ticks on my dogs (seems silly, but why spend extra money on another). Good set.</li>
            <li> These tweezers work really well.  I can&#x27;t even feel the hair being pulled, they grip so well.  The case is adorable.</li>
            <li> I have never gone to a salon to get my eyebrows waxed or threaded. I&#x27;ve ALWAYS been the person in charge of my eyebrows from day 1, from the shape to how thick I would like them. I was very interested in this set for a while and it was gifted to me by my Best Friend who knows how obsessed I am with beauty, but most of all maintenance on my eyebrows. It took a while for me to get the right shape and I&#x27;ve had really thin eyebrows almost all my life from over plucking, but I decided to let them grow out and only pluck  below carefully designing the shape month by month. I always felt like 1 tweezer wasn&#x27;t enough or 1 shape of tweezer wasn&#x27;t getting the job done. As soon as I received this trio I went in on my brows specifically on a week when they were growing without touching them &#x27;till I received this set. This set has been a breeze to use, it&#x27;s helped arch them so much easier than before and the best part is I can take them with me anywhere I choose because they come in a travel-friendly pouch in a gorgeous design &amp; color. These are the Tweezers I&#x27;ve been looking for All my life and I wouldn&#x27;t change them for the world at this moment. I highly recommend this beautiful Tweezer Trio to anyone who also plucks their own eyebrows and is looking forward to re-shaping or simply arching them in a better/different way. Once you own and use these Tweezers, trust me when I say they will change your life!♡</li>
            <li> Love it!  Great seller, fine price, excellent quality item.  Very pleased, except for the fact I have to continually take them back from my husband.</li>
            <li> Great product! Works great and looks super cute!</li>
            <li> What a cute set and work nicely!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in school to become an Esthetician and needed a good pair of tweezers. Wellifound all three of the best...In my opinion. .</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews but these tweezers are AWESOME. So cute and pretty floral packaging but the real awesome part is I like them better then my TWEEZERMAN tweezers. Yay so glad I purchased these.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my new tweezers. I was very surprised when I opened my package to see a beautiful feminine case  housing my new tweezers.Not only are the tweezers the best I have used , the craftsmanship exceeded my expectations. I know I will have these for years</li>
            <li> Great tweezer set. Very precise. Cute holder too.</li>
            <li> Very attractive. Very happy with purchase. Great price, fast delivery. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I recently order these tweezers because I gave up looking for my lost favorite pair of Tweezerman slant tweezers. I have only used them once but I am very happy with them! I can&#x27;t stand cheap  tweezers that don&#x27;t work well so I was a little hesitant buying these because three pairs are cheaper than one pair of my old ones, but I am glad I did! They are sturdy and grip single hairs firmly and easily. It is nice to have 3 options for getting all types of stubborn hairs. Thanks Bella and Bear for saving my eyebrows and my much needed extra cash !  Oh and  I love the case!</li>
            <li> Hi... I have already sent a review...love the set and will purchase one for my mom!</li>
            <li> Great quality, cute design.</li>
            <li> Very good tweezers and adorable case. A great purchase for a great price!</li>
            <li> I had a professional tweezers and I lost it. I thought that the due to good reviews, these are good ones; but compare to my professional one that had cost me $30.00, these are not good at all. May be, I am used to a very good one and now I am comparing!!!</li>
            <li> These tweezers are very sharp so be careful and gentle when you are using them. I tweezed with the pointy ones and they were like a little knife so that&#x27;s my warning when using these tweezers. But with that on notice these tweezers work amazing! They pulled every tiny hair I had on my brows. I used all three, the pointy ones for ingrown or tiny to reach hairs, the slanted ones for the bottom of my brows and the regular straight tweezer for the top of my brows. You can see a big difference and how nice and clean my brows looked. I took a before and after on one brow so you can see what a difference groomed brows make! I also forgot to mention these cute floral sharp tweezers come in a cute flip wallet holder with a flower print to match the tweezers. Yay! For Bella and Bear 5 stars!</li>
            <li> Great item will buy another set for my mom!</li>
            <li> Super cute set. They are great quality. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> These are amazing tweezers for a very good price. I am impressed and I&#x27;m sure these will last me a while. My brows grow fast so it&#x27;s nice to be able to clean them up in between eye brow waxes.</li>
            <li> Perfect. Just as described. Love it bought 2..</li>
            <li> Great! Some tweezers don&#x27;t tweeze. These three are great and easy to carry!</li>
            <li> I am beyond obsessed with this tweezer set from Bella and Bear. First, I am a sucker for packaging! The tweezers and the little travel case they come in are absolutely adorable. I love the color, the design, the elegance of it. I have an obsession with tweezers and constantly tweezing my eyebrows even when there&#x27;s just a little hair or two. This set is perfect! The sharp pointed ones are great for those tiny little hairs and ingrown ones. They grab the hair easily and rip it out quickly. They&#x27;re also great for splinters and little tiny pieces of glass. The slant and flat tweezers are both great to keep your eyebrows nice and groomed. They close tightly, the grip is comfortable, and you can pull more than one hair at once. This set is an all-in-one pack of tweezers you need for anything! It&#x27;s a great travel set for your purse! I seriously cannot think of anything negative to say about this tweezer set other than I wish I had them sooner. *sample provided for testing and review*</li>
            <li> I love these. They&#x27;re super cute and very durable. The yank the hairs right out, but they&#x27;re not that painful.</li>
            <li> So cute and amazing quality! I love these tweezers.</li>
            <li> These are as good or better than any other tweezers I have bought in the past. Very cute, nice quality case. Easily met my expectations.</li>
            <li> These are very good especially for the price. I appreciate the packaging too.</li>
            <li> Great tweezers with a great price. Pretty heavy duty for a cheap price &amp; honestly better than I expected. I would definitly buy from the brand Bella &amp; Bear again.</li>
            <li> Love it! So pretty and they work great</li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical at first regarding this tweezer set.  I have only found one type of tweezers (Revlon) that I actually like, so I got these figuring I&#x27;d be sterilizing them and passing them on to a friend or family member.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was wrong! The metal is supple and not &amp;#34;loose&amp;#34;, which is my number 1 complaint about tweezers. They grip the hairs, and pluck nicely. I like the precision tweezers, and the look of them are super cute. I received these free, not in exchange for my review, and all the opinions expressed are 100% my own.  As someone who only plucks her eyebrows, nothing else, good tweezers are important. And these are fantastic, and the price is good considering the set is for 3 of them.</li>
            <li> I LOVE ALL THE TWEEZERS AND THE CUTE CASE THAT CAME WITH IT AND THE PACKAGE DESIGN IS VERY CUTE AS ALWAYS. ALSO LOVE HOW THEY USED HIGH QUALITY MATERIALS. IT&#x27;S A MUST BUY PEOPLE :)</li>
            <li> Great quality, and the case keeps me from losing them.</li>
            <li> These are great tweezers! I am always looking for good tweezers and I have found that these are good and I can keep them all in one container. They are accurate and sharp. Everyone will love these tweezers!</li>
            <li> Great Tweezers. Different shapes sure do come in handy.</li>
            <li> These are seriously the BEST tweezers ever! Now, let me first say, I usually buy the $1.00 pair, and I always have to go for the hair more than once, and it seriously irritates me! I received these from Bella and Bear for testing purposes, and for an honest review on my blog, and I only had to go for the hair the FIRST time. I have 3 moles (My Mom always calls them Beauty Marks) lol but they have stray BLACK hairs coming out of them, ever since forever! Growing up i would just cut them, but these suckers grow fast, so I started ripping them out! Lol Eventually, I learned that if you plucked them, it got the root, which means it takes longer to grow back!!! So there started my adventure with tweezers! I could not be without them, so thankfully, the Tweezer Set by Bella and Bear comes in a beautiful case, which means you should never lose them! You will always have a flat tip, a slanted tip, and a pointy tip with you at all times! I only go for the hair one time now versus 3 or 4 times, getting angry and pinching skin. Ouch! I haven&#x27;t done that yet with these at all!! My girlfriend is the one who teases my eye brows and I made her use these and she almost stole them!! I told her go read my review and order your own set!! lol I would definitely recommend this set! It is completely worth it!!</li>
            <li> Great set! Great customer support!!</li>
            <li> These pluckers are so cute and the case it comes in is just beautiful! It would definitely make a good gift for a girl that loves beauty! Plus the pluckers are good quality: you definitely can get hold of those stubborn hairs. Since there is 3 of them I had to share with my sister and she absolutely loves it too!</li>
            <li> I love them they are the best i have ecer tried and the cute too,</li>
            <li> I love these tweezers, all 3 of them!  They are good quality and get the job done.  I&#x27;m glad I took the risk and went with these and not tweezerman that I&#x27;m used to.  The case is super cute and well made.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product, but definitely not worth the original price of over $20...for 3 different tweezers and a holding kit...I got it for $5 and that was about the right price for this product.</li>
            <li> I looked at Revlon and Tweezerman Bella and Bear was the best deal I wasn&#x27;t expecting much for the price Was I wrong these are really nice If you have trouble getting a hold on small objects these are great I will buy them as gifts</li>
            <li> Not only do they come in a super cute pouch, they actually do the job! It&#x27;s hard to find tweezers that have good grip. So to anyone reading reviews because they are wondering that same thing... Yes, they work. No, you do not have to grab the same piece of hair 10 times before the tweezers finally grip it.</li>
            <li> These are awesome tweezers. For the price, you get good, sturdy products with a variety that fills all your tweezing needs plus they&#x27;re just really cute. They are the kind of thing that&#x27;s super practical but also looks very gift-worthy.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these tweezers. And the case is adorable. I would definitely recommend them</li>
            <li> These tweezers are accustomed to fit any type of situation. I was browsing tweezers at first so that I could groom my own eyebrows, but then I noticed that there were tweezers with the ability to take out ingrown hairs. I don&#x27;t get serious ingrown hairs, but knowing that i have some is very annoying, so I purchased these. They arrived two days after I placed my order, and they work amazingly. The floral pattern makes it easy to carry around so that if it topples out of my bag, no one questions what it is or why I have it. It&#x27;s stylish while effective. I love it.</li>
            <li> These are the best tweezers I have ever bought!</li>
            <li> The tweezers are wonderful and they come in an attractive case  that makes it convenient to use the tweezer you need to use</li>
            <li> These tweezers definitely aren&#x27;t Tweezerman but are decent at their price. They worked to tweeze stray brow hairs and pull a splinter out of my kiddo&#x27;s finger.  I really like the color, the packaging and the variety. These are a great set for me to keep in my travel bag.</li>
            <li> Maybe I was just so used to having a smaller set that this set felt big, and bulky. I don&#x27;t think they worked as well either. It&#x27;s a cure little set, and the holder is nice, but this just doesn&#x27;t work for me. I ended up using my old Revlon tweezer.</li>
            <li> i love it! the design is cute and it works great</li>
            <li> I bought this set not too long ago.  I like the cute little case to keep the tweezers in, although the quality is slightly less than I expected.  (The little &amp;#34;belt&amp;#34; on the front of the case was bent/folded funny when I received it so it can be a little difficult to close the flap, rather, insert the flap, into the &amp;#34;belt.&amp;#34;)  The tweezers work quite well and I like have 3 different &amp;#34;tips&amp;#34; right on hand to address whatever difficult situation I am trying to address, tweeze-wise, lol! ;)  My only real disappointment is that I paid $25 for this set and now it is so much cheaper.  :-/  Ah well.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite set of tweezers thus far! The designs on them are timeless and vintage, and they are doing great things to give my brows the perfect shape.</li>
            <li> Love these tweezers! I love the packaging design and they really work.</li>
            <li> Love it and love it.  Have already used all three kinds of tweezers and they work great.  Even my husband has used them.  He said he wished they came in a more manly case so he can take them when he travels for work.  I told him I would make him an &amp;#34;manly case&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are great I&#x27;ve used them a couple of times and pulls out the unwanted hair smoothly.</li>
            <li> What an incredible set! This Tweezers Set By Bella and Bear includes all the necessary tools for any beauty. From daily maintenance to the fine, hard to get hairs, these tweezers get the job done!.</li>
            <li> I received \\&quot;The Pluckers\\&quot; Tweezer set by Bella and Bear and first thing I fell in love. This is a adorable cute set that is really fashionable. I loved everything about it from the color to the different precision tips. The carrying case the tweezers go in is the added bonus. Its perfect for traveling or on the go to put in your purse. I have bought similar items from Tweezerman and never gotten a case to put them in as cute as this one. All of the products in this kit are definitely made using high quality material. The different size tweezers were absolutely awesome. You have a choice of three different pair which are slant, flat, and pointed tweezers. Each one has a special use to your need. I really love the pointed tweezers the most. These tweezers are the best choice for precision use for those really fine small or those nasty ingrown hairs. Man do those ever hurt. This would be a really great kit to add to a first aid kit to give it a splash of color. It would also be a great gift for any beauty enthusiast. I also love the Bella and Bear name on the tweezers. This also adds to the cuteness of the product and I really love knowing how they came up with the name using inspiration from their fur babies. Oh I also want to mention you will also receive instructions and how to join their club where you will save 25% straight away and also be the first to know about their giveaways and promotions on all their new products. You will learn so much more about them once you join the site and all their beauty products they have. Wow! If that isn&#x27;t enough they also give you a MONEY BACK GUARANTEE with no questions asked. I love that I found this company and will continue to shop and purchase items from here in the future.</li>
            <li> These are cheap tweezers in a pretty box.Totally ineffective on ingrown hairs.They don&#x27;t align or close correctly. Not good for delicate tweezing. Waste of money. I sent them back.</li>
            <li> Lovely tweezer set. Gave it as a gift and they were ecstatic with the product. Works great and the bag is pretty.</li>
            <li> These are a perfect set . Super cute packaging and great quality .</li>
            <li> This is an awesome set of tweezers!  Very high quality, with 3 different tweezers to choose from AND super cute and handy storage.  Just the right size to fit in any purse or makeup bag.  Extremely pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I love this tweezer set! The case is beautiful and I like that you get three different tweezers for different purposes. They are also very sharp and easy to use. I have used store brands and they always seemed to be dull, but this Tweezer Set is perfect!! I would definitely recommend this set to anyone.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are much too thick at the ends and do not grab the chin hairs I need to pluck at all!  Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Really cute &amp; works really well!</li>
            <li> I get it...everyone has raged about these tweezers, but I have tried all 3 and so far not one has tweezed a hair on the first or second even sometimes more try! Very frustrating. I guess my hunt for great tweezers is not over. Sorry, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> great set, each tweezer does something different and fits all needs.  Great packaging and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are by far the best I have ever used.  They also come in a very stylish case that fits well in my purse.&lt;br /&gt;I carry these with me wherever I go.</li>
            <li> A tweezer for just about every occasion!  Bella &amp; Bear&#x27;s &amp;#34;The Pluckers&amp;#34; Tweezer set is any girl&#x27;s must have!  The 3 different sized tweezers are able to fit into just about any place making it easier to pluck those unwanted hairs or remove splinters.  The set comes with a beautiful carrying case and the tweezers are easy to handle due to the wider handles.  This is a must have for anyone that plucks their own eyebrows and any crafters.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Bella and Bear makes this 3 pack of tweezers. I love them. I didnt even know tweezers had different shapes/sizes. they also come with the cutest case so now i will never lose them again! I want to get several more to give out as bridesmaid gifts when i get married. Every girl should own these!</li>
            <li> I have something called PCOS, it&#x27;s a hormone imbalance that causes me to have extra testosterone which means my body can grow more hair in unwanted places. I get a lot around on my face that I like to both wax and pluck. I pluck a lot, constantly. I got these tweezers for free* to try and review. This pack comes with three tweezers with different tips and a case to store them all in. The three points are angled, flat(or straight) and pointed. Having several choices are good depending on what kind of hair and how long. Yeah, the hair can be different on my face two, three different thicknesses in three colors. Fun right? So all three shapes come in handy. The pointed ones are also good for certian kinds of splinters that you need a bit more precision for. This is definately a set I would buy all over again if I lost mine or needed to get a gift for a teen or lady.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*regardless of getting this tweezer set for free this is my 100% honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I really like these tweezers. They come in a beautiful package. Thismakes it easy to keep all three tweezers in the same place. The three different style of tweezers make it easy to tame your brows at home. I am able to completely pull the hair out at the root. I was never able to do that before with drug store tweezers. I highly recommend these for anyone who wants to maintain their brows at home.</li>
            <li> They really work! The case is well made. I must admit I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Nice set! Comes in a beautiful case. This would make a nice gift.</li>
            <li> These are the best tweezers ever:  3 tweezers in a convenient package (which is nice for me, because it hides them from my husband and kids who, if they don&#x27;t see them out in plain site, won&#x27;t use them!).  The are great for plucking eyebrows, getting splinters out, poking the hard plastic that covers packages to help you open them (instead of using a knife or scissors ... ok, so this might not be the intended use, but I do it), and they look great too.  They are sturdy, high-quality tweezers and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I really like these and the cute case they come in...these are the best tweezers I have used in a long time</li>
            <li> I love my Bella and Bear tweezers set! They are so pretty and match several other Bella and Bear items I have. The tweezers are sharp and tight and work very well. Definitely recommend these!</li>
            <li> These tweezers are excellent quality. I really enjoy the travel case and the fact it has three different sets of tweezers to use for a variety of things. The color is super cute and the customer service has been great. I think these will last a long time and withstand the bending that some tweezers have an issue with. I highly recommend this set to those looking for a new set or maybe a gift.</li>
            <li> I love this tweezer set, and for the price, you really can&#x27;t beat it. You get 3 tweezers for the price of one (compared to the prestige brands). I love the variety and the packaging is adorable. It&#x27;s a great quality product. I have already recommended these to friends and family. They would make a cute gift or stocking stuffer as well. :)</li>
            <li> This super adorable tweezer set is an eyebrows dream come true! There are three pair of tweezers in this set: slant, pointed and flat. All of them are all very well made and provide accurate precision. This set comes with a cute little case that keeps them clean and well protected for easy travel. All items come in the lovely vintage floral design that I have come to know as bella &amp; bear. I am super happy I was able to pick these up during a promotion. Love them!</li>
