            <li>This brush is nice.</li>
            <li>It really takes the guess work out of creating the perfect winged eyeliner!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s flexible, but not too much so it will hold it shape and line eyes or shape eyebrows perfectly</li>

            <li>Excellent firm under-eye liner brush.</li>
            <li>Fantastic for flat-lining eyes.</li>
            <li>, it is a perfect size and the bristles stay really nice, straight, and stiff after washing.  </li>
            <li>They are soft and strong, and the makeup application is nice.  </li>
            <li>definitely comparable to MAC or even better!</li>
            <li>But for everyday minimalistic use, this is great.</li>
            <li>So far I love it.</li>
            <li>the price is right</li>
            <li>You can use this with gel or liquid liners for a flawless wing, but I particularly like this for dark powders which I can push into my lash line for a natural or smoky effect.  </li>
            <li>Easy though, not heavy.</li>
            <li>Soft, comfortable bristles.</li>
            <li>It is my first Bdellium tools brush</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why there are so many make up &amp;#34;artists&amp;#34; on YouTube that talk about this brush.  </li>
            <li>I tried a lot of other brushes this shape that were so floppy that they were useless, but this one was absolutely perfect.</li>
            <li>The bristles are really nice and stiff, but still soft enough that they won&#x27;t poke your eye out.  </li>
            <li>I am a professional makeup artist and I received a set of bdellium brushes as a gift.  </li>
            <li>I also think this is gentle enough to smudge out underneath the eye</li>
            <li>Not as soft as I had thought it to be, its actually quite stiff, but not as much on the lower lash line which is what I plan to use this brush for.</li>
            <li>The bristles are nice and thin, stiff but soft enough not to hurt your eyes.</li>

            <li> I love bdellim brushes. They are my new fav brushes. I am getting every one. This eyeliner brush is a good push liner brush. Although I&#x27;m still not the best at getting product to push into my lashes, this brush has helped improve my skills.</li>

I have not been disappointed in the Bdellium brand yet and this brush is no exception. Love the fact that they are so affordable too!</li>
            <li> Bdellium brushes rock the face.  This brush I use on my brows....works wonderful.  Drawing out some small hairs makes it looks real.  Easy though, not heavy.</li>
            <li> My go to brush for cleaning up under my brows!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this brush!!!  I use it to apply shadow to my lower lash line and it works great!!</li>
            <li> This brush is great for applying eyeshadow under your bottom lash line. I then like to smoke it out with a pencil brush.</li>
            <li> Excellent firm under-eye liner brush. Great for powder liner.</li>
            <li> I like it, but I don&#x27;t love it. I had been searching for a new flat eyeliner brush since the one that I had been using broke in half and was discontinued at the store I bought it from. I searched for the same one but I couldn&#x27;t find it and I came across this one that looks similar. I really like this brush though, it works well. The only thing is I wish that the brissell&#x27;s would be a little bit sturdier and not so flimsy. If you&#x27;re looking for a brush to apply minimal make up on, this would be your brush. If you&#x27;re like me and you like for everything to pop and put on a lot of it, then I recommend to keep looking. I also wouldn&#x27;t recommend a make up artist purchase this brush. But for everyday minimalistic use, this is great.</li>
            <li> sturdy and precise! i love it! works really great with lipstick, shaping the eyebrows and concealing. highly recommended. great quality for a great price. definitely comparable to MAC or even better!</li>
            <li> I got this brush primarily to do push liner and I&#x27;m very happy with it. The bristles are nice and thin, stiff but soft enough not to hurt your eyes. I use this with dark eyeshadows, gel liner, and even with a pencil liner which otherwise applies too thick and smudges. It works well on the lower lashline and eyebrows too. It offers great precision, you can start your liner thin then build it up and easily wing it out. Highly recommended for the quality and value.</li>
            <li> I use it to line out my lower lash line with shadows. It´s perfect for the job, very precise and easy to work with</li>
            <li> I use this brush for eyeliner - filling in eyebrows and smudging under lash line. works great!</li>
            <li> High quality synthetic brushes</li>
            <li> Great brush! I like very clean lines and this brush has the perfect angle and stiffness to get the job done. Very light and easy to clean!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why there are so many make up &amp;#34;artists&amp;#34; on YouTube that talk about this brush.  It&#x27;s okay &amp; the price is right but it&#x27;s not earth shattering for me.  It&#x27;s a brush, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to &amp; it&#x27;s inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Nice firm brush, but I will not be using it. Bought it to tightline, but the brush is way too wide for me to use it for that purpose.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush, it is a perfect size and the bristles stay really nice, straight, and stiff after washing.  It is perfect for eyeliner and tight-lining.  Love it.</li>

            <li> This brush is amazing! It really takes the guess work out of creating the perfect winged eyeliner! And for the price it can&#x27;t be beat. I&#x27;m a makeup artist and I bought one for myself and my kit and it&#x27;s amazing. I love it! Brushes are stiff and get close to the lash line.</li>
            <li> Similar to Mac 212 brush. This is a great dupe.</li>
            <li> Not quite as stiff bristled as I would like, but it is better than any other I have to date</li>
            <li> This brush did it&#x27;s job. It&#x27;s flexible, but not too much so it will hold it shape and line eyes or shape eyebrows perfectly</li>
            <li> So far I love it. I have been looking this type of brush in other brands for a while, but had&#x27;t decide which one to get. It is my first Bdellium tools brush and I really like the way it picks up the product and the way it applies it. I don&#x27;t have any other brand of brush this same type to compare it with. But now I feel like I should get another type and compare.</li>
            <li> Fantastic for flat-lining eyes.</li>
            <li> really great stiff brush that is great for eyebrow carving. would recommend to anybody who is looking for a brush to eyebrow carve-- this one is perfect</li>
            <li> I like the build of these brushes and this one in particular is firm without being harsh or painful to the eye area.

Still overall disappointed by this brush and would have liked getting my money back but don&#x27;t want to deal with the return shipping crap. Oh well.</li>
