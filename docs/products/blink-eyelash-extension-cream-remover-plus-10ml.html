            <li>This stuff is amazing!  </li>
            <li>These removed my lashes nicely and effectively.</li>
            <li>I made sure to keep it away from skin and the eye.</li>
            <li>This was so much better.</li>
            <li>I finally found the perfect product...</li>
            <li>Works well without irritation, better than paying at the salon to remove the lashes.</li>
            <li>but I was able to figure it out :)  </li>
            <li>After about 5 minutes a number of the lashes came off easily.</li>
            <li>I applied with a cotton swab then used a clean mascara wand to brush it through.</li>
            <li>Be sure to keep your eyes shut tightly, it burns a bit :p</li>
            <li>It came off like nothing although some i had to apply a lil bit more because it was so much glue on there</li>
            <li>Rinsing with water stopped the burning fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>Be patient and careful and you should have a good</li>
            <li>Shipping was pretty quick too.</li>
            <li>I did wash my face after to make sure all glue was off then brushed the lashes with the clean wand.</li>
            <li>I always dread hacing to get the last few dangling lashes removed but this works great!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Rinse off your eye and repeat the process for the stubborn ones that didn&#x27;t come off the first time around.</li>
            <li>It did burn when I got it directly in my eye, but I was overly excited to get the extensions off</li>
            <li>Thanks to the helpful reviews I knew what to do.</li>
            <li>Works very well and did not irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li>that I really just went all in too soon.  </li>
            <li>This products saved my real eyelashes from getting cut off.</li>
            <li>So much cheaper than going to the salon-</li>
            <li>Most came off with the first application but a few of them stuck around so</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and will use it again if I decide to do the extensions again.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Simply dabbed it on, waited 5 minutes, and the lashes wiped right off with a cotton pad.</li>
            <li>not as good as I expected but did the job after a few trys</li>
            <li>My eyes did sting a bit the night that I removed them, and were even a little red and puffy right after the removal, but I was fine by the morning.</li>
            <li>I got my lashes put on professionally at a nail salon, therefore the glue was a lot stronger than normal.</li>
            <li>I put a small amount on a q-tip and was easily able to remove my false eyelashes without losing my own eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>That needs to be fixed.</li>
            <li>Lifesaver...if you have a set of eyelash extensions from hell like I did, and you are hoping to salvage your natural lashes go ahead and buy this.  </li>
            <li>I used a clean mascara brush to comb it through and then in a few minutes i started to pull them off with a tweezer.</li>
            <li>It worked, it took some time on some of the stubborn ones, but it definitely worked and it didn&#x27;t damage my natural lashes.  </li>
            <li>I think the best method is to squeeze a thin line of glue remover onto the base of your lash line, comb it through the lashes a bit (with a clean mascara wand) and wiggle side to side until the glue loosens (there are plenty of Youtube videos illustating this).</li>

            <li> I also put some on the underside of them CAREFULLY.</li>
            <li> I did leave the gel on for a few minutes before starting to remove the extensions.  </li>
            <li> After pulling out many of my natural lashes, considering taking a scissor to my eye, and three frustrating days looking crazy and swollen, Blink Eyelash Extension Cream Remover was a GOD SEND.</li>
            <li> This product works extremely well.  </li>
            <li> and i usually dont get them done because of my last experience getting them off which involved a sissors.</li>
            <li> but i didnt experience any pain or burn because i was very careful applying it.</li>
            <li> I put about half a pea sized amount on a Q-Tip and put it on my lash line.</li>
            <li> I mean, when you&#x27;re applying a chemical close to your eye, you should have some sort of instructions like how long to leave it on, etc.</li>
            <li> I do have some mild irritation from the fumes...which aren&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> Within in a few minutes, about 5-7, they came off without a problem!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My faux lashes were put on individually, but came off in chunks which seemed weird to me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure the correct way to apply it, it didn&#x27;t say on the tube or box,  </li>
            <li> Apply a thin line at the baseline of your eyelid.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t even try to do the other eye it hurt so bad.</li>
            <li> i know it was a bad idea from the moment she was finish because my eye lids were so heavy from the glue and irratating my eyes.</li>
            <li> It was such a horrible experience</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this got the job done, but the faux lashes were just so stubborn!</li>
            <li> I just lined it over the base of my lashes and figured it would need time to work.</li>
            <li> and it was the WORST pain of my life.</li>

            <li> I got my lashes put on professionally at a nail salon, therefore the glue was a lot stronger than normal. It took a long time to get the false lashes off of my natural lashes, and with no instructions on the box, or a pamphlet inside, it makes it pretty hard to gage just how long this should be left on. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this got the job done, but the faux lashes were just so stubborn! I think the best method is to squeeze a thin line of glue remover onto the base of your lash line, comb it through the lashes a bit (with a clean mascara wand) and wiggle side to side until the glue loosens (there are plenty of Youtube videos illustating this). My faux lashes were put on individually, but came off in chunks which seemed weird to me. My eyes did sting a bit the night that I removed them, and were even a little red and puffy right after the removal, but I was fine by the morning.</li>
            <li> It did not work for me</li>
            <li> Worked great but it got in my eye and it was the WORST pain of my life. Didn&#x27;t even try to do the other eye it hurt so bad. Be careful.</li>
            <li> Perfect product. Gel is great because it doesn&#x27;t run into your eyes. Simply dabbed it on, waited 5 minutes, and the lashes wiped right off with a cotton pad. I did 2 applications since there were one or 2 stubborn lashes on each eye. Total time spent--15 minutes. No pain, no lost eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Thanks to the helpful reviews I knew what to do. I did one eye at a time as a safety measure. I applied with a cotton swab then used a clean mascara wand to brush it through. After about 5 minutes a number of the lashes came off easily. As I kept working the wand through, others came off but I needed a second application for the stubborn ones. I made sure to keep it away from skin and the eye. I do have some mild irritation from the fumes...which aren&#x27;t bad. I did wash my face after to make sure all glue was off then brushed the lashes with the clean wand. Be patient and careful and you should have a good experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had tried olive oil and got nowhere with that over two evenings. This was so much better.</li>
            <li> Let me start by thanking those who posted directions on how to apply this stuff because it didn&#x27;t come with any instructions what so ever! Nothing in the box, nothing ON the box, nothing in the package. That needs to be fixed. I mean, when you&#x27;re applying a chemical close to your eye, you should have some sort of instructions like how long to leave it on, etc. ANYWAY. The product works great. I put about half a pea sized amount on a Q-Tip and put it on my lash line. I also put some on the underside of them CAREFULLY. I waited about five minutes and then started to brush through them with a mascara wand. Most came off with the first application but a few of them stuck around so I needed to apply it again after rinsing my eye off. I did one eye at a time so I could see what the heck I was doing. That should be common sense, but it&#x27;s worth mentioning. I already miss my eyelash extensions and will likely get them back on, but my lashes needed a break and this product helped to make that happen. I recommend it highly. Shipping was pretty quick too.</li>
            <li> This product works excellent.  I finally found the perfect product...</li>
            <li> Works like a charm! I always dread hacing to get the last few dangling lashes removed but this works great!</li>
            <li> Works well without irritation, better than paying at the salon to remove the lashes.</li>
            <li> This product works extremely well.  It did not hurt or sting my eyes in any way and I wear contact lens.  It is a gel.  I put a small amount on a q-tip and was easily able to remove my false eyelashes without losing my own eyelashes.  There was no pulling or yanking necessary.  I did leave the gel on for a few minutes before starting to remove the extensions.  I highly recommend this product and will use it again if I decide to do the extensions again.</li>
            <li> not as good as I expected but did the job after a few trys</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  There aren&#x27;t any instructions but I was able to figure it out :)  Simply spread a small amount across the base of your lashes, wait 10 minutes or so, use a warm washcloth (not quite wrung out completely) and gently wipe until all product - and lash extensions - are removed.  Be sure to keep your eyes shut tightly, it burns a bit :p</li>
            <li> These removed my lashes nicely and effectively. They did not require me to pull out my lashes, phew!</li>
            <li> Works very well and did not irritate my eyes. Saved me some $ and time, instead of going to a lash technician to remove my eyelash extensions. Recommended!</li>
            <li> Lifesaver...if you have a set of eyelash extensions from hell like I did, and you are hoping to salvage your natural lashes go ahead and buy this.  My only regret was that I didn&#x27;t spring for next day shipping.  It worked, it took some time on some of the stubborn ones, but it definitely worked and it didn&#x27;t damage my natural lashes.  It did burn when I got it directly in my eye, but I was overly excited to get the extensions off that I really just went all in too soon.  Rinsing with water stopped the burning fairly quickly.  I&#x27;m not really sure the correct way to apply it, it didn&#x27;t say on the tube or box,  i just dabbed it where I could see the glue and stayed away from flames.</li>
            <li> Great for taking lashes off.</li>
            <li> This definitely works. Apply a thin line at the baseline of your eyelid. With a brush cover all of your eyelashes with the eyelash cream.  Let sit for 5 to 7 minutes and brush off with a brush.&lt;br /&gt;Eyelashes come off smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rinse off your eye and repeat the process for the stubborn ones that didn&#x27;t come off the first time around.</li>
            <li> Got my eyelashes done at a nail salon in brooklyn ny and i usually dont get them done because of my last experience getting them off which involved a sissors. It was such a horrible experience but i wanted to try again since it was my birthday. Now let me tell you i know it was a bad idea from the moment she was finish because my eye lids were so heavy from the glue and irratating my eyes. The glue was sooo freaking hard and itchy i wanted them off right away. I googled eyelash remover and came across this product and didnt hesitate to buy it. Yes it work. I used a qutip to apply the product over and under my eyelid keeping my eyelids apart so it wont get in my eye because it burns once it gets in your eye. I used a clean mascara brush to comb it through and then in a few minutes i started to pull them off with a tweezer. It came off like nothing although some i had to apply a lil bit more because it was so much glue on there but i didnt experience any pain or burn because i was very careful applying it. Never again would i get eyelash extensions. This products saved my real eyelashes from getting cut off.</li>
            <li> AMAZING!&lt;br /&gt;This is a lifesaver. So much cheaper than going to the salon- lashes come out within minutes!</li>
            <li> After pulling out many of my natural lashes, considering taking a scissor to my eye, and three frustrating days looking crazy and swollen, Blink Eyelash Extension Cream Remover was a GOD SEND. I just lined it over the base of my lashes and figured it would need time to work. Within in a few minutes, about 5-7, they came off without a problem!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stuff just works. Did not burn. Did not irritate. It just worked. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome! Definitely use this if your removing your eyelash extension by yourself.</li>
