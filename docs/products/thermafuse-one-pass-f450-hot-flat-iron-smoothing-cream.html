            <li>I have very fine hair, and all products make it look greasy except this one.</li>
            <li>I said MOST of the time.  </li>
            <li>Smells nice, like light cotton candy.</li>
            <li>I have to make more than one pass</li>
            <li>but I love how it reduces frizz and adds manageability to my locks.</li>
            <li>I wish this had existed many years ago.</li>
            <li>I like the oil much better for my course hair type.  </li>
            <li>More than</li>
            <li>My hair is in much better condition since I started using these Thermafuse products;</li>
            <li>That said, most products are, so if your hair is not as fine it might work out well.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and tends to be frizzy more than curly.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s easy to work with.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>I apply One Pass to my hair while it is still damp, just before blow drying, and comb through thoroughly with a fine comb.</li>
            <li>Thermafuse One Pass F450 Hot Iron Smoothing Cream is awesome for flat ironing and heat combing the hair, this cream is the bomb!</li>
            <li>This is the product, leave hair straight, soft and with an incredible shine.</li>
            <li>use One Pass in conjunction with Smooth Balance conditioner and another sulfate/salt free conditioning shampoo.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have the option of longer straight hair AND to have HEALTHIER hair.</li>
            <li>I take a dime sized amount, rub it between palms, then smooth over my hair.</li>
            <li>Results are smooth, frizz free and lasts all day and</li>
            <li>I used a Thermafuse Hot Iron but it was an oil, this came and it was more a cream.  </li>
            <li>I would like a refund or replacement with the original product from the manufacturer.</li>
            <li>Most of the time I  really like my hair.  </li>
            <li>....makes hair really shinny and healthy looking.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t care for the smell of the product though, but it fades quickly.</li>
            <li>I never thought I could have smooth pretty hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s naturally straight; the texture is fine (but I have a lot of it) and, with the right products</li>
            <li>it does a great job with around 4-5 small pumps</li>
            <li>I also found that used on damp hair after shampooing, it makes the hair soft, and easy to curl with a curling iron or brush, if that&#x27;s what you want.</li>
            <li>All I need now is my large barreled hot curling iron and this product....love it!  </li>
            <li>My hair is very much softer and silkier when I use One</li>
            <li>It was fun having straight hair for a while</li>
            <li>Living where I do, without One Pass I would have to cut my hair very short or get a curly perm to be able to control it.  </li>
            <li>the best  part is you only need a small amount of product.  </li>
            <li>it was hot and humid.</li>
            <li>This is the first product that really keeps my hair from frizzing out in humidity - very well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>This product works pretty much as advertised to keep my hair smooth and more or less straight, even when I&#x27;m out in the wind.</li>
            <li>I can generally brush it smooth again.</li>
            <li>the frizz is certain to return.</li>
            <li>I use one and a half pumps for my short bob haircut, rub it between my palms and apply to my hair concentrating on the top of my scalp and ends of my hair (places where the humidity effects me most).</li>
            <li>It is 106 her in Kansas with very high humidity</li>
            <li>She claimed my hair would stay straight for up to 5 days.  </li>
            <li>and my hair has stayed straight.  </li>
            <li>but to much in your hair because it will make it look oily.</li>
            <li>stuff really works.  </li>
            <li>to experiment a bit with how much product to use and how close to your roots you want to get.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>My hair came out so straight</li>
            <li>and it is still straight.</li>
            <li>This does not make my hair as straight as I would like.  </li>
            <li>and I really like the result .</li>
            <li>and it absolutely works.</li>
            <li>It definitely helps to avoid the frizz, hair feels smooth after he iron pass</li>
            <li>If I stayed indoors, it would stay absolutely straight until I washed it again.</li>
            <li>Your hair will stay relatively straight in humidity, until you wash the product out.  </li>
            <li>My medium length, colored, very curly hair is now under control in the humid summers of Washington, DC.  </li>
            <li>It really smoothes out my curly hair.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I apply it after blow drying and before flat ironing, then finish with a light hold hairspray and my hair is immune to the south Florida humidity.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend using it every time you wash the hair, because it have to be sealed with high heat</li>
            <li>Not as straight as when I use the same brand but the oil hot Armour.</li>
            <li>My dry frizzy ends look so much better, not flat-ironed-perfect but close enough.</li>
            <li>I live in New York</li>
            <li>It did not work well at all in that climate, but in New York I can&#x27;t be without it</li>
            <li>My fine hair does not feel greasy or weighed down and the frizzies are kept to a minimum.</li>
            <li>less breakage and it stays smooth and mostly straight for a day or two depending on the weather and how much time I spend outside.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>My stylist recommended this product, but it is just too heavy for my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>If I get rained on it will frizz as it dries, but can be recovered when dry by a good brushing and a few passes with the flat</li>
            <li>This arrived without the cap and the product clearly had been diluted with water.</li>
            <li>For all you out there that want straight hair definitely try this product.  </li>
            <li>I would think that applying at the roots might make the hair look greasy, but if you have very curly or coarse hair that may not be a problem for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>if you use it always, personally I used once a month or every two weeks, when I want my hair to specially straight and shinny.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>On very humid days, especially windy days, the ends may frizz some</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this especially if you live in a humid country like I do.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and colored, so I try to avoid extreme heat, especially since I style it almost every day.  </li>
            <li>To be on the safe side I&#x27;d recommend using a small amount from about mid-shaft down the first time you try it.  </li>
            <li>I always use this product before using my flat iron and luckily my hair stays in place all day long.</li>
            <li>Our summers are brutally hot and humid and my hair generally looks like a cross between a dandelion seed head and a Brillo pad as soon as I go outside.</li>
            <li>; is usually true, however this product at $25 was a waste of money.  </li>
            <li>In hot weather I frequently wash and blow dry my hair daily.</li>
            <li>I live in the South Carolina Low Country.</li>
            <li>this is light weight enough, no oily residues and does not require heavy use of the product to begin with.</li>
            <li>This product is the only one that keeps my hair straight and frizz-free all day long, even in the humidity!</li>
            <li>The other has a much thicker consistency.  </li>
            <li>I then blow dry my hair using my fingers to pull it straight and a large round styling brush to shape it.</li>
            <li>After it is completely dry, I use my flat iron to smooth my hair and \\&quot;set\\&quot; the One Pass, but at a temperature less than 450.  </li>
            <li>:)A little goes a long way as well, even though it&#x27;s a small bottle.</li>

            <li> It left a residue on my hair, plus it didn&#x27;t seem to protect from the flat iron.  </li>
            <li> Since Summer here is humid, and the prospect of controlling my hair with a heavy coating of extreme hold hair spray is most unappealing, I&#x27;m constantly trying new styling products - with mixed results.  </li>
            <li> I used only on the mid-to-ends of my long hair, none on the roots (need body up there, not smoothing)</li>
            <li> so I use it with my titanium flat Iron at 390 degrees Fahrenheit, but It can be use it up to 450 degrees.</li>
            <li> I like to use a hair protectant when I flat iron my hair and</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend waiting until it&#x27;s fully dry before straightening the strand.</li>
            <li> Instead of a flat iron I use a large-barrel curling iron for a loose wave.  </li>

            <li> My hair is thick, curly and out of control!  After having my hair colored my stylist begged me to let her straighten my hair using this product.  I figured it was not going to work especially on my hair but surprisingly it did.  She claimed my hair would stay straight for up to 5 days.  I allowed 3 days to try it out and I have to say this product works amazingly. It is 106 her in Kansas with very high humidity and I have walked every night 3 miles and my hair has stayed straight.  For all you out there that want straight hair definitely try this product.  It was fun having straight hair for a while but tomorrow its back to my ringlets. I will however,let my stylist straighten my hair now every time i have it colored.</li>
            <li> This stuff works really good. Just don&#x27;t but to much in your hair because it will make it look oily.</li>
            <li> Most of the time I  really like my hair.  It&#x27;s naturally straight; the texture is fine (but I have a lot of it) and, with the right products, it&#x27;s easy to work with.  Notice I said MOST of the time.  Throw in a little heat and humidity and it all goes horribly wrong.  Frizzy,  1980&#x27;s-metal-band wrong.  Since Summer here is humid, and the prospect of controlling my hair with a heavy coating of extreme hold hair spray is most unappealing, I&#x27;m constantly trying new styling products - with mixed results.  Until now...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff really works.  I take about a nickel sized amount, rub it into my palms and work it into DRY hair from about mid-shaft down.  Instead of a flat iron I use a large-barrel curling iron for a loose wave.  Just finger comb, maybe add a dab of [[ASIN:B002RSS5F0 Thermafuse HeatSmart Serum Dry Oil Treatment (2 oz)]]  to the ends and I&#x27;m finished.  The style does not reverse, even when the weather is damp or humid.  My fine hair does not feel greasy or weighed down and the frizzies are kept to a minimum. It has a light coconut smell that is very faint once you&#x27;ve finished styling. Can we say that this product is just about perfect?  Why yes, I think we can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plan to experiment a bit with how much product to use and how close to your roots you want to get.  To be on the safe side I&#x27;d recommend using a small amount from about mid-shaft down the first time you try it.  I would think that applying at the roots might make the hair look greasy, but if you have very curly or coarse hair that may not be a problem for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go ahead, give it a try!  This is one product that actually delivers.</li>
            <li> Love one pass you don&#x27;t need much and it does a awesome job.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, like light cotton candy. I have to make more than one pass but I love how it reduces frizz and adds manageability to my locks. Will reorder for sure!</li>
            <li> My hairstylist recommended my using this product for flat ironing my hair to tame down the flyaways and keep it flat...it does a great job with around 4-5 small pumps....makes hair really shinny and healthy looking.  I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have very thick wavy hair and have had trouble finding anything that can last through the humidity of a New Jersey summer. This product is the only one that keeps my hair straight and frizz-free all day long, even in the humidity! I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I was first a little skeptical about using this product. A friend of mine uses the f450 straightening treatment and she loves it vs a relaxer.&lt;br /&gt;I got mine two days ago and straightened my hair yesterday. My hair came out so straight you thought I had a relaxer in. I&#x27;m on my second day after sweating and all and it is still straight. I&#x27;ll see if it goes past 5 days, but at this point anything thing that goes past two days without reverting is thumbs up with me.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is small, but you use very little so it will last you a long time If you don&#x27;t straighten often. I&#x27;m one happy customer.</li>
            <li> I never thought I could have smooth pretty hair. I wish this had existed many years ago.I don&#x27;t need to go back to the hair stylist.</li>
            <li> I used a Thermafuse Hot Iron but it was an oil, this came and it was more a cream.  I like the oil much better for my course hair type.  So I think I ordered the wrong stuff to use with my hot iron.  This does not make my hair as straight as I would like.  Not as straight as when I use the same brand but the oil hot Armour.</li>
            <li> My hair was total frizz before I for the F50 done,  I urge you to buy the straightening package for $60.  It cost me over $200 in salon.  The shampoo conditioner and straightening iron cream are all cheaper on her.</li>
            <li> Thermafuse One Pass F450 Hot Iron Smoothing Cream is awesome for flat ironing and heat combing the hair, this cream is the bomb! Love it Love it!</li>
            <li> I tried this smoothing cream on a whim hoping it would be good.  The &amp;#34;You get what you pay for...&amp;#34; is usually true, however this product at $25 was a waste of money.  It left a residue on my hair, plus it didn&#x27;t seem to protect from the flat iron.  I cannot recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Wow! Stylist recommended for flat ironing, but t am so impatient with the iron that I hardly ever used it. Today I decided, why not try this as a blow dry primer? The ingredients are similar, so why buy two different products, especially at this price? I used only on the mid-to-ends of my long hair, none on the roots (need body up there, not smoothing) and I really like the result . My dry frizzy ends look so much better, not flat-ironed-perfect but close enough.</li>
            <li> This is the first product that really keeps my hair from frizzing out in humidity - very well worth the price.  Easy to use and it absolutely works.</li>
            <li> This is the product, leave hair straight, soft and with an incredible shine. I have very fine hair so I use it with my titanium flat Iron at 390 degrees Fahrenheit, but It can be use it up to 450 degrees. I don&#x27;t recommend using it every time you wash the hair, because it have to be sealed with high heat and you can damage your hair  if you use it always, personally I used once a month or every two weeks, when I want my hair to specially straight and shinny.</li>
            <li> Got this for my daughter for Christmas and it worked great on her hair.  She has extremely curly hair and after using this you wouldn&#x27;t know it.</li>
            <li> Does what it is intended to do. Definitely recommend waiting until it&#x27;s fully dry before straightening the strand. Only takes about 10 seconds, but you don&#x27;t want it smoking. :)A little goes a long way as well, even though it&#x27;s a small bottle.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair.  When I want to straighten my hair, this does the job!  Best product I&#x27;ve found.  Love it!</li>
            <li> My stylist recommended this product, but it is just too heavy for my fine hair.  That said, most products are, so if your hair is not as fine it might work out well.</li>
            <li> It definitely helps to avoid the frizz, hair feels smooth after he iron pass</li>
            <li> I live in the South Carolina Low Country. My hair is fine and tends to be frizzy more than curly.  Our summers are brutally hot and humid and my hair generally looks like a cross between a dandelion seed head and a Brillo pad as soon as I go outside. This product works pretty much as advertised to keep my hair smooth and more or less straight, even when I&#x27;m out in the wind. Of course, if my hair gets wet, all bets are off - the frizz is certain to return. I started using Thermafuse products at the recommendation of my stylist a couple of years ago. My hair is very much softer and silkier when I use One Pass regularly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use One Pass in conjunction with Smooth Balance conditioner and another sulfate/salt free conditioning shampoo. In hot weather I frequently wash and blow dry my hair daily. I do not use One Pass according to the directions as I am not very good at applying any product to dry hair evenly.  I apply One Pass to my hair while it is still damp, just before blow drying, and comb through thoroughly with a fine comb. My hair is chin length and I only use about 4-5 pumps, two for each side, one for the back.  More than that tends to make my hair too sticky.  I then blow dry my hair using my fingers to pull it straight and a large round styling brush to shape it. After it is completely dry, I use my flat iron to smooth my hair and \\&quot;set\\&quot; the One Pass, but at a temperature less than 450.  The increments on my iron are not shown in degrees, but I would estimate it is around 300-325.  My hair is fine and colored, so I try to avoid extreme heat, especially since I style it almost every day.  My hair is in much better condition since I started using these Thermafuse products; less breakage and it stays smooth and mostly straight for a day or two depending on the weather and how much time I spend outside. If I stayed indoors, it would stay absolutely straight until I washed it again. On very humid days, especially windy days, the ends may frizz some if I&#x27;moutside for very long, but I can generally brush it smooth again. If I get rained on it will frizz as it dries, but can be recovered when dry by a good brushing and a few passes with the flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a great product.  Living where I do, without One Pass I would have to cut my hair very short or get a curly perm to be able to control it.  It&#x27;s nice to have the option of longer straight hair AND to have HEALTHIER hair.</li>
            <li> If you want to straighten out your curly hair, this is the stuff!  The directions say to use a small amount on dry hair, and then use your iron.  Your hair will stay relatively straight in humidity, until you wash the product out.  I also found that used on damp hair after shampooing, it makes the hair soft, and easy to curl with a curling iron or brush, if that&#x27;s what you want. Non greasy, just use a bit...I take a dime sized amount, rub it between palms, then smooth over my hair. Smells nice, too.</li>
            <li> My medium length, colored, very curly hair is now under control in the humid summers of Washington, DC.  My hairdresser had given me a sample of One Pass 450 after using it on me.  All I need now is my large barreled hot curling iron and this product....love it!  Results are smooth, frizz free and lasts all day and the best  part is you only need a small amount of product.  Small size will last a long time.  Five stars!</li>
            <li> This arrived without the cap and the product clearly had been diluted with water. The consistency is thin and runny compared to the bottle I had previously. The other has a much thicker consistency.  I would like a refund or replacement with the original product from the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> I like to use a hair protectant when I flat iron my hair and this is light weight enough, no oily residues and does not require heavy use of the product to begin with. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product almost two years. It really smoothes out my curly hair. I live in New York and I just returned from Florida&lt;br /&gt;where it was hot and humid. It did not work well at all in that climate, but in New York I can&#x27;t be without it</li>
            <li> This product has been my HG hair product for the last few years. I apply it after blow drying and before flat ironing, then finish with a light hold hairspray and my hair is immune to the south Florida humidity. I use one and a half pumps for my short bob haircut, rub it between my palms and apply to my hair concentrating on the top of my scalp and ends of my hair (places where the humidity effects me most). I have very fine hair, and all products make it look greasy except this one.</li>
            <li> Works great and makes my hair smooth and shiny. Don&#x27;t care for the smell of the product though, but it fades quickly.</li>
            <li> Great product and great service from the seller. I highly recommend this especially if you live in a humid country like I do. I always use this product before using my flat iron and luckily my hair stays in place all day long. It&#x27;s really an amazing product, my hair feels softer and looks shinier as well. Highly recommend!</li>
