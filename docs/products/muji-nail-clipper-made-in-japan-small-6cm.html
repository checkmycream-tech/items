            <li>Satisfying click.</li>
            <li>I have Tweezerman clippers and these seem much better.  </li>
            <li>You will not be able to fnd any better nail clipper.</li>
            <li>good price fast dlivery</li>
            <li>I agree, throw away any other clippers, these are the best.  </li>
            <li>It looks beautiful, feels solid, and performs like a champ.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are comfortable to hold and sturdy.</li>
            <li>I also like to clean my clippers and found when doing</li>
            <li>The cut is so clean I do not have to file away the ragged edges, and no nails go flying.</li>
            <li>What was described is true.</li>
            <li>, they cost more than the drugstore version, but man, these things cut way better, and are built to last.</li>
            <li>Products arrived quickly and were packaged well.  </li>
            <li>These clippers provide a pretty clean cut of the nail</li>
            <li>Great compact little clipper with a plastic cover to hold clippings.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure able spending so much for clipper, but they really are a step above the cheap ones.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>Pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li>Super sharp and effective.</li>
            <li>Excellent quality, sharp and and doesn&#x27;t leave rough edges at all.</li>
            <li>Finally, I&#x27;ve been looking for many years, this one is the one.</li>
            <li>I bought these because I thought it was hilarious that there&#x27;s even such thing as 5-star fingernail clippers.</li>
            <li>Nice sharp cut.</li>
            <li>It is in the way at the edges of the blades such that you can&#x27;t get to the corners of your nails easily.</li>
            <li>The clippers are pretty decent without the catcher installed but aren&#x27;t life changing.</li>
            <li>Very high quality build</li>
            <li>These cut very well compared to drug store nail clippers.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Stocking stuffers for my whole family.</li>
            <li>Nails much healthier with this rather than nail file.</li>
            <li>Perhaps it&#x27;s from Japan, because it says so on the wrapper, but it&#x27;s not stamped on the clipper, and it lacks the thoughtful packaging and finish I&#x27;ve come to expect of Japanese products of all kinds.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a large opening for getting cuticles from weird angles, but the cut is great.</li>
            <li>The file is built into the lever and of much better quality than the separate file beneath the lever typical of over the clippers.</li>
            <li>I have pretty strong nails, and these things clip through with little to no effort.</li>
            <li>Even the price is not that high, considering you&#x27;ll have these things for years.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>Like most guys, I only buy nail clippers if (a) my current ones are completely rusted out; or (b) I&#x27;m traveling</li>
            <li>Sharp and precise.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>They are sharp, so the cuts are clean.</li>
            <li>Wow, sharpest nail clipper I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I have zero regrets purchasing these, and I honestly can&#x27;t think of a negative.</li>
            <li>Probably the best cutting small clippers I&#x27;ve used, would buy again.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money as this clipper will last you a long long time.</li>
            <li>As another reviewer stated, it probably won&#x27;t be a life-changing purchase, for better or worse, unless you accidentally swallow it.</li>
            <li>About as good as my much less expensive Revlon clipper when it was new.  </li>
            <li>typical of other fine Japanese made nail clippers.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Amazingly sharp and the texture provides extra grip.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> Also, the clipper part is lined up and sharp, so it works like it should.  </li>

            <li> They came in contact with a small amount of water on my bath vanity and rusted in spots.</li>
            <li> I can use these clippers on my toenails too, something my regular nail clippers failed at.</li>
            <li> Not sure I&#x27;d buy them again.</li>
            <li> It has heft for a small clipper.</li>
            <li> There are few things worse than needing to clip a nail or cuticle and not have a clipper nearby.</li>
            <li> Until then, buy yourself one of these bad boys.</li>
            <li> You have no idea how bad your &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; nail clipper is until you use this.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Wow, so impressed with this product. It looks beautiful, feels solid, and performs like a champ. Like most guys, I only buy nail clippers if (a) my current ones are completely rusted out; or (b) I&#x27;m traveling and I forgot to cut my nails before I left. In this case, it was option (a). Since I&#x27;m almost 40, I figured it was time to buy some grown-man type products that were built to last. These little clippers deliver that and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, they cost more than the drugstore version, but man, these things cut way better, and are built to last. I have pretty strong nails, and these things clip through with little to no effort. I have zero regrets purchasing these, and I honestly can&#x27;t think of a negative. Even the price is not that high, considering you&#x27;ll have these things for years. If they fail or problems come up, I&#x27;ll be sure to update this review. Until then, buy yourself one of these bad boys.</li>
            <li> I got this because I wanted to have one for the car - to use on kiddos and my fingers as I noticed problems. I like the built in file on the underside of the clipper arm. It doesn&#x27;t have a large opening for getting cuticles from weird angles, but the cut is great.</li>
            <li> good price fast dlivery</li>
            <li> I agree, throw away any other clippers, these are the best.  The handle stays where you put it without swiveling around.  Nothing slips when you&#x27;re using them.  That&#x27;s nice.  Also, the clipper part is lined up and sharp, so it works like it should.  There is not the nail file part that some other clippers have, but I never use that anyway.  It just gets in the way.  This one doesn&#x27;t have that.  The clippers come with a plastic sleeve.  I don&#x27;t know what that is for, but it is removable.  Finally, I&#x27;ve been looking for many years, this one is the one.</li>
            <li> Love this nail clipper!</li>
            <li> Good. Works as expected. Just a bit expensdive though</li>
            <li> Awesome. Sharp and precise. Very high quality build</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that my nail clippings aren&#x27;t supposed to fly all over the room when I cut them.  I bought these, and they no longer do!  Awesome.</li>
            <li> typical of other fine Japanese made nail clippers. Sharp and sturdy. Well worth the money as this clipper will last you a long long time.</li>
            <li> Great nail clippers, the best I have ever purchased.  They cut very easily.  No cons.  I highly recommend them.</li>

            <li> Excellent. Saw article in the Guardian suggesting that this was the best nail cutter you could purchase and it is.</li>
            <li> Excellent build quality, much better than those you often find at retail stores. Recommended.</li>
            <li> These are wonderful. Makes nail trimming effortless.</li>
            <li> You will never buy a pharmacy nail clipper again. ever. This thing should be $25.</li>
            <li> Clip. Clip. Great clipper.</li>
            <li> Never thought of researching nail clippers before, but I guess that&#x27;s what the internet is for. Also never thought I&#x27;d pay more than $10 for nail clippers. And so I have done a disservice to myself all these years, because these clippers are fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;They are comfortable to hold and sturdy. The cut is so clean I do not have to file away the ragged edges, and no nails go flying. I can use these clippers on my toenails too, something my regular nail clippers failed at. Men might require the larger 8cm though.&lt;br /&gt;Stocking stuffers for my whole family.</li>
            <li> Nails much healthier with this rather than nail file.</li>
            <li> Great compact little clipper with a plastic cover to hold clippings. Definitely worth the purchase.</li>

            <li> I bought these because I thought it was hilarious that there&#x27;s even such thing as 5-star fingernail clippers. Guess what, these are 5-star fingernail clippers. Never knew what I was missing.</li>
            <li> Very sharp. I should have bought one of these a long time ago. It&#x27;s a little bit small for big toes, though.</li>
            <li> What was described is true. Would order again.</li>
            <li> Wow, sharpest nail clipper I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> They clip my nails. Satisfying click. Nice nail collector. Took ~2 weeks to receive from Japan and there was candy inside.</li>
            <li> The best finger nail clippers I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I have Tweezerman clippers and these seem much better.  I would recommend to anyone looking for nice clippers that cut your nails instead of breaking them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a good clipper.  About as good as my much less expensive Revlon clipper when it was new.

            <li> Super sharp and effective.</li>
            <li> Probably the best cutting small clippers I&#x27;ve used, would buy again. Pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> Finally decided to splurge on &amp;#34;premium&amp;#34; nail clippers. Wow! Why did I wait so long. Made in Japan!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bend the nail nearly as much as cheap drug store clippers, and the plastic case does a great job of catching clippings. Wish they weren&#x27;t so ugly though.</li>
            <li> You will not be able to fnd any better nail clipper.</li>
            <li> The best nail clipper I&#x27;ve ever owned. If you&#x27;ve always felt that nail clippers were way too big, this is the clipper for you. Pick up a couple spares and keep them handy. There are few things worse than needing to clip a nail or cuticle and not have a clipper nearby.</li>
            <li> These clippers provide a pretty clean cut of the nail but I had an issue with the plastic nail clipping catcher. It is in the way at the edges of the blades such that you can&#x27;t get to the corners of your nails easily. I ended up removing the plastic catcher and throwing it away. The clippers are pretty decent without the catcher installed but aren&#x27;t life changing. Not sure I&#x27;d buy them again.</li>
            <li> You have no idea how bad your &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; nail clipper is until you use this.  You can&#x27;t afford a Rolls Royce but can afford the Rolls Royce of nail clippers.</li>
            <li> Great quality. Nice sharp cut.</li>
            <li> Great product. Just received it. It has heft for a small clipper. Amazingly, it works on my toes just as well on fingernails. I have pretty thick toenails so I thought I would have to buy the larger 8 inch one. Really a wonderful clipper.</li>
