            <li>This is really nice.</li>
            <li>Best prices and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Nice smelling, but too soon to see if it is helping.</li>
            <li>It really smells wonderful - for my nose anyway.</li>
            <li>Nice sized bottle for the price.</li>
            <li>Wife liked the pleasing aroma.</li>
            <li>I make all my own lotions, cleaners, hair dressings, etc...</li>
            <li>and this works great in all of them and the smell stays great for the whole time I am using my homemade stuff.  </li>
            <li>Also another amazing scent from this company that I personally love is dill.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered a lot of oils from this company and they all smell amazing and seem to be of high quality at a great price.</li>
            <li>Great price, fantastic customer service, arrives quickly.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of rosemary thank you.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>It helps breath better and sleep well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with the purchase</li>
            <li>edens garden makes some of the best essential oils ...</li>
            <li>i love them all.</li>
            <li>I love this scent.</li>
            <li>I get a happy high from it. :)</li>
            <li>Smooth easy transaction!</li>
            <li>Just received this oil and am so excited to put it to use!</li>
            <li>Very good essential oil!  </li>
            <li>Probably the two most important things about EOs are to store them away from light and away from heat</li>
            <li>I have no other products to compare, but this product seems to be of a great quality.</li>
            <li>We have also used virtually every MLM essential oil brand known to man, and this is right up there with the best of them in quality and purity, at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>Great when mixed with clary sage too!</li>
            <li>I say this because for most essential oil users, quality and purity is a concern, and many are under the impression that you can only get the best by joining an MLM.</li>
            <li>Works quickly leaves my hair feeling strong and nourished.</li>
            <li>Their customer service is quick and fabulous.</li>
            <li>I use this oil in my cool mist humidifier.  </li>
            <li>I love it so much I could wear it as a perfume</li>
            <li>Smell great little strong</li>
            <li>Pretty good buy, but this particular rosemary scent in a bottle, although somewhat nice, is not the truly beautiful scent of rosemary on the plant unfortunately.</li>
            <li>This one smells exactly like rosemary and is quite strong.</li>
            <li>That is why many former MLM essential oil distributors who still want to use a great product yet can’t afford the network marketing prices and aren’t making any money with them have tried and like Eden’s Garden.</li>
            <li>I bought it to replace a different brand because I absolutely love Eden&#x27;s Garden&#x27;s products!</li>
            <li>The Rosemary is my favorite oil so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Using right now in my diffuser with distilled water and</li>
            <li>I combine 8 to 10 drops of each of Rosemary, Peppermint and Eucalyptus and fill the dish with water during winter and turn it on full light an hour before bed and then dim through the night.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>The smell is wonderful, a few drops goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Will certainly be ordering from here again.</li>
            <li>Another brand that I use lasts the whole day that the machine runs.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Could not believe how fast this was sent.</li>
            <li>I used to pay lots more $$ for other brands and frankly I like this one</li>
            <li>so I do have to be very careful when mixing my tonic&#x27;s and oils and more</li>
            <li>New ideas to explore!</li>
            <li>Many of the praises for Eden’s Garden come from current and / or former DT, Melaleuca, and YL customers.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s unacceptable to grow older and live with unattractive skin when you don&#x27;t have to.</li>
            <li>As always this is my new place to shop for oils.</li>
            <li>All products are packaged very well, and you can&#x27;t beat the price for such high quality oils.</li>
            <li>Extremely professional packaging and marketing materials included.</li>
            <li>purchase  with edens garden and haven&#x27;t had a concern thus far</li>
            <li>I use it in all my hair care products, and it makes my hair so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even get near it.</li>
            <li>I do wish that they were included with Amazon Prime for the free shipping, but they do ship fast, and it isn&#x27;t too expensive.</li>
            <li>This one works but a bit pungent compared to other brands,yet still lively and blended with Pepermint</li>

            <li> This one works but a bit pungent compared to other brands,yet still lively and blended with Pepermint</li>
            <li> I just started learning about Essential oils, and their benefits a few months ago, so I was very new to what brands to get.</li>
            <li> , that is just the nature of the natural oils breaking down.</li>
            <li> From my experience, and countless other essential oil enthusiasts who have also used doTerra, YL, and Melaleuca, there is no difference in quality, purity or smell with Eden’s Garden.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never run out as long as the product is sold in the USA.</li>
            <li> but I would also use that one as perfume strange as it sounds.</li>
            <li> , otherwise they can loose potency and get a funky smell</li>
            <li> These oils by Eden&#x27;s Garden are not the least bit inferior to doTerra, Melaleuca, or Young Living.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> your products do seem to come out faster than other&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I expected something less for the price.</li>
            <li> I love all the other Essential Oils that I have purchased from Eden&#x27;s Garden, but this one is TERRIBLE.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy from this brand based on previous reviews and price.</li>
            <li> it is less $$.  </li>
            <li> Add a few drops to shampoo and to your hair brush.  </li>
            <li> I mix it with Cedarwood, Thyme, peppermint, and clary sage, and mix those into Jojoba oil and a few drops of Evening Primrose oil.</li>
            <li> They stand behind their products and shipping issues.</li>
            <li> Unhappy with it.  </li>
            <li> Maybe the people complaining got a bad batch?</li>
            <li> :(</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I read the reviews and rolled the dice.  I use this oil in my cool mist humidifier.  After 15 minutes or so, the scent is gone.  Another brand that I use lasts the whole day that the machine runs.:(</li>
            <li> Wonderful.  Great price, fantastic customer service, arrives quickly.  Add a few drops to shampoo and to your hair brush.  Works quickly leaves my hair feeling strong and nourished.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Very good essential oil!  I have been using the oil on my lip areas and the blisters have been healing in about two days. I have been using in the morning and evening before going to bed .</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product! Use it for making my own Chapstick. Highly recommended! Will certainly be ordering from here again. Extremely professional packaging and marketing materials included. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Very clean, strong scent, have ordered from this company befoe, tend to have very good quality products.</li>
            <li> I use this for my hubby  I diffuse it at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li> I purchased several jars of body Souffl&amp;eacute; and added the Rosemary to improve the dryness of my skin and wrinkles. It&#x27;s unacceptable to grow older and live with unattractive skin when you don&#x27;t have to. I order Eden&#x27;s Garden oils by the boxes. I&#x27;ll never run out as long as the product is sold in the USA.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of rosemary thank you. I will be ordering more. your products do seem to come out faster than other&#x27;s I have used so I do have to be very careful when mixing my tonic&#x27;s and oils and more</li>
            <li> This is really nice. I&#x27;m Using right now in my diffuser with distilled water and the aroma coming from the vapors are all over the house.</li>
            <li> I combine 8 to 10 drops of each of Rosemary, Peppermint and Eucalyptus and fill the dish with water during winter and turn it on full light an hour before bed and then dim through the night. It helps breath better and sleep well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope that helps</li>
            <li> great product for the price , aroma is good  did the therapuetic grade test  and passed with me will order again .Often purchase  with edens garden and haven&#x27;t had a concern thus far</li>
            <li> This one works but a bit pungent compared to other brands,yet still lively and blended with Pepermint it does the trick</li>
            <li> Used for skin &amp; hair care, this is great in homemade body powder as well as witch hazel based skin toner. Great when mixed with clary sage too!</li>
            <li> learning how to use it</li>
            <li> This item works as it is said to.  Also have had very good luck with items ordered from Edens garden.  They stand behind their products and shipping issues.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very good product</li>
            <li> Pretty good buy, but this particular rosemary scent in a bottle, although somewhat nice, is not the truly beautiful scent of rosemary on the plant unfortunately.</li>
            <li> This is a good quality product. I am very pleased with their consistency. I expected something less for the price. This is very nice. Thanks!</li>
            <li> great for pesky pests</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with the purchase</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and as always shipping is very fast.</li>
            <li> Love it, great price.</li>
            <li> These oils by Eden&#x27;s Garden are not the least bit inferior to doTerra, Melaleuca, or Young Living. I say this because for most essential oil users, quality and purity is a concern, and many are under the impression that you can only get the best by joining an MLM. Many of the praises for Eden’s Garden come from current and / or former DT, Melaleuca, and YL customers. We have also used virtually every MLM essential oil brand known to man, and this is right up there with the best of them in quality and purity, at a fraction of the price. The reason it is a fraction of the price is because it does not have about 3 to 5 levels of compensations for its representatives built into the margins, which drastically reduces the overhead. That is why many former MLM essential oil distributors who still want to use a great product yet can’t afford the network marketing prices and aren’t making any money with them have tried and like Eden’s Garden. From my experience, and countless other essential oil enthusiasts who have also used doTerra, YL, and Melaleuca, there is no difference in quality, purity or smell with Eden’s Garden. If you are one of the 1 - 5% making great money with an MLM, more power to you! But for everyone else, this oil matches up well with the best of them.</li>
            <li> Wonderful, just as described. Best prices and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This is used for sensory stimulation at the senior resident facility I volunteer for.  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> Just received this oil and am so excited to put it to use! I bought it to replace a different brand because I absolutely love Eden&#x27;s Garden&#x27;s products! Their customer service is quick and fabulous. I just love this company and can&#x27;t wait to keep adding to my collection!</li>
            <li> I use this on my hair, and grandson&#x27;s eczema. Nice smelling, but too soon to see if it is helping. Good company! I am a repeat customer. Loved the booklet they sent too. New ideas to explore!</li>
            <li> I just started learning about Essential oils, and their benefits a few months ago, so I was very new to what brands to get. I started out ordering from different companies, and in the end I realized that I&#x27;ve only been buying Eden&#x27;s Garden. All products are packaged very well, and you can&#x27;t beat the price for such high quality oils. I do wish that they were included with Amazon Prime for the free shipping, but they do ship fast, and it isn&#x27;t too expensive. The Rosemary is my favorite oil so far. I use it in all my hair care products, and it makes my hair so soft and shiny. I have dealt with Telogen Effluvium for 7 years now, so I have been buying oils that stimulate hair growth. You can feel the Rosemary working. I mix it with Cedarwood, Thyme, peppermint, and clary sage, and mix those into Jojoba oil and a few drops of Evening Primrose oil. My scalp is definitely in great condition now!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell good at all. Smells like a chemical. Will not buy it again. Unhappy with it.  Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> edens garden makes some of the best essential oils ...i love them all.</li>
            <li> I love this scent. Maybe the people complaining got a bad batch? I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;ve ordered a lot of oils from this company and they all smell amazing and seem to be of high quality at a great price. This one smells exactly like rosemary and is quite strong. I love it so much I could wear it as a perfume but I use it on my hairbrush before I brush my hair. Rosemary is suppose to strengthen your hair and roots. So my hair smells great and is getting healthy benefits as well. Also another amazing scent from this company that I personally love is dill. I don&#x27;t know what you use it for but I would also use that one as perfume strange as it sounds. It really smells wonderful - for my nose anyway. I get a happy high from it. :)</li>
            <li> I recently started to read and use essentials oils. I decided to buy from this brand based on previous reviews and price. I have no other products to compare, but this product seems to be of a great quality. The smell is wonderful, a few drops goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Edens Garden always very good.</li>
            <li> Smell great little strong</li>
            <li> Love this!  I use it a lot around our house...for achy joints, in bath water, etc.  Nice sized bottle for the price.</li>
            <li> I use this oil in ultrasonic diffuser for aromatherapy. I have also blended this oil with massage oil. Wife liked the pleasing aroma.</li>
            <li> Smooth easy transaction! Superb oil!  Repeat buyer.</li>
            <li> Could not believe how fast this was sent. The packaging was with care. perfect smell to wake up the senses. As always this is my new place to shop for oils.</li>
            <li> Never again will I buy Eden&#x27;s Garden Rosemary Oil. Boy this stuff is funky! I can&#x27;t even get near it. I love all the other Essential Oils that I have purchased from Eden&#x27;s Garden, but this one is TERRIBLE. I will be using Plantlife Rosemary Oil for life from this point forward!</li>
            <li> This product is helping my hair grow</li>
            <li> I have been using this brand for a couple of years now and it is great.  I used to pay lots more $$ for other brands and frankly I like this one the best and bonus it is less $$.  I make all my own lotions, cleaners, hair dressings, etc... and this works great in all of them and the smell stays great for the whole time I am using my homemade stuff.  Probably the two most important things about EOs are to store them away from light and away from heat, otherwise they can loose potency and get a funky smell, that is just the nature of the natural oils breaking down.</li>
