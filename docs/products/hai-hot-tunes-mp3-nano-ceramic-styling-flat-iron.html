            <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>This is an amazing straightener.</li>
            <li>This one worked amazingly and I haven&#x27;t bothered with the portion</li>
            <li>I liked that it had an adjustable heat dial.</li>
            <li>so you can set it to what ever temp you want which is nice too.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with the results, and the ceramic irons are high quality and don&#x27;t make those burning, crunching sounds that cheaper irons make when tearing through your hair.</li>
            <li>I love the HAI brand and this one came at an outstanding price!</li>
            <li>For something this cheap I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be that good.</li>
            <li>This is a superior quality item at a super discount price.  </li>
            <li>and it does play music which Is actually the best part</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had mine for 4 years or more and purchased this one for my mom.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s way better than my chi.</li>
            <li>I still love or though :)</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t be happier :)</li>
            <li>The temperature control is an excellent option and the HAI flat iron just glides over my hair.</li>
            <li>This iron is pretty good.</li>
            <li>It gives good results and I&#x27;m VERY picky when it comes to my hair.</li>
            <li>Easy to sync.</li>
            <li>I shouldn&#x27;t have been, this is a wonderful iron that glides right thru very thick hair and does a very nice job at straightening it.  </li>
            <li>: I have curly, unruly hair that is also quite fine and prone to humidity.</li>
            <li>If this is your very first iron, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>I can get my hair pretty straight with the setting at 325, and it stays straight which is awesome because otherwise its a poofy mess.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The MP3 player on this flat iron is great and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I enjoy it aLot over using my phone</li>
            <li>Cheap</li>
            <li>Honestly, though, for the price I can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li>This one was a fraction of that price and works fantasticly.</li>
            <li>The straightener is pretty but the controls feel very cheap.</li>
            <li>But I tried it and lost my patience and honestly, I&#x27;m more interested in having rad hair than to listen to music I can already listen to from my phone or computer.&lt;br /&gt;Great, great flat iron brand.</li>
            <li>It straightened my curly hair pretty well :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this brand for MANY years and it&#x27;s never failed me.</li>
            <li>well worth the money - $188 on sale for $31 WHAT A DEAL!).</li>
            <li>However, I am so far very pleased with the rest of the straightener.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this because of the price and for the brand.</li>
            <li>but I lost it, and I needed something really quick and cheap to use until I could get another one.</li>
            <li>AMAZING, I WAS VERY SURPRISED</li>
            <li>This flat iron is pretty much one of the best ones I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>THAT, DUH, IT PLAYED MUSIC LOL, BUT I LOVE HOW SMOOTH AND SHINY</li>
            <li>Really, it&#x27;s a good deal because everything else is going to be at least $50 more!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s good for a flat iron.</li>
            <li>This flat iron is good.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly, it leaves my hair looking shiny, and I like that it has an on/of switch rather than a button.</li>
            <li>Good price, but don&#x27;t think it gets as hot as the standard HAI irons.</li>
            <li>I used to own the HSI iron (hands down my favorite iron ever)</li>
            <li>this flat iron pretty darn good for $30</li>
            <li>Hope you find this review useful.</li>
            <li>Has my own personal tunes playing while I get dolled up</li>
            <li>Well worth $30.</li>
            <li>It is worth the $24.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t worth the retail price.</li>
            <li>Even if I never get the MP3 player to work, this item is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Maybe connecting it to a desktop computer would be more effective, I&#x27;m not sure, but hooking it up to my Macbook 13&#x27;&#x27; wasn&#x27;t working.</li>
            <li>Two things: I have to set the temperature up pretty high to get results, and I do have to perform more passes than I am used to doing over my hair to get it bone straight.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a super affordable version of an excellent flat iron product so you can pay three times as much for the other one or just get this one and try uploading music if you want to, but don&#x27;t try to get it to work.</li>
            <li>my hair comes out super straight and shiny</li>
            <li>I love the white and blue color and the plates get hot very quickly and leave hair feeling silky smooth.</li>
            <li>It straightens on first swipe and it lasts.</li>
            <li>First let me start by saying that I haven&#x27;t even tried the MP3 player.</li>
            <li>It helps listening to music or a book while flat ironing my hair because it can take more than an hour to do.</li>
            <li>, my hair still feels healthy the next day which is very important to me, some flat iron will leave my hair dry and frizzy the day after, the mp3 works fine, i didn&#x27;t buy it for the mp3 player though i wanted to try a hai flatiron and at this price i was able to open my wallet and give it a try.</li>
            <li>Not only is it super cool that it plays music</li>
            <li>It heats up really fast, gets really hot, and the plates are extremely high quality...especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t care about the mp3 player, and I don&#x27;t plan to download music into it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t complain all too much.</li>
            <li>Straightens curly hair very well.  </li>
            <li>I am really impress with this product.</li>
            <li>AND LEFT IT SHINY AND SMOOTH.</li>
            <li>ITS A REASONABLE PRICE FOR A VERY QUALITY PRODUCT....</li>
            <li>Nice and affordable flat iron and works good for coarse and thick hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a must have, especially for teenagers looking for something unique and to keep them entertained.</li>
            <li>(it was a high fall)-</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to use high heat setting to achieve straight and soft hair.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money and spend a touch more on one that will deliver results.</li>
            <li>I have highly textured chemical free shoulder length hair and must be very careful of snags and heat damage.</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars because I&#x27;m so used to my old iron, which was a little better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I would repurchase but could live without the MP3 portion.</li>
            <li>This flat iron straightens each section of my hair in only a few swipes, and combined with a good straightening product, my hair stays relatively straight all day.</li>
            <li>so most straightners tend to work on my hair but never gentle enough to get to my baby hairs.</li>
            <li>The problem is that the highest heat isn&#x27;t actually hot enough to straighten her hair.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t snag my hair at all, heats up super fast and leaves my hair so silly smooth.</li>
            <li>I HAVEN&#x27;T RELAXED IN A LONG TIME, AND IT GOT IT VERY STRAIGHT,</li>
            <li>Search for other Hai irons and you&#x27;ll quickly see that you are a getting a steal with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far, the iron has met my expectations.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m too old to figure out how to work the MP3 player and too young not to ask my nieces to hook it up for me when they come over.  </li>
            <li>I USED IT ON MY NATURAL HAIR</li>
            <li>In my case, my HAI classic convertible iron gave up on me after 3 years of usage, and have no complaints about that flat iron.</li>
            <li>This one, it heats up very quickly, you can \\&quot;tune\\&quot; the temperature you want, you don&#x27;t have to constantly \\&quot;run\\&quot; the iron on the same strand of hair, so is less damaging to your hair.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend the flat iron!  </li>
            <li>It was really similar, though I was used to the classic, slightly larger model.</li>
            <li>I figured if my two year old decides to break this, it was only $20.</li>
            <li>It does not get as hot as my other flat iron, but it does get the job done!!</li>

            <li> I HAVEN&#x27;T RELAXED IN A LONG TIME, AND IT GOT IT VERY STRAIGHT,</li>
            <li> Search for other Hai irons and you&#x27;ll quickly see that you are a getting a steal with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far, the iron has met my expectations.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m too old to figure out how to work the MP3 player and too young not to ask my nieces to hook it up for me when they come over.  </li>
            <li> I USED IT ON MY NATURAL HAIR</li>
            <li> In my case, my HAI classic convertible iron gave up on me after 3 years of usage, and have no complaints about that flat iron.</li>
            <li> This one, it heats up very quickly, you can \\&quot;tune\\&quot; the temperature you want, you don&#x27;t have to constantly \\&quot;run\\&quot; the iron on the same strand of hair, so is less damaging to your hair.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend the flat iron!  </li>
            <li> It was really similar, though I was used to the classic, slightly larger model.</li>
            <li> I figured if my two year old decides to break this, it was only $20.</li>
            <li> It does not get as hot as my other flat iron, but it does get the job done!!</li>
            <li> I use this flat iron daily and sometimes twice daily!  </li>
            <li> It loses one star for not being dual voltage and for two other small issues (with the kind of prices that Hai charges, their irons darn well should be).</li>
            <li> Bought the HAI flat iron because my stylist uses one on my hair</li>
            <li> The flat iron portion of the Iron is so so.</li>
            <li> Listen, don&#x27;t even fuss with the mp3 aspect of this flat iron.</li>
            <li> The flat iron was a gift for my mother who has this hair.</li>
            <li> This definitely does the job, and I will certainly keep this as my secondary flat iron once I buy another HSI.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality flat iron for a ridiculously low price--because combining an MP3 player with a flat iron is a ridiculous idea and they must have a ton of these to get rid of.</li>
            <li> Plus the point of getting this was to straighten my hair, and at least it does that really well.</li>
            <li> I thought the concept looked &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; for my teenage daughter, but was a little nervous about the flat iron itself...</li>
            <li> I have very very thick hair and its very curly-</li>
            <li> Only negative thing I can say is a very faint sorta scratchy sound always comes out of the speaker when the flat iron is on.</li>
            <li> I purchased this in December and got my first delivery stolen by someone in y neighborhood (it was dropped off at my doorstep) needless to say I had purchase another one which sucked</li>
            <li> I my thinking of buying some other straightener now.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t tried tunes because I&#x27;m not interested in the music</li>
            <li> I bought this because every other Hai straightener was over $100.</li>
            <li> I went to wal-mart and bought your average iron</li>
            <li> Drag and dropped a few mp3s onto this iron.  </li>
            <li> The HerStyler was like my little engine that could</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s time to rate it or wait a little longer.</li>
            <li> I just got in the mail yesterday and immediately used it to straigthen my fairly thin, long hair.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately this time it didn&#x27;t turn out to be the same product that I used two years ago</li>
            <li> They are really expensive on other sites.</li>
            <li> I was sadly disappointed to find that when I plugged the USB connector into my computer, an error message came up saying the device I was trying to connect was too big and immediately disconnected the straightner.</li>
            <li> Only lost one star because of the worthless mp3 function.</li>
            <li> So the music function may be broken</li>
            <li> The idea of buying a hair straightener to play mp3s is silly.</li>
            <li> Very frustrating.</li>
            <li> I never review items but felt the need to with this one after my disappointment with it.</li>
            <li> Looks like I won&#x27;t be transferring any music onto here :(</li>
            <li> If you are buying it solely for the music than you may be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Crazy bargain to get this iron at this price!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this iron for 2 reasons&#x3D; It&#x27;s a HAI and it was $29.99 on Amazon. I really don&#x27;t care about the mp3 player, and I don&#x27;t plan to download music into it. So this review goes entirely on PERFORMANCE. I got it 6 days ago (and used it every day) so I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s time to rate it or wait a little longer. So far, the iron has met my expectations. If this is your very first iron, you&#x27;ll love it. In my case, my HAI classic convertible iron gave up on me after 3 years of usage, and have no complaints about that flat iron. This one, it heats up very quickly, you can \\&quot;tune\\&quot; the temperature you want, you don&#x27;t have to constantly \\&quot;run\\&quot; the iron on the same strand of hair, so is less damaging to your hair. It gives good results and I&#x27;m VERY picky when it comes to my hair. I gave it 4 stars because I&#x27;m so used to my old iron, which was a little better. Hope you find this review useful.</li>
            <li> Nice and affordable flat iron and works good for coarse and thick hair.</li>
            <li> Good price, but don&#x27;t think it gets as hot as the standard HAI irons.</li>
            <li> I use this flat iron daily and sometimes twice daily!  It has been excellent!  I love the HAI brand and this one came at an outstanding price!</li>
            <li> I purchased this in December and got my first delivery stolen by someone in y neighborhood (it was dropped off at my doorstep) needless to say I had purchase another one which sucked but it&#x27;s good for a flat iron. It does it&#x27;s job goes to about 425 degrees and it does play music which Is actually the best part I enjoy it aLot over using my phone lol anyways I give it 4 stars because they didn&#x27;t send me another one and I had to purchase it again. Also the music stopped playing. It straightened my curly hair pretty well :)</li>
            <li> Great looking iron that does a great job at an amazing price.  I would definitely recommend it, and the music is a bonus!</li>
            <li> Works well. I have not tried the MP3 player yet</li>
            <li> The MP3 player on this flat iron is great and easy to use. It helps listening to music or a book while flat ironing my hair because it can take more than an hour to do. I have highly textured chemical free shoulder length hair and must be very careful of snags and heat damage. The temperature control is an excellent option and the HAI flat iron just glides over my hair. I don&#x27;t have to use high heat setting to achieve straight and soft hair. It&#x27;s a must have, especially for teenagers looking for something unique and to keep them entertained. I love it and recommend it to everyone!!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing straightener. Not only is it super cool that it plays music but it&#x27;s a great product also. It straightens on first swipe and it lasts. I&#x27;ve had mine for 4 years or more and purchased this one for my mom. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this 3 stars instead of 5 because of the music option, or therefore lack of a music option. I followed the instructions perfectly and it just wont play music.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price I paid for this straightener I can&#x27;t complain all too much. Plus the point of getting this was to straighten my hair, and at least it does that really well.</li>
            <li> The mp3 player stopped working by the second use of curling my hair but who cares.  I bought this because its a HAI and at this price I was flooored.  I would highly recommend the flat iron!  Only lost one star because of the worthless mp3 function.</li>
            <li> Cheap and you get what you pay for with this one. Does not compare to my brand name iron.</li>
            <li> I love this iron! I had one for about 3 years and dropped it and it broke (it was a high fall)- I went to wal-mart and bought your average iron and I couldn&#x27;t handle it. I had to buy another one- I have very very thick hair and its very curly- this iron straightens my hair perfectly. This price is mind blowing too! You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> Two years ago, I bought this straightener from tjmax for 19.99.it was wonderful.I gave it to my friend because she Iiked it too.Now I found it on Amazon and I placed my order but unfortunately this time it didn&#x27;t turn out to be the same product that I used two years ago, it doesn&#x27;t work well at all.I my thinking of buying some other straightener now.</li>
            <li> Will order again..price great..product awesome</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is pretty much one of the best ones I&#x27;ve ever used and it&#x27;s a plus that it plays music</li>
            <li> Love it!  Straightens curly hair very well.  I don&#x27;t even use the music portion of the straightener.</li>
            <li> This iron is pretty good. It loses one star for not being dual voltage and for two other small issues (with the kind of prices that Hai charges, their irons darn well should be). Two things: I have to set the temperature up pretty high to get results, and I do have to perform more passes than I am used to doing over my hair to get it bone straight. Honestly, though, for the price I can&#x27;t complain too much. I used to own the HSI iron (hands down my favorite iron ever) but I lost it, and I needed something really quick and cheap to use until I could get another one. This definitely does the job, and I will certainly keep this as my secondary flat iron once I buy another HSI.</li>
            <li> I am really impress with this product. For something this cheap I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be that good.</li>
            <li> Great product,  works wonders on my hair. Has my own personal tunes playing while I get dolled up</li>
            <li> Did not do a good job of straightening hair. Didn&#x27;t even try the MP3 player. Returned it.</li>
            <li> Music doesn&#x27;t work, but it straightens perfect :)</li>
            <li> Bought the HAI flat iron because my stylist uses one on my hair and I love it. They are really expensive on other sites. When I found this one with the MP3 player for $23 I immediately bought it. It works great! It&#x27;s way better than my chi. Doesn&#x27;t snag my hair at all, heats up super fast and leaves my hair so silly smooth. Haven&#x27;t uploaded songs cause I just bought it to do my hair. Only negative thing I can say is a very faint sorta scratchy sound always comes out of the speaker when the flat iron is on. I still love or though :)</li>
            <li> This flat iron is good. The music is an extra bonus. It does not get as hot as my other flat iron, but it does get the job done!! Well worth $30.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my daughter and I and they are wonderful!  I have had other brands and they did not work near as well!</li>
            <li> It is worth the $24. Plays your music. Easy to sync. The flat iron portion of the Iron is so so. But what can you expect for $24. It isn&#x27;t worth the retail price. I have recommended for the music factor.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even care about the music part.....I&#x27;ve had this brand for MANY years and it&#x27;s never failed me. I tried switching to Hai once and went back. Crazy bargain to get this iron at this price!!!</li>
            <li> this flat iron pretty darn good for $30 my hair comes out super straight and shiny, my hair still feels healthy the next day which is very important to me, some flat iron will leave my hair dry and frizzy the day after, the mp3 works fine, i didn&#x27;t buy it for the mp3 player though i wanted to try a hai flatiron and at this price i was able to open my wallet and give it a try.</li>
            <li> I love this straigthner from Hai!! I just got in the mail yesterday and immediately used it to straigthen my fairly thin, long hair. I LOVE IT! I love the white and blue color and the plates get hot very quickly and leave hair feeling silky smooth. I haven&#x27;t had a chance to download songs and import them to this product, but I can&#x27;t wait to do so later! Even without the music feature, this is an excellent styling iron that works perfectly for me (and well worth the money - $188 on sale for $31 WHAT A DEAL!). Couldn&#x27;t be happier :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated 7/27: I went to transfer music from my laptop to the straightner last night. I was sadly disappointed to find that when I plugged the USB connector into my computer, an error message came up saying the device I was trying to connect was too big and immediately disconnected the straightner. Looks like I won&#x27;t be transferring any music onto here :( It&#x27;s not a big enough of a problem for me that would cause me to return the product, but if you&#x27;re buying this straightner for the music feature, I don&#x27;t think you should opt for this one. Maybe connecting it to a desktop computer would be more effective, I&#x27;m not sure, but hooking it up to my Macbook 13&#x27;&#x27; wasn&#x27;t working.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality flat iron for a ridiculously low price--because combining an MP3 player with a flat iron is a ridiculous idea and they must have a ton of these to get rid of. Search for other Hai irons and you&#x27;ll quickly see that you are a getting a steal with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I don&#x27;t use the MP3 player because 1) I can&#x27;t get it to work, and 2) I can&#x27;t be bothered to try to get it to work. So the music function may be broken but I simply don&#x27;t care because that&#x27;s not what I bought this for. If you are buying it solely for the music than you may be disappointed. Just be forewarned. I&#x27;m still giving it 5 stars because it excels at its prime purpose--straightening hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bit about my hair: I have curly, unruly hair that is also quite fine and prone to humidity. This flat iron straightens each section of my hair in only a few swipes, and combined with a good straightening product, my hair stays relatively straight all day. I am very happy with the results, and the ceramic irons are high quality and don&#x27;t make those burning, crunching sounds that cheaper irons make when tearing through your hair.</li>
            <li> This is one of those items you don&#x27;t think about, but buy.  This is a superior quality item at a super discount price.  I&#x27;m too old to figure out how to work the MP3 player and too young not to ask my nieces to hook it up for me when they come over.  Even if I never get the MP3 player to work, this item is well worth the money. On/Off switch and dial a setting. Flash on temperature alert.</li>
            <li> Listen, don&#x27;t even fuss with the mp3 aspect of this flat iron. It&#x27;s a super affordable version of an excellent flat iron product so you can pay three times as much for the other one or just get this one and try uploading music if you want to, but don&#x27;t try to get it to work. Maybe it works? But I tried it and lost my patience and honestly, I&#x27;m more interested in having rad hair than to listen to music I can already listen to from my phone or computer.&lt;br /&gt;Great, great flat iron brand.</li>
            <li> I never review items but felt the need to with this one after my disappointment with it. The flat iron was a gift for my mother who has this hair. I liked that it had an adjustable heat dial. The problem is that the highest heat isn&#x27;t actually hot enough to straighten her hair. He hair isn&#x27;t curly, just a touch of wave. I use a CHI and have used this on her hair before with ease but the HAI doesn&#x27;t even make a dent in her hair. Very frustrating. Don&#x27;t waste your money and spend a touch more on one that will deliver results.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe this curling iron was only $20. It works amazing!!!</li>
            <li> Works Great!!! haven&#x27;t tried tunes because I&#x27;m not interested in the music just iron, this is a very popular name brand and you can&#x27;t beat this price.</li>
            <li> First let me start by saying that I haven&#x27;t even tried the MP3 player. I don&#x27;t need it and I didn&#x27;t purchase this because of it. I bought this because every other Hai straightener was over $100. This one was a fraction of that price and works fantasticly. I&#x27;m very happy with it. It heats up quickly, it leaves my hair looking shiny, and I like that it has an on/of switch rather than a button. There&#x27;s a dial so you can set it to what ever temp you want which is nice too. I definitely recommend this straightener.</li>
            <li> The idea of buying a hair straightener to play mp3s is silly. That&#x27;s why this is priced so low. But when my Hai I&#x27;d had for years cracked after about a thousand falls off the bathroom sink, I thought I&#x27;d take the $30 gamble on this to see if the plates on this were any where close to what I was used to. It was really similar, though I was used to the classic, slightly larger model. It heats up really fast, gets really hot, and the plates are extremely high quality...especially for the price. Really, it&#x27;s a good deal because everything else is going to be at least $50 more! Buy it to straighten your hair, and play mp3s on your phone or an ipod like everyone else.</li>
            <li> AMAZING, I WAS VERY SURPRISED, I DID PURCHASE IT FOR THE FACT THAT, DUH, IT PLAYED MUSIC LOL, BUT I LOVE HOW SMOOTH AND SHINY IT LEFT MY HAIR. I USED IT ON MY NATURAL HAIR THAT I HAVEN&#x27;T RELAXED IN A LONG TIME, AND IT GOT IT VERY STRAIGHT, THE WEAVE I HAVE IN, IT TOOK ALL THE BULK OUT AND LEFT IT SHINY AND SMOOTH. I CANT WAIT TO USE IT ON MY DAUGHTERS HAIR FOR SCHOOL, I DEF RECOMMEND IT, ITS A REASONABLE PRICE FOR A VERY QUALITY PRODUCT....</li>
            <li> The straightener is pretty but the controls feel very cheap. Also, the straightener emits a light humming noise (similar to the buzzing of a light bulb) which is annoying. However, I am so far very pleased with the rest of the straightener. I had a HerStyler Titanium for close to 4 years before I realized it just was not making my hair look good anymore. The HerStyler was like my little engine that could but it finally needed replacing so I chose this Hai because I recognize the name is very good. I can get my hair pretty straight with the setting at 325, and it stays straight which is awesome because otherwise its a poofy mess.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would repurchase but could live without the MP3 portion.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this because of the price and for the brand. I figured if my two year old decides to break this, it was only $20. I have tick hair (never chemichally treated) so most straightners tend to work on my hair but never gentle enough to get to my baby hairs. This one worked amazingly and I haven&#x27;t bothered with the portion but if I get it to work kuddos to HAI.</li>
            <li> Drag and dropped a few mp3s onto this iron.  Will not play.  Tried turning on/off and different song but no luck.  Guess the music player was DOA</li>
            <li> I thought the concept looked &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; for my teenage daughter, but was a little nervous about the flat iron itself...I shouldn&#x27;t have been, this is a wonderful iron that glides right thru very thick hair and does a very nice job at straightening it.  She Loves it!</li>
