            <li>I started using this product about a month ago and absolutely love it!!  </li>
            <li>but it feels so much more oily and sticky than before!!</li>
            <li>You will be so glad you did!!</li>
            <li>I love this product!!</li>
            <li>rep was very nice and explained that they often receive returns with no RMA Form.  </li>
            <li>The products have been very effective in the cystic acne he had been experiencing.  </li>
            <li>Great service, great price, and most importantly, great product!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>Just 6mths in and this stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>The exposed skin care products are amazing!</li>
            <li>It is amazing!</li>
            <li>product is amazing!</li>
            <li>Amazing product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve taken a picture of my face (almost) every day since before I started using it, and the change is remarkable.</li>
            <li>However, exposed does the trick and leaves skin hydrated/even&#x3D; perfect foundation for make-up application or simply a healthy all-natural look.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m confident another month using it, my skin will be nearly perfect.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products but Exposed Skin, without a doubt, works the best.</li>
            <li>I honestly have no complaints!</li>
            <li>I just backed off to washing my face once a day until I was a bit more acclimated to the system, and now I&#x27;m up to washing twice a day and everything is great!!</li>
            <li>and I will have a perfect complexion again! :)</li>
            <li>I already kind of have a baby face and the acne was not helping me look my age at all!</li>
            <li>So glad i gave it a try, works great!</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for 8 years and love it.. works great!!!</li>
            <li>This is easily the best product I have ever used on my skin.</li>
            <li>They were so good that I decided to try it.  </li>
            <li>It was a good choice for me.</li>
            <li>Everyone has noticed and told me how good it looks</li>
            <li>This stuff is so darn good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had good experience with the Exposed Skincare line.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not oily or anything, but it looks good.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s good with his routine now and the results are so good.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels good.</li>
            <li>But nothing works as good as Exposed skin care.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin smooth and flawless with a glow.</li>
            <li>The company also gives good advice on cleaning up your diet by reducing sugar intake.</li>
            <li>your face is so smooth and glowing!&amp;#34; and that was like the best thing I&#x27;ve ever heard.</li>
            <li>Over all its a good product.</li>
            <li>and I am delighted with the results.</li>
            <li>I decided to try it and loved it.  </li>
            <li>Bought as a gift for a friend and she loved it.</li>
            <li>This is a good product.</li>
            <li>To my excitement one of the best options available Online</li>
            <li>I did an internet search for the best acne treatments available without a prescription and came across Exposed Skin Care and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s the product that makes my skin look so good.  </li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Good products.  </li>
            <li>My son gets on with these and has had good results.  </li>
            <li>Hearing good reviews I decided to try a kit and figured, why not.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this system for about three months now and my skin has never looked so flawless, hydrated, and blemish free.</li>
            <li>I had good succes with this.  </li>
            <li>wash is good, cloth</li>
            <li>Everything is just good.</li>
            <li>And one day while I was browsing on Internet about some good product for skin , i found Exposed Skin Care , I bought the skit since 4-5month now</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good stuff.</li>
            <li>This is a good product</li>
            <li>and you will for sure see good results!</li>
            <li>so so many good, even great, reviews about this product</li>
            <li>I stopped using it and switched to clinique mild soap with gel moisturizer and now it is almost perfect.</li>
            <li>I have now been a customer of Exposed Skin care products and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced any over drying like with most products.  </li>

            <li>I love it !</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE exposed acne treatment!</li>
            <li>thank you so much!!!!!</li>
            <li>This time I decided to be smart, and I looked up \\&quot;best acne treatment</li>
            <li>I loved this treatment so much that I also bought the scrub, and the mask, which are also very good, and I recommend it to anyone who asks me about the appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li>and i must confess, the results are amazing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using exposed for about 1 year now and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing</li>
            <li>everything is amazing about this product.</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>The stuff makes your skin feel amazing.</li>
            <li>EXPOSED SKIN CARE IS TRULY AMAZING</li>
            <li>It took two days for me to see amazing results.  </li>
            <li>Also the body wash is amazing and it works.</li>
            <li>She has been using Exposed Skin Care for 6 months and her skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel amazing.</li>
            <li>Before I found this amazing kit I was using hand soap for face wash.</li>
            <li>His skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>People compliment me on my skin all the time now, it feels amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>But the catch to the AMAZING outcome is that once you stop using it, you&#x27;ll break out again.</li>
            <li>but I saw an amazing improvement.  </li>
            <li>After that your skin will heal on its own and you&#x27;ll be happier.</li>
            <li>This is a nice product, works well.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s kind of off putting but</li>
            <li>, just make sure give whatever you try a fair chance.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s kind of off putting but</li>
            <li>, just make sure give whatever you try a fair chance.</li>
            <li>I would honestly recommend these products.  </li>
            <li>it is because Exposed has their own website for sales that is separate from amazon.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I was say that this product is a good investment (better than proactive).</li>
            <li>It is also wise to avoid touching or scratching your face throughout the day, in order to prevent the spread of bacteria.</li>
            <li>Keep up the good job:)</li>
            <li>The best thing about Exposed is how gentle yet effective it is.</li>
            <li>It honestly takes like 4 min.</li>
            <li>I also started taking birth control which cleared my skin up nicely (Loestrin24fe, for those of you women that want to maybe try that option).</li>
            <li>Ever since OBAGI recalled its Serum Gel (part of their Clenziderm M.D. kit) for crystallizing, I have not found an effective treatment to replace it with.</li>
            <li>I love EXPOSED because my skin FEELS good.  </li>
            <li>I am 47 and have always had really nice skin</li>
            <li>Hello,&lt;br /&gt;Before I used exposed skincare I had tried every kind of products but without results..</li>
            <li>I wish you all a good and healthy life.</li>
            <li>I will keep using this product, and I just hope that this continues being effective.  </li>
            <li>Also, be sure you are drinking plenty of water, getting good sleep, and eating a well balanced diet.</li>
            <li>I honestly and faithfully am using this product</li>
            <li>Most days, with a touch of good quality non-codemic mineral make-up, no-one even would know that I have acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Honestly, I have used a TON of acne products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have it automatically shipped every month</li>
            <li>Thanks Kelly for making me a happy customer!</li>
            <li>Skin feels great healthy and looks 10 times better then when I started.</li>
            <li>so I decided to seek out some kind of acne treatment.</li>
            <li>One day I kept researching for something better that would be good for my skin and came upon Exposed Skin Care.</li>
            <li>Probably zero, and if anything more, it is probably too good to be true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was so refreshing, surprising even, after my wars with proactiv.</li>
            <li>I have tried everything from 20 to 500 dollars and exposed skin care is the best and most consistent acne treatment out there.</li>
            <li>My boys love it, it works great, and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>I feel so much more beautiful and clean.</li>
            <li>For sure this product is very good and is worth buying.</li>
            <li>I think this is my new best friend.</li>
            <li>All the products in the Kit are amazing and effective, but I particularly love the cleanser, the acne serum, and the moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I was ready to buy ProActiv (the name I seemed to hear most often), until I did a Google search for the best product.  </li>
            <li>Exposed is the best by far!</li>
            <li>I am glad to say with the help of Exposed, I have been acne free for over a year!!</li>
            <li>:) I am an extremely satisfied, and thankful customer that&#x27;s not going anywhere!    </li>
            <li>After my first three month supply came in, I loved the immediate results!</li>
            <li>My skin is really much much better and healthy again!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so much more confident now in my life!</li>
            <li>let&#x27;s give it one more try, and I am so glad I did!</li>
            <li>But overall customer service was great and product is good!</li>
            <li>Best acne treatment I&#x27;ve tried so far</li>
            <li>It is clear and my skin looks great!  </li>
            <li>and I can honestly say it works better than anything else I have tried.  </li>
            <li>Exposed is by far the best acne treatment I have ever seen.     </li>
            <li>So what more can I say, this is just an honest review of my experience with this company and their expanded kit.</li>
            <li>and this is by far and away the best I have found!</li>
            <li>Exposed is by far the best acne treatment out there!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best.</li>
            <li>The Exposed Acne treating system is, by far, the best system I have ever used.</li>
            <li>My skin is clear and best of all</li>
            <li>This product so far is the best one that I&#x27;ve used for acne problem.</li>
            <li>Best results so far.  </li>
            <li>So far it aint perfect</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Exposed Skin Care for about 2 months now and so far it is the best product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>it seems like a kind of thing you should be able to take care of online, but I couldn&#x27;t find how.</li>
            <li>I now have clear skin that feels and looks great!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s affordable and easy to use!  </li>
            <li>Love love love Exposed!</li>
            <li>:) i can finally smile and be proud of my skin.</li>
            <li>The customer service department is also great and has always allowed me to make substitutions in my kits at no extra charge, which is great if you find yourself running out of one item and having a surplus on another all the time.</li>
            <li>The first time i started using it, My face cleared up beautifully but however as has been my experience with most acne products that have worked for me, I started to break out again in about a yr</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE Exposed - by far the best face care line I have used!</li>
            <li>That was pretty impressive, no TV marketing, no &amp;#34;celebrity endorsements&amp;#34; just a loyal customer spreading the word.  </li>
            <li>in light of how many products we have tried and how much it has cost over the years), and again, the best part:  THE PRODUCTS WORK!!!    </li>
            <li>I had lost all hope that my skin would ever be beautiful, but thanks to Exposed</li>
            <li>though I&#x27;d give Exposed Skin Care a try as I&#x27;ve read great stuff about them, you don&#x27;t need me to tell you that this stuff really works!</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions and used them consistently for a month and saw great improvement.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m convinced it&#x27;s too good to be true and keep waiting for a break-out, but I have yet to see one.  </li>
            <li>I have found that Exposed is very gentle to my skin but also very effective.</li>
            <li>I feel very fortunate to have found a product that works.  </li>
            <li>Now for the first time I am getting so many compliments about how great my skin looks and that my skin is glowing.</li>
            <li>My skin does not dry out, it doesn&#x27;t get or oily, it is perfect!</li>
            <li>I had beautiful skin until I was a senior in high school.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t had a break out in over a month, which is a huge milestone for me!</li>
            <li>This company should be sending me a thank you for spending literally hundreds of dollars :)</li>
            <li>No matter what though, somehow this product works for my skin better than anything I have tried.  </li>
            <li>Overall GREAT!!!</li>
            <li>My skin is noticeably clearer and as healthy as I can ever remember.</li>
            <li>I have had many friends compliment me on how healthy my skin looks.</li>
            <li>My face has never looked better.  </li>
            <li>My favorite product is the cleanser.</li>
            <li>After 30 days my skin looked WAyyyyyyyyyyyy better, but after 60 days my acne was gone.</li>
            <li>You may find that some of the products work better then others for your skin.</li>
            <li>and you just feel better about yourself.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>but it kept breaking out even more than it was before using Exposed.  </li>
            <li>and I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>My skin feels smoother and I feel more confident in my appearance.</li>
            <li>And her acne has not gotten better.  </li>
            <li>She eats healthy, drinks lots of water...</li>
            <li>Better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried, would recommend it to anyone no matter your skin type.</li>
            <li>We realize that some products work better than others depending on the type of skin you may have.</li>
            <li>After a week, I was in love.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now and still love it.</li>
            <li>Seriously love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I have been using Exposed skincare for more than 3 years.  </li>
            <li>I was pleased that I wanted to write this review.</li>
            <li>I have never gotten better results than I did with exposed.</li>
            <li>i would get a lovely breakout.</li>
            <li>It got better.</li>
            <li>but as I got closer to 40, the more severe it seemed to become.  </li>
            <li>Fact of the matter is, most of these products just don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I love it, as well.</li>
            <li>And drink your water :)</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s because they were already there to begin with</li>
            <li>I started breaking out with many cystic zits.</li>
            <li>I started using this product a couple of years ago, and I am totally pleased with the results I have recieved from using Exposed.</li>
            <li>They worked okay for a while, but it took a toll on my skin.</li>
            <li>After trying Exposed, I have been able to stop taking my prescribed medication and my face looks better than ever.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love the products.  </li>
            <li>I am glad that I have found this line of products because I have struggled with skin issues since pre-teen stage</li>
            <li>I love the botanicals in the products -</li>
            <li>I did not find the moisturizer to be better than store-bought brands.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year now and am really glad I found it.      </li>
            <li>but I love Exposed</li>
            <li>You can get better and cheaper med by prescription.</li>
            <li>Better than it has in years.  </li>
            <li>Mostly around my chin and some on my cheeks.</li>
            <li>, it took about 8 weeks for my face to start getting better.</li>
            <li>And most of all, MY FACE DOESN&#x27;T HURT ANYMORE.</li>
            <li>I love the caffeine and pumpkin extract in the mositurizer.</li>
            <li>To my surprise, Exposed Skin Care popped up on almost every site with either a number one rating, or listed in the top five.</li>
            <li>And the Derm X cloth is PRICELESS for it&#x27;s ability to open pores and polish your skin.    </li>
            <li>But really, that&#x27;s insignificant in comparison to how happy I am to have found Exposed</li>
            <li>I eat healthy and I drink plenty of water.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t until i searched the internet for the top acne treatment.</li>
            <li>even better?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just lovely.</li>
            <li>Bonus, I even love the smell of the products.</li>
            <li>so I can stare at my skin some more,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve read that before just like I had.</li>
            <li>and I love their products and customer service.</li>
            <li>Love it, but now it says i cant ship to Norway</li>
            <li>It has worked better than any of the prescription creams I tried.</li>
            <li>I love this product and would recommend to any of my friends or family.  </li>
            <li>5 out of 5 for sure.</li>
            <li>My skin is a lot better now.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used so many acne treatment out there</li>
            <li>It is definetly a better product.</li>
            <li>I did more research on the internet and found out about Exposed.</li>
            <li>how many days you want in between shipments.</li>
            <li>My skin is so healthy now.</li>
            <li>I have used many products during my lifetime (Proactive, etc.), but NONE of them ever worked.  </li>
            <li>It has worked better than any product I have ever used before.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t recommend this more.</li>
            <li>I love those products, better then anything else.</li>
            <li>I have tried all over the counter products available and Exposed Acne Treatment has been by far the best I have  ever used.  </li>
            <li>Which many of these products would burn and peel my face.  </li>
            <li>By day 5 we noticed more healing and clearing.  </li>
            <li>The Exposed Skin Care system is a great skin care line that has really helped to control the oil in my skin and prevent the breakouts that I&#x27;ve been accustomed to for years.  </li>
            <li>, she had way more severe acne than I do, and she recommended I get it</li>
            <li>I have used benzoyl peroxide acne fighters (mostly proactiv) for years.</li>
            <li>I have had better luck with over the counter acne medicines.</li>
            <li>but it is a TON better.</li>
            <li>eat healthy, drink more water.</li>
            <li>They look, feel, and smell more like spa products than medicated treatments.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I have been very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Many people swear by proactive</li>
            <li>and it has been outstanding.</li>
            <li>I have been using these products for almost a year now and love it.</li>
            <li>LOVE.</li>
            <li>My skin even continued to have breakouts and was more irrateds than before.</li>
            <li>I have tried more acne products than I can count, ever since I was 12 - Proactiv, Murad, over-the-counter brands - and even medication including Accutane.</li>
            <li>I LOVE Exposed.</li>
            <li>Most acne treatment is trial and error in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I used it for more than 2 months.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>: I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now and all I can say is its fantastic!</li>
            <li>I never ever in a million years thought I would be able to walk out of my house without makeup and feel confident about my skin.</li>
            <li>and I actually felt confident and beautiful!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff...</li>
            <li>and then you will see fabulous results!</li>
            <li>I remember there being a moment where i touched my face and couldn&#x27;t find one area that felt smooth!</li>
            <li>And since then, I&#x27;ve been hooked and I gladly recommend this to all of my friends.</li>
            <li>I have battled cystic acne for so many years.</li>
            <li>Now after 4 months my face is 100% better.  </li>
            <li>I love Exposed Acne treatment.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;I am pleased to report that the gamble paid off...  </li>
            <li>I promise it will work, and you will love it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get any more acne</li>
            <li>I do love the moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many over the counter products and nothing seemed to work.</li>
            <li>They have been using it for over 6 months and it controls their acne and keeps their skin healthy and glowing.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>All the red marks I had have faded and my skin LOOKS and FEELS great!</li>
            <li>and I was now even more embarrassed to be out in public.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>I tried many things.</li>
            <li>He lived with it thinking it would get better.</li>
            <li>Thank you exposed for developing such a wonderful product.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>Ok so I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month now by about two weeks.</li>
            <li>Love the moisturizer.</li>
            <li>The skin on my nose is so much better</li>
            <li>it seems like they&#x27;re getting better after using the mask and scrub</li>
            <li>top it all off, as a member Exposed</li>
            <li>product looks healthy in the bottles (not some toxic acne med</li>
            <li>and I feel my skin has better even tone to it</li>
            <li>For years I have been able to keep it under control</li>
            <li>I LOVE</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been happier with my skin:)</li>
            <li>i had have them removie  and got more scars.i</li>
            <li>brought one more</li>
            <li>and they are satisfied too.</li>
            <li>but I love it.  </li>
            <li>I am using Exposed Skin care for more than 1 year</li>
            <li>the more I use these products.</li>
            <li>This product is much better than Proactive.  </li>
            <li>I would consider this product better than ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Interestingly, my face doesn&#x27;t irritate with exposed as it uses both benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love that this kit comes with the moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Most of my whitehead pimples are gone, but my blackheads are still an issue.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting more of a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>I consider myself as the 1% who understands the causes of acne and its treatments better than most.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using exposed for more than 2 years.</li>
            <li>Why is exposed better?</li>
            <li>There is more details on their website.</li>
            <li>but it also smooths out my skin, which makes my face look even better.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>, I try the leading brand and didn&#x27;t work for me, once I purchased this product my skin looks healthy.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I have already reccommeneded this set to three of my friends and they love it as well.</li>
            <li>This product however is gentle , my skin feels great.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s way more to it than just dirt, oil, and hormonal imbalance.   :)</li>
            <li>plan to continue buying Exposed products :)</li>
            <li>I am so glad we discovered this product.</li>
            <li>And I have tried so many products.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products out there from Proactive to Skin Id to Murad...</li>
            <li>and I just Love these skin care products.</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;m probably not going to re-purchase this product, unless some magical event happens and my face clears up.</li>
            <li>This is the best acne product I have ever used and the only one that has worked for me.</li>
            <li>I think it works better on my son than it did on my daughter.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this acne kit.</li>
            <li>The results I have from this product are better than I have ever seen before.</li>
            <li>This product is okay.  </li>
            <li>She started using the system and within a week her face was looking so much better.  </li>
            <li>It is in a very generic bottle but is great!</li>
            <li>but Its working better than Proactive for me, Proactive didnt do anything.</li>
            <li>and I love the feel of my skin and</li>
            <li>Also, the Clarisonic got my skin 10 times cleaner than my hands alone did, which helped the Exposed products to seep into my skin better.</li>
            <li>and my skin looks noticeably better.</li>
            <li>The most susceptible area of having acne is around the cheek and chin area.</li>
            <li>It sure has changed my life.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>top it all off,</li>
            <li>Just received more of this product in the mail today.</li>
            <li>I looked at reviews for all acne treatment and found Exposed had the best overall.</li>
            <li>I have been using the kit for 60 days now and completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year, and I love it.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;I need more of my face</li>
            <li>/&gt;However I was not moved nor inspired to write this review because of the product (although it would have been warranted) but because of the customer service I have received from Exposed Skin Care and more specifically from Kelly who works for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I just wanted to make sure Kelly/Exposed Skin Care was acknowledged and thanked)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Like many been dealing with acne most of my life.</li>
            <li>About 2 months ago was doing research on many brands and products for my acne because what I was using what not working.</li>
            <li>Love it :)</li>
            <li>I was having more and more breakouts and my family was commenting on my skin a lot</li>
            <li>One of my favorite products is the exfoliating scrub.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad I stumbled  upon Exposed.</li>
            <li>We both absolutely LOVE it.</li>
            <li>Give it a try, you won&#x27;t regret it! :)</li>
            <li>Im sure</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>OKAY</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>I love makeup</li>
            <li>and I feel great and confident that I know its working so much.</li>
            <li>I love waking up every morning seeing more and more improvements.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>I use to have many problems with my skin and acne.</li>
            <li>I had good success using Exposed Skincare Products.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if this face acne medicine was going to work or not.</li>
            <li>DO NOT NOT NOT KEEP POPPING, SQUEEZING &amp; TOUCHING YOUR FACE.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using this product since 2010 and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>For the most part, this product deserves the praise it&#x27;s getting.</li>
            <li>seems to be one of the top concerns is the automatic charge for you to get another set-</li>
            <li>The Top Rated Acne Treatment Pill.</li>
            <li>He tried, then disbanded use of the moisturizer, with better results no using the moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I love this system.</li>
            <li>She follows the proram closely and her skin has never looked better.  </li>
            <li>Then I found this product and within a month my face was already looking better.</li>
            <li>Exposed Skin was basically just my newest, latest product.</li>
            <li>As of now, I can&#x27;t recommend a product more.</li>
            <li>started using this kit about 6-7 weeks ago and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Almost every single one had nothing but good things to say for this product: \\&quot;Best acne product ever!\\&quot;, \\&quot;Made my skin super clear\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Additionally, the staff is very friendly and will refund you ASAP if there was a mistake on your purchase.</li>
            <li>The best of all, it is very reasonably priced and it really works.</li>
            <li>I would pretty much like to say my skin is at the ever best condition.</li>
            <li>I have to use the system exactly as the instructions tell you to, but if I do that I am able to maintain good control over my acne.  </li>
            <li>Since a steady regiment of Exposed products I have seen great improvement.  </li>
            <li>My skin felt very clean after washing it and blemishes went away within days.  </li>
            <li>I really wish I had taken before and after pics of her face because the results were amazing!  </li>
            <li>Even though I experienced personal results myself, it&#x27;s just so amazing to see how her face was sever to now so healthy and</li>
            <li>Overall, great product and company...very refreshing on your skin!</li>
            <li>I was nervous because I have sensitive skin, but it has worked beautifully.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been an acne sufferer for many, many years, and like others, I&#x27;ve used almost everything available until I&#x27;ve fortunately found Exposed!</li>
            <li>The all-natural ingredients feel and smell great, and the multi-steps are not hard to keep track of.</li>
            <li>The doctor told me the combination of the acid and peroxide was TOO STRONG for most people&#x27;s faces.</li>
            <li>Have tried many things out in the market some have worked fairly well some not so much.</li>
            <li>but we can adjust that period to best fit your individual</li>
            <li>Exposed has done WONDERS for my self-confidence and is the single best thing I purchased in 2014.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t fun, but in my opinion it was better than the acne!</li>
            <li>Exposed allowed me to get in a routine so that I was able to maintain clean and healthy skin.</li>
            <li>Looks like Proactive has some competition, yea right this is better than Proactive!</li>
            <li>Great for adult acne.</li>
            <li>I am so happy there is a product out there that is made of natural ingredients for the face.</li>
            <li>Both have experienced troublesome acne, and I have had my share of adult acne.</li>
            <li>My skin looks more smooth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for just over a month and have been happy with the results so far.</li>
            <li>I have a more detailed review here:</li>
            <li>The accutane worked wonderful the first time for about 2 years I had awesome skin, then it returned, the second go around lasted a year, then the last go around my face</li>
            <li>It feels so refreshing and light.</li>
            <li>And after a while it started to clear up great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a great combination of products that balance and help eachother out to get rid of acne and give you clear</li>
            <li>The moisterizer is great, not heavy or greasy.  </li>
            <li>And I was delighted when it really did help my skin.  </li>
            <li>For me it took a good two months or so before it really started to work.</li>
            <li>after you apply it).been using this product for 4mons.my face is not oily anymore(can go out w/o powder)but not dry either,i also noticed my face whitens and softer!no more pimples.very happy &amp; satisfied.i</li>
            <li>Exposed is completely worth the money! :)</li>
            <li>And the best part about it, it does it while keeping my skin from drying out like other acne medications have done.</li>
            <li>I have used some other products before, and this one is the best set that I have used.</li>
            <li>Try it, and hope you will also have a desire to write excited review here like me:)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely excited to see the results after a couple more weeks.</li>
            <li>Turns out that this time they were true!</li>
            <li>My skin isnt perfect as I have many acne scars still healing, however I&#x27;m happy to say new breakouts are a thing of the past.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s easy to discontinue online if you don&#x27;t want to get the product every month.</li>
            <li>My skin is very oily and acne prone - this product has been by far the greatest for my skin.  </li>
            <li>I can finally feel confident without wearing makeup and people noticed how great my skin is looking.</li>
            <li>The Exposed website is easy to use and I can easily change my products and shipment frequency.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural and gentle on your skin and has all the best ingredients in it!</li>
            <li>I heard of EXPOSED on the internet and figured I&#x27;d try another product that probably wouldn&#x27;t work; a month later I was sure happy I tried it.</li>
            <li>makes it incredibly easy to adjust the frequency of your recurring order online.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more than happy to give feedback about this product as it appears to be the only brand I have tried where I received results.</li>
            <li>Cleared my face up very quickly.</li>
            <li>,i search for top acne treatment in the Internet,then I found exposed products.i gave it a try.i am so happy with the result.everyday i can see the improvements.i started with the exposed basic kit,in</li>
            <li>It was easy to talk with her and reach a solution!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Customer service is always verry easy to work with.</li>
            <li>Everything goes on really easily and lathers well.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>and it was too strong.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend giving Exposed a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS, wash your pillow cases... a lot.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend giving Exposed a chance.     </li>
            <li>Strongly caution against giving this company your credit card number</li>
            <li>strongly recommend this product</li>
            <li>I may test each product to see how strong and</li>
            <li>One of the Exposed packages comes with a Probiotic which is great for digestion, which could be a major cause of breakouts.</li>
            <li>decided to switch to another top brand, Murad, that was offering a special deal at the time.</li>
            <li>I bought the Expanded Kit for the first time and it truly is amazing.  </li>
            <li>It worked amazingly well at first (for about 2 weeks).  </li>
            <li>I really love this acne treatment, and rather than repeat myself, I suggest you read the reviews for the Full Kit.</li>
            <li>The cleanser is my favorite, my skin feels smooth, clean and refreshed, no over-drying.</li>
            <li>The products work best when you are consistent, and use the entire system.</li>
            <li>I used to get sporadic acne that would leave my skin looking less than perfect.  </li>
            <li>One thing that throws me off about this product is that they recommend to wash your face way too often in my opinion- for some skin types twice a day is fine</li>
            <li>After receiving a package and finding that most of the bottle of cleanser had leaked out during shipment, they quickly responded to my e-mail and sent a replacement.</li>
            <li>We are both loyal customers!</li>
            <li>Exposed Acne Treatment has helped my face tremendously!</li>
            <li>IT IT SUPER!</li>
            <li>He is also so very handsome, not because he is my son:), and I am so thankful I can enjoy his handsomeness with clear healing skin.</li>
            <li>It worked great for about 18 months, but then my acne came back strong.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle yet effective and I can easily say I couldn&#x27;t function without it.</li>
            <li>She was developing fairly significant acne, I researched and found that this product in general had great results.  </li>
            <li>My skin is 100% acne free and not dry to top it off!!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve seen a huge difference within just 2 days of using the product.</li>
            <li>So that is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>and when i added that to the regimen its made a huge difference.</li>
            <li>After 2 weeks, I noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling smooth and refreshed.</li>
            <li>She even goes to the store now without any makeup on because her complexion is so smooth.  </li>
            <li>and my skin feels smooth.</li>
            <li>Exposed has been the only one to get these great results.</li>
            <li>They offer a great guarantee - who else will offer you your money back after 12 months??</li>
            <li>and I am acne free.</li>
            <li>The moisturizer is so creamy and smooth on my skin.  </li>
            <li>In addition, the customer service is fantastic.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Exposed takes a while to work, but when it does, the results are incomparable.</li>
            <li>But I will say your diet plays an important part too.</li>
            <li>Another great thing about Exposed&#x27;s kits is I can switch out products I don&#x27;t want, down-size or up-size my entire kitwhenever</li>
            <li>It comes with the kit for free</li>
            <li>Exposed has been a perfect partner in my battle with Breakouts, even after a few months of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It had great reviews with a money back guaranty</li>
            <li>Plus, they are a fantastic company to deal with.</li>
            <li>The product is great, especially with the moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It honestly saved my face, and freed me of wasting so much time covering my spots when going out.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>Absolutely fantastic product.</li>
            <li>dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The exposed system guarantees to give you acne free skin in 30 days.  </li>
            <li>* acne free in 30 days,</li>
            <li>This system really does work, honestly.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s free</li>
            <li>and if I were customer service I would think that this guy (me) was pulling a scam trying to get free product.</li>
            <li>You are fantastic at your job</li>
            <li>It works and is gentle on the skin and has a nice smell.</li>
            <li>The facial wash worked so great that I decided to give the body wash a try.</li>
            <li>and I needed to use products that weren&#x27;t in the kit like the clarifying mask and probiotic (I got them for free though).</li>
            <li>Helps prevents breakouts and promotes smooth skin.</li>
            <li>(Try washing your pillowcases &amp; wash cloths with fragrance free laundry soap)&lt;br</li>
            <li>(Shipping times can be adjusted to fit your schedule)&lt;br /&gt;  2.</li>
            <li>My son had tried all kinds of acne treatments - Acne Free, Clearasil, Neutrogena, etc. -</li>
            <li>The company offers great savings in a variety of creative ways, has reasonable shipping, and a combination of ways to purchase their products so you can affordably purchase what you need.</li>
            <li>They will gladly personalize your shipment if you have too much of one product and need more of another.  </li>
            <li>Good luck with finding a company that is even close to what Exposed offers.</li>
            <li>have used a lot of product so far, from Obagi, Murad, Kiehls, Tea Tree etc, but so far this is the best acne treatment</li>
            <li>difference.my breakouts was gone.im on the expanded kit right now and is better than ever.each treatment you can see and feel how it works(right</li>
            <li>I have never found a product for my skin that works as well and as fast as exposed!!!</li>
            <li>I know it sounds like it is too good to be true, but this is a real review from a real person!!  </li>
            <li>My skin has never been clearer and I very rarely now suffer from any spots at all.</li>
            <li>After using this product, my skin feels very very fresh.</li>
            <li>Each of the items are very useful and helps getting through the day.</li>
            <li>Some of my friends have noticed how clean and smooth it is.</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick and easy.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s super easy now.</li>
            <li>Both the morning and evening application process are quick and easy once a routine is established.  </li>
            <li>Very gentle too.&lt;br /&gt;One of mine favorite products is the scrub.</li>
            <li>The price is kind of high</li>
            <li>At the beginning it took about two and half weeks to show results that I was happy with and after that it was more of a maintenance process.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be alarmed if more acne shows after the first week or so because Exposed is just basically restoring your face by pulling all the acne out.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this.</li>
            <li>I love the all-natural ingredients in each product, and you&#x27;re skin really feels and looks healthier while using it!</li>
            <li>and I still believe in my original review which is listed below.  </li>
            <li>This is definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not normally someone to write a review but this product genuinely had a great effect on my life</li>
            <li>and I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li>My skin was 100 times better after the first month.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t EVER take the time to review a product unless it&#x27;s honestly worth it!</li>
            <li>I originally bought this to try out for my boyfriend.</li>
            <li>I think this is a shady business practice at best.</li>
            <li>I can say pretty confidently that my acne is probably hormonal -</li>
            <li>I have tried a wide range of acne treatment systems (including the award winning La Roche Pose) and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li>I have been using it consistently for about two years now and my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li>Out of all the products this is the most consistent.</li>
            <li>I am traveling abroad soon and was excited to see they have a travel size kit as well.</li>
            <li>My skin hasn&#x27;t been this healthy or looked this good in a very long time!</li>
            <li>I have tried many other products and find this to be the most effective.  </li>
            <li>Lastly, a lot of people think this is pricey, but I just have to say clear skin is so worth it!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Without question this product has been the most effective acne treatment for my teenage son.  </li>
            <li>I love that this acne treatment system uses many natural extracts.  </li>
            <li>Exposed is the best secret in acne treatment, and more people suffering from acne need to know about it.</li>
            <li>: I apply everything with clean hands.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s about the same price as Proactiv and in my case more effective</li>
            <li>The cleanser makes my face feel clean, which is what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>I like that this product had better and more natural ingredients</li>
            <li>I been having my face clean all my life</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will be honest and say I noticed improvement in regards to the acne breakouts on my face within the first two weeks, BUT the product caused some severe drying and flaking of my skin for about a week - I was pretty bummed about that.</li>
            <li>I did some research on the internet and decided to give Exposed a try after reading many positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>I ordered exposed after reading many positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I have tried many of the other acne lines out there, including Proactiv, and did not have good results.</li>
            <li>Use the system as explicitly instructed by the Exposed pamphlet, according to personal needs, in conjunction with improved diet excluding refined grains and sugar, and you should have great success in getting rid of your mild to severe acne.</li>
            <li>Some stuff works better for certain people.</li>

            <li>Just so you know it didn&#x27;t happen overnight for me, but after a month I definately saw my skin going in the right direction, and now my scars are almost all gone!  </li>
            <li>Also priced right for the results!</li>
            <li>skin feels great, not overly dry or super oily like before.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product off and on for a little over two years and it is the most amazing stuff!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve hardly had any zits since, and I feel great about the skin I&#x27;m in!</li>
            <li>The products are not irritating and they are pretty effective against acme on face and chest.  </li>
            <li>My face freaked out and I needed something that was effective, fast, and was safe for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The investment was worth it, and he continues to use the products more than one year after first trying them.  </li>
            <li>It truely changed the way I see myself in the mirror.</li>
            <li>but I had been switching products so much before beginning this one that I think I need to give it more time.  </li>
            <li>They took payment immediately but it took them a full week to ship the order, despite their claims that they ship within 48 hours.</li>
            <li>I love how gentle the products are on my face.</li>
            <li>I researched at least 5 pages of Internet reviews on every site that google produced about best acne systems and their reviews...</li>
            <li>The ingredients they say they use is absolutely true.</li>
            <li>Nice and soft and supple.</li>
            <li>It is really soft, but I don&#x27;t think it does anything spectacular.</li>
            <li>I would say Exposed provides at least one of the best online customer services.  </li>
            <li>I have used many onther products, including ProActiv, and they haven&#x27;t really worked at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 23 and it honestly hurts your confidence to be an adult with acne still.</li>
            <li>Since I have not found better alternatives yet, I will be continuing using this product, unless their customer service really pisses me off.</li>
            <li>For me Exposed is a good middle ground.</li>
            <li>Up to this point, I have been using the products for virtually 1 full year.</li>
            <li>Loving this so far.  </li>
            <li>What&#x27;s more the product is very soothing to the skin and an added bonus for those with rosacea -- I was using a product called Finacea that is basically an azailic acid compound (prescription) that costs $150 every couple months plus the aggravation of having to go to the doctor/derm for refills.</li>
            <li>The Full Kit includes the scrub, the clay mask, and the oral supplement.</li>
            <li>It is seriously a good combination which actually works.</li>
            <li>If you want to hear my full story, then please ask by commenting on my review.</li>
            <li>I was very pleasantly surprised how effective this product is.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love Exposed skin care, it really has made a difference in my confidence with my skin.  </li>
            <li>but my skin is actually really oily and this is what bothers me the most.  </li>
            <li>The customer service is outstanding and every person I have spoken with has been very helpful and</li>
            <li>Liked the fact that it was a combo of natural and science.</li>
            <li>If so, this is an INCREDIBLY elaborate one that they haven&#x27;t already been legally charged for yet...</li>
            <li>My son had tried many products, but he often abandoned them when he didn&#x27;t see results in a reasonable period of time.  </li>
            <li>It looks smooth and fresh.  </li>
            <li>I do still have periodic breakouts, but it is not nearly as bad as it was before.</li>
            <li>it would not stain but it discolored my dress shirt a bit on the collar and my pillow case, but DEFINITELY not as bad as Proactiv ruined my towels and clothes.</li>
            <li>Not bad</li>
            <li>I purchased this product first for my 16 yr old daughter, saw good results in 3 weeks for her</li>
            <li>It not only cleared my skin up nearly 100% in about 3 weeks, but it is extremely effective at preventing breakouts!!</li>
            <li>I made the purchase too quickly without making sure that all these glowing reviews were real.</li>
            <li>It only takes about 3 minutes to do and they offer so many other things to help make your skin perfect.</li>
            <li>You have to find the right fit to your skin.</li>
            <li>So far so good, I hope the results remain positive.</li>
            <li>I have tried EVERYTHING, literally EVERYTHING to get rid of my acne and this regimen has been infinitely better than Proactive, or Clean and Clear, or Neutrogena, or Acne Free, or any of those (I&#x27;ve tried them all).  </li>
            <li>I have been a loyal customer for many, many years now, and I have tried many other products.</li>
            <li>Overall so far I&#x27;d say if you give it the two to three weeks at first and use it as directed it will be an awesome product for you as well.</li>
            <li>Now Exposed is now one of my favorite products - I couldn&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>I have always struggled with mild acne</li>
            <li>AND I&#x27;m super stoked - before I started using Exposed</li>
            <li>My teenage son also began using recently and his skin looks great also!  </li>
            <li>I have Mild acne.  </li>
            <li>My face cleared faster when I used Cetaphil a mild soap and witch hazel.  </li>
            <li>She&#x27;s been a loyal Exposed user now going on 2 years.  </li>
            <li>I started him quickly on the Exposed routine.  </li>
            <li>I personally believe that treating acne is best when using a daily cleansing and treatment regimen and a scrub/mask twice a week.</li>
            <li>I suffer from mild acne</li>
            <li>My acne went from mild to severe.</li>
            <li>If my skin stays clear after a year or more, I can comfortably give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li>I have been a loyal customer for a couple years now and will continue to be one for quite some time.</li>
            <li>I have fairly mild acne along with some acne scarring, so decided to give this product a shot.</li>
            <li>and I have been seeing tremendous skin tone color.</li>
            <li>I Identified this product I was very impressed by the money back, and after trawling through numerous reviews I decided to give it a go...</li>
            <li>Sure I still get occasionally acne, but it&#x27;s a lot more manageable.  </li>
            <li>I was really pleased at first and began seeing results pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>whether or not you have mild to severe acne, or anywhere in between.  </li>
            <li>I noticed also that eliminating dairy, grains and processed sugar from my diet has helped tremendously.</li>
            <li>but they became healed quickly.</li>
            <li>Now I don&#x27;t have to put on makeup just to take some picture of me and my son, I don&#x27;t have to slather on concealer just to go to make a quick trip to the store.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my 14 year old and he is quite happy with the results so far.  </li>
            <li>I have mild to medium acne.</li>
            <li>My redness was beginning to lighten, the large cystic ones were decreasing, and the pimples were becoming fewer and farther between.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes it&#x27;s clear and has a very strong sage smell, and others</li>
            <li>I find the products safe, gentle, long lasting, and the best part is :  THEY WORK!!!!  </li>
            <li>I have noticed, however, that the products do not stay very consistent.  </li>
            <li>This all adds to the ultimate cleansing experience - far superior to Proactiv!    </li>
            <li>Otherwise very pleased and wish I could get them locally.</li>
            <li>Even though it looks like alot of steps, the whole system is really easy and quick to use.</li>
            <li>Let me start by saying I have combination oily/dry skin, so it has always been a struggle to find good face products that don&#x27;t dry me out but also don&#x27;t leave my skin shiny and cause breakouts.</li>
            <li>Overall good reults after first couple of weeks adjusting to bew product.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t even been a week, only six days and many of my pimples have cleared up!</li>
            <li>I love the face cleanser and clear pore serum, and the clarifying mask works wonders!</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t even let my boyfriend see my face first thing in the morning!</li>
            <li>First of all, I do not write reviews!</li>
            <li>and I am absolutely FLOORED at the results!!  </li>
            <li>People can only use so many terms to describe acne suffering and what a product has done to help that!</li>
            <li>Must use consistently for results and don&#x27;t pick!</li>
            <li>At first it didn&#x27;t seem to be as effective as I thought but after several weeks I started to notice a HUGE difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s packed with healing/soothing ingredients on top of the strong acne preventing ones such as benxoyl peroxide.</li>
            <li>depending on your skin, if more dry than oily, you are better off using a moisturizer your skin is used to.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had a problem that wasn&#x27;t quickly and appropriately remedied, in nearly 3 years of use and bimonthly delivery.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had problems with acne on top of having super sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 24 years old with very oily skin and this product has definitely done the best job at consistently controlling my acne.</li>
            <li>I was really optimistic about Exposed because of the many positive reviews and articles that I read about it.</li>
            <li>The first few years I used Proactiv - which did a good job I thought, until I discovered Exposed!</li>
            <li>because they offer a higher statistically significant success rate of 98%</li>
            <li>I was about to give up on the product but decided to try using less of it, and that was very effective.</li>
            <li>You know how some people, when they have a great complexion, they have this little shiny spot on their forehead.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend Exposed Acne Treatment to anyone who is looking to try something new!  </li>
            <li>I know beauty is on the inside too, but its hard to laugh and smile and be happy when you have huge acne..</li>
            <li>I know everyone is different, but this company is amazing</li>
            <li>I tried Exposed Skin Care in hopes to calm my acne, it is not 100% gone</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t too harsh and everything smells great.</li>
            <li>It is by far the best of anything I have ever used and it leaves my skin looked fresh (not dried out and red) and acne-free.  </li>
            <li>It took 2 weeks and ever since, for now 6 month, I am acne free and my life is so much happier and easier now.</li>
            <li>I will post another review in a few weeks for an update, but I am already happy with the product, which has never happened to me before with skincare not received from a doctor.  </li>
            <li>so so so many products, (mostly all over the counter because i&#x27;m too poor to go to the doctor).&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many different of the following&lt;br /&gt;-medicated washes (st.ives scrubs, Neutrogena clear pore, many MANY more, but those 2 were my</li>
            <li>My skin looks so healthy and clear.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t worth the money in our situation.  </li>
            <li>It took about 3 weeks for my skin to clear and my skin tone is better than ever.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had clear skin that Ive been able to maintain.</li>
            <li>Blemishes remain until the natural healing process clears them up, but the healthy tissue around the blemish is irritated and peeling, burned from the chemicals in the lotions.  </li>
            <li>Although this item is a bit pricy, I think it&#x27;s worth the cost.</li>
            <li>I am a personal trainer and often at the gym 10-12 hours per day and between my clients workouts and my own, my skin is under stress and lots of perspiration throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>This is WELL WORTH every cent I paid.</li>
            <li>my acne!:)This is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>The only thing I kind of wish Exposed offered is an eye cream, and an extra strength pimple-zapper, as it would be nice to have all my skin care products in the one place.</li>
            <li>So after trying many products I now use a natural face cream by Ohio Valley Herbal Products, Inc. which leaves my skin feeling supple and hydrated.</li>
            <li>I too tried every product worth trying....over the counter as well as Proactive, Murad, Max Clarity etc......</li>
            <li>then my life will be complete :)</li>
            <li>and my skin was clear, but it wasn&#x27;t healthy looking.</li>
            <li>I have insanely sensitive skin, and it worked well for me :)</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about a year and have been pleased with its results thus far.  </li>
            <li>The price may seem steep to some, but I promise you it is worth it.</li>
            <li>more success story now includes my own 13 year old son as he is now entering his teenage years.  </li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>So far its done a good job at lessening the effects of the old acne.</li>
            <li>and I rarely have problems with my skin.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s honestly worth it.</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels so soft and healthy.  </li>
            <li>so I thought it was worth telling people about.</li>
            <li>He rarely even gets one pimple anymore.</li>
            <li>acne treatment serum works great as a spot treatment but do NOT get it on the surrounding skin, especially if your skin is sensitive.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll be able to have a clear complextion for my wedding day.</li>
            <li>If I feel a pimple coming on, I apply the Acne Treatment Serum to it and it rarely ever surfaces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so rare that I ever have even a mini-breakout that I&#x27;ve almost forgotten what it&#x27;s like.</li>
            <li>I will be completely blemish free!</li>
            <li>The deep cystic kind, blackheads, whiteheads, etc etc.</li>
            <li>What I like most about this product is that they combine all natural ingredients with proven acne fighting products (i.e. benzoyl peroxide salycic acid).  </li>
            <li>guarantee (when they had a 90% success rate).</li>
            <li>far I am really enjoying the effects.</li>
            <li>TO MY CLEAR, SMOOTH, ACNE FREE COMPLEXION.  </li>
            <li>honestly, I am saying that this product is only spending money on nothing.</li>
            <li>Worth a try.</li>
            <li>If you have acne issues, it&#x27;s worth giving this product a try.  </li>
            <li>Now she has clear skin and feels so much better about herself.  </li>
            <li>I use the moisture complex, it&#x27;s great because it keeps my skin smooth, but doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.</li>
            <li>I have only been using this product for about a month now, but it is working great so far.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s quite satisfied so far with the results.</li>
            <li>blemishes would clear up, 3 or 4 more would pop</li>
            <li>Regardless, not all of my problems have been cured, but this was definitely worth the try.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been told by my dermatologists that the only way to control this kind of acne (cysts) is by antibiotics.  </li>
            <li>Has helped with breakouts and even to just maintain clear and healthy skin.</li>
            <li>after using it longer it will continue to clear up even more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product overall, but it really depends on the person.</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powerful stuff.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny...</li>
            <li>the results have been very positive.  </li>
            <li>I am way more confident and will never use anything other than Exposed for now on.</li>
            <li>The moisture complex has helped to clear the scarring on my shoulders, and the cloth is an excellent exfoliater to help clean up any flaky skin and leave you looking glowing.  </li>
            <li>this has worked much better for me than most other acne products out there.</li>
            <li>I do have to supplement the kit with more the tonic because I use more of that then the other products.  </li>
            <li>By using many of their products, my skin quickly cleared up, became smooth and radiant, and didn&#x27;t dry up my skin or made it oily.</li>
            <li>I have had mild but consistent acne for years</li>
            <li>I am aware and know from experience that products do not work quickly.  </li>
            <li>I became a true believer after that and have now purchased kits for both of my daughters who are seeing positive results as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many other products, but this is the first that was able to convince me to stop wearing foundation because my natural skin looked better not covered up.</li>
            <li>They are also very helpful and customer friendly as well.</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave this product 4 stars is because I do go through the moisturizer quicker (it is probably normal for most people to go through on or more products faster than others)</li>
            <li>My skin has cleared up significantly and when I do breakout, it goes away much faster then before.</li>
            <li>I love the fact it lists all of the ingredients rather than the key ingredients or the ones that would make consumers think that they are special.</li>
            <li>but I just don&#x27;t think I have the right skin for this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It won&#x27;t work right away, so don&#x27;t give up when your acne hasn&#x27;t disappeared within a week.</li>
            <li>and then I find that the clearing tonic/acne treatment serum is drying, so on those mornings I skip the tonic and acne treatment, and then apply the moisturizer and the dryness clears right</li>
            <li>(what did I have to lose, right?).</li>
            <li>I saw improvements right away</li>
            <li>My skin is clear for the first time and I feel confident without the need to cover up with makeup.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, this is the first product that worked for my moderate acne!</li>
            <li>The face wash makes my skin feel so clean and the toner really helps to shrink my pores and take away the redness.</li>
            <li>My face is clear and I am able to wear blush/bronzer for the first time with no breakout.</li>
            <li>And I am very satisfied with what it has done for me in terms of significantly reduced acne and clear skin, though the oiliness is still about the same.</li>
            <li>I would recommend that you give this product a good honest try, as I fully expect that in 2-3 months I will finally have the clear, radiant skin I have been trying to get back to since puberty.ecommend</li>
            <li>that you give this product a good honest try, as I fully expect that in 2-3 months I will finally have the clear, radiant skin I have been trying to get back to since puberty.</li>
            <li>it just leaves is clear and clean feeling!</li>
            <li>I do still get some pimples sometimes, but they are much smaller (and most of the time they are whiteheads instead of the cystic type I used to get) and go away quickly.  </li>
            <li>This has always been higher than proactive&#x27;s success rate.</li>
            <li>and I know that this small passage will be inadequate to express how happy I am at the moment</li>
            <li>, then the clearing tonic (so it can work it&#x27;s magic at night) as well as two more capsules of the Clearzine.&lt;br /&gt;So far after only two weeks</li>
            <li>so be careful about how much you use at first, but so far so good for me :)</li>
            <li>Although it may be good to use it, I&#x27;ve switched to one that would heal dark spots and pigmentation instead.</li>
            <li>My skin look so rich and vibrant.</li>
            <li>I am hoping after using for a little more time we will see better results.  </li>
            <li>more and more acnes are coming out everyday and whaaat?</li>
            <li>Has lessened my acne and exposed skin care makes my skin feel good and look less blotchy.</li>
            <li>Simple, gentle and effective describe Exposed</li>
            <li>It is easy to use with the step instructions and clearly labeled bottles and has done wonders for my daughter&#x27;s skin and self esteem.</li>
            <li>My skin felt better after a few days and within 2 weeks my skin was clearer with a more even skin tone.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth the money if you want to enjoy clear skin and confidence.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been 9 months now and these Exposed products are still doing a great job to my daily facial care.  </li>
            <li>My skin is very tempermental and tends to dry out easy with most acne treatments.</li>
            <li>I use this stuff twice daily like the directions say and it does do a good job at getting rid of the old acne.</li>
            <li>I contacted the company directly expecting to get a call center representative whose brain I could pick about what made the product so great.  </li>
            <li>Have had better success with basic soap and a touch on spot healer.</li>
            <li>I still get regular breakouts, despite good diet, frequent washing of bedding, etc.</li>
            <li>product ships incredibly fast and comes with detailed instructions on what to use and when, which really helps.</li>
            <li>but they last a good amount of time, they offer coupons and special deals, and you can buy any product individually if you use one faster than the others.</li>
            <li>Long story short, my skin has cleared up A LOT and many people have told me over and over that my skin is amazing-</li>
            <li>but then as soon as istarted back doing it the right way my skin was beautiful.the kit with all the products are better skin heals way quicker and you will see your skin glow in no time.</li>
            <li>(But I am sure they will take it a couple steps further, right guys??</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had acne since I was about 15 or 16, usually pretty mild, didn&#x27;t really get it on cheeks or forehead</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s incredibly smooth I actually look forward to washing my face and not worring about breaking out and last but not least, what an amazing price!</li>
            <li>The facial cleanser is very light on my skin and doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation or redness.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for some months now, but I remember seeing results very fast.</li>
            <li>Did not help my son very much</li>
            <li>Exposed is a great product to at least give a chance to, especially with their great money back</li>
            <li>They haven&#x27;t changed size very much at all.</li>
            <li>Also very reasonable for the price.</li>
            <li>and I tend to go through the moisturizer faster than the other products), which is great for sensitive skin like mine.  </li>
            <li>I switched from high end products to more natural treatments like honey, lemon, even clay.  </li>
            <li>Once your face is clean, then the product prevents the new break</li>
            <li>(I was wearing makeup, but now I can get my skin looking practically flawless with a bit of makeup - before, I could only really cover the redness) and the other thinking I was wearing makeup when I wasn&#x27;t!!  </li>
            <li>Exposed works so well after the first two weeks your face will look rejuvenated.</li>
            <li>Not only does it help with acne, it makes my skin feel better too.  </li>
            <li>First off, \\&quot;Exposed, keep your credit...</li>
            <li>My first order arrived and I began using the toner.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use most benzoyl peroxide treatments because my skin gets extremely red, itchy, and peels.</li>
            <li>I had similar issues with Proactiv when I tried it many years ago.</li>
            <li>Thanks Exposed Skincare!</li>
            <li>It seemed like a pain in the butt at first</li>
            <li>but I got the hang of it after the first week</li>
            <li>This was the last product i was willing to try, after searching the internet for top 10  acne solutions i came across the expanded kit.</li>
            <li>Overall, I would recommend this product for sure.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on the middle of week 4 and my skin looks better than it has in longer than i can remember.</li>
            <li>It DOES hurt at first.</li>
            <li>I recommend geting the kit with everything on your first buy.</li>
            <li>Thanks Exposed!</li>
            <li>I have tried and bought all kinds of different products and brands and have never been truly and completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>This one consistently popped up as number 1 about 75 or 80 percent of the time.</li>
            <li>I struggled with acne through college and literally tried everything, including Proactive to Acne Free and even shifted to all natural products of Burt&#x27;s Bees.  </li>
            <li>I am just so glad that there is a product out there that actually does what it claims.</li>
            <li>After having tried many options for my daughter we finally found this product and it worked almost immediately.</li>
            <li>I first started using exposed, because the product that I had been using was discontinued.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I finally found a product that works for me.  </li>
            <li>Once I got it (incredibly fast shipping!)</li>
            <li>This stuff is for real!</li>
            <li>I first tried Exposed in 2006, just months before my wedding.</li>
            <li>You have to be consistent with this product.  </li>
            <li>My face cleared up for the first month.  </li>
            <li>I honostly can say that yess it really works!</li>
            <li>It simply does a better job fighting acne than Proactive.</li>
            <li>My daughter tried so many different acne products and none were helping...</li>
            <li>However, after I tried the Exposed acne products, the white-head started to disappear way before I finished my first Exposed Expanded Kit.  </li>
            <li>When you buy a kit, it comes up much more cheaper, rather buying products individually.</li>
            <li>I never struggled with acne until I was 24 and onto my first job out of college.  </li>
            <li>My two favorite products in the kit are the Facial Cleanser and Acne Treatment Serum.  </li>
            <li>This is truly the only product that worked for me after so many years of struggling with Acne.  </li>
            <li>of sleep go back to bed, and those of you who want ance free skin try this product out!</li>
            <li>Doing this routine with Exposed has left my skin glowing, my complexion even, and me blemish free!</li>
            <li>I just received my first Exposed treatment kit in the mail today and used the evening routine (cleanser, serum and spot treatment) about 1 hour ago.</li>
            <li>Skin ID worked for a while, but recently it seemed to stop being able to control my outbreaks.</li>
            <li>I was in a pretty severe breakout stage when I got Exposed in the mail.</li>
            <li>My makeup goes on so much better, and my skin looks completely different.  </li>
            <li>I have tried countless products and have been to the derm on many occasions.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different products to deal with acne.</li>
            <li>In the past I have tried Proactive, perscription face products, Artistry, Neutrogena, Clean&amp;Clear, and many, many others.  </li>
            <li>This product along with additional face moisturizers work very well for me!</li>
            <li>Even after my first day of using it, I noticed an improvement on my complexion.</li>
            <li>I got a reaction the first usage and within a week I could feel that my skin was softer and smoother.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many different treatments and products.</li>
            <li>From the off the shelf products to facial sessions that cost more than $200 dollars each, and antibiotics and contraceptive pills.</li>
            <li>I felt my skin was \\&quot;peaceful\\&quot;, it was not angry anymore.</li>
            <li>My facial skin has been quite oily, and had a lot more acne.</li>
            <li>Believe me, it really works!</li>
            <li>I had moderate acne most of my life.</li>
            <li>After a phone call with Amazon customer service, they agreed to refund the money however buyers should be aware Exposed does not guarantee the product when purchased through Amazon.</li>
            <li>The reviews here, if you click the \\&quot;See all my reviews\\&quot; link, you&#x27;ll notice for many users this is the only product they&#x27;ve ever reviewed.</li>
            <li>[...] is a review for exposed, has a link that leads back to [...] along with many user comments that are garbled and don&#x27;t make any sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have changed my diet around and am drinking more water daily and still nothing.</li>
            <li>I will update in three weeks if anyone&#x27;s interested in the results.</li>
            <li>I began to see results while being consistent in using it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The price was reasonable and I will continue to use this product line for life!</li>
            <li>I have been an avid proactiv user for over 8 years.  </li>
            <li>the next day my face would already look better and now even if I have to work in the kitchen</li>
            <li>and it is now completely zit free for the first time in</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have ever written a review about any product that I have purchased online...</li>
            <li>I love every part of this acne system and I never have to worry about what product I should try next.</li>
            <li>It could be that I&#x27;m more religious about keeping to the routine of washing my face every morning and night, or it could be the products themselves.  </li>
            <li>try it work for while on first</li>
            <li>I tried sooooo many different acne treatments and it never seemed to help.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND EVERYONE TRYING IT!!</li>
            <li>I started suffering from acne around the area next to the eyebrows, and Skin ID couldn&#x27;t control it any more.</li>
            <li>I PURCHASED MY FIRST KIT IN OCTOBER 2011</li>
            <li>Skin feel smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended to everyone !!</li>
            <li>Now, it&#x27;s around 6 months after I first started to use the exposed system</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft and blemish free.</li>
            <li>and now I have the pretty skin that I used to have.</li>
            <li>This product has been working real well for me!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I finally gave it a try; I used it for about a week before I started to see results.</li>
            <li>I was interested in the Exposed product because it promised use of both &amp;#34;science and nature&amp;#34; --</li>
            <li>Problems occur when I moved to Europe, for the first 3 months</li>
            <li>I am so glad I finally found something that worked for me.  </li>
            <li>I continued to struggle with acne, not finding a product that would work and CONTINUE to work on a consistent basis.</li>
            <li>/&gt;We are on the automatic send program and it is,for me, the only way to go as I am sure I would forget to order.</li>
            <li>While I still am fighting the acne I am feeling better about myself as I continue to see daily improvement.  </li>
            <li>OK there was no way I was going to get that package back</li>
            <li>;) )</li>
            <li>Results may be gradual, but they are amazing.&lt;br /&gt;Stick with it and be consistent in your habit of using it &amp; here may be your solution to a life-long acne problem.</li>
            <li>and my daughters face was completely blemish free.  </li>
            <li>It works great and as long as you stick with it, you will definitely see results.</li>
            <li>really helped my skin!</li>
            <li>used it for the first week and followed the directions every morning and night, strictly.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>In fact , I tried a lot of product such as the famous proactiv but that did not working for me.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;ll most likely work for you.</li>
            <li>and it has been 32 weeks (7 months) since I first started using Exposed Skin Care medicine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;****Be Consistent &amp; Take Care</li>
            <li>After trying many over the counter and perscription products this finally worked!</li>
            <li>Majority of reviews I read said it worked at first</li>
            <li>I saw the difference after the first week.</li>
            <li>This kit has done so well for me that this is the first review I&#x27;ve ever written.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried every combination and this seems to keep my skin consistent.</li>
            <li>Naturally I was skeptical, even after reading the amazing reviews because they all have great reviews.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re having trouble maintaining good skin, I would suggest you look into this product.</li>
            <li>After using this product for a good few weeks.  </li>
            <li>My face did NOT feel good for a few days.  </li>
            <li>I hope the products can be a little bit more affordable and the shipping could be faster, because they are very quickly used up.</li>
            <li>the mircroscrub is great especially if you&#x27;re skin is dry</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Exposed Acne product for several months now and it&#x27;s been the best I&#x27;ve tried so far... and I have also used Proactiv and other over the counter treatments.  </li>
            <li>I had previously used proactive for a year and initially had good results but my skin was incredibly dry and burned, so I tried exposed and have had amazing results!</li>
            <li>4-6 more weeks, her acne was completely gone and her face was clear!  </li>
            <li>At first it didn&#x27;t work, but I kept with it and followed the directions completely, and I am so excited about my skin.  </li>
            <li>Dermatologist prescriptions that were too mild or strong, from Proactiv (which was WAY too strong), to Clinique (did next to nothing after almost 3 mos of religious use).</li>
            <li>Granted, I am only on my second kit, so I can&#x27;t vouch for the long-term consistency, but I do know that it is working better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, and that&#x27;s good enough for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>Product is consistent and if you use it you will see positive results.</li>
            <li>I surfed the net and actually found another product line that I tried first - not as good in my opinion.</li>
            <li>My skin was always pretty good with the occasional pimple until last year.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks clean and smooth, neither oily nor dry.</li>
            <li>Proactiv, Clean and Clear, Clinique, Vichy, Clearasil, Neutrogena, Murad, the Body Shop&#x27;s tea tree line...</li>
            <li>I used proactiv, murad, clean and clear, neutrogena, etc.</li>
            <li>Combined with a clean diet you could get clear skin within a month.</li>
            <li>I tried Proactive, Clearasil, Clean &amp; Clear and Neutrogena.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything from Clean &amp; Clear to Proactive and none of it worked for me.</li>
            <li>African black soap + coconut oil has worked much more nicely for fixing up my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After trying many facial soaps from stores and even Proactiv Solution, I never saw any real results.</li>
            <li>I liked that the products have such natural ingredients and after reading dozens of reviews online I decided to get the Expanded kit.  </li>
            <li>After using proactiv and Murad for years and dealing with constant pimples it feels good to finally use a product that works.</li>
            <li>(According to my own research into the user and medical reviews), was an all natural line of products known as Exposed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Finally at 55, my face looks good enough where I don&#x27;t  have to where make up to cover up the acne.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really works, for the longest I used so many different products until I started with Exposed!</li>
            <li>I suppose that is more of a scheme of tactics significantly over scam knowing that consumers and people in general only read what they want to read while skimming over the words in emails and websites.</li>
            <li>Best of all, the black/blue discoloration was going away and no more dry, flaky skin.</li>
            <li>I have used Clinique and rhodan fields in the past and nothing has worked as effectively and quickly as this product.</li>
            <li>I first tried this 2 years ago and it made my skin super sensitive for a couple weeks, but then my acne was GONE.</li>
            <li>I searched and found a number of positive reviews and with the guarantee</li>
            <li>I searched online and read Exposed&#x27;s mostly positive reviews.</li>
            <li>It was also SUPER nice on my sensitive skin, which has been my biggest issue with other acne kits.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty much every type of acne, whiteheads, blackheads, cystic.</li>
            <li>I have been struggling with acne for years and have tried pretty much everything.  </li>
            <li>When I found exposed I was skeptic at first because I hadn&#x27;t heard much about it.</li>
            <li>This is the first system that I have found that really works.  </li>
            <li>It is the FIRST one that I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue on my skin and absorbs really well without feeling sticky or greasy.</li>
            <li>have used it about a week, within the first 24 hours I could see a very noticeable improvement.</li>
            <li>It REALLY works and works fast!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I would recommend this product -- my skin looks better now that it has in a long time.  </li>
            <li>This is so gentle on my skin and clears it up fast!</li>
            <li>If you follow directions and use it twice per day, you see results pretty much overnight.</li>
            <li>I looked online and found Exposed and loved that it was a mix of natural and other ingredients.  </li>
            <li>The old saying you are what eat, it&#x27;s probably true...</li>
            <li>I also had super some super dry patches that would conveniently show up in the middle of the day that were not too appealing.  </li>
            <li>It is the same with pores, they look soo much smaller and my skin looks more and more natural</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a bit more flare ups here and there, but it says it gets worse before it gets better, but overall it seems to be getting better.</li>
            <li>The products are very easy to use and work extremely well.</li>
            <li>Over the years I have used so many other products and finally found the one :)  </li>
            <li>Most products have never been able to help my skin from breaking out especially from extreme workouts</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;ve tried many other commercial products, which all resulted more breakouts.</li>
            <li>Exposed doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out and works 100 times better than proactive ever did.</li>
            <li>It made my skin dry and so itchy, which I could have dealt with had it made my acne better.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more of a clear brown color and had barely any sage to the smell.</li>
            <li>As someone with very mild acne still clinging on after my teenage years, I&#x27;m looking to eliminate it.</li>
            <li>As soon as my face began getting better it also became extremely dry &amp; irritated.</li>
            <li>its make me more dry and</li>
            <li>I can strongly recommend you to give it a try, and definitely be persistent in applying it as recommended.</li>
            <li>That being said, a large portion of my acne problem still remains, which I hold out hope is a situation which will change, but I know that my acne is an exceptional case which topical creams can only do so much for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had severe blackheads &amp; whiteheads which would turn into large zits because I had a habit of squeezing them.</li>
            <li>my skin is pretty much blemish free and so much more soft and less oily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to ask for a refund if it doesn&#x27;t get better in 30 more days, because it is an expensive kit and Exposed do promise a full refund if it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>And I love that I get a new facial cloth (Derm-X Cloth) with every shipment.</li>
            <li>With the Exposed Skincare line of products, I have not only been able to rid myself of the acne I had, but help reduce new pimples/cysts/blackheads from forming.  </li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s ONE occasional new spot, not the many I would get</li>
            <li>But now he checks to make sure the new kit is coming before he runs out of the current.  </li>
            <li>And for me, Exposed&#x27;s Moisture Complex isn&#x27;t enough - it&#x27;s a very light moisturizer that absorbs too quickly and leaves my skin wanting more.</li>
            <li>Id definitely recommend this line to anyone who wants to clear up their acne as well as make their skin actually look nice!</li>
            <li>It took about 2 weeks to see a big difference and by the time I went through all the products (about 6 weeks) and ordered more my skin was completely clear!</li>
            <li>I was hesitant just due to the fact that I had tried so many products that seemed to work at first, but then would eventually stop working.  </li>
            <li>There are going to be cases where this product simply wont work for them, and that is completely fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to know that if I get an outbreak that I can put a little cream on it</li>
            <li>It took a little longer to work that I would have liked, but after the forst 60 day package I seem to be on track.</li>
            <li>But, honestly, this product did little to nothing for me.</li>
            <li>By the end of 3 months, her face looked very clear as if nothing had ever happened!!  </li>
            <li>Unless I can find a product that works as well and doesn&#x27;t cost as much, I will continue to use this because of the results.  </li>
            <li>I do wish iit didn&#x27;t cost so much.</li>
            <li>It has made me so much happier and</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
            <li>Exposed Acne Treatment was one of those rated very well</li>
            <li>This product really works and i am grateful for them.</li>
            <li>However, I researched and found this product&#x27;s claim to be promising.  </li>
            <li>All of the over the counter products we had tried did absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li>It dried out my skin some and made the red blotchy texture even more prominent.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I started using it and my skin cleared up gradually after a couple of weeks and felt softer and healthier straight away.</li>
            <li>Try them all and then you can re-buy the ones you really like.</li>
            <li>Try them all and then you can re-buy the ones you really like.</li>
            <li>It has boosted my confidence in myself, and I&#x27;m really thankful for this product.  </li>
            <li>I highly reccommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li>and my skin is really clearing.  </li>
            <li>After one month my skin was free of blemishes and redness and my pores were smaller.</li>
            <li>This system works very well.</li>
            <li>Now, I use it every day and its working very well.</li>
            <li>It has improved her skin and she is much happier.</li>
            <li>I really do reccommend this product.</li>
            <li>I only use maybe 1-2 products at a time, and all of them are light and airy.    </li>
            <li>I figured there wasn&#x27;t really a solution for my acne</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>i really recommend the microderm scrub.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>One thing I&#x27;m really hoping for Exposed to come out with is an SPF based moisturizer</li>
            <li>I thank her for her prompt assistance so that my problem was solved reasonably fast.  </li>
            <li>Products are gentle on the skin yet somehow manage to do the job.</li>
            <li>Their stuff is very helpful and knowledgeable.</li>
            <li>AND I AM VERY GRATEFUL</li>
            <li>Just like the rest of the reviews for this product, I&#x27;ve tried absolutely everything to no avail.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a great feeling to have such inner peace knowing he will not have to suffer with these problems like I did into adulthood.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Proactiv, some over the counter acne wash, nothing&#x27;s really worked for me.</li>
            <li>The product has really done nothing.</li>
            <li>A highly recommended product!</li>
            <li>I got the expanded package because I really wanted the moisturizer as I am from Chicago and my skin dries out in the winter.  </li>
            <li>My chin is so much smoother and cleaner now than before.  </li>
            <li>Science and nature really do work together.</li>
            <li>They have even let me keep an extra kit they sent by accident for FREE.</li>
            <li>Thanks for your follow up.  ,</li>
            <li>Through using exposed, I saw amazingly fast results in a matter of days</li>
            <li>Then I went to Proactiv+ with much excitement, but it didn&#x27;t make much of a difference.  </li>
            <li>Exposed has really helped me a lot.</li>
            <li>I had tried absolutely everything.</li>
            <li>This cleared up my whole face</li>
            <li>I really think it is the combination of the salicylic acid and the benzoyl peroxide.</li>
            <li>I have tried absolutely everything from OTC products to precription topicals to oral medication and nothing ever helped.</li>
            <li>Haha.  </li>
            <li>After trying a variety of acne skin care products and &amp;#34;kits&amp;#34; that didn&#x27;t work, I was really worried about trying Exposed and wasting money.  </li>
            <li>Either way it didn&#x27;t look much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The kit comes with a moisturizer that I fully expected to use but my skin has been so healthy with the rest of the system I haven&#x27;t needed</li>
            <li>The system is straight forward containing the ingredients you need to fight acne- benzoyl peroxide &amp; salicylic acid.  </li>
            <li>i try so much stuff</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a product that is gentle on your face and won&#x27;t irritate your skin, I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>and I thought there is nothing really</li>
            <li>I was ready to buy Proactive when I came across this product.  </li>
            <li>After looking into anti-acne treatments on a whim, I settled on this -- and absolutely adore it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend giving these products a try!</li>
            <li>After reading much reviews, I decided that I would order Exposed skincare products for her.</li>
            <li>So this really works.</li>
            <li>One last thing, Exposed is so confident in their success rate that they offer 1 year money back guarantee.</li>
            <li>I hope that very soon they will all disappear!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>I find the price reasonable and I always buy the expanded set as I like the moisturiser.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend them!</li>
            <li>I was sticking to the skin care routine very well, but I kept suffering form this jaw-line acne and Proactiv wouldn&#x27;t cure it.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I really like the outcome of it and recommend it to those also struggling with acne.</li>
            <li>now my whole face is acne .</li>
            <li>The products really do work.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product to anyone that knows me because they know how much I struggled before</li>
            <li>You really have to be patient to use this product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s risks and feel this product provides a much wiser, safer option.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much acne to begin with, but after using Exposed</li>
            <li>First I order online and for the first few days of use the product was ok.</li>
            <li>Exposed is not a miracle product, nothing really is.</li>
            <li>And knowing how many different products you get that last for two months - the price was worth it for me.</li>
            <li>but I really like the Benzoyl Peroxide for spot treatments.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t really have acne until I was out of my teens.</li>
            <li>this made my eyelashes fall out at a much faster rate than normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Additionally, the products do not smell like medicine and they are extremely gentle.</li>
            <li>I do not break out nearly as much</li>
            <li>I started eliminating the products one-by-one to find out which ones I really need.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>REALLY WANT PEOPLE TO SEE</li>
            <li>It really does.</li>
            <li>Its really working</li>
            <li>I appreciated that</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t finished using the whole kit yet</li>
            <li>I wash my make up off using Cetaphil Gentle Cleansing Antibacterial Bar Soap.***&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li>this means you probably signed up for a membership to get the discount if you got the product straight off their site.</li>

            <li>We would highly recommend this line of products!</li>
            <li>Their products have really helped me.  </li>
            <li>and i must say that its starting to clear most of my acne.</li>
            <li>I liked the minimal number of all natural ingredients and what they were.</li>
            <li>it suits me (currently I&#x27;m using the basic kit), and change my ship dates online at my own convenience.</li>
            <li>As an adult in my 30&#x27;s you could imagine how distressing this could get, but after so many years of battling acne my skin has finally cleared up.</li>
            <li>We still marvel on how this was the only product to help her and continues to help her maintain a clear healthy face.  </li>
            <li>Exposed actually helped control my acne, making it more clear than it has been for years.</li>
            <li>At least it is getting her into a regimine for good skin care.  </li>
            <li>What pleased me was that it was a mix of natural extracts and acne medicines as well as the one year money back guarantee.  </li>
            <li>Exposed was the first thing that consistently kept my skin clear.  </li>
            <li>Love how I have such sensitive skin and</li>
            <li>I used many acne skin care lines over the years from over the counter to prescription level so in comparison, this line feels gentler on my skin and because of it, I haven&#x27;t broken out more.</li>
            <li>my face was clear!!!</li>
            <li>The e-mail states that there is no need to rush sending back the product because I have a whole year!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks, and the acnes completely gone!!!</li>
            <li>The description made it sound like it was way better than proactive and all other brands, but it&#x27;s all about the same to me.</li>
            <li>But seriously what&#x27;s more important an acne free face, or 10 extra minutes of sleep before school or work!</li>
            <li>My first month of college in a new city my face exploded in acne.</li>
            <li>I started using the cleanser and toner from the new kit about two or three weeks ago, but I am still using the moisturizer and acne and pore serums from the first kit.</li>
            <li>When she does, it is minor and easy to keep under control.</li>
            <li>A couple of notes - don&#x27;t use the clear pore serum near your eyes - that stuff is POWERFUL!</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s light and fresh and there is no lingering odor like some other products I have tried.  </li>
            <li>It has made a serious difference in my skin, which is the most important thing.</li>
            <li>On a doctor review site I saw that they recommended this one over proactive and even though I had never heard of it, it seemed like it had a lot of active ingredients that would help and I liked that it used natural things too.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My face is super clear, and my skin is very soft.  </li>
            <li>and I was originally using Proactive Extra Strength</li>
            <li>This product has worked better for me than when I used Proactiv or other skin care products.</li>
            <li>Cleared up my skin without drying it out, something that I hadn&#x27;t been able to find with other products.  </li>
            <li>I give Exposed Skin Care 5 very big golden stars!</li>
            <li>I had such faith in the results and was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many other acne products that do not seem to work for me.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Exposed Expanded Kit after trying many other skin care products, including Proactiv.</li>
            <li>They told me I had agreed to this when I made my original purchase and that this is why they send an e-mail 5 days prior to charging your account.</li>
            <li>just don&#x27;t feel like Exposed worked any better than any other skincare product I&#x27;ve tried, and I feel like</li>
            <li>It only takes a couple of minutes as a part of your routine in the morning and at night and is WELL worth it!  </li>
            <li>This product has worked better for my skin than any other acne product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally leave feedback for a product,  but since this product really is working for my adult acne, it&#x27;s worth a write</li>
            <li>I have tried many different acne products in the past and this is the first acne fighting set that I have found that not only works, but gives great and lasting results.</li>
            <li>However the younger daughter follows the directions exactly and she has rarely a breakout.  </li>
            <li>So i reverted to just trying to keep my skin clean and putting topical solutions on blemishes which appeared.  </li>
            <li>I was hesitant to believe that a system could actually help my situation, since I was striking out left and right, but I was very pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>I was so hesitant buying this product because I know for a fact a lot of the reviews on here are a straight out scam, from people the company hired to give their product high stars.</li>
            <li>The system tells you to first wash with the cleanser, then apply the clearing tonic with just your fingers (I use a cotton pad as lightly as possible since the liquid just slips right through my fingers), then apply the acne treatment serum in the morning.</li>
            <li>I had to change my diet and get my omega 6 and 3 ratio in line (more fish, less sugar / carbs)... which really helped.</li>
            <li>I liked the idea of it because of the natural remedies combined with the typical treatments.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still oily but my pores are smaller, my face is softer and smoother and when I do get a breakout, I don&#x27;t feel the need to pick at it as much because this product clears it up quickly.  </li>
            <li>My skin is combination, but more on the dry side, &amp; sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I am not completely acne free at the moment, but I have seen a lot of improvements.</li>
            <li>It made my skin extremely oily and break out more than normal.</li>
            <li>All the Exposed products I have used have a really nice quality feel, and do not cause excessive dryness.</li>
            <li>I have tried everything short of going to the dermotologist for a full on treatment.</li>
            <li>And although I have never had full on acne I have definitely suffered from those nagging episodic breakouts that seemed to come from nowhere.  </li>
            <li>It is also true that your skin can eventually get used to a product and suddenly it no longer works for you.  </li>
            <li>Exposed is the first acne treatment system to completely get rid of acne.</li>
            <li>I had a face full of red irritated heaps of acne.</li>
            <li>On the up side, it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out like most skin care products and is more natural than previous ones I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li>This product works, my teen daughter had tried other products with little results, this one has cleared up her skin wonderfully.</li>
            <li>I tried many other products - I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I found this kit that sounded pretty promising since they give you not only a 30 day money back guarantee but a whole year!!!</li>
            <li>I bought this product feeling a bit sceptical due to the high price, but after a month a have to say my acne is significantly reduced and my scars are fading!</li>
            <li>I also love that it does not bleach my clothes like a brand I previously used.</li>
            <li>Additionally when less pimples appear I stop touching my face, which is the biggest issue causing my acne.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through cheapo in store products (too many to name) and some of the more expensive products:</li>
            <li>I like the expanded kit particularly because it comes with the moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>and it left my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After only 4 months, my face isn&#x27;t 100% clear, but I feel comfortable leaving the house without makeup</li>
            <li>I also tried Retin-A - but that just ended up burning my skin and causing big red patches all over it making me even more of a monster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I mainly had acne because I work in a kitchen so every time I used this kit</li>
            <li>This is one main reason for why I use exposed.</li>
            <li>(this is the main acne product I believe).</li>
            <li>a clean cotton fabric to GENTLY PAT dry your face.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is true that this is not clearly stated with the membership upfront, however it really should be the responsibility of the consumer to see what they are signing up for.</li>
            <li>It is more rigorous that other products I have tried but is totally worth the extra time and money to have clear skin again!!</li>
            <li>At first my face broke out a little bit more, but then after about 3 weeks it got,  and stayed clear.</li>
            <li>I researched pretty much all of the over the counter acne medications and finally went out on a whim and got Exposed even though i didn&#x27;t know too much about it.</li>
            <li>and i have very sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>On top of that the price, while it is in truth competitive with other top sellers, it is completely out of my budget especially now being recently laid</li>
            <li>His face was a mess and after 2 weeks he looked 10x better.</li>
            <li>After 2 months of using these products my acne has been clear and only once in a while get a light breakout which for my acne that&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend getting the expanded kit, it&#x27;s worth the extra couple bucks to get the full results.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>

            <li>I have tried every product out there, from drugstore buys to high end products including Proactiv, Clinique, and products from a dermatologist.</li>
            <li>Exposed is a high quality product sold by a high quality company.</li>
            <li>I have tried everything for acne, and i have been struggling with it since high school.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend to anyone with acne problems.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend anybody to give it a go.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this company and their products.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product if you have been struggling with over the counter brand.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this-</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>highly recommend the product and the company.</li>
            <li>And I would highly recommend giving it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly reccomend.</li>
            <li>I began seeing results within 2 weeks of using Exposed and while I periodically have breakouts, the serums calm them down quickly.</li>
            <li>I do have to say that other than the acne that remains and continues to come back, my face feels amazing.</li>
            <li>This product helped clear up my skin better than any other system.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin to benzoyl peroxide which most of the other products on the market contain.  </li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this product to help clear up mild to moderate acne</li>
            <li>One last thing I would like to compliment is their friendly, professional and prompt customer service.</li>
            <li>Has worked far better for me than any other product.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft, NOT dry, NOT red - just free of blemishes!  </li>
            <li>For some reason when I hit 22 I broke out with a ton of white and black heads and nothing worked to clear my usually good skin.</li>
            <li>But about 6wks after I sarted to use exposed skin my face was clear and my confidence returned!!</li>
            <li>but I use a tiny bit 1-2 times a day and am still on my first order!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using exposed for a little more than 6 months now.</li>
            <li>WOW!!</li>
            <li>The kit is advertised as a month&#x27;s supply, but I have been using this product for a little more than 5 months and have had to reorder the kit once.</li>
            <li>He committed to their regular, consistent use, and he is sold!  </li>
            <li>The formula is literally like water, and comes out too quickly (so I tend to waste a lot in the morning with quick wake-up rushes to go out).  </li>
            <li>A nice feature Exposed has is that you can have them automatically send you a new Exposed Acne Treatment system so you won&#x27;t have to ever go back on the site unless you want to order other products, which I also recommend.</li>
            <li>and I picked exposed because of the natural gentle ingredients alongside of the acne medication and proactive</li>
            <li>None of these products worked for my face, and I really felt like I would never have clear skin again.  </li>
            <li>Proactiv was very drying to my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I was so surprised, this stuff really does work.</li>
            <li>This is really working well to clear up my daughters acne.</li>
            <li>He has real oily, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>but it really does clear up almost overnight now.</li>
            <li>, I had a laugh line/wrinkle developing and I&#x27;m only 23!!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t eat chocolate, rarely eat greasy food and the only thing I drink is water.</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t write reviews but this product has been a life saver.</li>
            <li>i was completely sold when i saw there was a full 1 year money back</li>
            <li>The Exposed line of products are well worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>so many acne cleansers have, which feel as though they are having some heavy duty cleansing effect).</li>
            <li>I have combination skin and normally break out along my t-zone.  </li>
            <li>but I definitely think it is worth working into my budget.</li>
            <li>I have tried Proactiv with moderate results, Murad with some success, and every over-the-counter drugstore product on the shelves.</li>
            <li>So we will give it a few more weeks to decide how well it is working.</li>
            <li>Apparently when I ordered the first kit, I agreed to continue ordering one every 60 days.</li>
            <li>but I liked that it had natural ingredients as well as the usual salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide.</li>
            <li>I love this product because there aren&#x27;t any harsh chemicals yet</li>
            <li>I’m surewithin a few more weeks</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally write reviews</li>
            <li>2 years ago, Exposed success rate was only 90%, and now its 98%!!!</li>
            <li>Proactiv was too harsh on my skin, but this Acne Treatment worked phenomenally.</li>
            <li>After discontinuing use, my face has returned to normal after ~30 hours.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve seen each other in person a few times since that trip and each time I stare at her in AW as it is so amazing to see such a clear and healthy face.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have nearly as many blackheads or red, dry areas.  </li>
            <li>About half would clear up my skin most the way or reduce the amount of acne I had</li>
            <li>This seemed to have more natural ingredients that were less drying on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I USED TO WEAR A HEAVY OIL FREE FOUNDATION TO ATTEMPT TO COVER MY IMPERFECTIONS, BUT NOW HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CHANGE TO A LIGHTER PRODUCT DUE</li>
            <li>The acne seems to come right back as soon as we stop using it.</li>
            <li>I just apply on my left and right cheek.</li>
            <li>If I run out of product my face goes right back to where it was</li>
            <li>Ok so I was a little sceptical when I first bought this, so I only bought the travel kit to start off with.  </li>
            <li>It mostly flared up once a month, but was getting steadily worse (which is weird because I am an adult and used to have perfect skin).</li>
            <li>Now in my early 30&#x27;s I still struggle with acne, but my skin is super sensitive so it is difficult to find a product that is gentle and effective.</li>
            <li>That being said I do have very sensitive skin, but exposed definitely wasn&#x27;t right for me.</li>
            <li>After Week 2, I noticed a definite improvement in my skin&#x27;s tone and texture, and that one of the persistent cysts on my chin was more apparent, but felt smaller.</li>
            <li>I thought my skin would clear up, or look a little better if I didn&#x27;t wear makeup for a couple days.</li>
            <li>I still give it a full 5 stars because no other product I have tried to date comes even close to providing the same result.</li>
            <li>and I woke up to a very bright red, itchy, angry face.</li>
            <li>I decided it was time to switch to something new.</li>
            <li>I had brought with me new bottles of everything for the trip, thank God.  </li>
            <li>However, I am still getting new acne to pop up on my face.</li>
            <li>The new flare ups could be my fault which is why I gave this product a 4 and not a 3.</li>
            <li>Live and Learn.</li>
            <li>So I decided to try something new since Proactiv was just not getting the job done anymore.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a new skin care line.  </li>
            <li>and I had forgotten to reorder a new batch for her and the acne returned.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s like my skin can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>So I found myself having to purchase additional cleanser and toner before the new kit arrives in 60 days.</li>
            <li>Automatic re-delivery of a new Exposed Acne Kit</li>
            <li>I then tried Proactive Plus for about 90 days, because that was new advertised great product, but that only made my acne worse.  </li>
            <li>I had such high hopes but I&#x27;m going back to my original idea.</li>
            <li>Within 2 weeks of her using this product as directed, I could already tell a huge improvement as the acne was getting smaller and wasn&#x27;t quite as red.  </li>
            <li>I have used everything from the cheap over the counter acne treatments to pro active and prescription benzoyl peroxide washes.</li>
            <li>I am 34 years old, I&#x27;ve had mild to moderate acne since my early teens.</li>
            <li>(because, honestly, I don&#x27;t think it could&#x27;ve gotten any worse) but eventually (after about 8 weeks of use) it did get SO MUCH</li>
            <li>You can also send in your empty bottles of your old treatment that didn&#x27;t work for credits and free products.</li>
            <li>I finally got curious and did a google search for better options a month ago.  </li>
            <li>The products last approximately 1 1/2 months so its a great value as well.  </li>
            <li>I really believe the key is the whole system, INCLUDING the pro-biotic.  </li>
            <li>I sure wish I would have found it sooner because within a few days of using it my face was completely clear.  </li>
            <li>In fact, if I remain patient, in a few more months I think there will be enough improvement for me to feel confident enough to drop my concealer from my daily routine.</li>
            <li>Thankfully Exposed made an effective acne product that doesn&#x27;t leave me red and flaky, even after a few months of</li>
            <li>There have been a couple of times I considered switching to a different systems, just to try something new, and I have ALWAYS regretted it!!!</li>
            <li>first two weeks I did have a little bit of a breakout - but it was a quick one, and their website said it would happen.</li>
            <li>I have tried every single acne product on the market from ProActiv to Clean &amp; Clear (</li>
            <li>It is very refreshing, but definitely has a bit of a sting at first, but at least you know it&#x27;s working!</li>
            <li>Very natural and plant-like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft and feels well taken care</li>
            <li>product is very gentle and doesn&#x27;t leave you all red and flaky in an attempt to stop pimples</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have VERY sensitive skin</li>
            <li>As a disclaimer, I do have very sensitive skin, so this may not be the case for everyone.</li>
            <li>and she let me know that politely and very professionally.</li>
            <li>I had noticeable results within 10 days and within a month my skin was clear!</li>
            <li>I usually do not write reviews.</li>
            <li>but wow!</li>
            <li>I have tried many different kinds of facial treatment products and this is the only one I have found that does not leave my face feeling oily.</li>
            <li>After using Exposed for one month my skin completely cleared!</li>
            <li>I used to not be able to open my mouth or widen my eyes without my skin searing in pain due to the acne.</li>
            <li>&amp; I have really sensitive skin!  </li>
            <li>and WOW!</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin soft and GLOWING!</li>
            <li>The only one that sort of worked was the Body Shop, but it just wasn&#x27;t consistent and only seemed to make my acne go away faster instead of preventing it from cropping up in the first place.</li>
            <li>First of all, let me begin by saying that I tried tons of different products for my stubborn acne.</li>
            <li>First I noticed that as the breakouts were going thru their cycle, the healing was different.  </li>
            <li>I gave her the products I was used to using normally (Cleanser, Towel, Tonic, Acne Serum, Clear Pore Serum and weekly mask).  </li>
            <li>I wish amazon provided customer satisfaction or a refund with such important issues, such as clear skin.</li>
            <li>I have a hormonal imbalance that causes the acne, as well as many other symptoms, from PCOS, so I believed I would have acne my entire life.</li>
            <li>After two months, my skin completely cleared up!</li>
            <li>And this is going on my 3rd week and it is already helping so much!</li>
            <li>Who cares if Proactiv made my skin baby butt soft--it didn&#x27;t stop my adult acne!  </li>
            <li>This kit has cleared up my teen&#x27;s acne better than any other product we have tried.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many products in the past and either got no results</li>
            <li>I am getting married next month</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other products tried with no luck: Clearasil, Stridex, Oxy, ProActiv, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Product tried with minor success: Neutrogena Oil-fee Acne Wash</li>
            <li>but your old acne products!</li>
            <li>I do not find it necessary to order the expanded kit, however it may be recommended for the first time.</li>
            <li>I began the system in the morning, following the instructions exactly.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve tried everything else and nothing has worked, give Exposed a try before going to more extreme treatments such as oral meds or surgery.</li>
            <li>Within the first week his breakouts started to lessen and within the second week they disappeared.</li>
            <li>Prior to using this product, I was using another very well-know, very celebrity-endorsed, well advertised acne system for over a year, but I never got the clear skin it promised.  </li>
            <li>You have be consistent with it, you have to be willing to make other changes (diet, water, etc.)</li>
            <li>Since I tried the product first it was obviously opened.</li>
            <li>After the first two months my skin started looking different.</li>
            <li>One thing I&#x27;ve also noticed is that when I take a shower with the product on my face that it makes my face really red, irritated, and hot.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m in my early twenties and was worried this acne would never go away!</li>
            <li>maybe starting with a doctor&#x27;s opinion first would have saved me from looking like a circus clown.</li>
            <li>I am still using the first products that I bought in January, so the products last 4-5 months.</li>
            <li>washing your face GENTLY use your bare hands while using cool/warm water.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not sure what will happen to my skin if I run out and don&#x27;t buy more, which is a bummer, but for now I am hooked.</li>
            <li>I do have the intention of cancelling my account after I receive my first order and if I like it, sign back up.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Honestly, it&#x27;s not the main ingredients like Benzoyl Peroxide or Salicylic Acid that make the product this good, it&#x27;s the other natural ingredients like their extracts that really mix well together.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve always used clean and clear and Avon acne products and a few natural products, nothing really consistently worked.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m sure ill be able to have clear skin by next kit.</li>
            <li>I have tried proactive (the old one and the new one).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an amazing product, I use it everyday and it lasts me as long as it should.</li>
            <li>My skin is pretty clear now except for the occasional outbreak and some fading scars so if your thinking about I say give it a try</li>
            <li>I missed out on so much during that time just trying to avoid anything social where I had to show my face.</li>
            <li>I purchased the kit directly from exposed, and I noticed a charge on my bank account for a second kit 3 months after paying for the first.</li>
            <li>It might be a reaction with the direct constant hot water.</li>
            <li>So if your down and have tried many products i personally stand by this product.</li>
            <li>My older daughter, having a slightly darker complexion, has even experienced bleaching, actual white patches on her face, from some of the more expensive of these products.     </li>
            <li>when you use this product, make sure you have a regular facial to clean your face since what this product does is to clear all the black heads and white heads.  </li>
            <li>I only hope my positive results continue, time will tell</li>
            <li>I decided to buy exposed after seeing all the positive customer reviews and their money back guarantee.</li>
            <li>and when you follow the routine, your skin will be clear and soft within 2 weeks tops!</li>
            <li>currently finishing my first kit and my skin remains completely clear and the scars are almost completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But Wow was I surprised!</li>
            <li>I was a little nervous to try this product because the reviews seemed too good to be true, but this product seriously works!</li>
            <li>I continued to notice improvement, less and less new pimples, and when I wouldget new ones, they would definitely go away more quickly than before.</li>
            <li>Since benzoyl peroxide started to irritate my skin I had to cancel an acne treatment that worked really well and switched to using those with salicylic acid, which does very little to clean my acne.</li>
            <li>I did not have chronic outbreaks, but always had 1-3 large red ones I had to hide with makeup.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the towel much because its not as smooth as I expected it to be and not long lasting</li>
            <li>price is a little on the high side for me, especially as I also have to pay higher postage fees to have it shipped to the UK, but I consider it absolutely worth it for the results I have had.</li>
            <li>/&gt;She was extremely prompt and quick to reply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make my skin dry like most other products do</li>
            <li>My skin has never been so clear and</li>
            <li>my face feels clean and soft with noticeably less oil and my blemishes are scabbing up and healing.</li>
            <li>I tried this after trying Philosophy Clear days ahead line and also tried Dermalogica...</li>
            <li>They also never claim that you will have 100% clear skin, with no breakouts.</li>
            <li>Even my friends have commented about how clear my skin has looked.  </li>
            <li>My skin has not yet shown improvement, but I am hopeful it will eventually clear up.</li>
            <li>After a week my skin was completely clear of pimples and blackheads.</li>
            <li>Amazon uses images throughout the product pages that clearly indicate the product is backed by a one year guarantee.  </li>
            <li>Combination of these products keep my skin clear, no peeling.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything you can think of to try to clear my skin up and nothing worked until I found this.</li>
            <li>Clear skin?</li>
            <li>I chuckle every time I put on the Clear Pore Serum because it reminds me of the smell of salad dressing, but the odor is gone once it dries.  </li>
            <li>and so have tried just about every product out there to clear up my skin.</li>
            <li>AND MY SKIN WAS CLEAR IN 2 WEEKS.  </li>
            <li>My skin was amazingly clear until around the age of 16-17, when I began to get spots.  </li>
            <li>I bought the starter kit with the cleanser, toner, acne treatment, clear pore serum, and moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I just wish the core clear serium wasn&#x27;t so sticky.</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d never have clear skin again, but this kit changed all of that.</li>
            <li>Dont trust the gurantee that it gives you clear skin in 30 days.</li>
            <li>Clearly that is a lie.</li>
            <li>2 weeks, my face was completely clear, and I was seeing siome improvement in the look of the acne scars.</li>
            <li>Acne Treatment Serum during the day &amp; Clear Pore Serum at night.</li>
            <li>My face and chest have never been so clear.</li>
            <li>I followed the kit instructions and my face was clear in 5 weeks.  </li>
            <li>I had clear skin before that</li>
            <li>Lets be clear..</li>
            <li>BAM clear skin.</li>
            <li>My son started using this and his skin was clear in days.</li>
            <li>every 60 days, so you are never without clear skin.</li>
            <li>just wow.</li>
            <li>Proactiv was not effective nor did it make my skin feel healthy.</li>
            <li>The products are gentle on the skin and the results are obvious.</li>
            <li>My 13 year old daughter now uses the products as well.  </li>
            <li>I totally recommend the whole kit.</li>
            <li>My daughter has sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Exposed Expanded kit for my teenage daughter after doing much research.  </li>
            <li>I decided to start using this product because it&#x27;s natural</li>
            <li>Thanks Exposed for giving relief to the teen in our home.</li>
            <li>Every now and again, my 21 yr old has a breakout and uses Exposed Skincare products to treat until it goes away.</li>
            <li>I am 18 years old and have tried everything to get rid of my acne.</li>
            <li>I used to get up early</li>
            <li>Even washing it gently with my hands would leave it red, patchy, and swollen.</li>
            <li>I purchased this item directly from the Exposed website.</li>
            <li>I have sufferred from acne since i was 16 yrs old</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft, is glowing, and is clear.</li>
            <li>But the natural way was the way I wanted to go</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve battled with acne since I was 11 years old -</li>
            <li>they do irritate my sensitive skin, but I&#x27;ve found how to use them so it suits my skin.  </li>
            <li>....it&#x27;s cleared up my skin and completely evened out my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>At 35 years old I was mortified when I started having adult acne.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and proactive</li>
            <li>I had tried antibiotics and Proactive but neither worked, I was completely astounded when I saw my skin this clear.  </li>
            <li>My skin is soft, supple, non-greasy, and almost blemish-free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product completely reversed my skin, my acne scars are gone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Proactiv twice with no results, almost all of Neutrogena&#x27;s line, Biore, Phisoderm, even an all natural witch hazel beauty bar.</li>
            <li>I was very dubious of the supposed effectiveness of their treatment, especially since it was structured like Proactiv and that hadn&#x27;t worked.</li>
            <li>I cook frequently, so I know what sage smells like</li>
            <li>I am in my early 40&#x27;s and had struggled with adult acne.  </li>
            <li>As a woman in my early 40s I&#x27;ve kept adult acne at bay for just over 10 years.</li>
            <li>I have been using exposed acne treatments for 6 months and have noticed a considerable difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>wow.</li>
            <li>I bought this after suffering months of adult acne on my chin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve battled skin issues as an adult for over a decade</li>
            <li>PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT FOR MY 17 YEAR OLD SON, WHO HAD SEVERE ACNE.</li>
            <li>I have battled with adult acne for 15 years.</li>
            <li>I use the complete Exposed system including the microdermabrasion scrub and mask.</li>
            <li>I have seen a marked improvement in my skin tone and clarity.</li>
            <li>I really like that there are different products for treating acne and for shrinking pores.</li>
            <li>I used them for at least 3 months or more, because I know all the treatments will need time to \\&quot;heal up\\&quot; the skin.</li>
            <li>But Exposed Skin Care system has made my face much clearer than before after about several weeks of use.</li>
            <li>I have PCOS and began breaking out at 10 years old.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this works for me.  </li>
            <li>They have been very flexible when I needed to swap out a different item in my kits or change the shipping dates.  </li>
            <li>My pores look tighter and the scars are reduced quite considerably reduced.  </li>
            <li>I had 2 existing blackheads when I started applying the product and within 3 days they were completely invisible.  </li>
            <li>I am now 29 years old and wish i could have found this product sooner.</li>
            <li>I have tried proactive, every over the counter products, natural remedies, and prescriptions.</li>
            <li>and it felt soft.</li>
            <li>I have an extremely sensitive and oily skin...</li>
            <li>I have suffered with problem skin since I was a teenager, and have tried nearly every product on the market.  </li>
            <li>I am 22 years old</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it since early 2014.  </li>
            <li>I nearly didn&#x27;t buy Exposed because some reviewers indicated they thought the reviews were staged.</li>
            <li>I began struggling with adult cystic acne.  </li>
            <li>My advise is if you have allergies or sensitive skin might be to find another product.</li>
            <li>Then I went all natural with tea tree oil, castile soap, and shea butter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 33 years old.  </li>
            <li>Then I stumbled across exposed products on line early 2006</li>
            <li>fact is I applied product morning and evening as instructed and it has showed considerable results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve actually had a couple of compliments on my skin - one noticing that it looked so much clearer</li>
            <li>It has been well worth the expense as I now have a clear neck and back with only occassional breakouts.</li>
            <li>The product is not overdrying and the smell has a natural herb like scent to it.</li>
            <li>I tried multiple product and nothing would work very well at all.</li>
            <li>None of them work nearly as well as Exposed.</li>
            <li>I have now been using Exposed for almost six months and my acne has done a complete turn-around.  </li>
            <li>It said guaranteed clear skin in one month and that didn&#x27;t work for me so far.</li>
            <li>up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I researched and researched acne treatments, natural remedies, changed my diet, etc.</li>
            <li>or \\&quot;we are busy now and will call you back\\</li>
            <li>I wanted to try these products because of the natural ingredients and beneficial age fighting products.</li>
            <li>Fast and simple shipping of reorder products.</li>
            <li>My 14 year old son&#x27;s face was covered with acne....</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t realise we had signed up for monthly deliveries with debits automatically going from our account, these turned out to be rather erratic and too frequent.  </li>
            <li>Started in my teens and continued to my adult years.</li>
            <li>I was afflicted with adult acne in my early twenties.</li>
            <li>I also suggest using sensitive skin type SPF face lotion and SPF eye cream in conjunction with the products as they do not contain ingredients that will protect you from the sun.</li>
            <li>I bought a kit to treat frequent breakouts.  </li>
            <li>but it hasn&#x27;t completely cleared up yet.</li>
            <li>: It&#x27;s completely up to you.</li>
            <li>my skin has completely cleared up as well as the blotchiness is now gone.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone</li>
            <li>Switching to Exposed has not only saved me but also, given me back the smile i wanted on my face.  </li>
            <li>I think the formula needs to have a bit more substance, or else it&#x27;s a potential waste of money.&lt;br</li>
            <li>tried so many different acne treatments, majority of the dried my skin</li>
            <li>Although the product is relatively expensive, it is worth it to me to have healthy skin.</li>
            <li>As a guy who has struggled with acne and oily skin throughout my teens and 20s, I&#x27;ve tried tons of products out there with minimal success.  </li>
            <li>The thing that made me skeptical about this site before is that I couldn&#x27;t have made the transfer using PayPal, however seeing that Google verification was available (which I personally trust with loyalty, if you don&#x27;t feel comfortable about the lack of security other than Google, that is completely fine)</li>
            <li>I have used other skin care products of this genre but they always dry out my skin pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin so smooth and even less breakouts!</li>
            <li>it is a little pricy, but worth it!</li>
            <li>If they do, it&#x27;s very mild and usually earthy smelling, like the sage and pumpkin.</li>
            <li>Clean and clear dried me out, proactiv made my skin scaly and sensitive.</li>
            <li>I still have a few minor (manageable) break outs, but at least my skin is more clear and feels healthy.</li>
            <li>I had mild acne and dark spots.</li>
            <li>Exposed Acne Treatment improved the appearance of my complexion without irritating it and drying it off  since the products have natural ingredients that leave my skin feeling fresh and clean every time.</li>
            <li>It seems as though every time I get a new shipment or a new package/bottle of it the consistency is different.</li>
            <li>I tried the Neutrogena acne kit which just left me with super dry and oily skin.  </li>
            <li>A little goes a LONG way : )    </li>
            <li>The Clear Pore and Acne Treatment serum&#x27;s work exactly as they should, and the moisturizer works miracles, especially during the initial adjustment period.</li>
            <li>Within just a few weeks of using the product, my son&#x27;s face began clearing up significantly.</li>
            <li>Most skin care programs will warn you that it usually gets worse before it gets better.</li>
            <li>I can probably switch down to the basic kit and it will still be fine.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this for anyone especially those that feel like they have lost hope in finding something that will clear up their skin.</li>
            <li>I have tried expensive products, cheap products and everything in between for my adult acne with super sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend their products especially to those are having adult acne problem.    </li>
            <li>and I finally found a skin care line that made my skin better, not only helped keep it clear but also MUCH less oily</li>
            <li>I am a 30 year old female who has struggled with mild to moderate acne for the last 15 years.</li>
            <li>I am a 42-year -old female and I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Not only has it cleared up my skin, (without leaving it dry and flakey), it&#x27;s also relatively inexpensive and they have fantastic customer service...</li>
            <li>with 28 years of age I can finally enjoy having a ´normal´ clear skin, and that happened after only month and half of using.</li>
            <li>Besides those big acnes, I also had many small pimples.</li>
            <li>My face not only is still exactly the same</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t get a perfect result from it, but it contains the worst problems pretty well.</li>
            <li>Fortunately I only had mild acne on my face, but severe acne on the back of my neck, as well as the rest of my back.</li>
            <li>Bacne has been a consistent problem for me for the last 15 years, I would never take my shirt off during the summer because I was embarassed by my back.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical of buying this product at first, but after reading so many customer reviews, I figured I would give it a try.</li>
            <li>About a month and a half I did begin to see mild improvements.</li>
            <li>After the first night of using it, I woke up the next morning and my face was swollen and red.</li>
            <li>It seriously work and of course like any other product just wait it for a good two weeks.  </li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone, from those who get an occasional breakout to people with severe acne.</li>
            <li>Overall, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>The high quality ingredients not only treated my acne but improved the look and feel of my skin.</li>
            <li>so highly recommend this to everyone who has acne even if it&#x27;s only because of what you do or where you work</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this facial cleansing system to anyone...</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s highly reactive, which means I don&#x27;t only get acne, but eczema as well.</li>
            <li>I had such high expectations for this product.</li>
            <li>There is no other word for it!</li>
            <li>The cleanser is easy on your skin and washes off quickly (especially with the included DermX cloth), and the tonic isn&#x27;t nearly as harsh as others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking for something gentle to provide long lasting results</li>
            <li>I have battled breakouts my whole life, and currently have moderate adult acne.</li>
            <li>/&gt;^^^It is important to note that not many people notice this, the membership notice is also noted on the bottom of their site^^^&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While I would have expected this to happen during the first week or two I did not expect this to continue to be a problem.</li>
            <li>and my skin is almost back to normal.</li>
            <li>FYI, my face skin is a combination of oily in the inner circle and normal at the outer circle of my face.</li>
            <li>After I stopped treatment it took months for my face to back to normal.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t feel like it was good enough, the product has broken the regular cycle of one spot coming up as another one goes</li>
            <li>Many other acne products left my face dry and flakey, but this Exposed system works womderfully!  </li>
            <li>As I began using it this morning after I awoke, I had already noticed some inflammation EXTREMELY CALM DOWN.</li>
            <li>so i could give my face time to calm down before i went to work.</li>
            <li>I use Exposed in conjunction with taking the Pill, which has helped calm down my skin over the years.</li>
            <li>For the last couple years (mid 30&#x27;s) other than the few occasional pimples I was in pretty good shape and didn&#x27;t have to mess with it much.</li>
            <li>I was a little intimidated by the price to begin with, but I have to say so far it&#x27;s been worth every penny.</li>
            <li>My skin is clearer, there is hardly any redness any more and my pores are smaller.</li>
            <li>Subsequently I have tried numerous products that are available on the market, however they haven&#x27;t worked, or I have had to stop using them due to incompatibility with my skin type.  </li>
            <li>This product has given him such a new outlook.</li>
            <li>In probably 5-6 weeks I had almost stopped getting new spots, so my skin was finally getting the chance to begin to heal.  </li>
            <li>I have combo skin- dry cheeks and very oily T-zone.</li>
            <li>The only negative to this product is the priceline, and if you have more than one person using it.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and the products do not dry out or irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>It is the only thing that has really seemed to make the blackheads go away &amp; make my pores look smaller.</li>
            <li>Recently however, I developed SEVERE adult acne.</li>
            <li>and I found that proactive dried my skin out too quickly.</li>
            <li>I still have small blemishes and redness but can actually notice significant improvement and haven’t had any new breakouts.</li>
            <li>I have mild to moderate acne, large pores and oily skin, with a few cysts back from my bare minerals days that I could never get rid of (the bare minerals story is a rant that I will not go into here).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin is a lot clearer and a barely get any pimples!</li>
            <li>I used to have dehydrated but oily skin, so white-head is the major problem to my skin.  </li>
            <li>My favorite is the probiotic complex, because it is just a pill and it works inside and out!</li>
            <li>Now, 5 months later his acne is completely gone!</li>
            <li>Started using this product 10 days ago and already I can see a major difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>She began using them and within a short period of maybe 2 weeks, her acne began to disappear completely!</li>
            <li>I still haven&#x27;t grown out of it and no other acne treaments worked.</li>
            <li>I now have no more spots, and although my skin is still oily, it is significantly reduced.</li>
            <li>Since I have used this product, I have not had any major breakouts.</li>
            <li>I used the Facial Cleanser every morning when I first woke up and every night before bed (on my face, neck, shoulders &amp; chest), and then I used the Clearing Tonic and would let it air dry off my face &amp; body.</li>
            <li>[...] offers an extremely long and detailed look at exposed, places ads all over its site for exposed, and then offers only short blurbs for other acne care products.</li>
            <li>Just a little info, for me personally the facial cleanser is always the first to be used so it might be worth your while stocking up two at a time, that way you won&#x27;t run short.</li>
            <li>I am a 24 year old mother that has been dealing with mild regular and cystic acne for a few years now.</li>
            <li>and I saw exposed and thought well I&#x27;ve wasted way more money on other treatments that didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been struggling with acne so long and my main motivation was that I DID NOT want acne when I was going to college.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this product for a couple days and my skin feels so soft and clean, and I can see my old acne scars starting to fade and new blemishes are shrinking slowly.</li>
            <li>The only thing I had done differently in my routine was try a new primer from Smashbox but even after I stopped using it (and got a refund!)</li>
            <li>I tried Proactiv and Dermologica products but with little success.</li>
            <li>Keeping in mind that every face works differently for different people, I am Female, 18-25, mild to moderate acne, Asian.  </li>
            <li>I had a special occasion and of course my face decided to break out a few days prior.</li>
            <li>Within just a few short weeks on the Exposed system, my face cleared right up and its been that way ever since!  </li>
            <li>While other systems have left me dry in some areas and oily in others, with Exposed my face remains shine free without over-drying.     </li>
            <li>But anything with Benzoyl Peroxide generally does bleach.      </li>
            <li>My only suggestion is to always use the cleanser, clearing tonic and clear pore serum.</li>
            <li>and my confidence is back, my skin is clear and i dont have to worry about my pimple breakouts anymore.</li>
            <li>1x a wk to prevent future breakouts - your skin will be clear.</li>
            <li>The Cleanser, Tonic, and Clear Pore Serum have all leaked out of their bottles while properly stored at room temperature, at sea level, in an upright position on a shelf in my bathroom.</li>
            <li>The red bumps receded and my chin started looking like the clear skin I used to have.  </li>
            <li>last time I had clear chin skin was when I was probably 13, I&#x27;m now</li>
            <li>was only clear until I had finished the prescription.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Every morning, I wash with the Facial Cleanser, use the Clearing Tonic, and then apply the Clear Pore Serum.  </li>
            <li>None of my regular go-to routines were working to clear up my skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not only helped to clear my acne</li>
            <li>I have tried them all and was starting to give up on clear skin</li>
            <li>Not only does it clear my skin of blemishes</li>
            <li>It kept my skin relatively clear, but I&#x27;ve had breakouts every now and then, especially when I&#x27;m stressed out.</li>
            <li>Works wonders, in 5 days I noticed my skin starting to clear up.</li>
            <li>When clearly it states M-F from 8 to 4 pm they are open.</li>
            <li>I was really hesitant to buy it, considering it was something that I hadn&#x27;t heard a whole lot about in the past, but my husband convinced me to go for it</li>
            <li>I was looking for something to help my skin fight aging and clear my occasional breakouts.</li>
            <li>I have tried everything possible to clear my acne.  </li>
            <li>After the second week my skin began to clear and the scars started to fade.</li>
            <li>By the fourth week my skin was completely clear and the scars continued to fade.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>I am 20 years old and I have tried dozens of different acne treatments.</li>
            <li>I am just an 18yr Old College Student, Male.</li>
            <li>With my 19 yr old, his face was red and some of the pimples started to turn black/blue, discoloring his skin.</li>
            <li>It is non-drying, and my adult acne is essentially gone.     </li>
            <li>I am 29 years old and after having 2 kids, my skin and I were constantly at war.</li>
            <li>If you have acne and nothing else has worked so far, definitely try Exposed!</li>
            <li>I was using bare minerals.</li>
            <li>Too much money spent when product doesnt work.</li>
            <li>Not only did I suffer with Acne, BUT I also struggle with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Not only is my face pimple free, the acne marks left on my skin from past blemishes have faded considerably.</li>
            <li>even the scars from old blemishes are starting to lighten.</li>
            <li>[...] offers a review only for exposed.</li>
            <li>Not only does it work, but it is not harsh on your skin like some others.  </li>
            <li>Although, it did not entirely clear my face as guaranteed in the 30 day period, it showed significant improvement than the last two products I&#x27;ve used (which seems to be an endless process).</li>
            <li>I completely stopped using proactiv and now only use exposed.</li>
            <li>i bought the basic kit for my 19yr old son.  </li>
            <li>people that I barely even talk to.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 29 year old male who has suffered from acne since I was an adolescent.</li>
            <li>Exposed Skin Care acne treatment has almost completely cleared up his back and face.  </li>
            <li>Now I just have to wait until the red marks fade completely</li>
            <li>Face is clearing up starting to feel soft.</li>
            <li>I developed cyst like bumps over my entire face.</li>
            <li>With how well it&#x27;s worked so far I&#x27;m definitely optimistic!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cleared all my breakouts and now I barely even get a pimple.</li>
            <li>but then either acne returned or skin became red, flaky and sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 38 year old male who has had acne of varying severity since my teens.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything...from Proactiv to Philosophy, including expensive lines like Dermologica and iS Clinical; but I&#x27;ve never had the kind of results I&#x27;ve seen with Exposed.</li>
            <li>I gave it a month and my skin became inflamed and more broken out.</li>
            <li>I am trying to dicipline myself and sticking with a consistant regiman, but with full time work, 2 small kids, a dog/puppy and a house...</li>
            <li>One of a world famous acne treatment product package also made my skin worse.</li>
            <li>After 3 months, I felt that the product had plateaued because my skin didn&#x27;t seem to be getting better, but it also wasn&#x27;t getting worse.</li>
            <li>The fact for my experience is that is did get worse for a week before it got better.</li>
            <li>Although sometimes it gets worse before it gets better</li>
            <li>For me with this problematic and stubborn acne to have inflammation to calm down in only 24 hours.....</li>
            <li>Old blemishes have totally gone away, I haven&#x27;t seen any new zits, and the pesky ones are starting to get smaller.</li>
            <li>or my skin would be dry, dull and not look healthy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using exposed now for a month but after the first two and a half weeks my skin started to clear up</li>
            <li>It was only about 4 weeks later, my skin did not have any new breakouts.</li>
            <li>I was hoping that after I got my initial acne cleared up that it would prevent new acne from coming back, but that didn&#x27;t happen.</li>
            <li>and I only very occasionally get a new spot -</li>
            <li>such she let me know that they were going to ship the new package the next day.....</li>
            <li>When your skin is clear it takes way less time to get ready in the morning</li>
            <li>Without any treatment, my face typically breaks out constantly (white heads, more apparent black spots, nodules, ect),  </li>
            <li>I even get compliments and people telling me they wished they had my skin :) i&#x27;ve never written a review before but exposed seriously deserve it!</li>
            <li>IVe had breakouts on my forehead and chin due to stress and it&#x27;s happened consistently in the last two years.</li>
            <li>For the last 10 years I have struggled with moderate acne that mainly consisted of occasional breakouts.</li>
            <li>I have oily to normal skin and was pleasantly surprised that this 6-piece kit didnt irritate my skin like other products did.</li>
            <li>In the first two weeks my skin was quite irritated but I applied only every other day to ease this off until my skin got used to it, which it did</li>
            <li>I go to a dermatologist, which in the past has helped, but I have had times where I can not go quickly</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had 2 small pimples, both of which cleared quickly.  </li>
            <li>It made my skin very smooth, but only if my skin wasn&#x27;t already broken out.  </li>
            <li>I would say I have moderate acne but no other product even compared to Exposed!</li>
            <li>But I can calm the skin down pretty quickly with this - it is the only thing I&#x27;ve ever tried that brings my skin vaguely under control, letting it heal.</li>
            <li>When I first bought a trial pack I was a bit skeptical as, the facial cleanser is so light (ie.</li>
            <li>but I kept avoiding it because it was much pricier than the other items I was trying.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really care for the other products in the line</li>
            <li>I have struggled with acne for a long time and I have never found any product or treatment system that works nearly as well as exposed!  </li>
            <li>A few warnings (And it says on the product), you will see it get worse at first before it gets better.</li>
            <li>down to the experience of it.----------------&lt;br /&gt;It comes with 4-5 products depending on if you get the moisturizer or not, which I highly recommend for clear</li>
            <li>only dislike is that if I&#x27;m not organised and forget to order the product on time I do need to wait for it to come from America to oz, but the wait time isn&#x27;t too bad, but it would be great to have the option of purchasing the product here in oz&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for 30 days and so far I have seen a noticable difference in the tecture of my skin, and my breakouts are much fewer, still a few here and there,</li>
            <li>After years of trying different OTC products &amp; prescribed medications, I have finally found something that keeps my skin clear.   </li>
            <li>Actually, I ordered the smaller, travel sized kit, that guarantees clear skin in 30 days, or money</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only going to buy the acne treatment serum, clear pore serum and clearing tonic in the future.  </li>
            <li>I have used Exposed for a few years now and it really works to keep my skin clear.</li>
            <li>I started using exposed several weeks ago and although it did take a while to get going, my skin is finally beginning to clear up</li>
            <li>I had tried EVERY professional and over the counter acne medication - both topical and internal - since I was a teenager.</li>
            <li>and I learned that not only was facial cleansing a vital part but diet as well.</li>
            <li>I am a 21 year old male who has been battling cystic acne for several years.  </li>
            <li>I am 60 years old and have been fighting menopausal (hormonal related) acne for the last 10 years!!  </li>
            <li>I no longer have drying of my skin, and where my forehead used to always have a thin layer of teeny weeny pimples, Exposed keeps my skin soft, supple, and incredibly smooth.    </li>
            <li>I had tried the popular teen choices from the magazines, an expensive one from Clinique, and even the soap-free hypoallergenic ones; they would momentarily fix my blemishes, but as I kept using them, they stopped working.</li>
            <li>My skin did not dry out at all.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Another concern is the horrible customer service and honestly how many companies can you think of that</li>
            <li>The mask does not dry out your skin.  </li>
            <li>I used to take Raouctan and my skin was always very sensitive and dry.</li>
            <li>The product was a bit drying to my skin at first, so I had to back down to once a day.  </li>
            <li>major low point).</li>
            <li>each and every reviewer on this product and all except a handful (3-5) reviewers who gave it 5 stars have no other product reviews, or if they do, it&#x27;s only stuff made by Exposed skin care.</li>
            <li>I used all other products and they had the same thing; works the first 3 weeks then back to misery.</li>
            <li>Overall, results were clear after the first few of weeks of using their products and continued with further use.</li>
            <li>I tried changing up a few things (had been using a very gentle cleanser and switched to some salicylic acid cleansers).</li>
            <li>No more flaky dry skin, discolouration and huge zits all over.</li>
            <li>Additionally black heads in general should be treated with gentle scrubbing (which the expanded kit does not offer).</li>
            <li>My face felt normal (not over dry or too oily) and I even noticed some scars starting to soften and fade (which isn&#x27;t even something that the company advertises for).</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first - now I&#x27;m a loyal convert.</li>
            <li>I found it actually quite gentle to skin, comparing it with some other products that did nothing to me except irritations.</li>
            <li>In my early 30s, I tried proactive which appeared to clear the pimples but was extremely drying for my skin</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;d been using a natural tea tree oil face wash for a long time</li>
            <li>, I am an 18 year old white female with semi-dry, flaky, sometimes red skin.</li>
            <li>Both my sister and I started ordering the &#x27;Exposed Acne Treatment - Basic kit&#x27; after proactiv failed to give the results we would have liked and we would never go back to anything else.</li>
            <li>I could feel the difference the first day and my skin after a few weeks looks like I never had any skin issues.</li>
            <li>For me, my skin got a little dry and flaky and then it started to clear after the first week.</li>
            <li>That means there are very few products I can use, since most of them are far too harsh and just leave me with eczema instead of (or as well as!)</li>
            <li>First week was not that rough, i got a few new pimples</li>
            <li>give up.i real hard lumps and scar because every thing i try would&lt;br /&gt;either burn my face or just give more ance or big ones that were</li>
            <li>My skin went from being relatively clear for the last several years to non-stop breakouts in the last several months.</li>
            <li>My older daughter is a little less likely to follow the full regime, and so she still experiences some minor issues with her skin.</li>
            <li>I have dry, and also sensitive skin, and wanted to try it out.</li>
            <li>so far working well, makes my face really dry</li>
            <li>The areas of my face that only had minor acne problems have cleared up, but I am still waiting for my chin (my biggest problem area) to clear up.</li>
            <li>Now I can make funny faces all day long and my skin just feels like skin, not a fresh flesh wound.</li>
            <li>The only trouble I had was when I first started.</li>
            <li>and I even grew more obsessive about cleaning my makeup brushes, not touching my face, and changing my pillow case every few days.</li>
            <li>consistent EVERYDAY with the facial treatment</li>
            <li>My favorite items in this line are the Derm-X Cloth which I feel gets every bit of makeup off my face at night, and the Moisture Complex that leaves my skin feeling like satin!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will post another review if not completely update this one once my skin care arrives, but before I did the research to inform myself, I was skeptical due to the numerous amount of negative comments, and you should be able to make your own informed decisions about what you are buying.&lt;br /&gt;It is not likely that this site is trying any tricks on their customers.</li>
            <li>The system calms the skin down and resolves the acne with natural ingredients and no harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>I love that it has soothing elements and only very little harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>Weeks 2 and 3 showed steady improvement, few new minor pimples and my skin started looking healthier.</li>
            <li>I generally buy this set as I think they are the most essential ones, although once they sent me the wrong item.</li>
            <li>After having at least 6-7 deep pimples consistently, my skin was basically clear in a week.  </li>
            <li>This has definitely helped clear my skin up &amp; didn&#x27;t dry my skin out like Proactiv.</li>
            <li>but so far the only thing I&#x27;ve noticed is it makes my skin dry.</li>
            <li>I have used other various products that have provided decent yet short lived results.  </li>
            <li>DUE TO THE WINTER WEATHER CAUSING EXCESSIVE DRYNESS, AND I HAVE ADDED AN OIL FREE MOISTURIZER</li>
            <li>Within 3 days, I seriously did not believe this stuff was true.  </li>
            <li>and if my input can help another exhausted acne victim i will be glad to give it.</li>
            <li>and if my input can help another exhausted acne victim i will be glad to give it.</li>
            <li>Right now Im breaking out pretty bad, but only because I have very compacted skin</li>
            <li>/&gt;The product can get a little crusty on your face throughout the day, but that might be because I&#x27;m putting to much on.</li>
            <li>Even with these little negatives, I think over all the product is really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I no longer get large painful pimples and most of the time I don&#x27;t even have to wear foundation/concealer; whereas before, I wouldn&#x27;t dream of leaving the house without foundation on.  </li>
            <li>I used to have little pimples all over my face especially on my forehead and it made me very selfconsciuos.</li>
            <li>With Exposed, less is more; I use very small amounts for it to work.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding products that actually clear my skin without completely drying it up or making it worse before it gets better.</li>
            <li>Amazingly, this unhappy practice has gone since I have been using the Exposed acne products.  </li>
            <li>I was breaking out badly until I did some research and seen all the good reviews and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>The only treatment that really worked so far, at least for me</li>
            <li>Exposed took a few weeks to clear up my skin, but my skin has been clear since.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve taken a picture of my face (almost) every day since before I started using it, and the change is remarkable.</li>
            <li> However, exposed does the trick and leaves skin hydrated/even&#x3D; perfect foundation for make-up application or simply a healthy all-natural look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m confident another month using it, my skin will be nearly perfect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products but Exposed Skin, without a doubt, works the best.</li>
            <li> I honestly have no complaints!</li>
            <li> I just backed off to washing my face once a day until I was a bit more acclimated to the system, and now I&#x27;m up to washing twice a day and everything is great!!</li>
            <li> and I will have a perfect complexion again! :)</li>
            <li> I already kind of have a baby face and the acne was not helping me look my age at all!</li>
            <li> So glad i gave it a try, works great!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 8 years and love it.. works great!!!</li>
            <li> This is easily the best product I have ever used on my skin.</li>
            <li> They were so good that I decided to try it.  </li>
            <li> It was a good choice for me.</li>
            <li> Everyone has noticed and told me how good it looks</li>
            <li> This stuff is so darn good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had good experience with the Exposed Skincare line.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not oily or anything, but it looks good.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s good with his routine now and the results are so good.  </li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels good.</li>
            <li> But nothing works as good as Exposed skin care.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin smooth and flawless with a glow.</li>
            <li> The company also gives good advice on cleaning up your diet by reducing sugar intake.</li>
            <li> your face is so smooth and glowing!&amp;#34; and that was like the best thing I&#x27;ve ever heard.</li>
            <li> Over all its a good product.</li>
            <li> and I am delighted with the results.</li>
            <li> I decided to try it and loved it.  </li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for a friend and she loved it.</li>
            <li> This is a good product.</li>
            <li> To my excitement one of the best options available Online</li>
            <li> I did an internet search for the best acne treatments available without a prescription and came across Exposed Skin Care and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s the product that makes my skin look so good.  </li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Good products.  </li>
            <li> My son gets on with these and has had good results.  </li>
            <li> Hearing good reviews I decided to try a kit and figured, why not.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this system for about three months now and my skin has never looked so flawless, hydrated, and blemish free.</li>
            <li> I had good succes with this.  </li>
            <li> wash is good, cloth</li>
            <li> Everything is just good.</li>
            <li> And one day while I was browsing on Internet about some good product for skin , i found Exposed Skin Care , I bought the skit since 4-5month now</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good stuff.</li>
            <li> This is a good product</li>
            <li> and you will for sure see good results!</li>
            <li> so so many good, even great, reviews about this product</li>
            <li> I stopped using it and switched to clinique mild soap with gel moisturizer and now it is almost perfect.</li>
            <li> I have now been a customer of Exposed Skin care products and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t experienced any over drying like with most products.  </li>
            <li> I then searched online and found many great reviews on Exposed.  </li>
            <li> After researching online for the best product, we chose Exposed-and it has worked at keeping their skin clear and beautiful for over a year.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the results of this product.</li>
            <li> After trying many products on the market and nothing was making me happy, i researched online and decided to give Exposed a try...</li>
            <li> I am a very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> The pills are great for clearing skin from the inside, and the clarifying mask is probably my favorite.</li>
            <li> Although I have a very interesting story to tell, I will not tell it because I believe people prefer shorter reviews.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am VERY pleased with this treatment medicine that Exposed Skin Care has created.</li>
            <li> The products feel good &amp; smell nice.</li>
            <li> Ordering is very easy and the smell of the products are pleasant.  </li>
            <li> Exposed worked wonderfully, for the first 2-3 months.  </li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it!</li>

            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>

            <li> Please Try it, You&#x27;ll love it!</li>

            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> and I am so pleased that I persevered!  </li>
            <li> (How many times have you fought with customer service?!?</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I love it !</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE exposed acne treatment!</li>
            <li> thank you so much!!!!!</li>
            <li> This time I decided to be smart, and I looked up \\&quot;best acne treatment</li>
            <li> I loved this treatment so much that I also bought the scrub, and the mask, which are also very good, and I recommend it to anyone who asks me about the appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> and i must confess, the results are amazing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using exposed for about 1 year now and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing</li>
            <li> everything is amazing about this product.</li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> The stuff makes your skin feel amazing.</li>
            <li> EXPOSED SKIN CARE IS TRULY AMAZING</li>
            <li> It took two days for me to see amazing results.  </li>
            <li> Also the body wash is amazing and it works.</li>
            <li> She has been using Exposed Skin Care for 6 months and her skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel amazing.</li>
            <li> Before I found this amazing kit I was using hand soap for face wash.</li>
            <li> His skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> People compliment me on my skin all the time now, it feels amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing.</li>
            <li> But the catch to the AMAZING outcome is that once you stop using it, you&#x27;ll break out again.</li>
            <li> but I saw an amazing improvement.  </li>
            <li> After that your skin will heal on its own and you&#x27;ll be happier.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product, works well.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s kind of off putting but</li>
            <li> , just make sure give whatever you try a fair chance.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s kind of off putting but</li>
            <li> , just make sure give whatever you try a fair chance.</li>
            <li> I would honestly recommend these products.  </li>
            <li> it is because Exposed has their own website for sales that is separate from amazon.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I was say that this product is a good investment (better than proactive).</li>
            <li> It is also wise to avoid touching or scratching your face throughout the day, in order to prevent the spread of bacteria.</li>
            <li> Keep up the good job:)</li>
            <li> The best thing about Exposed is how gentle yet effective it is.</li>
            <li> It honestly takes like 4 min.</li>
            <li> I also started taking birth control which cleared my skin up nicely (Loestrin24fe, for those of you women that want to maybe try that option).</li>
            <li> Ever since OBAGI recalled its Serum Gel (part of their Clenziderm M.D. kit) for crystallizing, I have not found an effective treatment to replace it with.</li>
            <li> I love EXPOSED because my skin FEELS good.  </li>
            <li> I am 47 and have always had really nice skin</li>
            <li> Hello,&lt;br /&gt;Before I used exposed skincare I had tried every kind of products but without results..</li>
            <li> I wish you all a good and healthy life.</li>
            <li> I will keep using this product, and I just hope that this continues being effective.  </li>
            <li> Also, be sure you are drinking plenty of water, getting good sleep, and eating a well balanced diet.</li>
            <li> I honestly and faithfully am using this product</li>
            <li> Most days, with a touch of good quality non-codemic mineral make-up, no-one even would know that I have acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Honestly, I have used a TON of acne products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have it automatically shipped every month</li>
            <li> Thanks Kelly for making me a happy customer!</li>
            <li> Skin feels great healthy and looks 10 times better then when I started.</li>
            <li> so I decided to seek out some kind of acne treatment.</li>
            <li> One day I kept researching for something better that would be good for my skin and came upon Exposed Skin Care.</li>
            <li> Probably zero, and if anything more, it is probably too good to be true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was so refreshing, surprising even, after my wars with proactiv.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything from 20 to 500 dollars and exposed skin care is the best and most consistent acne treatment out there.</li>
            <li> My boys love it, it works great, and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I feel so much more beautiful and clean.</li>
            <li> For sure this product is very good and is worth buying.</li>
            <li> I think this is my new best friend.</li>
            <li> All the products in the Kit are amazing and effective, but I particularly love the cleanser, the acne serum, and the moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I was ready to buy ProActiv (the name I seemed to hear most often), until I did a Google search for the best product.  </li>
            <li> Exposed is the best by far!</li>
            <li> I am glad to say with the help of Exposed, I have been acne free for over a year!!</li>
            <li> :) I am an extremely satisfied, and thankful customer that&#x27;s not going anywhere!    </li>
            <li> After my first three month supply came in, I loved the immediate results!</li>
            <li> My skin is really much much better and healthy again!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so much more confident now in my life!</li>
            <li> let&#x27;s give it one more try, and I am so glad I did!</li>
            <li> But overall customer service was great and product is good!</li>
            <li> Best acne treatment I&#x27;ve tried so far</li>
            <li> It is clear and my skin looks great!  </li>
            <li> and I can honestly say it works better than anything else I have tried.  </li>
            <li> Exposed is by far the best acne treatment I have ever seen.     </li>
            <li> So what more can I say, this is just an honest review of my experience with this company and their expanded kit.</li>
            <li> and this is by far and away the best I have found!</li>
            <li> Exposed is by far the best acne treatment out there!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best.</li>
            <li> The Exposed Acne treating system is, by far, the best system I have ever used.</li>
            <li> My skin is clear and best of all</li>
            <li> This product so far is the best one that I&#x27;ve used for acne problem.</li>
            <li> Best results so far.  </li>
            <li> So far it aint perfect</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Exposed Skin Care for about 2 months now and so far it is the best product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> it seems like a kind of thing you should be able to take care of online, but I couldn&#x27;t find how.</li>
            <li> I now have clear skin that feels and looks great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s affordable and easy to use!  </li>
            <li> Love love love Exposed!</li>
            <li> :) i can finally smile and be proud of my skin.</li>
            <li> The customer service department is also great and has always allowed me to make substitutions in my kits at no extra charge, which is great if you find yourself running out of one item and having a surplus on another all the time.</li>
            <li> The first time i started using it, My face cleared up beautifully but however as has been my experience with most acne products that have worked for me, I started to break out again in about a yr</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE Exposed - by far the best face care line I have used!</li>
            <li> That was pretty impressive, no TV marketing, no &amp;#34;celebrity endorsements&amp;#34; just a loyal customer spreading the word.  </li>
            <li> in light of how many products we have tried and how much it has cost over the years), and again, the best part:  THE PRODUCTS WORK!!!    </li>
            <li> I had lost all hope that my skin would ever be beautiful, but thanks to Exposed</li>
            <li> though I&#x27;d give Exposed Skin Care a try as I&#x27;ve read great stuff about them, you don&#x27;t need me to tell you that this stuff really works!</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions and used them consistently for a month and saw great improvement.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m convinced it&#x27;s too good to be true and keep waiting for a break-out, but I have yet to see one.  </li>
            <li> I have found that Exposed is very gentle to my skin but also very effective.</li>
            <li> I feel very fortunate to have found a product that works.  </li>
            <li> Now for the first time I am getting so many compliments about how great my skin looks and that my skin is glowing.</li>
            <li> My skin does not dry out, it doesn&#x27;t get or oily, it is perfect!</li>
            <li> I had beautiful skin until I was a senior in high school.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t had a break out in over a month, which is a huge milestone for me!</li>
            <li> This company should be sending me a thank you for spending literally hundreds of dollars :)</li>
            <li> No matter what though, somehow this product works for my skin better than anything I have tried.  </li>
            <li> Overall GREAT!!!</li>
            <li> My skin is noticeably clearer and as healthy as I can ever remember.</li>
            <li> I have had many friends compliment me on how healthy my skin looks.</li>
            <li> My face has never looked better.  </li>
            <li> My favorite product is the cleanser.</li>
            <li> After 30 days my skin looked WAyyyyyyyyyyyy better, but after 60 days my acne was gone.</li>
            <li> You may find that some of the products work better then others for your skin.</li>
            <li> and you just feel better about yourself.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> but it kept breaking out even more than it was before using Exposed.  </li>
            <li> and I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> My skin feels smoother and I feel more confident in my appearance.</li>
            <li> And her acne has not gotten better.  </li>
            <li> She eats healthy, drinks lots of water...</li>
            <li> Better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried, would recommend it to anyone no matter your skin type.</li>
            <li> We realize that some products work better than others depending on the type of skin you may have.</li>
            <li> After a week, I was in love.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now and still love it.</li>
            <li> Seriously love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have been using Exposed skincare for more than 3 years.  </li>
            <li> I was pleased that I wanted to write this review.</li>
            <li> I have never gotten better results than I did with exposed.</li>
            <li> i would get a lovely breakout.</li>
            <li> It got better.</li>
            <li> but as I got closer to 40, the more severe it seemed to become.  </li>
            <li> Fact of the matter is, most of these products just don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I love it, as well.</li>
            <li> And drink your water :)</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s because they were already there to begin with</li>
            <li> I started breaking out with many cystic zits.</li>
            <li> I started using this product a couple of years ago, and I am totally pleased with the results I have recieved from using Exposed.</li>
            <li> They worked okay for a while, but it took a toll on my skin.</li>
            <li> After trying Exposed, I have been able to stop taking my prescribed medication and my face looks better than ever.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love the products.  </li>
            <li> I am glad that I have found this line of products because I have struggled with skin issues since pre-teen stage</li>
            <li> I love the botanicals in the products -</li>
            <li> I did not find the moisturizer to be better than store-bought brands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year now and am really glad I found it.      </li>
            <li> but I love Exposed</li>
            <li> You can get better and cheaper med by prescription.</li>
            <li> Better than it has in years.  </li>
            <li> Mostly around my chin and some on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> , it took about 8 weeks for my face to start getting better.</li>
            <li> And most of all, MY FACE DOESN&#x27;T HURT ANYMORE.</li>
            <li> I love the caffeine and pumpkin extract in the mositurizer.</li>
            <li> To my surprise, Exposed Skin Care popped up on almost every site with either a number one rating, or listed in the top five.</li>
            <li> And the Derm X cloth is PRICELESS for it&#x27;s ability to open pores and polish your skin.    </li>
            <li> But really, that&#x27;s insignificant in comparison to how happy I am to have found Exposed</li>
            <li> I eat healthy and I drink plenty of water.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t until i searched the internet for the top acne treatment.</li>
            <li> even better?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just lovely.</li>
            <li> Bonus, I even love the smell of the products.</li>
            <li> so I can stare at my skin some more,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve read that before just like I had.</li>
            <li> and I love their products and customer service.</li>
            <li> Love it, but now it says i cant ship to Norway</li>
            <li> It has worked better than any of the prescription creams I tried.</li>
            <li> I love this product and would recommend to any of my friends or family.  </li>
            <li> 5 out of 5 for sure.</li>
            <li> My skin is a lot better now.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used so many acne treatment out there</li>
            <li> It is definetly a better product.</li>
            <li> I did more research on the internet and found out about Exposed.</li>
            <li> how many days you want in between shipments.</li>
            <li> My skin is so healthy now.</li>
            <li> I have used many products during my lifetime (Proactive, etc.), but NONE of them ever worked.  </li>
            <li> It has worked better than any product I have ever used before.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t recommend this more.</li>
            <li> I love those products, better then anything else.</li>
            <li> I have tried all over the counter products available and Exposed Acne Treatment has been by far the best I have  ever used.  </li>
            <li> Which many of these products would burn and peel my face.  </li>
            <li> By day 5 we noticed more healing and clearing.  </li>
            <li> The Exposed Skin Care system is a great skin care line that has really helped to control the oil in my skin and prevent the breakouts that I&#x27;ve been accustomed to for years.  </li>
            <li> , she had way more severe acne than I do, and she recommended I get it</li>
            <li> I have used benzoyl peroxide acne fighters (mostly proactiv) for years.</li>
            <li> I have had better luck with over the counter acne medicines.</li>
            <li> but it is a TON better.</li>
            <li> eat healthy, drink more water.</li>
            <li> They look, feel, and smell more like spa products than medicated treatments.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I have been very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Many people swear by proactive</li>
            <li> and it has been outstanding.</li>
            <li> I have been using these products for almost a year now and love it.</li>
            <li> LOVE.</li>
            <li> My skin even continued to have breakouts and was more irrateds than before.</li>
            <li> I have tried more acne products than I can count, ever since I was 12 - Proactiv, Murad, over-the-counter brands - and even medication including Accutane.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Exposed.</li>
            <li> Most acne treatment is trial and error in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I used it for more than 2 months.</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> : I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now and all I can say is its fantastic!</li>
            <li> I never ever in a million years thought I would be able to walk out of my house without makeup and feel confident about my skin.</li>
            <li> and I actually felt confident and beautiful!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff...</li>
            <li> and then you will see fabulous results!</li>
            <li> I remember there being a moment where i touched my face and couldn&#x27;t find one area that felt smooth!</li>
            <li> And since then, I&#x27;ve been hooked and I gladly recommend this to all of my friends.</li>
            <li> I have battled cystic acne for so many years.</li>
            <li> Now after 4 months my face is 100% better.  </li>
            <li> I love Exposed Acne treatment.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;I am pleased to report that the gamble paid off...  </li>
            <li> I promise it will work, and you will love it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get any more acne</li>
            <li> I do love the moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many over the counter products and nothing seemed to work.</li>
            <li> They have been using it for over 6 months and it controls their acne and keeps their skin healthy and glowing.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li> All the red marks I had have faded and my skin LOOKS and FEELS great!</li>
            <li> and I was now even more embarrassed to be out in public.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> I tried many things.</li>
            <li> He lived with it thinking it would get better.</li>
            <li> Thank you exposed for developing such a wonderful product.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> Ok so I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month now by about two weeks.</li>
            <li> Love the moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The skin on my nose is so much better</li>
            <li> it seems like they&#x27;re getting better after using the mask and scrub</li>
            <li> top it all off, as a member Exposed</li>
            <li> product looks healthy in the bottles (not some toxic acne med</li>
            <li> and I feel my skin has better even tone to it</li>
            <li> For years I have been able to keep it under control</li>
            <li> I LOVE</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been happier with my skin:)</li>
            <li> i had have them removie  and got more scars.i</li>
            <li> brought one more</li>
            <li> and they are satisfied too.</li>
            <li> but I love it.  </li>
            <li> I am using Exposed Skin care for more than 1 year</li>
            <li> the more I use these products.</li>
            <li> This product is much better than Proactive.  </li>
            <li> I would consider this product better than ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Interestingly, my face doesn&#x27;t irritate with exposed as it uses both benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love that this kit comes with the moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Most of my whitehead pimples are gone, but my blackheads are still an issue.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting more of a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I consider myself as the 1% who understands the causes of acne and its treatments better than most.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using exposed for more than 2 years.</li>
            <li> Why is exposed better?</li>
            <li> There is more details on their website.</li>
            <li> but it also smooths out my skin, which makes my face look even better.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> , I try the leading brand and didn&#x27;t work for me, once I purchased this product my skin looks healthy.</li>
            <li> and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I have already reccommeneded this set to three of my friends and they love it as well.</li>
            <li> This product however is gentle , my skin feels great.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s way more to it than just dirt, oil, and hormonal imbalance.   :)</li>
            <li> plan to continue buying Exposed products :)</li>
            <li> I am so glad we discovered this product.</li>
            <li> And I have tried so many products.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products out there from Proactive to Skin Id to Murad...</li>
            <li> and I just Love these skin care products.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m probably not going to re-purchase this product, unless some magical event happens and my face clears up.</li>
            <li> This is the best acne product I have ever used and the only one that has worked for me.</li>
            <li> I think it works better on my son than it did on my daughter.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this acne kit.</li>
            <li> The results I have from this product are better than I have ever seen before.</li>
            <li> This product is okay.  </li>
            <li> She started using the system and within a week her face was looking so much better.  </li>
            <li> It is in a very generic bottle but is great!</li>
            <li> but Its working better than Proactive for me, Proactive didnt do anything.</li>
            <li> and I love the feel of my skin and</li>
            <li> Also, the Clarisonic got my skin 10 times cleaner than my hands alone did, which helped the Exposed products to seep into my skin better.</li>
            <li> and my skin looks noticeably better.</li>
            <li> The most susceptible area of having acne is around the cheek and chin area.</li>
            <li> It sure has changed my life.</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> top it all off,</li>
            <li> Just received more of this product in the mail today.</li>
            <li> I looked at reviews for all acne treatment and found Exposed had the best overall.</li>
            <li> I have been using the kit for 60 days now and completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year, and I love it.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I need more of my face</li>
            <li> /&gt;However I was not moved nor inspired to write this review because of the product (although it would have been warranted) but because of the customer service I have received from Exposed Skin Care and more specifically from Kelly who works for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I just wanted to make sure Kelly/Exposed Skin Care was acknowledged and thanked)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like many been dealing with acne most of my life.</li>
            <li> About 2 months ago was doing research on many brands and products for my acne because what I was using what not working.</li>
            <li> Love it :)</li>
            <li> I was having more and more breakouts and my family was commenting on my skin a lot</li>
            <li> One of my favorite products is the exfoliating scrub.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad I stumbled  upon Exposed.</li>
            <li> We both absolutely LOVE it.</li>
            <li> Give it a try, you won&#x27;t regret it! :)</li>
            <li> Im sure</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> OKAY</li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> I love makeup</li>
            <li> and I feel great and confident that I know its working so much.</li>
            <li> I love waking up every morning seeing more and more improvements.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> I use to have many problems with my skin and acne.</li>
            <li> I had good success using Exposed Skincare Products.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if this face acne medicine was going to work or not.</li>
            <li> DO NOT NOT NOT KEEP POPPING, SQUEEZING &amp; TOUCHING YOUR FACE.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since 2010 and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> For the most part, this product deserves the praise it&#x27;s getting.</li>
            <li> seems to be one of the top concerns is the automatic charge for you to get another set-</li>
            <li> The Top Rated Acne Treatment Pill.</li>
            <li> He tried, then disbanded use of the moisturizer, with better results no using the moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I love this system.</li>
            <li> She follows the proram closely and her skin has never looked better.  </li>
            <li> Then I found this product and within a month my face was already looking better.</li>
            <li> Exposed Skin was basically just my newest, latest product.</li>
            <li> As of now, I can&#x27;t recommend a product more.</li>
            <li> started using this kit about 6-7 weeks ago and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Almost every single one had nothing but good things to say for this product: \\&quot;Best acne product ever!\\&quot;, \\&quot;Made my skin super clear\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Additionally, the staff is very friendly and will refund you ASAP if there was a mistake on your purchase.</li>
            <li> The best of all, it is very reasonably priced and it really works.</li>
            <li> I would pretty much like to say my skin is at the ever best condition.</li>
            <li> I have to use the system exactly as the instructions tell you to, but if I do that I am able to maintain good control over my acne.  </li>
            <li> Since a steady regiment of Exposed products I have seen great improvement.  </li>
            <li> My skin felt very clean after washing it and blemishes went away within days.  </li>
            <li> I really wish I had taken before and after pics of her face because the results were amazing!  </li>
            <li> Even though I experienced personal results myself, it&#x27;s just so amazing to see how her face was sever to now so healthy and</li>
            <li> Overall, great product and company...very refreshing on your skin!</li>
            <li> I was nervous because I have sensitive skin, but it has worked beautifully.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been an acne sufferer for many, many years, and like others, I&#x27;ve used almost everything available until I&#x27;ve fortunately found Exposed!</li>
            <li> The all-natural ingredients feel and smell great, and the multi-steps are not hard to keep track of.</li>
            <li> The doctor told me the combination of the acid and peroxide was TOO STRONG for most people&#x27;s faces.</li>
            <li> Have tried many things out in the market some have worked fairly well some not so much.</li>
            <li> but we can adjust that period to best fit your individual</li>
            <li> Exposed has done WONDERS for my self-confidence and is the single best thing I purchased in 2014.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t fun, but in my opinion it was better than the acne!</li>
            <li> Exposed allowed me to get in a routine so that I was able to maintain clean and healthy skin.</li>
            <li> Looks like Proactive has some competition, yea right this is better than Proactive!</li>
            <li> Great for adult acne.</li>
            <li> I am so happy there is a product out there that is made of natural ingredients for the face.</li>
            <li> Both have experienced troublesome acne, and I have had my share of adult acne.</li>
            <li> My skin looks more smooth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for just over a month and have been happy with the results so far.</li>
            <li> I have a more detailed review here:</li>
            <li> The accutane worked wonderful the first time for about 2 years I had awesome skin, then it returned, the second go around lasted a year, then the last go around my face</li>
            <li> It feels so refreshing and light.</li>
            <li> And after a while it started to clear up great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a great combination of products that balance and help eachother out to get rid of acne and give you clear</li>
            <li> The moisterizer is great, not heavy or greasy.  </li>
            <li> And I was delighted when it really did help my skin.  </li>
            <li> For me it took a good two months or so before it really started to work.</li>
            <li> after you apply it).been using this product for 4mons.my face is not oily anymore(can go out w/o powder)but not dry either,i also noticed my face whitens and softer!no more pimples.very happy &amp; satisfied.i</li>
            <li> Exposed is completely worth the money! :)</li>
            <li> And the best part about it, it does it while keeping my skin from drying out like other acne medications have done.</li>
            <li> I have used some other products before, and this one is the best set that I have used.</li>
            <li> Try it, and hope you will also have a desire to write excited review here like me:)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely excited to see the results after a couple more weeks.</li>
            <li> Turns out that this time they were true!</li>
            <li> My skin isnt perfect as I have many acne scars still healing, however I&#x27;m happy to say new breakouts are a thing of the past.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s easy to discontinue online if you don&#x27;t want to get the product every month.</li>
            <li> My skin is very oily and acne prone - this product has been by far the greatest for my skin.  </li>
            <li> I can finally feel confident without wearing makeup and people noticed how great my skin is looking.</li>
            <li> The Exposed website is easy to use and I can easily change my products and shipment frequency.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all natural and gentle on your skin and has all the best ingredients in it!</li>
            <li> I heard of EXPOSED on the internet and figured I&#x27;d try another product that probably wouldn&#x27;t work; a month later I was sure happy I tried it.</li>
            <li> makes it incredibly easy to adjust the frequency of your recurring order online.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more than happy to give feedback about this product as it appears to be the only brand I have tried where I received results.</li>
            <li> Cleared my face up very quickly.</li>
            <li> ,i search for top acne treatment in the Internet,then I found exposed products.i gave it a try.i am so happy with the result.everyday i can see the improvements.i started with the exposed basic kit,in</li>
            <li> It was easy to talk with her and reach a solution!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Customer service is always verry easy to work with.</li>
            <li> Everything goes on really easily and lathers well.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> and it was too strong.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend giving Exposed a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS, wash your pillow cases... a lot.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend giving Exposed a chance.     </li>
            <li> Strongly caution against giving this company your credit card number</li>
            <li> strongly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I may test each product to see how strong and</li>
            <li> One of the Exposed packages comes with a Probiotic which is great for digestion, which could be a major cause of breakouts.</li>
            <li> decided to switch to another top brand, Murad, that was offering a special deal at the time.</li>
            <li> I bought the Expanded Kit for the first time and it truly is amazing.  </li>
            <li> It worked amazingly well at first (for about 2 weeks).  </li>
            <li> I really love this acne treatment, and rather than repeat myself, I suggest you read the reviews for the Full Kit.</li>
            <li> The cleanser is my favorite, my skin feels smooth, clean and refreshed, no over-drying.</li>
            <li> The products work best when you are consistent, and use the entire system.</li>
            <li> I used to get sporadic acne that would leave my skin looking less than perfect.  </li>
            <li> One thing that throws me off about this product is that they recommend to wash your face way too often in my opinion- for some skin types twice a day is fine</li>
            <li> After receiving a package and finding that most of the bottle of cleanser had leaked out during shipment, they quickly responded to my e-mail and sent a replacement.</li>
            <li> We are both loyal customers!</li>
            <li> Exposed Acne Treatment has helped my face tremendously!</li>
            <li> IT IT SUPER!</li>
            <li> He is also so very handsome, not because he is my son:), and I am so thankful I can enjoy his handsomeness with clear healing skin.</li>
            <li> It worked great for about 18 months, but then my acne came back strong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle yet effective and I can easily say I couldn&#x27;t function without it.</li>
            <li> She was developing fairly significant acne, I researched and found that this product in general had great results.  </li>
            <li> My skin is 100% acne free and not dry to top it off!!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve seen a huge difference within just 2 days of using the product.</li>
            <li> So that is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> and when i added that to the regimen its made a huge difference.</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks, I noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling smooth and refreshed.</li>
            <li> She even goes to the store now without any makeup on because her complexion is so smooth.  </li>
            <li> and my skin feels smooth.</li>
            <li> Exposed has been the only one to get these great results.</li>
            <li> They offer a great guarantee - who else will offer you your money back after 12 months??</li>
            <li> and I am acne free.</li>
            <li> The moisturizer is so creamy and smooth on my skin.  </li>
            <li> In addition, the customer service is fantastic.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Exposed takes a while to work, but when it does, the results are incomparable.</li>
            <li> But I will say your diet plays an important part too.</li>
            <li> Another great thing about Exposed&#x27;s kits is I can switch out products I don&#x27;t want, down-size or up-size my entire kitwhenever</li>
            <li> It comes with the kit for free</li>
            <li> Exposed has been a perfect partner in my battle with Breakouts, even after a few months of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It had great reviews with a money back guaranty</li>
            <li> Plus, they are a fantastic company to deal with.</li>
            <li> The product is great, especially with the moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It honestly saved my face, and freed me of wasting so much time covering my spots when going out.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic product.</li>
            <li> dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The exposed system guarantees to give you acne free skin in 30 days.  </li>
            <li> * acne free in 30 days,</li>
            <li> This system really does work, honestly.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s free</li>
            <li> and if I were customer service I would think that this guy (me) was pulling a scam trying to get free product.</li>
            <li> You are fantastic at your job</li>
            <li> It works and is gentle on the skin and has a nice smell.</li>
            <li> The facial wash worked so great that I decided to give the body wash a try.</li>
            <li> and I needed to use products that weren&#x27;t in the kit like the clarifying mask and probiotic (I got them for free though).</li>
            <li> Helps prevents breakouts and promotes smooth skin.</li>
            <li> (Try washing your pillowcases &amp; wash cloths with fragrance free laundry soap)&lt;br</li>
            <li> (Shipping times can be adjusted to fit your schedule)&lt;br /&gt;  2.</li>
            <li> My son had tried all kinds of acne treatments - Acne Free, Clearasil, Neutrogena, etc. -</li>
            <li> The company offers great savings in a variety of creative ways, has reasonable shipping, and a combination of ways to purchase their products so you can affordably purchase what you need.</li>
            <li> They will gladly personalize your shipment if you have too much of one product and need more of another.  </li>
            <li> Good luck with finding a company that is even close to what Exposed offers.</li>
            <li> have used a lot of product so far, from Obagi, Murad, Kiehls, Tea Tree etc, but so far this is the best acne treatment</li>
            <li> difference.my breakouts was gone.im on the expanded kit right now and is better than ever.each treatment you can see and feel how it works(right</li>
            <li> I have never found a product for my skin that works as well and as fast as exposed!!!</li>
            <li> I know it sounds like it is too good to be true, but this is a real review from a real person!!  </li>
            <li> My skin has never been clearer and I very rarely now suffer from any spots at all.</li>
            <li> After using this product, my skin feels very very fresh.</li>
            <li> Each of the items are very useful and helps getting through the day.</li>
            <li> Some of my friends have noticed how clean and smooth it is.</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick and easy.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s super easy now.</li>
            <li> Both the morning and evening application process are quick and easy once a routine is established.  </li>
            <li> Very gentle too.&lt;br /&gt;One of mine favorite products is the scrub.</li>
            <li> The price is kind of high</li>
            <li> At the beginning it took about two and half weeks to show results that I was happy with and after that it was more of a maintenance process.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be alarmed if more acne shows after the first week or so because Exposed is just basically restoring your face by pulling all the acne out.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this.</li>
            <li> I love the all-natural ingredients in each product, and you&#x27;re skin really feels and looks healthier while using it!</li>
            <li> and I still believe in my original review which is listed below.  </li>
            <li> This is definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not normally someone to write a review but this product genuinely had a great effect on my life</li>
            <li> and I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li> My skin was 100 times better after the first month.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t EVER take the time to review a product unless it&#x27;s honestly worth it!</li>
            <li> I originally bought this to try out for my boyfriend.</li>
            <li> I think this is a shady business practice at best.</li>
            <li> I can say pretty confidently that my acne is probably hormonal -</li>
            <li> I have tried a wide range of acne treatment systems (including the award winning La Roche Pose) and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li> I have been using it consistently for about two years now and my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> Out of all the products this is the most consistent.</li>
            <li> I am traveling abroad soon and was excited to see they have a travel size kit as well.</li>
            <li> My skin hasn&#x27;t been this healthy or looked this good in a very long time!</li>
            <li> I have tried many other products and find this to be the most effective.  </li>
            <li> Lastly, a lot of people think this is pricey, but I just have to say clear skin is so worth it!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Without question this product has been the most effective acne treatment for my teenage son.  </li>
            <li> I love that this acne treatment system uses many natural extracts.  </li>
            <li> Exposed is the best secret in acne treatment, and more people suffering from acne need to know about it.</li>
            <li> : I apply everything with clean hands.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s about the same price as Proactiv and in my case more effective</li>
            <li> The cleanser makes my face feel clean, which is what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I like that this product had better and more natural ingredients</li>
            <li> I been having my face clean all my life</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will be honest and say I noticed improvement in regards to the acne breakouts on my face within the first two weeks, BUT the product caused some severe drying and flaking of my skin for about a week - I was pretty bummed about that.</li>
            <li> I did some research on the internet and decided to give Exposed a try after reading many positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> I ordered exposed after reading many positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I have tried many of the other acne lines out there, including Proactiv, and did not have good results.</li>
            <li> Use the system as explicitly instructed by the Exposed pamphlet, according to personal needs, in conjunction with improved diet excluding refined grains and sugar, and you should have great success in getting rid of your mild to severe acne.</li>
            <li> Some stuff works better for certain people.</li>
            <li> Special Member Rates: With a membership you&#x27;ll lock in our special Member Rate and save $10 on every kit...</li>
            <li> Just so you know it didn&#x27;t happen overnight for me, but after a month I definately saw my skin going in the right direction, and now my scars are almost all gone!  </li>
            <li> Also priced right for the results!</li>
            <li> skin feels great, not overly dry or super oily like before.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product off and on for a little over two years and it is the most amazing stuff!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve hardly had any zits since, and I feel great about the skin I&#x27;m in!</li>
            <li> The products are not irritating and they are pretty effective against acme on face and chest.  </li>
            <li> My face freaked out and I needed something that was effective, fast, and was safe for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The investment was worth it, and he continues to use the products more than one year after first trying them.  </li>
            <li> It truely changed the way I see myself in the mirror.</li>
            <li> but I had been switching products so much before beginning this one that I think I need to give it more time.  </li>
            <li> They took payment immediately but it took them a full week to ship the order, despite their claims that they ship within 48 hours.</li>
            <li> I love how gentle the products are on my face.</li>
            <li> I researched at least 5 pages of Internet reviews on every site that google produced about best acne systems and their reviews...</li>
            <li> The ingredients they say they use is absolutely true.</li>
            <li> Nice and soft and supple.</li>
            <li> It is really soft, but I don&#x27;t think it does anything spectacular.</li>
            <li> I would say Exposed provides at least one of the best online customer services.  </li>
            <li> I have used many onther products, including ProActiv, and they haven&#x27;t really worked at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 23 and it honestly hurts your confidence to be an adult with acne still.</li>
            <li> Since I have not found better alternatives yet, I will be continuing using this product, unless their customer service really pisses me off.</li>
            <li> For me Exposed is a good middle ground.</li>
            <li> Up to this point, I have been using the products for virtually 1 full year.</li>
            <li> Loving this so far.  </li>
            <li> What&#x27;s more the product is very soothing to the skin and an added bonus for those with rosacea -- I was using a product called Finacea that is basically an azailic acid compound (prescription) that costs $150 every couple months plus the aggravation of having to go to the doctor/derm for refills.</li>
            <li> The Full Kit includes the scrub, the clay mask, and the oral supplement.</li>
            <li> It is seriously a good combination which actually works.</li>
            <li> If you want to hear my full story, then please ask by commenting on my review.</li>
            <li> I was very pleasantly surprised how effective this product is.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love Exposed skin care, it really has made a difference in my confidence with my skin.  </li>
            <li> but my skin is actually really oily and this is what bothers me the most.  </li>
            <li> The customer service is outstanding and every person I have spoken with has been very helpful and</li>
            <li> Liked the fact that it was a combo of natural and science.</li>
            <li> If so, this is an INCREDIBLY elaborate one that they haven&#x27;t already been legally charged for yet...</li>
            <li> My son had tried many products, but he often abandoned them when he didn&#x27;t see results in a reasonable period of time.  </li>
            <li> It looks smooth and fresh.  </li>
            <li> I do still have periodic breakouts, but it is not nearly as bad as it was before.</li>
            <li> it would not stain but it discolored my dress shirt a bit on the collar and my pillow case, but DEFINITELY not as bad as Proactiv ruined my towels and clothes.</li>
            <li> Not bad</li>
            <li> I purchased this product first for my 16 yr old daughter, saw good results in 3 weeks for her</li>
            <li> It not only cleared my skin up nearly 100% in about 3 weeks, but it is extremely effective at preventing breakouts!!</li>
            <li> I made the purchase too quickly without making sure that all these glowing reviews were real.</li>
            <li> It only takes about 3 minutes to do and they offer so many other things to help make your skin perfect.</li>
            <li> You have to find the right fit to your skin.</li>
            <li> So far so good, I hope the results remain positive.</li>
            <li> I have tried EVERYTHING, literally EVERYTHING to get rid of my acne and this regimen has been infinitely better than Proactive, or Clean and Clear, or Neutrogena, or Acne Free, or any of those (I&#x27;ve tried them all).  </li>
            <li> I have been a loyal customer for many, many years now, and I have tried many other products.</li>
            <li> Overall so far I&#x27;d say if you give it the two to three weeks at first and use it as directed it will be an awesome product for you as well.</li>
            <li> Now Exposed is now one of my favorite products - I couldn&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> I have always struggled with mild acne</li>
            <li> AND I&#x27;m super stoked - before I started using Exposed</li>
            <li> My teenage son also began using recently and his skin looks great also!  </li>
            <li> I have Mild acne.  </li>
            <li> My face cleared faster when I used Cetaphil a mild soap and witch hazel.  </li>
            <li> She&#x27;s been a loyal Exposed user now going on 2 years.  </li>
            <li> I started him quickly on the Exposed routine.  </li>
            <li> I personally believe that treating acne is best when using a daily cleansing and treatment regimen and a scrub/mask twice a week.</li>
            <li> I suffer from mild acne</li>
            <li> My acne went from mild to severe.</li>
            <li> If my skin stays clear after a year or more, I can comfortably give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I have been a loyal customer for a couple years now and will continue to be one for quite some time.</li>
            <li> I have fairly mild acne along with some acne scarring, so decided to give this product a shot.</li>
            <li> and I have been seeing tremendous skin tone color.</li>
            <li> I Identified this product I was very impressed by the money back, and after trawling through numerous reviews I decided to give it a go...</li>
            <li> Sure I still get occasionally acne, but it&#x27;s a lot more manageable.  </li>
            <li> I was really pleased at first and began seeing results pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> whether or not you have mild to severe acne, or anywhere in between.  </li>
            <li> I noticed also that eliminating dairy, grains and processed sugar from my diet has helped tremendously.</li>
            <li> but they became healed quickly.</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t have to put on makeup just to take some picture of me and my son, I don&#x27;t have to slather on concealer just to go to make a quick trip to the store.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 14 year old and he is quite happy with the results so far.  </li>
            <li> I have mild to medium acne.</li>
            <li> My redness was beginning to lighten, the large cystic ones were decreasing, and the pimples were becoming fewer and farther between.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes it&#x27;s clear and has a very strong sage smell, and others</li>
            <li> I find the products safe, gentle, long lasting, and the best part is :  THEY WORK!!!!  </li>
            <li> I have noticed, however, that the products do not stay very consistent.  </li>
            <li> This all adds to the ultimate cleansing experience - far superior to Proactiv!    </li>
            <li> Otherwise very pleased and wish I could get them locally.</li>
            <li> Even though it looks like alot of steps, the whole system is really easy and quick to use.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I have combination oily/dry skin, so it has always been a struggle to find good face products that don&#x27;t dry me out but also don&#x27;t leave my skin shiny and cause breakouts.</li>
            <li> Overall good reults after first couple of weeks adjusting to bew product.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t even been a week, only six days and many of my pimples have cleared up!</li>
            <li> I love the face cleanser and clear pore serum, and the clarifying mask works wonders!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t even let my boyfriend see my face first thing in the morning!</li>
            <li> First of all, I do not write reviews!</li>
            <li> and I am absolutely FLOORED at the results!!  </li>
            <li> People can only use so many terms to describe acne suffering and what a product has done to help that!</li>
            <li> Must use consistently for results and don&#x27;t pick!</li>
            <li> At first it didn&#x27;t seem to be as effective as I thought but after several weeks I started to notice a HUGE difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s packed with healing/soothing ingredients on top of the strong acne preventing ones such as benxoyl peroxide.</li>
            <li> depending on your skin, if more dry than oily, you are better off using a moisturizer your skin is used to.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a problem that wasn&#x27;t quickly and appropriately remedied, in nearly 3 years of use and bimonthly delivery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had problems with acne on top of having super sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 24 years old with very oily skin and this product has definitely done the best job at consistently controlling my acne.</li>
            <li> I was really optimistic about Exposed because of the many positive reviews and articles that I read about it.</li>
            <li> The first few years I used Proactiv - which did a good job I thought, until I discovered Exposed!</li>
            <li> because they offer a higher statistically significant success rate of 98%</li>
            <li> I was about to give up on the product but decided to try using less of it, and that was very effective.</li>
            <li> You know how some people, when they have a great complexion, they have this little shiny spot on their forehead.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend Exposed Acne Treatment to anyone who is looking to try something new!  </li>
            <li> I know beauty is on the inside too, but its hard to laugh and smile and be happy when you have huge acne..</li>
            <li> I know everyone is different, but this company is amazing</li>
            <li> I tried Exposed Skin Care in hopes to calm my acne, it is not 100% gone</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t too harsh and everything smells great.</li>
            <li> It is by far the best of anything I have ever used and it leaves my skin looked fresh (not dried out and red) and acne-free.  </li>
            <li> It took 2 weeks and ever since, for now 6 month, I am acne free and my life is so much happier and easier now.</li>
            <li> I will post another review in a few weeks for an update, but I am already happy with the product, which has never happened to me before with skincare not received from a doctor.  </li>
            <li> so so so many products, (mostly all over the counter because i&#x27;m too poor to go to the doctor).&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many different of the following&lt;br /&gt;-medicated washes (st.ives scrubs, Neutrogena clear pore, many MANY more, but those 2 were my</li>
            <li> My skin looks so healthy and clear.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t worth the money in our situation.  </li>
            <li> It took about 3 weeks for my skin to clear and my skin tone is better than ever.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had clear skin that Ive been able to maintain.</li>
            <li> Blemishes remain until the natural healing process clears them up, but the healthy tissue around the blemish is irritated and peeling, burned from the chemicals in the lotions.  </li>
            <li> Although this item is a bit pricy, I think it&#x27;s worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I am a personal trainer and often at the gym 10-12 hours per day and between my clients workouts and my own, my skin is under stress and lots of perspiration throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> This is WELL WORTH every cent I paid.</li>
            <li> my acne!:)This is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> The only thing I kind of wish Exposed offered is an eye cream, and an extra strength pimple-zapper, as it would be nice to have all my skin care products in the one place.</li>
            <li> So after trying many products I now use a natural face cream by Ohio Valley Herbal Products, Inc. which leaves my skin feeling supple and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I too tried every product worth trying....over the counter as well as Proactive, Murad, Max Clarity etc......</li>
            <li> then my life will be complete :)</li>
            <li> and my skin was clear, but it wasn&#x27;t healthy looking.</li>
            <li> I have insanely sensitive skin, and it worked well for me :)</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a year and have been pleased with its results thus far.  </li>
            <li> The price may seem steep to some, but I promise you it is worth it.</li>
            <li> more success story now includes my own 13 year old son as he is now entering his teenage years.  </li>
            <li> It is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> So far its done a good job at lessening the effects of the old acne.</li>
            <li> and I rarely have problems with my skin.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s honestly worth it.</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels so soft and healthy.  </li>
            <li> so I thought it was worth telling people about.</li>
            <li> He rarely even gets one pimple anymore.</li>
            <li> acne treatment serum works great as a spot treatment but do NOT get it on the surrounding skin, especially if your skin is sensitive.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll be able to have a clear complextion for my wedding day.</li>
            <li> If I feel a pimple coming on, I apply the Acne Treatment Serum to it and it rarely ever surfaces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so rare that I ever have even a mini-breakout that I&#x27;ve almost forgotten what it&#x27;s like.</li>
            <li> I will be completely blemish free!</li>
            <li> The deep cystic kind, blackheads, whiteheads, etc etc.</li>
            <li> What I like most about this product is that they combine all natural ingredients with proven acne fighting products (i.e. benzoyl peroxide salycic acid).  </li>
            <li> guarantee (when they had a 90% success rate).</li>
            <li> far I am really enjoying the effects.</li>
            <li> TO MY CLEAR, SMOOTH, ACNE FREE COMPLEXION.  </li>
            <li> honestly, I am saying that this product is only spending money on nothing.</li>
            <li> Worth a try.</li>
            <li> If you have acne issues, it&#x27;s worth giving this product a try.  </li>
            <li> Now she has clear skin and feels so much better about herself.  </li>
            <li> I use the moisture complex, it&#x27;s great because it keeps my skin smooth, but doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for about a month now, but it is working great so far.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s quite satisfied so far with the results.</li>
            <li> blemishes would clear up, 3 or 4 more would pop</li>
            <li> Regardless, not all of my problems have been cured, but this was definitely worth the try.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been told by my dermatologists that the only way to control this kind of acne (cysts) is by antibiotics.  </li>
            <li> Has helped with breakouts and even to just maintain clear and healthy skin.</li>
            <li> after using it longer it will continue to clear up even more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product overall, but it really depends on the person.</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powerful stuff.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny...</li>
            <li> the results have been very positive.  </li>
            <li> I am way more confident and will never use anything other than Exposed for now on.</li>
            <li> The moisture complex has helped to clear the scarring on my shoulders, and the cloth is an excellent exfoliater to help clean up any flaky skin and leave you looking glowing.  </li>
            <li> this has worked much better for me than most other acne products out there.</li>
            <li> I do have to supplement the kit with more the tonic because I use more of that then the other products.  </li>
            <li> By using many of their products, my skin quickly cleared up, became smooth and radiant, and didn&#x27;t dry up my skin or made it oily.</li>
            <li> I have had mild but consistent acne for years</li>
            <li> I am aware and know from experience that products do not work quickly.  </li>
            <li> I became a true believer after that and have now purchased kits for both of my daughters who are seeing positive results as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many other products, but this is the first that was able to convince me to stop wearing foundation because my natural skin looked better not covered up.</li>
            <li> They are also very helpful and customer friendly as well.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave this product 4 stars is because I do go through the moisturizer quicker (it is probably normal for most people to go through on or more products faster than others)</li>
            <li> My skin has cleared up significantly and when I do breakout, it goes away much faster then before.</li>
            <li> I love the fact it lists all of the ingredients rather than the key ingredients or the ones that would make consumers think that they are special.</li>
            <li> but I just don&#x27;t think I have the right skin for this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It won&#x27;t work right away, so don&#x27;t give up when your acne hasn&#x27;t disappeared within a week.</li>
            <li> and then I find that the clearing tonic/acne treatment serum is drying, so on those mornings I skip the tonic and acne treatment, and then apply the moisturizer and the dryness clears right</li>
            <li> (what did I have to lose, right?).</li>
            <li> I saw improvements right away</li>
            <li> My skin is clear for the first time and I feel confident without the need to cover up with makeup.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, this is the first product that worked for my moderate acne!</li>
            <li> The face wash makes my skin feel so clean and the toner really helps to shrink my pores and take away the redness.</li>
            <li> My face is clear and I am able to wear blush/bronzer for the first time with no breakout.</li>
            <li> And I am very satisfied with what it has done for me in terms of significantly reduced acne and clear skin, though the oiliness is still about the same.</li>
            <li> I would recommend that you give this product a good honest try, as I fully expect that in 2-3 months I will finally have the clear, radiant skin I have been trying to get back to since puberty.ecommend</li>
            <li> that you give this product a good honest try, as I fully expect that in 2-3 months I will finally have the clear, radiant skin I have been trying to get back to since puberty.</li>
            <li> it just leaves is clear and clean feeling!</li>
            <li> I do still get some pimples sometimes, but they are much smaller (and most of the time they are whiteheads instead of the cystic type I used to get) and go away quickly.  </li>
            <li> This has always been higher than proactive&#x27;s success rate.</li>
            <li> and I know that this small passage will be inadequate to express how happy I am at the moment</li>
            <li> , then the clearing tonic (so it can work it&#x27;s magic at night) as well as two more capsules of the Clearzine.&lt;br /&gt;So far after only two weeks</li>
            <li> so be careful about how much you use at first, but so far so good for me :)</li>
            <li> Although it may be good to use it, I&#x27;ve switched to one that would heal dark spots and pigmentation instead.</li>
            <li> My skin look so rich and vibrant.</li>
            <li> I am hoping after using for a little more time we will see better results.  </li>
            <li> more and more acnes are coming out everyday and whaaat?</li>
            <li> Has lessened my acne and exposed skin care makes my skin feel good and look less blotchy.</li>
            <li> Simple, gentle and effective describe Exposed</li>
            <li> It is easy to use with the step instructions and clearly labeled bottles and has done wonders for my daughter&#x27;s skin and self esteem.</li>
            <li> My skin felt better after a few days and within 2 weeks my skin was clearer with a more even skin tone.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth the money if you want to enjoy clear skin and confidence.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been 9 months now and these Exposed products are still doing a great job to my daily facial care.  </li>
            <li> My skin is very tempermental and tends to dry out easy with most acne treatments.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff twice daily like the directions say and it does do a good job at getting rid of the old acne.</li>
            <li> I contacted the company directly expecting to get a call center representative whose brain I could pick about what made the product so great.  </li>
            <li> Have had better success with basic soap and a touch on spot healer.</li>
            <li> I still get regular breakouts, despite good diet, frequent washing of bedding, etc.</li>
            <li> product ships incredibly fast and comes with detailed instructions on what to use and when, which really helps.</li>
            <li> but they last a good amount of time, they offer coupons and special deals, and you can buy any product individually if you use one faster than the others.</li>
            <li> Long story short, my skin has cleared up A LOT and many people have told me over and over that my skin is amazing-</li>
            <li> but then as soon as istarted back doing it the right way my skin was beautiful.the kit with all the products are better skin heals way quicker and you will see your skin glow in no time.</li>
            <li> (But I am sure they will take it a couple steps further, right guys??</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had acne since I was about 15 or 16, usually pretty mild, didn&#x27;t really get it on cheeks or forehead</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s incredibly smooth I actually look forward to washing my face and not worring about breaking out and last but not least, what an amazing price!</li>
            <li> The facial cleanser is very light on my skin and doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation or redness.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for some months now, but I remember seeing results very fast.</li>
            <li> Did not help my son very much</li>
            <li> Exposed is a great product to at least give a chance to, especially with their great money back</li>
            <li> They haven&#x27;t changed size very much at all.</li>
            <li> Also very reasonable for the price.</li>
            <li> and I tend to go through the moisturizer faster than the other products), which is great for sensitive skin like mine.  </li>
            <li> I switched from high end products to more natural treatments like honey, lemon, even clay.  </li>
            <li> Once your face is clean, then the product prevents the new break</li>
            <li> (I was wearing makeup, but now I can get my skin looking practically flawless with a bit of makeup - before, I could only really cover the redness) and the other thinking I was wearing makeup when I wasn&#x27;t!!  </li>
            <li> Exposed works so well after the first two weeks your face will look rejuvenated.</li>
            <li> Not only does it help with acne, it makes my skin feel better too.  </li>
            <li> First off, \\&quot;Exposed, keep your credit...</li>
            <li> My first order arrived and I began using the toner.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use most benzoyl peroxide treatments because my skin gets extremely red, itchy, and peels.</li>
            <li> I had similar issues with Proactiv when I tried it many years ago.</li>
            <li> Thanks Exposed Skincare!</li>
            <li> It seemed like a pain in the butt at first</li>
            <li> but I got the hang of it after the first week</li>
            <li> This was the last product i was willing to try, after searching the internet for top 10  acne solutions i came across the expanded kit.</li>
            <li> Overall, I would recommend this product for sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on the middle of week 4 and my skin looks better than it has in longer than i can remember.</li>
            <li> It DOES hurt at first.</li>
            <li> I recommend geting the kit with everything on your first buy.</li>
            <li> Thanks Exposed!</li>
            <li> I have tried and bought all kinds of different products and brands and have never been truly and completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> This one consistently popped up as number 1 about 75 or 80 percent of the time.</li>
            <li> I struggled with acne through college and literally tried everything, including Proactive to Acne Free and even shifted to all natural products of Burt&#x27;s Bees.  </li>
            <li> I am just so glad that there is a product out there that actually does what it claims.</li>
            <li> After having tried many options for my daughter we finally found this product and it worked almost immediately.</li>
            <li> I first started using exposed, because the product that I had been using was discontinued.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I finally found a product that works for me.  </li>
            <li> Once I got it (incredibly fast shipping!)</li>
            <li> This stuff is for real!</li>
            <li> I first tried Exposed in 2006, just months before my wedding.</li>
            <li> You have to be consistent with this product.  </li>
            <li> My face cleared up for the first month.  </li>
            <li> I honostly can say that yess it really works!</li>
            <li> It simply does a better job fighting acne than Proactive.</li>
            <li> My daughter tried so many different acne products and none were helping...</li>
            <li> However, after I tried the Exposed acne products, the white-head started to disappear way before I finished my first Exposed Expanded Kit.  </li>
            <li> When you buy a kit, it comes up much more cheaper, rather buying products individually.</li>
            <li> I never struggled with acne until I was 24 and onto my first job out of college.  </li>
            <li> My two favorite products in the kit are the Facial Cleanser and Acne Treatment Serum.  </li>
            <li> This is truly the only product that worked for me after so many years of struggling with Acne.  </li>
            <li> of sleep go back to bed, and those of you who want ance free skin try this product out!</li>
            <li> Doing this routine with Exposed has left my skin glowing, my complexion even, and me blemish free!</li>
            <li> I just received my first Exposed treatment kit in the mail today and used the evening routine (cleanser, serum and spot treatment) about 1 hour ago.</li>
            <li> Skin ID worked for a while, but recently it seemed to stop being able to control my outbreaks.</li>
            <li> I was in a pretty severe breakout stage when I got Exposed in the mail.</li>
            <li> My makeup goes on so much better, and my skin looks completely different.  </li>
            <li> I have tried countless products and have been to the derm on many occasions.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different products to deal with acne.</li>
            <li> In the past I have tried Proactive, perscription face products, Artistry, Neutrogena, Clean&amp;Clear, and many, many others.  </li>
            <li> This product along with additional face moisturizers work very well for me!</li>
            <li> Even after my first day of using it, I noticed an improvement on my complexion.</li>
            <li> I got a reaction the first usage and within a week I could feel that my skin was softer and smoother.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different treatments and products.</li>
            <li> From the off the shelf products to facial sessions that cost more than $200 dollars each, and antibiotics and contraceptive pills.</li>
            <li> I felt my skin was \\&quot;peaceful\\&quot;, it was not angry anymore.</li>
            <li> My facial skin has been quite oily, and had a lot more acne.</li>
            <li> Believe me, it really works!</li>
            <li> I had moderate acne most of my life.</li>
            <li> After a phone call with Amazon customer service, they agreed to refund the money however buyers should be aware Exposed does not guarantee the product when purchased through Amazon.</li>
            <li> The reviews here, if you click the \\&quot;See all my reviews\\&quot; link, you&#x27;ll notice for many users this is the only product they&#x27;ve ever reviewed.</li>
            <li> [...] is a review for exposed, has a link that leads back to [...] along with many user comments that are garbled and don&#x27;t make any sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have changed my diet around and am drinking more water daily and still nothing.</li>
            <li> I will update in three weeks if anyone&#x27;s interested in the results.</li>
            <li> I began to see results while being consistent in using it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The price was reasonable and I will continue to use this product line for life!</li>
            <li> I have been an avid proactiv user for over 8 years.  </li>
            <li> the next day my face would already look better and now even if I have to work in the kitchen</li>
            <li> and it is now completely zit free for the first time in</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever written a review about any product that I have purchased online...</li>
            <li> I love every part of this acne system and I never have to worry about what product I should try next.</li>
            <li> It could be that I&#x27;m more religious about keeping to the routine of washing my face every morning and night, or it could be the products themselves.  </li>
            <li> try it work for while on first</li>
            <li> I tried sooooo many different acne treatments and it never seemed to help.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY RECOMMEND EVERYONE TRYING IT!!</li>
            <li> I started suffering from acne around the area next to the eyebrows, and Skin ID couldn&#x27;t control it any more.</li>
            <li> I PURCHASED MY FIRST KIT IN OCTOBER 2011</li>
            <li> Skin feel smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended to everyone !!</li>
            <li> Now, it&#x27;s around 6 months after I first started to use the exposed system</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft and blemish free.</li>
            <li> and now I have the pretty skin that I used to have.</li>
            <li> This product has been working real well for me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I finally gave it a try; I used it for about a week before I started to see results.</li>
            <li> I was interested in the Exposed product because it promised use of both &amp;#34;science and nature&amp;#34; --</li>
            <li> Problems occur when I moved to Europe, for the first 3 months</li>
            <li> I am so glad I finally found something that worked for me.  </li>
            <li> I continued to struggle with acne, not finding a product that would work and CONTINUE to work on a consistent basis.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We are on the automatic send program and it is,for me, the only way to go as I am sure I would forget to order.</li>
            <li> While I still am fighting the acne I am feeling better about myself as I continue to see daily improvement.  </li>
            <li> OK there was no way I was going to get that package back</li>
            <li> ;) )</li>
            <li> Results may be gradual, but they are amazing.&lt;br /&gt;Stick with it and be consistent in your habit of using it &amp; here may be your solution to a life-long acne problem.</li>
            <li> and my daughters face was completely blemish free.  </li>
            <li> It works great and as long as you stick with it, you will definitely see results.</li>
            <li> really helped my skin!</li>
            <li> used it for the first week and followed the directions every morning and night, strictly.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> In fact , I tried a lot of product such as the famous proactiv but that did not working for me.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;ll most likely work for you.</li>
            <li> and it has been 32 weeks (7 months) since I first started using Exposed Skin Care medicine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;****Be Consistent &amp; Take Care</li>
            <li> After trying many over the counter and perscription products this finally worked!</li>
            <li> Majority of reviews I read said it worked at first</li>
            <li> I saw the difference after the first week.</li>
            <li> This kit has done so well for me that this is the first review I&#x27;ve ever written.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every combination and this seems to keep my skin consistent.</li>
            <li> Naturally I was skeptical, even after reading the amazing reviews because they all have great reviews.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re having trouble maintaining good skin, I would suggest you look into this product.</li>
            <li> After using this product for a good few weeks.  </li>
            <li> My face did NOT feel good for a few days.  </li>
            <li> I hope the products can be a little bit more affordable and the shipping could be faster, because they are very quickly used up.</li>
            <li> the mircroscrub is great especially if you&#x27;re skin is dry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Exposed Acne product for several months now and it&#x27;s been the best I&#x27;ve tried so far... and I have also used Proactiv and other over the counter treatments.  </li>
            <li> I had previously used proactive for a year and initially had good results but my skin was incredibly dry and burned, so I tried exposed and have had amazing results!</li>
            <li> 4-6 more weeks, her acne was completely gone and her face was clear!  </li>
            <li> At first it didn&#x27;t work, but I kept with it and followed the directions completely, and I am so excited about my skin.  </li>
            <li> Dermatologist prescriptions that were too mild or strong, from Proactiv (which was WAY too strong), to Clinique (did next to nothing after almost 3 mos of religious use).</li>
            <li> Granted, I am only on my second kit, so I can&#x27;t vouch for the long-term consistency, but I do know that it is working better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, and that&#x27;s good enough for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> Product is consistent and if you use it you will see positive results.</li>
            <li> I surfed the net and actually found another product line that I tried first - not as good in my opinion.</li>
            <li> My skin was always pretty good with the occasional pimple until last year.  </li>
            <li> My skin looks clean and smooth, neither oily nor dry.</li>
            <li> Proactiv, Clean and Clear, Clinique, Vichy, Clearasil, Neutrogena, Murad, the Body Shop&#x27;s tea tree line...</li>
            <li> I used proactiv, murad, clean and clear, neutrogena, etc.</li>
            <li> Combined with a clean diet you could get clear skin within a month.</li>
            <li> I tried Proactive, Clearasil, Clean &amp; Clear and Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything from Clean &amp; Clear to Proactive and none of it worked for me.</li>
            <li> African black soap + coconut oil has worked much more nicely for fixing up my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After trying many facial soaps from stores and even Proactiv Solution, I never saw any real results.</li>
            <li> I liked that the products have such natural ingredients and after reading dozens of reviews online I decided to get the Expanded kit.  </li>
            <li> After using proactiv and Murad for years and dealing with constant pimples it feels good to finally use a product that works.</li>
            <li> (According to my own research into the user and medical reviews), was an all natural line of products known as Exposed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Finally at 55, my face looks good enough where I don&#x27;t  have to where make up to cover up the acne.  </li>
            <li> This stuff really works, for the longest I used so many different products until I started with Exposed!</li>
            <li> I suppose that is more of a scheme of tactics significantly over scam knowing that consumers and people in general only read what they want to read while skimming over the words in emails and websites.</li>
            <li> Best of all, the black/blue discoloration was going away and no more dry, flaky skin.</li>
            <li> I have used Clinique and rhodan fields in the past and nothing has worked as effectively and quickly as this product.</li>
            <li> I first tried this 2 years ago and it made my skin super sensitive for a couple weeks, but then my acne was GONE.</li>
            <li> I searched and found a number of positive reviews and with the guarantee</li>
            <li> I searched online and read Exposed&#x27;s mostly positive reviews.</li>
            <li> It was also SUPER nice on my sensitive skin, which has been my biggest issue with other acne kits.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty much every type of acne, whiteheads, blackheads, cystic.</li>
            <li> I have been struggling with acne for years and have tried pretty much everything.  </li>
            <li> When I found exposed I was skeptic at first because I hadn&#x27;t heard much about it.</li>
            <li> This is the first system that I have found that really works.  </li>
            <li> It is the FIRST one that I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue on my skin and absorbs really well without feeling sticky or greasy.</li>
            <li> have used it about a week, within the first 24 hours I could see a very noticeable improvement.</li>
            <li> It REALLY works and works fast!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I would recommend this product -- my skin looks better now that it has in a long time.  </li>
            <li> This is so gentle on my skin and clears it up fast!</li>
            <li> If you follow directions and use it twice per day, you see results pretty much overnight.</li>
            <li> I looked online and found Exposed and loved that it was a mix of natural and other ingredients.  </li>
            <li> The old saying you are what eat, it&#x27;s probably true...</li>
            <li> I also had super some super dry patches that would conveniently show up in the middle of the day that were not too appealing.  </li>
            <li> It is the same with pores, they look soo much smaller and my skin looks more and more natural</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a bit more flare ups here and there, but it says it gets worse before it gets better, but overall it seems to be getting better.</li>
            <li> The products are very easy to use and work extremely well.</li>
            <li> Over the years I have used so many other products and finally found the one :)  </li>
            <li> Most products have never been able to help my skin from breaking out especially from extreme workouts</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve tried many other commercial products, which all resulted more breakouts.</li>
            <li> Exposed doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out and works 100 times better than proactive ever did.</li>
            <li> It made my skin dry and so itchy, which I could have dealt with had it made my acne better.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more of a clear brown color and had barely any sage to the smell.</li>
            <li> As someone with very mild acne still clinging on after my teenage years, I&#x27;m looking to eliminate it.</li>
            <li> As soon as my face began getting better it also became extremely dry &amp; irritated.</li>
            <li> its make me more dry and</li>
            <li> I can strongly recommend you to give it a try, and definitely be persistent in applying it as recommended.</li>
            <li> That being said, a large portion of my acne problem still remains, which I hold out hope is a situation which will change, but I know that my acne is an exceptional case which topical creams can only do so much for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had severe blackheads &amp; whiteheads which would turn into large zits because I had a habit of squeezing them.</li>
            <li> my skin is pretty much blemish free and so much more soft and less oily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to ask for a refund if it doesn&#x27;t get better in 30 more days, because it is an expensive kit and Exposed do promise a full refund if it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> And I love that I get a new facial cloth (Derm-X Cloth) with every shipment.</li>
            <li> With the Exposed Skincare line of products, I have not only been able to rid myself of the acne I had, but help reduce new pimples/cysts/blackheads from forming.  </li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s ONE occasional new spot, not the many I would get</li>
            <li> But now he checks to make sure the new kit is coming before he runs out of the current.  </li>
            <li> And for me, Exposed&#x27;s Moisture Complex isn&#x27;t enough - it&#x27;s a very light moisturizer that absorbs too quickly and leaves my skin wanting more.</li>
            <li> Id definitely recommend this line to anyone who wants to clear up their acne as well as make their skin actually look nice!</li>
            <li> It took about 2 weeks to see a big difference and by the time I went through all the products (about 6 weeks) and ordered more my skin was completely clear!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant just due to the fact that I had tried so many products that seemed to work at first, but then would eventually stop working.  </li>
            <li> There are going to be cases where this product simply wont work for them, and that is completely fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to know that if I get an outbreak that I can put a little cream on it</li>
            <li> It took a little longer to work that I would have liked, but after the forst 60 day package I seem to be on track.</li>
            <li> But, honestly, this product did little to nothing for me.</li>
            <li> By the end of 3 months, her face looked very clear as if nothing had ever happened!!  </li>
            <li> Unless I can find a product that works as well and doesn&#x27;t cost as much, I will continue to use this because of the results.  </li>
            <li> I do wish iit didn&#x27;t cost so much.</li>
            <li> It has made me so much happier and</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
            <li> Exposed Acne Treatment was one of those rated very well</li>
            <li> This product really works and i am grateful for them.</li>
            <li> However, I researched and found this product&#x27;s claim to be promising.  </li>
            <li> All of the over the counter products we had tried did absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li> It dried out my skin some and made the red blotchy texture even more prominent.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I started using it and my skin cleared up gradually after a couple of weeks and felt softer and healthier straight away.</li>
            <li> Try them all and then you can re-buy the ones you really like.</li>
            <li> Try them all and then you can re-buy the ones you really like.</li>
            <li> It has boosted my confidence in myself, and I&#x27;m really thankful for this product.  </li>
            <li> I highly reccommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> and my skin is really clearing.  </li>
            <li> After one month my skin was free of blemishes and redness and my pores were smaller.</li>
            <li> This system works very well.</li>
            <li> Now, I use it every day and its working very well.</li>
            <li> It has improved her skin and she is much happier.</li>
            <li> I really do reccommend this product.</li>
            <li> I only use maybe 1-2 products at a time, and all of them are light and airy.    </li>
            <li> I figured there wasn&#x27;t really a solution for my acne</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> i really recommend the microderm scrub.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> One thing I&#x27;m really hoping for Exposed to come out with is an SPF based moisturizer</li>
            <li> I thank her for her prompt assistance so that my problem was solved reasonably fast.  </li>
            <li> Products are gentle on the skin yet somehow manage to do the job.</li>
            <li> Their stuff is very helpful and knowledgeable.</li>
            <li> AND I AM VERY GRATEFUL</li>
            <li> Just like the rest of the reviews for this product, I&#x27;ve tried absolutely everything to no avail.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a great feeling to have such inner peace knowing he will not have to suffer with these problems like I did into adulthood.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Proactiv, some over the counter acne wash, nothing&#x27;s really worked for me.</li>
            <li> The product has really done nothing.</li>
            <li> A highly recommended product!</li>
            <li> I got the expanded package because I really wanted the moisturizer as I am from Chicago and my skin dries out in the winter.  </li>
            <li> My chin is so much smoother and cleaner now than before.  </li>
            <li> Science and nature really do work together.</li>
            <li> They have even let me keep an extra kit they sent by accident for FREE.</li>
            <li> Thanks for your follow up.  ,</li>
            <li> Through using exposed, I saw amazingly fast results in a matter of days</li>
            <li> Then I went to Proactiv+ with much excitement, but it didn&#x27;t make much of a difference.  </li>
            <li> Exposed has really helped me a lot.</li>
            <li> I had tried absolutely everything.</li>
            <li> This cleared up my whole face</li>
            <li> I really think it is the combination of the salicylic acid and the benzoyl peroxide.</li>
            <li> I have tried absolutely everything from OTC products to precription topicals to oral medication and nothing ever helped.</li>
            <li> Haha.  </li>
            <li> After trying a variety of acne skin care products and &amp;#34;kits&amp;#34; that didn&#x27;t work, I was really worried about trying Exposed and wasting money.  </li>
            <li> Either way it didn&#x27;t look much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The kit comes with a moisturizer that I fully expected to use but my skin has been so healthy with the rest of the system I haven&#x27;t needed</li>
            <li> The system is straight forward containing the ingredients you need to fight acne- benzoyl peroxide &amp; salicylic acid.  </li>
            <li> i try so much stuff</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a product that is gentle on your face and won&#x27;t irritate your skin, I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> and I thought there is nothing really</li>
            <li> I was ready to buy Proactive when I came across this product.  </li>
            <li> After looking into anti-acne treatments on a whim, I settled on this -- and absolutely adore it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend giving these products a try!</li>
            <li> After reading much reviews, I decided that I would order Exposed skincare products for her.</li>
            <li> So this really works.</li>
            <li> One last thing, Exposed is so confident in their success rate that they offer 1 year money back guarantee.</li>
            <li> I hope that very soon they will all disappear!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> I find the price reasonable and I always buy the expanded set as I like the moisturiser.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> I was sticking to the skin care routine very well, but I kept suffering form this jaw-line acne and Proactiv wouldn&#x27;t cure it.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I really like the outcome of it and recommend it to those also struggling with acne.</li>
            <li> now my whole face is acne .</li>
            <li> The products really do work.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone that knows me because they know how much I struggled before</li>
            <li> You really have to be patient to use this product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s risks and feel this product provides a much wiser, safer option.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much acne to begin with, but after using Exposed</li>
            <li> First I order online and for the first few days of use the product was ok.</li>
            <li> Exposed is not a miracle product, nothing really is.</li>
            <li> And knowing how many different products you get that last for two months - the price was worth it for me.</li>
            <li> but I really like the Benzoyl Peroxide for spot treatments.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t really have acne until I was out of my teens.</li>
            <li> this made my eyelashes fall out at a much faster rate than normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Additionally, the products do not smell like medicine and they are extremely gentle.</li>
            <li> I do not break out nearly as much</li>
            <li> I started eliminating the products one-by-one to find out which ones I really need.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> REALLY WANT PEOPLE TO SEE</li>
            <li> It really does.</li>
            <li> Its really working</li>
            <li> I appreciated that</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t finished using the whole kit yet</li>
            <li> I wash my make up off using Cetaphil Gentle Cleansing Antibacterial Bar Soap.***&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li> this means you probably signed up for a membership to get the discount if you got the product straight off their site.</li>
            <li> #34;Club Exposed Membership details: If you ordered a product including a free membership in Club Exposed, you will receive the following benefits:&lt;br /&gt;  1.</li>
            <li> We would highly recommend this line of products!</li>
            <li> Their products have really helped me.  </li>
            <li> and i must say that its starting to clear most of my acne.</li>
            <li> I liked the minimal number of all natural ingredients and what they were.</li>
            <li> it suits me (currently I&#x27;m using the basic kit), and change my ship dates online at my own convenience.</li>
            <li> As an adult in my 30&#x27;s you could imagine how distressing this could get, but after so many years of battling acne my skin has finally cleared up.</li>
            <li> We still marvel on how this was the only product to help her and continues to help her maintain a clear healthy face.  </li>
            <li> Exposed actually helped control my acne, making it more clear than it has been for years.</li>
            <li> At least it is getting her into a regimine for good skin care.  </li>
            <li> What pleased me was that it was a mix of natural extracts and acne medicines as well as the one year money back guarantee.  </li>
            <li> Exposed was the first thing that consistently kept my skin clear.  </li>
            <li> Love how I have such sensitive skin and</li>
            <li> I used many acne skin care lines over the years from over the counter to prescription level so in comparison, this line feels gentler on my skin and because of it, I haven&#x27;t broken out more.</li>
            <li> my face was clear!!!</li>
            <li> The e-mail states that there is no need to rush sending back the product because I have a whole year!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks, and the acnes completely gone!!!</li>
            <li> The description made it sound like it was way better than proactive and all other brands, but it&#x27;s all about the same to me.</li>
            <li> But seriously what&#x27;s more important an acne free face, or 10 extra minutes of sleep before school or work!</li>
            <li> My first month of college in a new city my face exploded in acne.</li>
            <li> I started using the cleanser and toner from the new kit about two or three weeks ago, but I am still using the moisturizer and acne and pore serums from the first kit.</li>
            <li> When she does, it is minor and easy to keep under control.</li>
            <li> A couple of notes - don&#x27;t use the clear pore serum near your eyes - that stuff is POWERFUL!</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s light and fresh and there is no lingering odor like some other products I have tried.  </li>
            <li> It has made a serious difference in my skin, which is the most important thing.</li>
            <li> On a doctor review site I saw that they recommended this one over proactive and even though I had never heard of it, it seemed like it had a lot of active ingredients that would help and I liked that it used natural things too.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My face is super clear, and my skin is very soft.  </li>
            <li> and I was originally using Proactive Extra Strength</li>
            <li> This product has worked better for me than when I used Proactiv or other skin care products.</li>
            <li> Cleared up my skin without drying it out, something that I hadn&#x27;t been able to find with other products.  </li>
            <li> I give Exposed Skin Care 5 very big golden stars!</li>
            <li> I had such faith in the results and was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many other acne products that do not seem to work for me.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Exposed Expanded Kit after trying many other skin care products, including Proactiv.</li>
            <li> They told me I had agreed to this when I made my original purchase and that this is why they send an e-mail 5 days prior to charging your account.</li>
            <li> just don&#x27;t feel like Exposed worked any better than any other skincare product I&#x27;ve tried, and I feel like</li>
            <li> It only takes a couple of minutes as a part of your routine in the morning and at night and is WELL worth it!  </li>
            <li> This product has worked better for my skin than any other acne product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally leave feedback for a product,  but since this product really is working for my adult acne, it&#x27;s worth a write</li>
            <li> I have tried many different acne products in the past and this is the first acne fighting set that I have found that not only works, but gives great and lasting results.</li>
            <li> However the younger daughter follows the directions exactly and she has rarely a breakout.  </li>
            <li> So i reverted to just trying to keep my skin clean and putting topical solutions on blemishes which appeared.  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant to believe that a system could actually help my situation, since I was striking out left and right, but I was very pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> I was so hesitant buying this product because I know for a fact a lot of the reviews on here are a straight out scam, from people the company hired to give their product high stars.</li>
            <li> The system tells you to first wash with the cleanser, then apply the clearing tonic with just your fingers (I use a cotton pad as lightly as possible since the liquid just slips right through my fingers), then apply the acne treatment serum in the morning.</li>
            <li> I had to change my diet and get my omega 6 and 3 ratio in line (more fish, less sugar / carbs)... which really helped.</li>
            <li> I liked the idea of it because of the natural remedies combined with the typical treatments.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still oily but my pores are smaller, my face is softer and smoother and when I do get a breakout, I don&#x27;t feel the need to pick at it as much because this product clears it up quickly.  </li>
            <li> My skin is combination, but more on the dry side, &amp; sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I am not completely acne free at the moment, but I have seen a lot of improvements.</li>
            <li> It made my skin extremely oily and break out more than normal.</li>
            <li> All the Exposed products I have used have a really nice quality feel, and do not cause excessive dryness.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything short of going to the dermotologist for a full on treatment.</li>
            <li> And although I have never had full on acne I have definitely suffered from those nagging episodic breakouts that seemed to come from nowhere.  </li>
            <li> It is also true that your skin can eventually get used to a product and suddenly it no longer works for you.  </li>
            <li> Exposed is the first acne treatment system to completely get rid of acne.</li>
            <li> I had a face full of red irritated heaps of acne.</li>
            <li> On the up side, it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out like most skin care products and is more natural than previous ones I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> This product works, my teen daughter had tried other products with little results, this one has cleared up her skin wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I tried many other products - I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I found this kit that sounded pretty promising since they give you not only a 30 day money back guarantee but a whole year!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product feeling a bit sceptical due to the high price, but after a month a have to say my acne is significantly reduced and my scars are fading!</li>
            <li> I also love that it does not bleach my clothes like a brand I previously used.</li>
            <li> Additionally when less pimples appear I stop touching my face, which is the biggest issue causing my acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through cheapo in store products (too many to name) and some of the more expensive products:</li>
            <li> I like the expanded kit particularly because it comes with the moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> and it left my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After only 4 months, my face isn&#x27;t 100% clear, but I feel comfortable leaving the house without makeup</li>
            <li> I also tried Retin-A - but that just ended up burning my skin and causing big red patches all over it making me even more of a monster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mainly had acne because I work in a kitchen so every time I used this kit</li>
            <li> This is one main reason for why I use exposed.</li>
            <li> (this is the main acne product I believe).</li>
            <li> a clean cotton fabric to GENTLY PAT dry your face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is true that this is not clearly stated with the membership upfront, however it really should be the responsibility of the consumer to see what they are signing up for.</li>
            <li> It is more rigorous that other products I have tried but is totally worth the extra time and money to have clear skin again!!</li>
            <li> At first my face broke out a little bit more, but then after about 3 weeks it got,  and stayed clear.</li>
            <li> I researched pretty much all of the over the counter acne medications and finally went out on a whim and got Exposed even though i didn&#x27;t know too much about it.</li>
            <li> and i have very sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> On top of that the price, while it is in truth competitive with other top sellers, it is completely out of my budget especially now being recently laid</li>
            <li> His face was a mess and after 2 weeks he looked 10x better.</li>
            <li> After 2 months of using these products my acne has been clear and only once in a while get a light breakout which for my acne that&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend getting the expanded kit, it&#x27;s worth the extra couple bucks to get the full results.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>

            <li> And I would highly recommend giving it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly reccomend.</li>
            <li> I began seeing results within 2 weeks of using Exposed and while I periodically have breakouts, the serums calm them down quickly.</li>
            <li> I do have to say that other than the acne that remains and continues to come back, my face feels amazing.</li>
            <li> This product helped clear up my skin better than any other system.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin to benzoyl peroxide which most of the other products on the market contain.  </li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend this product to help clear up mild to moderate acne</li>
            <li> One last thing I would like to compliment is their friendly, professional and prompt customer service.</li>
            <li> Has worked far better for me than any other product.</li>
            <li> My skin is soft, NOT dry, NOT red - just free of blemishes!  </li>
            <li> For some reason when I hit 22 I broke out with a ton of white and black heads and nothing worked to clear my usually good skin.</li>
            <li> But about 6wks after I sarted to use exposed skin my face was clear and my confidence returned!!</li>
            <li> but I use a tiny bit 1-2 times a day and am still on my first order!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using exposed for a little more than 6 months now.</li>
            <li> WOW!!</li>
            <li> The kit is advertised as a month&#x27;s supply, but I have been using this product for a little more than 5 months and have had to reorder the kit once.</li>
            <li> He committed to their regular, consistent use, and he is sold!  </li>
            <li> The formula is literally like water, and comes out too quickly (so I tend to waste a lot in the morning with quick wake-up rushes to go out).  </li>
            <li> A nice feature Exposed has is that you can have them automatically send you a new Exposed Acne Treatment system so you won&#x27;t have to ever go back on the site unless you want to order other products, which I also recommend.</li>
            <li> and I picked exposed because of the natural gentle ingredients alongside of the acne medication and proactive</li>
            <li> None of these products worked for my face, and I really felt like I would never have clear skin again.  </li>
            <li> Proactiv was very drying to my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I was so surprised, this stuff really does work.</li>
            <li> This is really working well to clear up my daughters acne.</li>
            <li> He has real oily, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> but it really does clear up almost overnight now.</li>
            <li> , I had a laugh line/wrinkle developing and I&#x27;m only 23!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t eat chocolate, rarely eat greasy food and the only thing I drink is water.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t write reviews but this product has been a life saver.</li>
            <li> i was completely sold when i saw there was a full 1 year money back</li>
            <li> The Exposed line of products are well worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> so many acne cleansers have, which feel as though they are having some heavy duty cleansing effect).</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and normally break out along my t-zone.  </li>
            <li> but I definitely think it is worth working into my budget.</li>
            <li> I have tried Proactiv with moderate results, Murad with some success, and every over-the-counter drugstore product on the shelves.</li>
            <li> So we will give it a few more weeks to decide how well it is working.</li>
            <li> Apparently when I ordered the first kit, I agreed to continue ordering one every 60 days.</li>
            <li> but I liked that it had natural ingredients as well as the usual salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide.</li>
            <li> I love this product because there aren&#x27;t any harsh chemicals yet</li>
            <li> I’m surewithin a few more weeks</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews</li>
            <li> 2 years ago, Exposed success rate was only 90%, and now its 98%!!!</li>
            <li> Proactiv was too harsh on my skin, but this Acne Treatment worked phenomenally.</li>
            <li> After discontinuing use, my face has returned to normal after ~30 hours.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve seen each other in person a few times since that trip and each time I stare at her in AW as it is so amazing to see such a clear and healthy face.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have nearly as many blackheads or red, dry areas.  </li>
            <li> About half would clear up my skin most the way or reduce the amount of acne I had</li>
            <li> This seemed to have more natural ingredients that were less drying on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I USED TO WEAR A HEAVY OIL FREE FOUNDATION TO ATTEMPT TO COVER MY IMPERFECTIONS, BUT NOW HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CHANGE TO A LIGHTER PRODUCT DUE</li>
            <li> The acne seems to come right back as soon as we stop using it.</li>
            <li> I just apply on my left and right cheek.</li>
            <li> If I run out of product my face goes right back to where it was</li>
            <li> Ok so I was a little sceptical when I first bought this, so I only bought the travel kit to start off with.  </li>
            <li> It mostly flared up once a month, but was getting steadily worse (which is weird because I am an adult and used to have perfect skin).</li>
            <li> Now in my early 30&#x27;s I still struggle with acne, but my skin is super sensitive so it is difficult to find a product that is gentle and effective.</li>
            <li> That being said I do have very sensitive skin, but exposed definitely wasn&#x27;t right for me.</li>
            <li> After Week 2, I noticed a definite improvement in my skin&#x27;s tone and texture, and that one of the persistent cysts on my chin was more apparent, but felt smaller.</li>
            <li> I thought my skin would clear up, or look a little better if I didn&#x27;t wear makeup for a couple days.</li>
            <li> I still give it a full 5 stars because no other product I have tried to date comes even close to providing the same result.</li>
            <li> and I woke up to a very bright red, itchy, angry face.</li>
            <li> I decided it was time to switch to something new.</li>
            <li> I had brought with me new bottles of everything for the trip, thank God.  </li>
            <li> However, I am still getting new acne to pop up on my face.</li>
            <li> The new flare ups could be my fault which is why I gave this product a 4 and not a 3.</li>
            <li> Live and Learn.</li>
            <li> So I decided to try something new since Proactiv was just not getting the job done anymore.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new skin care line.  </li>
            <li> and I had forgotten to reorder a new batch for her and the acne returned.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s like my skin can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> So I found myself having to purchase additional cleanser and toner before the new kit arrives in 60 days.</li>
            <li> Automatic re-delivery of a new Exposed Acne Kit</li>
            <li> I then tried Proactive Plus for about 90 days, because that was new advertised great product, but that only made my acne worse.  </li>
            <li> I had such high hopes but I&#x27;m going back to my original idea.</li>
            <li> Within 2 weeks of her using this product as directed, I could already tell a huge improvement as the acne was getting smaller and wasn&#x27;t quite as red.  </li>
            <li> I have used everything from the cheap over the counter acne treatments to pro active and prescription benzoyl peroxide washes.</li>
            <li> I am 34 years old, I&#x27;ve had mild to moderate acne since my early teens.</li>
            <li> (because, honestly, I don&#x27;t think it could&#x27;ve gotten any worse) but eventually (after about 8 weeks of use) it did get SO MUCH</li>
            <li> You can also send in your empty bottles of your old treatment that didn&#x27;t work for credits and free products.</li>
            <li> I finally got curious and did a google search for better options a month ago.  </li>
            <li> The products last approximately 1 1/2 months so its a great value as well.  </li>
            <li> I really believe the key is the whole system, INCLUDING the pro-biotic.  </li>
            <li> I sure wish I would have found it sooner because within a few days of using it my face was completely clear.  </li>
            <li> In fact, if I remain patient, in a few more months I think there will be enough improvement for me to feel confident enough to drop my concealer from my daily routine.</li>
            <li> Thankfully Exposed made an effective acne product that doesn&#x27;t leave me red and flaky, even after a few months of</li>
            <li> There have been a couple of times I considered switching to a different systems, just to try something new, and I have ALWAYS regretted it!!!</li>
            <li> first two weeks I did have a little bit of a breakout - but it was a quick one, and their website said it would happen.</li>
            <li> I have tried every single acne product on the market from ProActiv to Clean &amp; Clear (</li>
            <li> It is very refreshing, but definitely has a bit of a sting at first, but at least you know it&#x27;s working!</li>
            <li> Very natural and plant-like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft and feels well taken care</li>
            <li> product is very gentle and doesn&#x27;t leave you all red and flaky in an attempt to stop pimples</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have VERY sensitive skin</li>
            <li> As a disclaimer, I do have very sensitive skin, so this may not be the case for everyone.</li>
            <li> and she let me know that politely and very professionally.</li>
            <li> I had noticeable results within 10 days and within a month my skin was clear!</li>
            <li> I usually do not write reviews.</li>
            <li> but wow!</li>
            <li> I have tried many different kinds of facial treatment products and this is the only one I have found that does not leave my face feeling oily.</li>
            <li> After using Exposed for one month my skin completely cleared!</li>
            <li> I used to not be able to open my mouth or widen my eyes without my skin searing in pain due to the acne.</li>
            <li> &amp; I have really sensitive skin!  </li>
            <li> and WOW!</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin soft and GLOWING!</li>
            <li> The only one that sort of worked was the Body Shop, but it just wasn&#x27;t consistent and only seemed to make my acne go away faster instead of preventing it from cropping up in the first place.</li>
            <li> First of all, let me begin by saying that I tried tons of different products for my stubborn acne.</li>
            <li> First I noticed that as the breakouts were going thru their cycle, the healing was different.  </li>
            <li> I gave her the products I was used to using normally (Cleanser, Towel, Tonic, Acne Serum, Clear Pore Serum and weekly mask).  </li>
            <li> I wish amazon provided customer satisfaction or a refund with such important issues, such as clear skin.</li>
            <li> I have a hormonal imbalance that causes the acne, as well as many other symptoms, from PCOS, so I believed I would have acne my entire life.</li>
            <li> After two months, my skin completely cleared up!</li>
            <li> And this is going on my 3rd week and it is already helping so much!</li>
            <li> Who cares if Proactiv made my skin baby butt soft--it didn&#x27;t stop my adult acne!  </li>
            <li> This kit has cleared up my teen&#x27;s acne better than any other product we have tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many products in the past and either got no results</li>
            <li> I am getting married next month</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other products tried with no luck: Clearasil, Stridex, Oxy, ProActiv, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Product tried with minor success: Neutrogena Oil-fee Acne Wash</li>
            <li> but your old acne products!</li>
            <li> I do not find it necessary to order the expanded kit, however it may be recommended for the first time.</li>
            <li> I began the system in the morning, following the instructions exactly.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve tried everything else and nothing has worked, give Exposed a try before going to more extreme treatments such as oral meds or surgery.</li>
            <li> Within the first week his breakouts started to lessen and within the second week they disappeared.</li>
            <li> Prior to using this product, I was using another very well-know, very celebrity-endorsed, well advertised acne system for over a year, but I never got the clear skin it promised.  </li>
            <li> You have be consistent with it, you have to be willing to make other changes (diet, water, etc.)</li>
            <li> Since I tried the product first it was obviously opened.</li>
            <li> After the first two months my skin started looking different.</li>
            <li> One thing I&#x27;ve also noticed is that when I take a shower with the product on my face that it makes my face really red, irritated, and hot.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m in my early twenties and was worried this acne would never go away!</li>
            <li> maybe starting with a doctor&#x27;s opinion first would have saved me from looking like a circus clown.</li>
            <li> I am still using the first products that I bought in January, so the products last 4-5 months.</li>
            <li> washing your face GENTLY use your bare hands while using cool/warm water.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure what will happen to my skin if I run out and don&#x27;t buy more, which is a bummer, but for now I am hooked.</li>
            <li> I do have the intention of cancelling my account after I receive my first order and if I like it, sign back up.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Honestly, it&#x27;s not the main ingredients like Benzoyl Peroxide or Salicylic Acid that make the product this good, it&#x27;s the other natural ingredients like their extracts that really mix well together.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve always used clean and clear and Avon acne products and a few natural products, nothing really consistently worked.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m sure ill be able to have clear skin by next kit.</li>
            <li> I have tried proactive (the old one and the new one).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amazing product, I use it everyday and it lasts me as long as it should.</li>
            <li> My skin is pretty clear now except for the occasional outbreak and some fading scars so if your thinking about I say give it a try</li>
            <li> I missed out on so much during that time just trying to avoid anything social where I had to show my face.</li>
            <li> I purchased the kit directly from exposed, and I noticed a charge on my bank account for a second kit 3 months after paying for the first.</li>
            <li> It might be a reaction with the direct constant hot water.</li>
            <li> So if your down and have tried many products i personally stand by this product.</li>
            <li> My older daughter, having a slightly darker complexion, has even experienced bleaching, actual white patches on her face, from some of the more expensive of these products.     </li>
            <li> when you use this product, make sure you have a regular facial to clean your face since what this product does is to clear all the black heads and white heads.  </li>
            <li> I only hope my positive results continue, time will tell</li>
            <li> I decided to buy exposed after seeing all the positive customer reviews and their money back guarantee.</li>
            <li> and when you follow the routine, your skin will be clear and soft within 2 weeks tops!</li>
            <li> currently finishing my first kit and my skin remains completely clear and the scars are almost completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But Wow was I surprised!</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous to try this product because the reviews seemed too good to be true, but this product seriously works!</li>
            <li> I continued to notice improvement, less and less new pimples, and when I wouldget new ones, they would definitely go away more quickly than before.</li>
            <li> Since benzoyl peroxide started to irritate my skin I had to cancel an acne treatment that worked really well and switched to using those with salicylic acid, which does very little to clean my acne.</li>
            <li> I did not have chronic outbreaks, but always had 1-3 large red ones I had to hide with makeup.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the towel much because its not as smooth as I expected it to be and not long lasting</li>
            <li> price is a little on the high side for me, especially as I also have to pay higher postage fees to have it shipped to the UK, but I consider it absolutely worth it for the results I have had.</li>
            <li> /&gt;She was extremely prompt and quick to reply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my skin dry like most other products do</li>
            <li> My skin has never been so clear and</li>
            <li> my face feels clean and soft with noticeably less oil and my blemishes are scabbing up and healing.</li>
            <li> I tried this after trying Philosophy Clear days ahead line and also tried Dermalogica...</li>
            <li> They also never claim that you will have 100% clear skin, with no breakouts.</li>
            <li> Even my friends have commented about how clear my skin has looked.  </li>
            <li> My skin has not yet shown improvement, but I am hopeful it will eventually clear up.</li>
            <li> After a week my skin was completely clear of pimples and blackheads.</li>
            <li> Amazon uses images throughout the product pages that clearly indicate the product is backed by a one year guarantee.  </li>
            <li> Combination of these products keep my skin clear, no peeling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything you can think of to try to clear my skin up and nothing worked until I found this.</li>
            <li> Clear skin?</li>
            <li> I chuckle every time I put on the Clear Pore Serum because it reminds me of the smell of salad dressing, but the odor is gone once it dries.  </li>
            <li> and so have tried just about every product out there to clear up my skin.</li>
            <li> AND MY SKIN WAS CLEAR IN 2 WEEKS.  </li>
            <li> My skin was amazingly clear until around the age of 16-17, when I began to get spots.  </li>
            <li> I bought the starter kit with the cleanser, toner, acne treatment, clear pore serum, and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I just wish the core clear serium wasn&#x27;t so sticky.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d never have clear skin again, but this kit changed all of that.</li>
            <li> Dont trust the gurantee that it gives you clear skin in 30 days.</li>
            <li> Clearly that is a lie.</li>
            <li> 2 weeks, my face was completely clear, and I was seeing siome improvement in the look of the acne scars.</li>
            <li> Acne Treatment Serum during the day &amp; Clear Pore Serum at night.</li>
            <li> My face and chest have never been so clear.</li>
            <li> I followed the kit instructions and my face was clear in 5 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I had clear skin before that</li>
            <li> Lets be clear..</li>
            <li> BAM clear skin.</li>
            <li> My son started using this and his skin was clear in days.</li>
            <li> every 60 days, so you are never without clear skin.</li>
            <li> just wow.</li>
            <li> Proactiv was not effective nor did it make my skin feel healthy.</li>
            <li> The products are gentle on the skin and the results are obvious.</li>
            <li> My 13 year old daughter now uses the products as well.  </li>
            <li> I totally recommend the whole kit.</li>
            <li> My daughter has sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Exposed Expanded kit for my teenage daughter after doing much research.  </li>
            <li> I decided to start using this product because it&#x27;s natural</li>
            <li> Thanks Exposed for giving relief to the teen in our home.</li>
            <li> Every now and again, my 21 yr old has a breakout and uses Exposed Skincare products to treat until it goes away.</li>
            <li> I am 18 years old and have tried everything to get rid of my acne.</li>
            <li> I used to get up early</li>
            <li> Even washing it gently with my hands would leave it red, patchy, and swollen.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item directly from the Exposed website.</li>
            <li> I have sufferred from acne since i was 16 yrs old</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft, is glowing, and is clear.</li>
            <li> But the natural way was the way I wanted to go</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve battled with acne since I was 11 years old -</li>
            <li> they do irritate my sensitive skin, but I&#x27;ve found how to use them so it suits my skin.  </li>
            <li> ....it&#x27;s cleared up my skin and completely evened out my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> At 35 years old I was mortified when I started having adult acne.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and proactive</li>
            <li> I had tried antibiotics and Proactive but neither worked, I was completely astounded when I saw my skin this clear.  </li>
            <li> My skin is soft, supple, non-greasy, and almost blemish-free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product completely reversed my skin, my acne scars are gone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Proactiv twice with no results, almost all of Neutrogena&#x27;s line, Biore, Phisoderm, even an all natural witch hazel beauty bar.</li>
            <li> I was very dubious of the supposed effectiveness of their treatment, especially since it was structured like Proactiv and that hadn&#x27;t worked.</li>
            <li> I cook frequently, so I know what sage smells like</li>
            <li> I am in my early 40&#x27;s and had struggled with adult acne.  </li>
            <li> As a woman in my early 40s I&#x27;ve kept adult acne at bay for just over 10 years.</li>
            <li> I have been using exposed acne treatments for 6 months and have noticed a considerable difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> wow.</li>
            <li> I bought this after suffering months of adult acne on my chin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve battled skin issues as an adult for over a decade</li>
            <li> PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT FOR MY 17 YEAR OLD SON, WHO HAD SEVERE ACNE.</li>
            <li> I have battled with adult acne for 15 years.</li>
            <li> I use the complete Exposed system including the microdermabrasion scrub and mask.</li>
            <li> I have seen a marked improvement in my skin tone and clarity.</li>
            <li> I really like that there are different products for treating acne and for shrinking pores.</li>
            <li> I used them for at least 3 months or more, because I know all the treatments will need time to \\&quot;heal up\\&quot; the skin.</li>
            <li> But Exposed Skin Care system has made my face much clearer than before after about several weeks of use.</li>
            <li> I have PCOS and began breaking out at 10 years old.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this works for me.  </li>
            <li> They have been very flexible when I needed to swap out a different item in my kits or change the shipping dates.  </li>
            <li> My pores look tighter and the scars are reduced quite considerably reduced.  </li>
            <li> I had 2 existing blackheads when I started applying the product and within 3 days they were completely invisible.  </li>
            <li> I am now 29 years old and wish i could have found this product sooner.</li>
            <li> I have tried proactive, every over the counter products, natural remedies, and prescriptions.</li>
            <li> and it felt soft.</li>
            <li> I have an extremely sensitive and oily skin...</li>
            <li> I have suffered with problem skin since I was a teenager, and have tried nearly every product on the market.  </li>
            <li> I am 22 years old</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it since early 2014.  </li>
            <li> I nearly didn&#x27;t buy Exposed because some reviewers indicated they thought the reviews were staged.</li>
            <li> I began struggling with adult cystic acne.  </li>
            <li> My advise is if you have allergies or sensitive skin might be to find another product.</li>
            <li> Then I went all natural with tea tree oil, castile soap, and shea butter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 33 years old.  </li>
            <li> Then I stumbled across exposed products on line early 2006</li>
            <li> fact is I applied product morning and evening as instructed and it has showed considerable results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually had a couple of compliments on my skin - one noticing that it looked so much clearer</li>
            <li> It has been well worth the expense as I now have a clear neck and back with only occassional breakouts.</li>
            <li> The product is not overdrying and the smell has a natural herb like scent to it.</li>
            <li> I tried multiple product and nothing would work very well at all.</li>
            <li> None of them work nearly as well as Exposed.</li>
            <li> I have now been using Exposed for almost six months and my acne has done a complete turn-around.  </li>
            <li> It said guaranteed clear skin in one month and that didn&#x27;t work for me so far.</li>
            <li> up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I researched and researched acne treatments, natural remedies, changed my diet, etc.</li>
            <li> or \\&quot;we are busy now and will call you back\\</li>
            <li> I wanted to try these products because of the natural ingredients and beneficial age fighting products.</li>
            <li> Fast and simple shipping of reorder products.</li>
            <li> My 14 year old son&#x27;s face was covered with acne....</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realise we had signed up for monthly deliveries with debits automatically going from our account, these turned out to be rather erratic and too frequent.  </li>
            <li> Started in my teens and continued to my adult years.</li>
            <li> I was afflicted with adult acne in my early twenties.</li>
            <li> I also suggest using sensitive skin type SPF face lotion and SPF eye cream in conjunction with the products as they do not contain ingredients that will protect you from the sun.</li>
            <li> I bought a kit to treat frequent breakouts.  </li>
            <li> but it hasn&#x27;t completely cleared up yet.</li>
            <li> : It&#x27;s completely up to you.</li>
            <li> my skin has completely cleared up as well as the blotchiness is now gone.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone</li>
            <li> Switching to Exposed has not only saved me but also, given me back the smile i wanted on my face.  </li>
            <li> I think the formula needs to have a bit more substance, or else it&#x27;s a potential waste of money.&lt;br</li>
            <li> tried so many different acne treatments, majority of the dried my skin</li>
            <li> Although the product is relatively expensive, it is worth it to me to have healthy skin.</li>
            <li> As a guy who has struggled with acne and oily skin throughout my teens and 20s, I&#x27;ve tried tons of products out there with minimal success.  </li>
            <li> The thing that made me skeptical about this site before is that I couldn&#x27;t have made the transfer using PayPal, however seeing that Google verification was available (which I personally trust with loyalty, if you don&#x27;t feel comfortable about the lack of security other than Google, that is completely fine)</li>
            <li> I have used other skin care products of this genre but they always dry out my skin pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin so smooth and even less breakouts!</li>
            <li> it is a little pricy, but worth it!</li>
            <li> If they do, it&#x27;s very mild and usually earthy smelling, like the sage and pumpkin.</li>
            <li> Clean and clear dried me out, proactiv made my skin scaly and sensitive.</li>
            <li> I still have a few minor (manageable) break outs, but at least my skin is more clear and feels healthy.</li>
            <li> I had mild acne and dark spots.</li>
            <li> Exposed Acne Treatment improved the appearance of my complexion without irritating it and drying it off  since the products have natural ingredients that leave my skin feeling fresh and clean every time.</li>
            <li> It seems as though every time I get a new shipment or a new package/bottle of it the consistency is different.</li>
            <li> I tried the Neutrogena acne kit which just left me with super dry and oily skin.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a LONG way : )    </li>
            <li> The Clear Pore and Acne Treatment serum&#x27;s work exactly as they should, and the moisturizer works miracles, especially during the initial adjustment period.</li>
            <li> Within just a few weeks of using the product, my son&#x27;s face began clearing up significantly.</li>
            <li> Most skin care programs will warn you that it usually gets worse before it gets better.</li>
            <li> I can probably switch down to the basic kit and it will still be fine.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this for anyone especially those that feel like they have lost hope in finding something that will clear up their skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried expensive products, cheap products and everything in between for my adult acne with super sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend their products especially to those are having adult acne problem.    </li>
            <li> and I finally found a skin care line that made my skin better, not only helped keep it clear but also MUCH less oily</li>
            <li> I am a 30 year old female who has struggled with mild to moderate acne for the last 15 years.</li>
            <li> I am a 42-year -old female and I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Not only has it cleared up my skin, (without leaving it dry and flakey), it&#x27;s also relatively inexpensive and they have fantastic customer service...</li>
            <li> with 28 years of age I can finally enjoy having a ´normal´ clear skin, and that happened after only month and half of using.</li>
            <li> Besides those big acnes, I also had many small pimples.</li>
            <li> My face not only is still exactly the same</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t get a perfect result from it, but it contains the worst problems pretty well.</li>
            <li> Fortunately I only had mild acne on my face, but severe acne on the back of my neck, as well as the rest of my back.</li>
            <li> Bacne has been a consistent problem for me for the last 15 years, I would never take my shirt off during the summer because I was embarassed by my back.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of buying this product at first, but after reading so many customer reviews, I figured I would give it a try.</li>
            <li> About a month and a half I did begin to see mild improvements.</li>
            <li> After the first night of using it, I woke up the next morning and my face was swollen and red.</li>
            <li> It seriously work and of course like any other product just wait it for a good two weeks.  </li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone, from those who get an occasional breakout to people with severe acne.</li>
            <li> Overall, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The high quality ingredients not only treated my acne but improved the look and feel of my skin.</li>
            <li> so highly recommend this to everyone who has acne even if it&#x27;s only because of what you do or where you work</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this facial cleansing system to anyone...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s highly reactive, which means I don&#x27;t only get acne, but eczema as well.</li>
            <li> I had such high expectations for this product.</li>
            <li> There is no other word for it!</li>
            <li> The cleanser is easy on your skin and washes off quickly (especially with the included DermX cloth), and the tonic isn&#x27;t nearly as harsh as others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking for something gentle to provide long lasting results</li>
            <li> I have battled breakouts my whole life, and currently have moderate adult acne.</li>
            <li> /&gt;^^^It is important to note that not many people notice this, the membership notice is also noted on the bottom of their site^^^&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While I would have expected this to happen during the first week or two I did not expect this to continue to be a problem.</li>
            <li> and my skin is almost back to normal.</li>
            <li> FYI, my face skin is a combination of oily in the inner circle and normal at the outer circle of my face.</li>
            <li> After I stopped treatment it took months for my face to back to normal.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t feel like it was good enough, the product has broken the regular cycle of one spot coming up as another one goes</li>
            <li> Many other acne products left my face dry and flakey, but this Exposed system works womderfully!  </li>
            <li> As I began using it this morning after I awoke, I had already noticed some inflammation EXTREMELY CALM DOWN.</li>
            <li> so i could give my face time to calm down before i went to work.</li>
            <li> I use Exposed in conjunction with taking the Pill, which has helped calm down my skin over the years.</li>
            <li> For the last couple years (mid 30&#x27;s) other than the few occasional pimples I was in pretty good shape and didn&#x27;t have to mess with it much.</li>
            <li> I was a little intimidated by the price to begin with, but I have to say so far it&#x27;s been worth every penny.</li>
            <li> My skin is clearer, there is hardly any redness any more and my pores are smaller.</li>
            <li> Subsequently I have tried numerous products that are available on the market, however they haven&#x27;t worked, or I have had to stop using them due to incompatibility with my skin type.  </li>
            <li> This product has given him such a new outlook.</li>
            <li> In probably 5-6 weeks I had almost stopped getting new spots, so my skin was finally getting the chance to begin to heal.  </li>
            <li> I have combo skin- dry cheeks and very oily T-zone.</li>
            <li> The only negative to this product is the priceline, and if you have more than one person using it.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and the products do not dry out or irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> It is the only thing that has really seemed to make the blackheads go away &amp; make my pores look smaller.</li>
            <li> Recently however, I developed SEVERE adult acne.</li>
            <li> and I found that proactive dried my skin out too quickly.</li>
            <li> I still have small blemishes and redness but can actually notice significant improvement and haven’t had any new breakouts.</li>
            <li> I have mild to moderate acne, large pores and oily skin, with a few cysts back from my bare minerals days that I could never get rid of (the bare minerals story is a rant that I will not go into here).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin is a lot clearer and a barely get any pimples!</li>
            <li> I used to have dehydrated but oily skin, so white-head is the major problem to my skin.  </li>
            <li> My favorite is the probiotic complex, because it is just a pill and it works inside and out!</li>
            <li> Now, 5 months later his acne is completely gone!</li>
            <li> Started using this product 10 days ago and already I can see a major difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> She began using them and within a short period of maybe 2 weeks, her acne began to disappear completely!</li>
            <li> I still haven&#x27;t grown out of it and no other acne treaments worked.</li>
            <li> I now have no more spots, and although my skin is still oily, it is significantly reduced.</li>
            <li> Since I have used this product, I have not had any major breakouts.</li>
            <li> I used the Facial Cleanser every morning when I first woke up and every night before bed (on my face, neck, shoulders &amp; chest), and then I used the Clearing Tonic and would let it air dry off my face &amp; body.</li>
            <li> [...] offers an extremely long and detailed look at exposed, places ads all over its site for exposed, and then offers only short blurbs for other acne care products.</li>
            <li> Just a little info, for me personally the facial cleanser is always the first to be used so it might be worth your while stocking up two at a time, that way you won&#x27;t run short.</li>
            <li> I am a 24 year old mother that has been dealing with mild regular and cystic acne for a few years now.</li>
            <li> and I saw exposed and thought well I&#x27;ve wasted way more money on other treatments that didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with acne so long and my main motivation was that I DID NOT want acne when I was going to college.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product for a couple days and my skin feels so soft and clean, and I can see my old acne scars starting to fade and new blemishes are shrinking slowly.</li>
            <li> The only thing I had done differently in my routine was try a new primer from Smashbox but even after I stopped using it (and got a refund!)</li>
            <li> I tried Proactiv and Dermologica products but with little success.</li>
            <li> Keeping in mind that every face works differently for different people, I am Female, 18-25, mild to moderate acne, Asian.  </li>
            <li> I had a special occasion and of course my face decided to break out a few days prior.</li>
            <li> Within just a few short weeks on the Exposed system, my face cleared right up and its been that way ever since!  </li>
            <li> While other systems have left me dry in some areas and oily in others, with Exposed my face remains shine free without over-drying.     </li>
            <li> But anything with Benzoyl Peroxide generally does bleach.      </li>
            <li> My only suggestion is to always use the cleanser, clearing tonic and clear pore serum.</li>
            <li> and my confidence is back, my skin is clear and i dont have to worry about my pimple breakouts anymore.</li>
            <li> 1x a wk to prevent future breakouts - your skin will be clear.</li>
            <li> The Cleanser, Tonic, and Clear Pore Serum have all leaked out of their bottles while properly stored at room temperature, at sea level, in an upright position on a shelf in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> The red bumps receded and my chin started looking like the clear skin I used to have.  </li>
            <li> last time I had clear chin skin was when I was probably 13, I&#x27;m now</li>
            <li> was only clear until I had finished the prescription.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Every morning, I wash with the Facial Cleanser, use the Clearing Tonic, and then apply the Clear Pore Serum.  </li>
            <li> None of my regular go-to routines were working to clear up my skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not only helped to clear my acne</li>
            <li> I have tried them all and was starting to give up on clear skin</li>
            <li> Not only does it clear my skin of blemishes</li>
            <li> It kept my skin relatively clear, but I&#x27;ve had breakouts every now and then, especially when I&#x27;m stressed out.</li>
            <li> Works wonders, in 5 days I noticed my skin starting to clear up.</li>
            <li> When clearly it states M-F from 8 to 4 pm they are open.</li>
            <li> I was really hesitant to buy it, considering it was something that I hadn&#x27;t heard a whole lot about in the past, but my husband convinced me to go for it</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to help my skin fight aging and clear my occasional breakouts.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything possible to clear my acne.  </li>
            <li> After the second week my skin began to clear and the scars started to fade.</li>
            <li> By the fourth week my skin was completely clear and the scars continued to fade.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> I am 20 years old and I have tried dozens of different acne treatments.</li>
            <li> I am just an 18yr Old College Student, Male.</li>
            <li> With my 19 yr old, his face was red and some of the pimples started to turn black/blue, discoloring his skin.</li>
            <li> It is non-drying, and my adult acne is essentially gone.     </li>
            <li> I am 29 years old and after having 2 kids, my skin and I were constantly at war.</li>
            <li> If you have acne and nothing else has worked so far, definitely try Exposed!</li>
            <li> I was using bare minerals.</li>
            <li> Too much money spent when product doesnt work.</li>
            <li> Not only did I suffer with Acne, BUT I also struggle with sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Not only is my face pimple free, the acne marks left on my skin from past blemishes have faded considerably.</li>
            <li> even the scars from old blemishes are starting to lighten.</li>
            <li> [...] offers a review only for exposed.</li>
            <li> Not only does it work, but it is not harsh on your skin like some others.  </li>
            <li> Although, it did not entirely clear my face as guaranteed in the 30 day period, it showed significant improvement than the last two products I&#x27;ve used (which seems to be an endless process).</li>
            <li> I completely stopped using proactiv and now only use exposed.</li>
            <li> i bought the basic kit for my 19yr old son.  </li>
            <li> people that I barely even talk to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 29 year old male who has suffered from acne since I was an adolescent.</li>
            <li> Exposed Skin Care acne treatment has almost completely cleared up his back and face.  </li>
            <li> Now I just have to wait until the red marks fade completely</li>
            <li> Face is clearing up starting to feel soft.</li>
            <li> I developed cyst like bumps over my entire face.</li>
            <li> With how well it&#x27;s worked so far I&#x27;m definitely optimistic!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cleared all my breakouts and now I barely even get a pimple.</li>
            <li> but then either acne returned or skin became red, flaky and sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 38 year old male who has had acne of varying severity since my teens.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything...from Proactiv to Philosophy, including expensive lines like Dermologica and iS Clinical; but I&#x27;ve never had the kind of results I&#x27;ve seen with Exposed.</li>
            <li> I gave it a month and my skin became inflamed and more broken out.</li>
            <li> I am trying to dicipline myself and sticking with a consistant regiman, but with full time work, 2 small kids, a dog/puppy and a house...</li>
            <li> One of a world famous acne treatment product package also made my skin worse.</li>
            <li> After 3 months, I felt that the product had plateaued because my skin didn&#x27;t seem to be getting better, but it also wasn&#x27;t getting worse.</li>
            <li> The fact for my experience is that is did get worse for a week before it got better.</li>
            <li> Although sometimes it gets worse before it gets better</li>
            <li> For me with this problematic and stubborn acne to have inflammation to calm down in only 24 hours.....</li>
            <li> Old blemishes have totally gone away, I haven&#x27;t seen any new zits, and the pesky ones are starting to get smaller.</li>
            <li> or my skin would be dry, dull and not look healthy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using exposed now for a month but after the first two and a half weeks my skin started to clear up</li>
            <li> It was only about 4 weeks later, my skin did not have any new breakouts.</li>
            <li> I was hoping that after I got my initial acne cleared up that it would prevent new acne from coming back, but that didn&#x27;t happen.</li>
            <li> and I only very occasionally get a new spot -</li>
            <li> such she let me know that they were going to ship the new package the next day.....</li>
            <li> When your skin is clear it takes way less time to get ready in the morning</li>
            <li> Without any treatment, my face typically breaks out constantly (white heads, more apparent black spots, nodules, ect),  </li>
            <li> I even get compliments and people telling me they wished they had my skin :) i&#x27;ve never written a review before but exposed seriously deserve it!</li>
            <li> IVe had breakouts on my forehead and chin due to stress and it&#x27;s happened consistently in the last two years.</li>
            <li> For the last 10 years I have struggled with moderate acne that mainly consisted of occasional breakouts.</li>
            <li> I have oily to normal skin and was pleasantly surprised that this 6-piece kit didnt irritate my skin like other products did.</li>
            <li> In the first two weeks my skin was quite irritated but I applied only every other day to ease this off until my skin got used to it, which it did</li>
            <li> I go to a dermatologist, which in the past has helped, but I have had times where I can not go quickly</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had 2 small pimples, both of which cleared quickly.  </li>
            <li> It made my skin very smooth, but only if my skin wasn&#x27;t already broken out.  </li>
            <li> I would say I have moderate acne but no other product even compared to Exposed!</li>
            <li> But I can calm the skin down pretty quickly with this - it is the only thing I&#x27;ve ever tried that brings my skin vaguely under control, letting it heal.</li>
            <li> When I first bought a trial pack I was a bit skeptical as, the facial cleanser is so light (ie.</li>
            <li> but I kept avoiding it because it was much pricier than the other items I was trying.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care for the other products in the line</li>
            <li> I have struggled with acne for a long time and I have never found any product or treatment system that works nearly as well as exposed!  </li>
            <li> A few warnings (And it says on the product), you will see it get worse at first before it gets better.</li>
            <li> down to the experience of it.----------------&lt;br /&gt;It comes with 4-5 products depending on if you get the moisturizer or not, which I highly recommend for clear</li>
            <li> only dislike is that if I&#x27;m not organised and forget to order the product on time I do need to wait for it to come from America to oz, but the wait time isn&#x27;t too bad, but it would be great to have the option of purchasing the product here in oz&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 30 days and so far I have seen a noticable difference in the tecture of my skin, and my breakouts are much fewer, still a few here and there,</li>
            <li> After years of trying different OTC products &amp; prescribed medications, I have finally found something that keeps my skin clear.   </li>
            <li> Actually, I ordered the smaller, travel sized kit, that guarantees clear skin in 30 days, or money</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only going to buy the acne treatment serum, clear pore serum and clearing tonic in the future.  </li>
            <li> I have used Exposed for a few years now and it really works to keep my skin clear.</li>
            <li> I started using exposed several weeks ago and although it did take a while to get going, my skin is finally beginning to clear up</li>
            <li> I had tried EVERY professional and over the counter acne medication - both topical and internal - since I was a teenager.</li>
            <li> and I learned that not only was facial cleansing a vital part but diet as well.</li>
            <li> I am a 21 year old male who has been battling cystic acne for several years.  </li>
            <li> I am 60 years old and have been fighting menopausal (hormonal related) acne for the last 10 years!!  </li>
            <li> I no longer have drying of my skin, and where my forehead used to always have a thin layer of teeny weeny pimples, Exposed keeps my skin soft, supple, and incredibly smooth.    </li>
            <li> I had tried the popular teen choices from the magazines, an expensive one from Clinique, and even the soap-free hypoallergenic ones; they would momentarily fix my blemishes, but as I kept using them, they stopped working.</li>
            <li> My skin did not dry out at all.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Another concern is the horrible customer service and honestly how many companies can you think of that</li>
            <li> The mask does not dry out your skin.  </li>
            <li> I used to take Raouctan and my skin was always very sensitive and dry.</li>
            <li> The product was a bit drying to my skin at first, so I had to back down to once a day.  </li>
            <li> major low point).</li>
            <li> each and every reviewer on this product and all except a handful (3-5) reviewers who gave it 5 stars have no other product reviews, or if they do, it&#x27;s only stuff made by Exposed skin care.</li>
            <li> I used all other products and they had the same thing; works the first 3 weeks then back to misery.</li>
            <li> Overall, results were clear after the first few of weeks of using their products and continued with further use.</li>
            <li> I tried changing up a few things (had been using a very gentle cleanser and switched to some salicylic acid cleansers).</li>
            <li> No more flaky dry skin, discolouration and huge zits all over.</li>
            <li> Additionally black heads in general should be treated with gentle scrubbing (which the expanded kit does not offer).</li>
            <li> My face felt normal (not over dry or too oily) and I even noticed some scars starting to soften and fade (which isn&#x27;t even something that the company advertises for).</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first - now I&#x27;m a loyal convert.</li>
            <li> I found it actually quite gentle to skin, comparing it with some other products that did nothing to me except irritations.</li>
            <li> In my early 30s, I tried proactive which appeared to clear the pimples but was extremely drying for my skin</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;d been using a natural tea tree oil face wash for a long time</li>
            <li> , I am an 18 year old white female with semi-dry, flaky, sometimes red skin.</li>
            <li> Both my sister and I started ordering the &#x27;Exposed Acne Treatment - Basic kit&#x27; after proactiv failed to give the results we would have liked and we would never go back to anything else.</li>
            <li> I could feel the difference the first day and my skin after a few weeks looks like I never had any skin issues.</li>
            <li> For me, my skin got a little dry and flaky and then it started to clear after the first week.</li>
            <li> That means there are very few products I can use, since most of them are far too harsh and just leave me with eczema instead of (or as well as!)</li>
            <li> First week was not that rough, i got a few new pimples</li>
            <li> give up.i real hard lumps and scar because every thing i try would&lt;br /&gt;either burn my face or just give more ance or big ones that were</li>
            <li> My skin went from being relatively clear for the last several years to non-stop breakouts in the last several months.</li>
            <li> My older daughter is a little less likely to follow the full regime, and so she still experiences some minor issues with her skin.</li>
            <li> I have dry, and also sensitive skin, and wanted to try it out.</li>
            <li> so far working well, makes my face really dry</li>
            <li> The areas of my face that only had minor acne problems have cleared up, but I am still waiting for my chin (my biggest problem area) to clear up.</li>
            <li> Now I can make funny faces all day long and my skin just feels like skin, not a fresh flesh wound.</li>
            <li> The only trouble I had was when I first started.</li>
            <li> and I even grew more obsessive about cleaning my makeup brushes, not touching my face, and changing my pillow case every few days.</li>
            <li> consistent EVERYDAY with the facial treatment</li>
            <li> My favorite items in this line are the Derm-X Cloth which I feel gets every bit of makeup off my face at night, and the Moisture Complex that leaves my skin feeling like satin!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will post another review if not completely update this one once my skin care arrives, but before I did the research to inform myself, I was skeptical due to the numerous amount of negative comments, and you should be able to make your own informed decisions about what you are buying.&lt;br /&gt;It is not likely that this site is trying any tricks on their customers.</li>
            <li> The system calms the skin down and resolves the acne with natural ingredients and no harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> I love that it has soothing elements and only very little harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> Weeks 2 and 3 showed steady improvement, few new minor pimples and my skin started looking healthier.</li>
            <li> I generally buy this set as I think they are the most essential ones, although once they sent me the wrong item.</li>
            <li> After having at least 6-7 deep pimples consistently, my skin was basically clear in a week.  </li>
            <li> This has definitely helped clear my skin up &amp; didn&#x27;t dry my skin out like Proactiv.</li>
            <li> but so far the only thing I&#x27;ve noticed is it makes my skin dry.</li>
            <li> I have used other various products that have provided decent yet short lived results.  </li>
            <li> DUE TO THE WINTER WEATHER CAUSING EXCESSIVE DRYNESS, AND I HAVE ADDED AN OIL FREE MOISTURIZER</li>
            <li> Within 3 days, I seriously did not believe this stuff was true.  </li>
            <li> and if my input can help another exhausted acne victim i will be glad to give it.</li>
            <li> and if my input can help another exhausted acne victim i will be glad to give it.</li>
            <li> Right now Im breaking out pretty bad, but only because I have very compacted skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;The product can get a little crusty on your face throughout the day, but that might be because I&#x27;m putting to much on.</li>
            <li> Even with these little negatives, I think over all the product is really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I no longer get large painful pimples and most of the time I don&#x27;t even have to wear foundation/concealer; whereas before, I wouldn&#x27;t dream of leaving the house without foundation on.  </li>
            <li> I used to have little pimples all over my face especially on my forehead and it made me very selfconsciuos.</li>
            <li> With Exposed, less is more; I use very small amounts for it to work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding products that actually clear my skin without completely drying it up or making it worse before it gets better.</li>
            <li> Amazingly, this unhappy practice has gone since I have been using the Exposed acne products.  </li>
            <li> I was breaking out badly until I did some research and seen all the good reviews and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> The only treatment that really worked so far, at least for me</li>
            <li> Exposed took a few weeks to clear up my skin, but my skin has been clear since.</li>
            <li> And Exposed is honestly the only stuff that actually cleared my skin up in any significant way without awful side effects.</li>
            <li> I still get the occasional lonely pimple now and again, but major clusters of breakouts - GONE!</li>
            <li> I rarely have breakouts and when I do have them, i only get one or two very small blimishes.  </li>
            <li> ALL of these products left my skin in significantly worse condition than it originally</li>
            <li> really became self conscious about my horrible acne because I felt so pretty when I had smooth skin, but when I started to get acne</li>
            <li> hope Exposed Skin Care sees this and does something special for her, if at the very least an acknowledgement and pat on the back.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the clear pore serum is sticky and a bit rubbery and other times</li>
            <li> The ingredients are natural unlike some of the other products out there for acne treatment.  </li>
            <li> Actually, all of the products in this kit have a much shorter and extreme \\&quot;getting used to\\&quot; period than other stuff i have tried.</li>
            <li> I have ordered some refills and other products like a mask that Exposed offers.</li>
            <li> Exposed combines both as well as other natural ingredients (see [...]).</li>
            <li> I have had a very stressful and anxiety-filled 6 months of work and normally that would mean plenty of breakouts for me but not this time around!  </li>
            <li> Nothing really worked for me, I was about to give and try Proactiv (which I&#x27;ve always been pretty skeptical about -</li>
            <li> week: After a week, I have to say, my cyst like pimples have really shrunk into small red marks I can cover up with makeup.  </li>
            <li> I ONLY OCCASIONALLY HAVE A MINOR BREAKOUT, BUT IT CLEARS UP OVERNIGHT WITH THE ACNE TREATMENT SERUM.  </li>
            <li> Within the first few weeks I began to breakout (which I fully expected).</li>
            <li> I live with my sister and we both use the products a little differently.</li>
            <li> Yeah (usually around a certain time of month),</li>
            <li> The first 2 weeks of use were worrying because I broke out pretty badly on my cheeks (where I usually never breakout).</li>
            <li> Within a few weeks I didn’t have any new breakouts and the cystic acne was finally shrinking.</li>
            <li> always seemed to dry my skin up and made me sometimes only use it once a day instead of the standard two times.  </li>
            <li> When I got pregnant with my son, my acne just got worse, and ever since I feel like it&#x27;s been a constant battle - every time one or two pimples/</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve lost over half a bottle of Cleanser and nearly a whole bottle of Tonic due to leakage, and the Pore Serum is so caked around the end of the tube that I almost want to throw it out for being too gross and gooey to touch.</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable and less than other similar products, like Proactiv.</li>
            <li> I have used Exposed for the past 2 months and it works really well.</li>
            <li> and although i still break out, Exposed has definitely helped manage but not completely eliminate my acne</li>
            <li> Gave 4 stars since I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough.</li>
            <li> but I haven’t used it long enough to see those results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it does actually work, and how long depends on the person.</li>
            <li> Also, It may not clear EVERYTHING, there may be that one tiny spot that never goes</li>
            <li> I normally get with harsh acne treatments.</li>
            <li> Since I was using a new product I did have a little dryness</li>
            <li> IT DOESN&#x27;T SEEM TO BE AS STRONG AND IRRITATING AS SOME OTHER PRODUCTS.</li>
            <li> A few new ones popped up</li>
            <li> Having used Proactiv before I knew how the chemicals had an extremely harsh rash like effect of my skin it was time to start something new.</li>
            <li> My one teen gets small breakouts on the face &amp; the other gets the large cysts like ones on his back.</li>
            <li> My now 15 year old daughter had been struggling with face and body acne since 5th grade, so bad that she was embarrassed to wear a bathing suit or a tank top because of her body breakouts.  </li>
            <li> I was having a lot of problems with various products leaving my skin oily or excessively dry.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin but some products still managed to give me red and dry spots where I applied them.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s erasing the scarring along my jaw and bumps from previous acne.</li>
            <li> I tend to have a very oily face and it does nothing to help that problem, but at least the acne that used to be a big concern has been reduced by 85%+!!  </li>
            <li> I got the expanded kit with the lotion because my skin gets dry, but I think the basic would work as well.</li>
            <li> At night before bed I would use the Facial Cleasner and then I would use the Clearing Tonic and waited for it to dry before i would put on the Clearing Pore Serum and leave it on my face over night.</li>
            <li> far, I have used this system just as religiously as I used to use Clinique, with a few exceptions.</li>
            <li> so a downside (which would have been minus 1/2 star if possible) effected me out of personal preference rather than the product itself.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and they all either made my face super red &amp; dry or made me break out worse than before - none of them worked.</li>
            <li> For those of you still on the fence, maybe you could order a single tube of Acne Treatment Serum and give it a test run along with your present skin care routine - applying it after your toner and before your moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my son and he has only been using for a couple of weeks but so far I have only noticed a small amount of change.  </li>
            <li> He had tried several other name brand products prior to using Exposed and did not get the results he has gotten from Exposed.</li>
            <li> Unlike other reviews or obvious paid testimonials you see on tv (namely, celebrities who endorse proactive), I will tell you only THE TRUTH.</li>
            <li> You can tell that they use natural ingredients, the products smell natural &amp; I think that makes them less harsh on your skin.</li>
            <li> There is a little benzoyl peroxide and there is also lots of nutrients and botanicals to keep my skin soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> However, there are only a few of them, they are very small, and not painful.</li>
            <li> For the past few years, I&#x27;ve particularly struggled with 2 patches of acne; one on my chin and one near my temple.  </li>
            <li> Because they are smaller bottles, make it last and only use a little bit at a time.</li>
            <li> I tried those for awhile, but did not want to continually be on antibiotics, which seemed to have their own set of bad side effects (skin darkenening, etc.).  </li>
            <li> but consistently I&#x27;ve had breakouts (moderate to pretty bad) on my chin.</li>
            <li> Cheap product, extremely expensive product, product with celebrities, etc</li>
            <li> Try and order at least the expanded kit because the cleanser, tonic, acne serum, pore clearing serum and moisturizer are all things you really do need.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m gonna continue to use for a few months till my face is clear</li>
            <li> this product was a complete waste of money .</li>
            <li> I ordered Exposed because it contains natural ingredients, claimed it would not irritate my skin and does not contain any harsh chemicals like Alpha Hydroxy or Retin A.  </li>
            <li> As long as I keep using it day and night</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over 7 years now, with one year long pimply break.</li>
            <li> I have a strange skin type.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even know how long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Obviously can&#x27;t guarantee it would work for you, but I wish I had found it a long time ago..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a compulsive picker on top of this and therefore have endured many nasty infections, including impetigo a few times.</li>
            <li> but I feel so passionately about this product I had too.</li>
            <li> She will continue to use it as long as she needs to.</li>
            <li> My skin looked terrific within 3 weeks of using the products and I have had minimal problems with pimples since.</li>
            <li> They seemed too harsh and drying for my sensitive, combination skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Skin ID by Neutrogena for a long time.  </li>
            <li> My 15 year old daughter had tried everything from prescription medication to you just about name it including some of the \\&quot;eating green</li>
            <li> My face does not feel dried out and there is no harsh smell from products.</li>
            <li> and I know what it is like to continue worrying about your skin long after the days you are supposed to.  </li>
            <li> I tried this kit for 2 months following the instructions carefully.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using the body wash that long</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about 2 months and my skin is not clear yet</li>
            <li> My dermatologist says you have to use something for at least 90 days to get the full affect, so I will continue and hope that even the few breakouts will disappear.</li>
            <li> The first day I started using Exposed, my skin felt nice, but by day three I was covered in the worst breakout I have ever had.</li>
            <li> Although she followed the instructions exactly, her acne actually got worse.  </li>
            <li> It has been everything from thick, thin, watery, runny, clear, cloudy, rough and smooth to even smelling different each time.  </li>
            <li> Granted my skin is not completely clear yet, but i can see the changes it is making.  </li>
            <li> During the second order, my face started to clear dramatically with the exception of black heads and dark spots.</li>
            <li> OTC products, left my skin pink &amp; dry.</li>
            <li> (I think my face is used to all the ingredients already) and my skin started to calm down (less redness) within a few days.  </li>
            <li> When they say \\&quot;use Exposed products very sparingly at first\\&quot; they mean it.</li>
            <li> so I can understand why it costs so much, but it doesn&#x27;t mean I have to like</li>
            <li> I have found that even while using other brand toners, facial cleansers and moisturizers, so long as I continue to apply the Acne Treatment Serum</li>
            <li> in regards to the price - it seemed a little much to me at first, but taking into consideration how much I was spending on random stuff I kept trying (that wasn&#x27;t working), not to mention makeup.</li>
            <li> Acne can be very frustrating, but it is important to know that not every product works for everyone.  </li>
            <li> In the past every time I tried a new acne wash or medication I would get extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> A lot of other acne treatment systems don&#x27;t include a moisturizer and keeping your skin from drying out too much is essential to these types of products working.  </li>
            <li> It looks like other people may have had the same problem.</li>
            <li> We saw results within 30 days, which I can not say when it comes to other facial products.</li>
            <li> I have had long problems with my skin!</li>
            <li> Will be using it for as long as I need it!</li>
            <li> It was July last year when I found the cure to my endless breakouts.</li>
            <li> I will only get one pimple due to not changing pillow cases as often as recommended.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant because of the cost and thought this would only last me 30 days</li>
            <li> The benzoyl peroxide is the same as any other product EXCEPT it does not irritate your skin at all because the compound of benzoyl peroxide is encapsulated.</li>
            <li> This dried out my face just a little around my nostrils, but the product works VERY well.</li>
            <li> Tiny bumps on my chin began to disappear, and some of my other breakouts were decreasing.</li>
            <li> I was not expecting to see any improvement with my scars without some other type intervention, so I actually see this as a bonus.</li>
            <li> I had tried every other acne product (Proactive and kits from the local drug store), but nothing worked the way Exposed does.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not pretty, then week 2 starts and BAM your a total hottie.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any rashes or red spots that other reviewers have talked about.</li>
            <li> so i alternate every other day with the serums..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t suffer from severe acne but have been getting small breakouts consistently for the past 6 months, I also had red scars from these breakouts.</li>
            <li> My skin was never clear!  </li>
            <li> skin doesn&#x27;t look entirely clear due to the redness and scarring from previous spots, but even that is gradually improving.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be buying exposed products for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Does not over dry.</li>
            <li> They would make my skin crack and break and over dry.  </li>
            <li> My skin tone has improved dramatically and isn&#x27;t dry and irritated like it was with Proactiv.</li>
            <li> And the redness and dry skin you get with Proactive?</li>
            <li> It does make yor skin a bit dry</li>
            <li> They never make my skin dry during the acne treatment.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin like Proactive did.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry me out.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t dry out my skin</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin...</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any dry or burned skin.</li>
            <li> It does not leave your skin dry or peely.</li>
            <li> THis product didn&#x27;t dry out my face</li>
            <li> My face wasn&#x27;t peeling or extremely dry</li>
            <li> but when I put it on with acne it just cooks dry around my scabs</li>
            <li> It is gental on your skin and does not over dry like \\&quot;Proactive\\</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve definitely got a few red marks from all the years of torment and like exposed claims, the marks are fading.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve definitely got a few red marks from all the years of torment and like exposed claims, the marks are fading.     </li>
            <li> At least the Murad line had decent results that would keep the existing acne at bay.</li>
            <li> Initially my acne began clearing up, but after about two weeks my acne became worse, pimples were appearing on my face in areas where I&#x27;ve never previously broken out.</li>
            <li> but I decided to go back to my old routine, which at least kept my skin manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been desperate for some relief because not only does it look awful, but it leaves so many scars and most importantly it really hurts.</li>
            <li> I used Proactive for a year and saw no new results.  </li>
            <li> and I have limited finances for face care.</li>
            <li> I have tried every single acne product and nothing had worked for me.  </li>
            <li> Within a month almost every single zit was gone.</li>
            <li> Though I&#x27;m sure there are exceptions among the reviews containing people that have legitimately purchased the product and have had it work for them, a large majority of the reviews I&#x27;ve seen are questionable, and sometimes blatantly fake.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a single break out since I started.  </li>
            <li> It not only eliminated the huge and painful pimples, but actually changed the texture of my skin.  </li>
            <li> I had an unbelievable outbreak in February/March 2014, at age 24, and NOTHING I tried could clear up my face.</li>
            <li> My face has been clear for the past two weeks and</li>
            <li> And dark marks that I&#x27;ve had forever are finally fading.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, I have experience with a full range of acne treatments, from the basics like Clearasil to celebrity endorsed products like Proactiv.</li>
            <li> I would love to get a refund on this product because it was very expensive</li>
            <li> and then I am forced to buy more of it before my next kit comes and it gets expensive.  </li>
            <li> If you follow the advice given with the system - such as diet recommendations - you should absolutely see some dramatic results.</li>
            <li> I brought her to a skin specialist who said that they would prescribe her with Roaccutane as a form of medication to alleviate her condition but after reading the possible side effects of this drug, there was no way we wanted to go down this route.</li>
            <li> Within a week and a half - I had NO new pimples, and present ones were almost gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I know my skin problem is due to using Exposed because it got worse right when I started using the product.</li>
            <li> for each to dry!</li>
            <li> Customer service called back in less than 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I use small amounts of each product, and only once a day (instead of twice, and since there are two separate acne creams, one for day/one for night, I simply alternate them, washing my face just once a day).</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that after a while, I barely needed the acne treatment anymore</li>
            <li> I only had slight problems with acne.</li>
            <li> The price is the same as comparable products (murad, proactive) that i have tried with mixed results in the past.  </li>
            <li> My acne was not mild or moderate</li>
            <li> cysts).None of the previously mentioned treatments were for severe acne only exposed.</li>
            <li> I have tried lots of different products previously and had quite severe acne.</li>
            <li> Reducing milk and sugar at the same time I started using this product has been a factor, but the naturalness of Exposed and variety of products within this box have all worked together to give me less concern for acne in my life.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I did not give it five stars is because it is pretty expensive.</li>
            <li> I have largers nose pores, have mostly black heads all over my nose and get white heads on my cheeks and</li>
            <li> I tried Proactiv in the past, but I was left with skin that was red, flaky, irritated, and STILL breaking out.</li>
            <li> I was super skeptical but with the reviews I had to try it.</li>
            <li> The Exposed products don&#x27;t irritate my skin (although, if I don&#x27;t use the moisturizer enough, my skin will get a little dry</li>
            <li> My skin is acne-prone and also very dry, so I battle both oily and flakey skin.  </li>
            <li> But after a while my face became very dry.</li>
            <li> It is expensive, but it should last for 2-3 months as long as you don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li> My skin began to clear up within a few weeks and the i didnt have the drying factor that i had with previous products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it ever since, and I get small whiteheads/blackheads around my period, but other than that, totally clear.</li>
            <li> Not only did it work equally as quickly as Proactive in ridding me of the acne, but it has never left my face irritated and painful feeling.</li>
            <li> but i noticed my blackheads were getting a little smaller.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always struggled with acne a little bit, but it didn&#x27;t get out of control until my mid 30s for some reason.  </li>
            <li> Exposed can get a little pricey, but something I can deal with for finally having something that works.</li>
            <li> It took several weeks before I started to notice a little difference.</li>
            <li> Which I couldn&#x27;t cover up with makeup because it would Peel off due to my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using Exposed for over a month, and during that time I have not had problems with either the oily skin or the dry skin that I was having with other products.</li>
            <li> Due to the rosacea anything I did for the pimples seemed to just make everything red with a slight reduction in pimples.</li>
            <li> Long story short they reshipped my package to the correct address with very little hassle  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t ever think about how ugly my skin is any more.</li>
            <li> The Moisture Complex is a must, especially when you are starting out, so I suggest the Expanded Kit.  </li>
            <li> It felt as if I was applying crushed glass with a cotton ball.  </li>
            <li> I spent the money and my daughter began using Exposed faithfully.  </li>
            <li> You have to wet your face with it before applying the cream.</li>
            <li> Now i use it 1 to 2 times a day and there is absolutely no discomfort.</li>
            <li> I have seen a lot of improvement in my complexion over the last few weeks because of Exposed skincare.</li>
            <li> However, it is expensive, but I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple to use, and you start to see the results in a few days.  </li>
            <li> She told me that they did not have call center and that all of their business is from word of mouth.</li>
            <li> I spent a lot of time searching online for an alternative to medication for her.</li>
            <li> Just try Exposed because there is absolutely no risk.</li>
            <li> I had only somewhat dried skin at the beginning, but no redness, no pain, nothing...</li>
            <li> I will follow up within next few weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently had a lot of trouble with acne breakouts.</li>
            <li> so I always had to be careful what I chose.</li>
            <li> He is careful to change his pillowcases, too.  </li>
            <li> My pores are minimal.</li>
            <li> the automatic machine says the office is closed.</li>
            <li> I never had acne as teen (aside from a few pimples here and there).</li>
            <li> The BP died my clothing which is to be expected with BP.&lt;br /&gt;The two biggest negatives:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li> Please be careful if you buy this product...</li>
            <li> Since May I have had only a few pimples-about 4</li>
            <li> Overall, I would say to try these products if you deal with frustrating unsightly acne, like I have since I was 12 years old</li>
            <li> My advice for anyone with sensitive skin is to start out slowly and let your skin build up a tolerance to the medications.</li>
            <li> I am a 40yr old woman tired of teenage acne products.</li>
            <li> It seems unbelievable, but this is the ONLY product that has EVER worked for me and I will keep using it long after this review!</li>
            <li> Plain and simple this stuff works.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m bad about following the routine like I&#x27;m suppose to is the only time I break out other then an occasional single pimple...which I can live with.</li>
            <li> Because effectively treating the root cause of acne is difficult, it requires a dramatic change in your diet; if you can do it, then tell me about it.</li>
            <li> His entire face was constantly covered in new breakouts and was  red and painful.</li>
            <li> but yet these products did not dry my skin like other products had in the past.  </li>
            <li> I have had a problem with red cheeks / forehead -- very seldom with acne/pimples -- but was unable to track down what the culprit was.  </li>
            <li> I never wanted to use prescription treatment for something that is a normal part of teen life, and I didn&#x27;t want them to make it worse!</li>
            <li> Just to give you an idea, I am an adult, and I did not have serious breakout problems when I was a teenager.     </li>
            <li> Along with a healthy diet cutting out the usual, dairy, sugar and flour product consumption helped alot.</li>
            <li> I was pretty broken out on my chin and forehead for a few days, but it goes away.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with all the products.</li>
            <li> i won&#x27;t comment on the moisture complex because i don&#x27;t use it every day, and i only use it when i&#x27;m dry or remember.</li>
            <li> (If you put a thin layer of the Acne Treatment Serum on it will dry clear-</li>
            <li> It made my skin either dry and flakey or shiny and tight.</li>
            <li> Week 1, I noticed there were very few new blackheads and small pimples.</li>
            <li> My skin isn&#x27;t completely covered in acne, but I get frequent break outs, including those deep, painful ones.</li>
            <li> Its not like any other product that says oh this will work and what not.</li>
            <li> With the other products, my skin would either get used to the product after using it for a while and stop working or make me breakout.</li>
            <li> even the scars from past acne is starting to fade.</li>
            <li> I do have some minor peeling in a few spots</li>
            <li> We did some research online to see what our other options were</li>
            <li> Other products did not work for my daughters.</li>
            <li> I looked at the other reviews,</li>
            <li> NO THANKS!</li>
            <li> I will never use any other product.</li>
            <li> in due time, it lessens the appearance.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the cloth that comes with it, but other than that, I&#x27;ve been using everything as directed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> every other month.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had tried other products and they would work and then stop.</li>
            <li> The price is comparable to other acne treatment systems  </li>
            <li> Proactive didn&#x27;t cut it and when I looked for other options, Exposed came up.</li>
            <li> So I approached this kit with extreme caution.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to change to any other product again.</li>
            <li> This product is just about like every other acne care product out there.</li>
            <li> Other than that, no complaints.  </li>
            <li> This works extremely well.  </li>
            <li> If you discovered that salicylic acid and/or benzoyl peroxide has helped treat your acne, then stop looking for other products and buy this one.</li>
            <li> Go and google other companies and let me know if you see a company offering something close to that.</li>
            <li> My Mom found this Skincare online after using multiple products in the past.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used any other treatment before</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I first ordered Exposed.</li>
            <li> and I have only gotten 3 small pimples compared to the 8-10 cystic ones that I would get on a day to day basis.</li>
            <li> &quot; stuff you get from other companies.</li>
            <li> Since my acne is mostly due to what I eat (sugar), and I have been &amp;#34;enjoying myself&amp;#34; for the holidays, I am not pimple-free at the moment.</li>
            <li> I have even tried Proactive along with other prescribed medications.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use any other product.</li>
            <li> every other night.&lt;br /&gt;-Pull</li>
            <li> A little of this stuff goes a long way!</li>
            <li> use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The way my daily regiment usually shapes up is this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also recommend using a moisturizer in conjunction with it due to the salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide drying out the skin.</li>
            <li> I should say don&#x27;t expect miracles if you have very persistent or very bad acne, but you will see a noticeable improvement, and quite quickly.</li>
            <li> I started using Exposed a little while ago because Proactiv was too hard on my skin and Exposed is made for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> His face looked very dry and flaky and at one point, it appeared he had a black eye.</li>
            <li> It may take a little longer to clear my acne this way, but at least I can avoid making my skin sore.  </li>
            <li> I know it is a little expensive, but I think it really is worth it if you struggle with acne like I did.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;BE VERY CAREFUL --</li>
            <li> I believe these are what allows my skin to tolerate the harsher active ingredients.  </li>
            <li> And the pimples dry up in a few days and don&#x27;t leave scars.</li>
            <li> I am lucky in that I am not a person who has a face that is completely covered with acne, however I do get frequent break outs, including those deep, painful ones that other reviewers have mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;I suffer with extremely oily skin, which makes identifying skin products very difficult.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try Pro active instead.</li>
            <li> Soon I went into a deep depression which only made my acne and picking even worse.</li>
            <li> It does not have harsh chemicals nor did it dry my face it.  </li>
            <li> and I let it air dry for a few minutes...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smoother, my pores are smaller, no more black heads on my cheeks or chin</li>
            <li> Add to the mix that my skin is sensitive, and it&#x27;s really very hard to find a product to help.  </li>
            <li> Even after trying a few different prescribed options I was still a mess!</li>
            <li> I developed cystic acne which I found very hard to cure.  </li>
            <li> I was considering trying oral medication but the possible negative side affects made me search for other options.</li>
            <li> I thought i was going through mature age acne, it was frustrating to see product after product failing EVEN pro active.</li>
            <li> Almost a year and a half now with minimal to no acne!</li>
            <li> I tried this out on a whim upon my mother&#x27;s insistence due to all the rave reviews (that I previously had known some of them were fraud).</li>
            <li> but I know how hard it is to find skincare that actually works....</li>
            <li> My younger teenage daughter also developed bad acne on her forehead</li>
            <li> Since my breakouts were so bad in the beginning, I felt as though I needed to use more product, but that actually made things worse.</li>
            <li> It has been the only thing that has worked on my skin without any negative side effects.  </li>
            <li> This product did not improve my acne and neither did it work on my dark spots</li>
            <li> The toner is average.</li>
            <li> I think this product is overpriced and not worth it.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is the price.</li>
            <li> Trust me, I am not an employee, just an average person that USED to have acne.  </li>
            <li> On average, I would have between 3 or 4 to 8 or 9 cylic acnes.</li>
            <li> Then I tried every over the counter option, with no success.  </li>
            <li> The product advertises itself as producing clear skin in 30 days, so after giving it well over two months I can say this product didn&#x27;t work for me, and even made things worse to an extent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so dark marks never seem to go away.  </li>
            <li> I may have to send the product back, or at least diminish use.</li>
            <li> Every night after my shower I wash with the Facial Cleanser, use the Clearing Tonic, apply the Acne Treatment Serum, and finish with the Moisture Complex.  </li>
            <li> Although, I seem to run through the Clearing Tonic faster than the average person.  </li>
            <li> but at least you get your money back if it doesn’t.</li>
            <li> That is the only complaint I have.  </li>
            <li> I have tried the expensive creams and antibiotics from the dermatologist without much improvement.</li>
            <li> There could be a few fake reviews, but I&#x27;m a real person who took a chance ordering Exposed and it worked!</li>
            <li> This is truly the secret to getting clear skin.</li>
            <li> and you can see the dark spots underneath along with all the redness that comes along with acne.</li>
            <li> I would never wear makeup at home and tried to as least as possible when I went out to stores on weekends or during break.</li>
            <li> I first tried this product, I was slightly skeptical because everything else on the market seems to operate under the assumption that it has to be harsh to work.</li>
            <li> I had used Proactive for a few years and it cleared up my face, but never really got rid of my acne and after awhile, it didn&#x27;t seem to be working anymore.</li>
            <li> With this other acne system, my skin was also very red, irritated, oily, and I also would get those large, painful, cystic acne pimples.  </li>
            <li> It is still a little dry from getting used to the difference in this product from others i have used, but my black heads are gone and my pimples have dried out.</li>
            <li> After months of using Proactiv with no results and horrific customer service, it&#x27;s nice to use something that helps and doesn&#x27;t completely dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll be down about $40 anyway...</li>
            <li> I started using it once every other day there was certainly a little discomfort.</li>
            <li> My face would continue to break out in all of my problem areas and the excessive maintenance caused dry patches on my face.</li>
            <li> At night after cleanser/tonic you apply the pore clearing serum, let dry, and then pat a small amount of moisturizer into your skin.</li>
            <li> I used Proactiv in the past, but it tended to leave my skin dry and flaky.  </li>
            <li> There are only three small downsides I can think of:&lt;br /&gt;-It takes a little while to get used to the liquorice smell of the Cleanser, but I stopped noticing it after a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;-THE PACKAGING.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s a bad product, because every one has a different skin type, but it certainly has not worked for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked at the other reviews, definitely a few fakes</li>
            <li> I stopped using it for a few days, then started every other day.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone that has been having trouble with any other product.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the other few products</li>
            <li> On the whole, the system is a little bit expensive, but I have the feeling once things are clearing up</li>
            <li> We expected her skin to get worse initially</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a year and a half</li>
            <li> My skin cleared up in less that 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> With that I have found that it takes less and less of the product to maintain the desired results.  </li>
            <li> Results in less than 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> She tried all the typical stuff including lots of herbal/natural remedies.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Exposed for less than a year now</li>
            <li> My daughter has been using this product for about a month and a half now.   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for half a year now</li>
            <li> Although it has been less than two months since I purchased the product the return option from Amazon has expired.  </li>
            <li> Used it for about two and a half months.</li>
            <li> Within less than 30 min&#x27;s a customer service rep called me back.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recommend it anyone who has serious acne problems without any hesitation and the sooner you start using it the earlier you will benefit from it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too sure if this would heal those with severe acne as mine is typically moderate at worst.  </li>
            <li> Murad was the only thing that ever came close to the results that I have seen with exposed and that was simply too expensive and the results short-lived.</li>
            <li> All those insisting these reviews are fake because they use the same (or similar) wording-</li>
            <li> I am mostly skeptical about using commercial face treatment products as none of them has actually worked on my face.</li>
            <li> So I ordered it and was anxious (but still skeptical) to receive my first kit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well that did seem to eventually die down a little, but this did nothing for my hormonal acne on my forehead and chin.</li>
            <li> , my skin would not calm down!  </li>
            <li> and I resorted to using tweezers to remove the congealed glue mess to make them function.</li>
            <li> At night I noticed my skin felt a little softer and seemed less irritated.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to get a prescription, which is what I was given through the dermatologist, which dried my skin like crazy and caused other issues, so I really wanted to find something that would work without one.  </li>
            <li> Hi if you have bad skin or just mild acne this is for you.</li>
            <li> (Half of your body weight in ounces is what a person should be drinking each and everyday.</li>
            <li> I have tried the other competing products and I was never able to get the results i wanted</li>
            <li> My daughter was a little discourage with her acne and we tried a number of products that didn&#x27;t seem to make a difference.</li>
            <li> Some products would seem to work for a little while</li>
            <li> I have been using Exposed for a little over a month and have noticed a difference.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Exposed for a little over 3 months</li>
            <li> Tried everything on the market and pills from a derm doc with little to no result until exposed.</li>
            <li> If anything it&#x27;s a little</li>
            <li> I was not excited about it though.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Exposed for a little over a month now</li>
            <li> That should give you some idea of how little of this product I use.</li>
            <li> It kinda works but is no better than any other product I have used yet.</li>
            <li> warning you that you might want to set aside a week where you don&#x27;t plan on wearing make up and don&#x27;t see people unless you don&#x27;t mind them seeing you, because my acne got flaky and it looked a little irritated.</li>
            <li> It has been a little bit over a month</li>
            <li> When I used Proactiv, I hated the rough cleanser, and the lotion smelled really strongly of medicine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Right away I noticed that the creams were less irritating than Proactive, but were showing the same results.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to leave my room because my acne broke out super bad, but it was already worse enough.</li>
            <li> I can now count the FEW pimples on my face and the last one&#x27;s seem to be slowly dissapearing!</li>
            <li> I must confess that I was very surprised by the treatment effectiveness due to disappointing past experiences with other acne treatments.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After trying a variety of cleansers, scrubs and creams, I have to say this.worked.the.best.&lt;br /&gt;After almost 2 weeks, all of my chin acne had cleared up (plus my scarring seems to have gone down!</li>
            <li> If you have an acne problem, Exposed Acne skincare is the way to go hands down!</li>
            <li> I decided to give it a shot, I mean what could I loose?</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t heal my skin if it was in a bad state, only helped it if I did not have any major breakouts, so not worth the money.  </li>
            <li> It was painful to smile and at times it&#x27;d crack and bleed.</li>
            <li> At 30 years old, I finally became so frustrated that I started looking for yet another product.  </li>
            <li> and I have tried quite a few.</li>
            <li> The microderm scrub has also helped with the scars that were left behind on my chin.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on this product if I were you.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> , it worked for a few years for me, but then my face started breaking out again.  </li>
            <li> I have had trouble skin all my life.</li>
            <li> I also have noticed that the redness had decreased dramatically and my pores are smaller as well.</li>
            <li> i have trouble finding products that won&#x27;t irritate me.</li>
            <li> I have been using Exposed Acne product for a few months now</li>
            <li> definitely a few fakes</li>
            <li> I was considering going to a demonologist but was weary of taking pills or having to use a really harsh product.  </li>
            <li> a chance - try it for a a few weeks before making a judgement.</li>
            <li> The bottles do not close completely and are useless for traveling.</li>
            <li> What a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> So I just resigned to wearing make-up everyday to hide my embarrassing skin (even in the summer going in the pool or to go to the gym).</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
            <li> After reading a few reviews, I tried the Exposed system.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s still working, so I won&#x27;t waste it.&lt;br /&gt;-The cost.</li>
            <li> Their customer line is never available.</li>
            <li> I used to have few pimples on my face once a month.  </li>
            <li> I used Proactiv for over a year, went with store bough brands for a few months and thankfully discovered Exposed.</li>
            <li> One of my friends bought this a few months ago</li>
            <li> I thought I would let everybody know in a few weeks if it works or not (crossing my fingers....)</li>
            <li> Also, when I try those products, I didn&#x27;t just them for a few days or a few weeks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Those are just a few examples, and there still others if you look closely.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had a few compliments on my skin&#x27;s radiance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We weren&#x27;t too optimistic, but within a few weeks we were seeing the results we had been searching for.</li>
            <li> After a few days existing pimples were shrinking.</li>
            <li> I think there may have been a few of those, but there are also buyers like myself who have never reviewed a product before.</li>
            <li> I made an appointment to see my doctor but couldn’t get in for a few weeks so in frustration I searched acneskin care products online and came across Exposed.  </li>
            <li> I also drink green tea too which may have helped too.</li>
            <li> but you notice healthier skin in just a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I get a few Pop ups once in a while</li>
            <li> and I use them everyday.</li>
            <li> His face still gets a few break outs, but nothing like before.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s actually made my acne worse.</li>
            <li> Sometimes you have to go through a few before you find one that works for you.  </li>
            <li> and I use it almost everyday.</li>
            <li> and my skin is the same or worse.</li>
            <li> the products aren&#x27;t harsh at all.</li>
            <li> I am in my mid 30&#x27;s, so at this point, it&#x27;s beyond frustrating and after research, I decided to give exposed a try.  </li>
            <li> After just a few days I noticed improvements.</li>
            <li> Benzoyl Peroxide acne treatment is heaven after 2 weeks once you adjust because it can get harsh</li>
            <li> All the acne and pimples on my face, cheeks, nose, chin, forehead, hairline, jawline, neck, back of my neck, behind my ears, chest, shoulders, behind my shoulders and on my back....</li>
            <li> it goes away after a few months.</li>
            <li> It seemed like this only got worse at that point.</li>
            <li> My acne got worse (WORSE) as if I really needed that.</li>
            <li> Before I purchased this product, I read several reviews on Amazon and saw claims of &#x27;false reviews&#x27;.</li>
            <li> This made my skin dull and dry, even using small amounts once a day.</li>
            <li> It keeps the zits under wraps and my breakouts have been less excessive.</li>
            <li> Since all the other products failed me, I didnt think Exposed would be any different.</li>
            <li> This year I was getting frustrated that my skin was getting new large zits that were really uncomfortable and embarrassing.</li>
            <li> This stuff just plain works.  </li>
            <li> It took about three weeks to see its effect, but my chin and forehead (which are usually always broken out) have finally cleared.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed however in the lack of complete removal as well as how it irritated my skin, so I began searching for another topical solution.</li>
            <li> This product is definitely different from other acne products and you definitely will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I had the deep cystic ones that were extremely painful, the little bumps that were hard, the black and whiteheads, and the regular acne that could be popped...yuck!  </li>
            <li> My flare-up battles with acne started when I first tried the BC pill, which had bad side effects for me, including acne.</li>
            <li> This increased over the next few years and it got to the point where the acne was often painful, especially around my chin and jawline, and the spots, redness and scars covered the majority of my face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone to the dermatologist in the past and tried prescription creams and antibiotics, but they were so harsh that I was embarrassed with the results.</li>
            <li> , dark spots are slowly disappearing, once or twice pimples occurred</li>
            <li> I mean, why not, right??</li>
            <li> The clearing tonic does occasionally cause my face to sting, but only where I have a really bad pimple, and not always.</li>
            <li> Everything else dried out my skin to the point where even my lips were painfully cracked and peeling, and did absolutely nothing for my acne.</li>
            <li> it totally cleared up the very deep and painful pimples I was getting.</li>
            <li> My skin is just very reactive, so I think I will always get problems if I am tired, or ill, or stressed.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know if anyone has taken the time to read my annoying novel, but I want people to have the same confidence that clear skin gives you.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m just very disappointed that this product has so many manufactured 5-star reviews.</li>
            <li> hands down!!</li>
            <li> About a month and a half ago I had a particularly bad breakout and I resolved to try something new.</li>
            <li> I also had zero burning and very little irritation when using Exposed (Proactiv included lots of burning and lots of irritation).</li>
            <li> All of their products have very little scent, if any for some.</li>
            <li> but all you really need if you have bad chin acne like me is to buy these three products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had used Cliniques 3 step system for about 4 years and this past year I began breaking out all over my chin</li>
            <li> Both of my boys have been using Exposed Skincare Products for the past 3 months.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get breakouts as much no more</li>
            <li> but they usually disappear within a day or two with continued use of the product.  </li>
            <li> If you want clearer skin without being harsh Side effects order this product!</li>
            <li> so I usually just gave up on it.</li>
            <li> The shipping is usually next-day (two days max.)</li>
            <li> I ran my usual google search on acne treatments one day and came across Exposed.</li>
            <li> otherwise you will get small breakouts here and there.  </li>
            <li> but I was just never satisfied with any of them.  </li>
            <li> He&#x27;s learned that he can&#x27;t be lazy and skip on morning or evening treatments.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews</li>
            <li> If you still insist on trying this product then test it out on a small patch of skin for a week before putting it all over your face.</li>
            <li> Not sure about that inconsistancy.</li>
            <li> Just try it, and you will see the results within a few weeks!</li>
            <li> So I went online and googled different things and randomly found this.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s usually after I work and</li>
            <li> but it has also helped my skin heal from all the awful damage I caused from the many years of acne and picking.</li>
            <li> now I have no more skin problems</li>
            <li> I was never really able to use one in the past without causing a breakout.  </li>
            <li> Shes been using it for the past 2 years and its kept her acne away.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s unbelievable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect now, but I&#x27;m definitely going to keep using and see what it can do in another month.</li>
            <li> Her face started breaking out and just wasn&#x27;t clearing up as it had in the past.  </li>
            <li> The only two drawbacks to Exposed are (1) you have to apply 3-4 products morning and night, and (2) it is relatively expensive.</li>
            <li> From what I have tried in the past that combination had always worked well.</li>
            <li> I have been using this kit for the past 2 months</li>
            <li> I bought this product, fully expecting to take advantage of the money back guarantee, because I was skeptical that it would work.  </li>
            <li> Same thing with Clearzine, which was expensive and did not work for me.</li>
            <li> have never had anything for the past 4 years work like exposed skin</li>
            <li> In the past, he would use something and then be ho hum about it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews for items I purchase</li>
            <li> Acne products tend to dry my skin out a lot, and leave flaky spots that are hard to then cover with makeup, but this moisturizer works wonders, and it&#x27;s not greasy!!</li>
            <li> As for the other review that claims there are false reviews posted because they are not \\&quot;verified amazon</li>
            <li> TO always feel ugly and dirty and to never be able to look to peoples eyes.</li>
            <li> This does not mean it is a bad product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had some pretty difficult times with my skin and at the beginning of summer last year it got really bad!</li>
            <li> I personally would like to avoid speaking to others over a phone whenever I can, since I have the worst time speaking to other people, especially in the case of an official transaction in need of a conversation (which does not exclude ordering pizza and/or talking to officers to report a problem)</li>
            <li> After trying so many products over 20 years, with no results, I was frustrated and very skeptical about trying Exposed...</li>
            <li> I have always has really dry skin and random breakouts.</li>
            <li> I continued to receive breakouts and my previous acne just got worse.</li>
            <li> It will be hard to stop using once you have started.</li>
            <li> and I hardly ever break out anymore, not even around that time of the month.</li>
            <li> This schedule holds me accountable to the routine, and it takes hardly any time at all.  </li>
            <li> Once you order this product it is way to hard to return.</li>
            <li> It became a horrible mess that I had to paint with makeup whenever I went to school to cover up my acne, and I always washed it off right when I get home.</li>
            <li> Give it at least 1 month for you to see differences.</li>
            <li> I am in my late 40&#x27;s and still have problems with breakouts.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from chronic, painful acne since I was 12 years old (22 now).</li>
            <li> Even with with oily skin type i think the moisture complex is a must</li>
            <li> but the Moisture Complex took care of that and didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li> This last year he went from clear baby face to BOOM ugly outbreaks, ugh!!!  </li>
            <li> and I still always had a least one blemish on my face.</li>
            <li> Customer service has been extremely rude, and has even hung up on me.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for at least 6 months ago.</li>
            <li> I contacted customer service to cancel the order and have my money refunded, which they agreed to do, but they were extremely rude about it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying the moisture complex</li>
            <li> By 20 he had become frustrated and self conscious.</li>
            <li> but each time the tests were negative.  </li>
            <li> I am in my late teens and have had skin problems since I was 13.</li>
            <li> I tried 3 expensive product lines and some beauty tools (clarisonic/zeno) and spent $100&#x27;s of dollars before stumbling upon exposed skin care.  </li>
            <li> Put i am no loonger afraid to go out in public.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It didn&#x27;t work for me but at least I&#x27;m getting a refund.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this company at all, but I have to admit that they have at least one product that works.</li>
            <li> I think the progress has been slow since she was still eating lots of her Halloween candy.   </li>
            <li> It also seems like the blackheads (with the Microscrub) are slowly reducing in numbers.</li>
            <li> I used to hate my skin, fearing I would struggle with acne my whole life.</li>
            <li> I was diligent about my skincare a few months ago because I was tired of being in my mid-twenties with the skin of a teenager.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I tried it and had no positive results.</li>
            <li> I have no more acne!</li>
            <li> Why keep such an expensive product thats not being used?!?</li>
            <li> The one thing that sucks is that for the price, the bottles are very small.</li>
            <li> I had really bad acne before using Exposed, and no other acne wash was working for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using Exposed for 2 months now never missing a morning or night, and I am disappointed</li>
            <li> If I put a very small amount of this on my face preventatively each day, then I never break out at all.  </li>
            <li> for as far as i can tell, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be disappointed</li>
            <li> Once I finally received it, it was impossible to get the plastic seals off the bottles</li>
            <li> Seriously, two days.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try exposed and it seriously have changed my life (no over exaggeration).</li>
            <li> I also went to the dermatologist for years and the result was that I always had outbreaks even though I was prescribed quite serious pills for my skin.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ve gotten 2 or 3 of the horrible giant cysts since starting on this line, but nothing - nothing like before.</li>
            <li> I was definitely skeptical about this purchase, especially after reading the remarks about fake reviews.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about Exposed Acne Treatment.</li>
            <li> My only dislike about the product is that I hate having to use 3 products at night and 3 in the morning, but seriously, that&#x27;s very little inconvenience for the results I have achieved.  </li>
            <li> The price of the product itself isn&#x27;t so bad (comparable to similar products), it&#x27;s the shipping to Canada that kills me every time.</li>
            <li> like anything with a money back guarantee, and knowing what it&#x27;s like to battle with bad skin</li>
            <li> I use the moisture complex on my face, instead of lotion, because it moisturizes my skin without leaving behind an oily residue.</li>
            <li> No matter what i always had blackheads, a few random pimples, and about 1 to 2 times a month</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s those big acnes that sit underneath your skin for days to develop, and can be painful if you touch them.</li>
            <li> I have been dealing with awful cystic acne for the last couple of years (several times worse than anything I had had as a teenager) and nothing has worked on it.  </li>
            <li> (I had horrific acne and pimples all over my face, cheeks, nose, chin, forehead, hairline, jawline, neck, on the back of my neck, behind my ears, on my chest, on my shoulders, behind my shoulders and on my upper back--basically EVERYWHERE.</li>
            <li> I would say my skin has never been absolutely terrible even in middle/high school, but it has been kind of bad at times and always been something to have to think about and screw with.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with acne and it seemed to be slowly progressing and getting worse and worse.</li>
            <li> and it sucks!</li>
            <li> And no more Proactiv randomly charging my credit card.  </li>
            <li> Indeed, the results ended up surpassing Proactive, despite application being no more complicated or time consuming.</li>
            <li> Proactiv would work for like a month, and then it would dry my face out so badly that i&#x27;d have to get off of it.  </li>
            <li> What few blemishes I do get (we&#x27;re talking a reduction from 40+ painful pimples to no more than 3 barely-noticeable blemishes)</li>
            <li> I kept using it, being very delicate with my toner application.  </li>
            <li> no more dryness and irritation while clearing up my skin!!  </li>
            <li> Some of my acne has been incredibly bad lately as well, even causing a few scars - which has never happened to me before.</li>
            <li> and I actually cried a few times looking at how awful my skin was.     </li>
            <li> I have used this product for approximately 6 months.  </li>
            <li> My acne has significantly decreased.</li>
            <li> Made my acne worse.</li>
            <li> Some of the products made my skin worse.</li>
            <li> and I was tired of using harmful chemicals on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I did see the notice saying that sometimes skin gets worse before it starts improving (as it adjusts to the products) but this did not happen to me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not made my skin worse</li>
            <li> and my skin is worse</li>
            <li> My face didn&#x27;t get worse</li>
            <li> And it seems to have just gotten worse and worse since I hit my twenties.</li>
            <li> I believe my skin would probably be worse without the help of the product.</li>
            <li> My skin is addicted to them and breaks out every time I try to stop.</li>
            <li> I kept hoping that my body would neutralize the hormones after a year, but it never did, and my face just kept getting worse and worse.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately the product is *really* sticky on my skin and if I don&#x27;t use the moisturizer after it drys my face feels terrible.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s worse I never knew what to expect from one day to another.</li>
            <li> and this product increased my acne instead decreased or reduced.</li>
            <li> My face had never looked worse.</li>
            <li> In fact, it made it worse after using it for two months.</li>
            <li> I figured this was the &amp;#34;gets worse before better&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I started putting a thin layer of the Acne Treatment Serum all over my face, jawline, chest and shoulder area.</li>
            <li> After I put on the thin layer of Acne Treatment Serum</li>
            <li> (Thin layer)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Clearing Pore Serum (Thin layer)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not exactly a great combination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Exposed seriously works with all skin types!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had horrible cystic acne since high school, and I&#x27;ve tried everything from ProActive to BenzaClin to Accutane.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t the normal nasty stuff.  </li>
            <li> Since I haven&#x27;t used the product that long, I can not say that I hate it, I just want to strangle my boyfriend for letting me try it-</li>
            <li> A little expensive to try out, but I was desperate to see if it&#x27;d work.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t seen a dramatic difference in my skin yet.</li>
            <li> My skin dried up really bad.</li>
            <li> the Advantage kit actually dried my skin so bad it looked sunburnt) to Murad.  </li>
            <li> Proactive dried my skin out so bad it made it crack</li>
            <li> Bad skin doesn&#x27;t just explode and return if you stop the product for a few days.</li>
            <li> It has also been extremely painful and I generally had anywhere from 5 to 15 painful breakouts on any given day.</li>
            <li> I ordered Exposed Skin Care a couple of months ago, and so far, dealing with this company has been one of the worst experiences.</li>
            <li> but it is nowhere near as awful as it was a month</li>
            <li> After my 30th bday I began suffering from adult acne something awful!</li>
            <li> And that includes prescribed medication, all of which was useless or made things much worse.</li>
            <li> this is how it starts, and once it does, I have had a difficult time getting rid of pimples and it seems to get worse once I break out.  </li>
            <li> cloth that is included has been helpful in cleaning pores and exfoliating my skin, which has caused my terrible dark spots to slowly start fading.</li>
            <li> My bumps/pimples were painful and large and would leave awful scarring on my face.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it has not helped at all.  </li>
            <li> The tonic was weird and required some adjusting since I&#x27;ve never used a tonic before.</li>
            <li> I skeptically pulled the trigger and got the uber kit with all the goodies.</li>
            <li> I have used it faithfully for 2 months and my skin is WORSE THAN EVER!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not even going to attempt to return it after the horror stories I have read about customer&#x27;s failed attempts at doing so.</li>
            <li> Of course its not perfect, but that all depends on your diet and water intake.</li>
            <li> My face feels cleaner and those horrible red pumps have not returned.  </li>
            <li> I also believe that there are a lot of fake reviews.</li>
            <li> This stuff exposed me in the worst way possible!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product did not work for me.</li>
            <li> I read tons of reviews before I ordered, but I am always skeptical thinking that employees of the company write the reviews.  </li>
            <li> They have sent the wrong kits to the wrong address&#x27;s and then expect to charge the customer to re-ship.</li>
            <li> everyday or my skin looks like crap.</li>
            <li> I used.it wrong and was breaking out and had no idea I was</li>
            <li> of note are the amount of fake reviews for this product.</li>
            <li> They have failed to reply and when I called them, it repeatedly said that the operator was not in order and directed me to a voice message.</li>
            <li> Prior to using Exposed, I would wake up in the morning dreading looking in the mirror because my skin was always at its worst in the AM.  </li>
            <li> I was really skeptical about getting this but decided to grab this after using proactive for quite a while</li>
            <li> I was always insecure about it</li>
            <li> unfortunately, after 30 day including shipping, they will not accepting returning option.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this a try after using almost every acne product at the pharmacies and beauty supply but only made my acne worst.</li>
            <li> Fake or not-</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sorry to those reviewers for whom this product has not worked.</li>
            <li> Sadly it still doesn&#x27;t work as well as the company promises.</li>
            <li> However, when the supply was all used, It&#x27;s freakishly expensive to consult to a dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, Exposed did not work for my skin.</li>
            <li> Shortly after my skin took a turn for the worst.</li>
            <li> The moisturizer was useless for me.</li>
            <li> guarantee - so you really can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I ordered this kit and ill</li>
            <li> The rest of the products are just expensive and irrelevant.  </li>
            <li> first week was horrible :(</li>
            <li> I think it has made my skin worse!</li>
            <li> I was sick and tired of having unhealthy skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyhow, one day i was at my wits end (might have been the day after i was in bed crying to my husband about how i&#x27;m so ugly!</li>
            <li> My face cleared up after having a serious bout with cystic acne. :(  </li>
            <li> What a dramatic difference!</li>
            <li> began using this product due to a terrible flare-up of acne this summer.</li>
            <li> But Accutane is very hard to get and a very dangerous drug</li>
            <li> I was desperate -</li>
            <li> I recommend to anyone I know who suffers from skin problems.</li>
            <li> In a desperate attempt, I googled ACNE solutions and Exposed came up as a hit.  </li>
            <li> I returned it after it dried my face out terribly.</li>
            <li> It made me nervous, but I was so desperate to do something about my worsening acne</li>
            <li> Proactiv dries out my skin like crazy and irritates it</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wear makeup, it was too painful and it made the dryness look worse!</li>
            <li> But my skin got used to it, it dried it out, and i got terrible sunburn.</li>
            <li> so messed up,forehead,cheeks,chin.so desperate</li>
            <li> Yet another disappointment...</li>
            <li> but the results were disappointing.  </li>
            <li> I was mad.  </li>
            <li> Seriously!!!</li>
            <li> It has seriously made my skin emarassingly horrible</li>
            <li> and now it&#x27;s covered with itchy distracting rashes that are impossible to cover or forget about.</li>
            <li> I had bad acne and the product i was using before</li>
            <li> My acne had gotten so bad that I was embarrassed to go to the gym without makeup</li>
            <li> She had really bad acne on her forehead and both cheeks.  </li>
            <li> my skin wasnt THAT bad</li>
            <li> I used to literally have nightmares about going out of the house without makeup and having people see my bad skin underneath.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still getting really bad breakouts on my chin that will not go away.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Never had acne problems as teenager, but after having children, it has gotten bad.  </li>
            <li> I came across the product when looking for an alternative to proactive, as my skin wasn&#x27;t that bad</li>
            <li> I said my skin wasn&#x27;t that bad</li>
            <li> just get looks from people if i do not know how bad i look .</li>
            <li> Then, I begin to have really bad acne and tried every product on the market.</li>
            <li> I moved from the Midwest to Los Angeles 2 years ago and started to get really bad, continuous breakouts.</li>
            <li> I had a bad reaction to this and had to return it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just that I had a bad reaction.</li>
            <li> has never gotten a comment on bad customer service?</li>
            <li> I was frustrated.</li>
            <li> Within a week my skin cleared up and was no longer painful.</li>
            <li> I was frustrated because I kept spending money, using a product for 6-8 weeks and never seeing any results.  </li>
            <li> And i have been extremely frustrated that nothing out there seemed to work for me.</li>
            <li> I felt ugly all day.</li>
            <li> I felt so ugly</li>
            <li> I was so frustrated.</li>
            <li> They are very depressing and IMPOSSIBLE to cover with makeup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve figured out that if I rinse my face off in the sink with cold water before I shower that the reaction isn&#x27;t as bad!</li>
            <li> This has yet to happen to me even during this cold winter!</li>
            <li> So disappointed.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Am disappointed  .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a really cynical and somewhat defensive person (I don&#x27;t want any \\&quot;product\\&quot; ruining my face!)  </li>
            <li> Nothing worked :(, one day doing research on the web</li>
            <li> One overnight application of the gel virtually got rid of my acne and pimples and so you could imagine how disappointed I was when they replaced it with a lotion.</li>
            <li> I tried it for two months and was so disappointed.</li>
            <li> and it began peeling and cracking like crazy!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re anything like me, if I don&#x27;t return it now the year will pass me by and I will be stuck with this product!! :(</li>
            <li> When I found online about Exposed, I was a bit desperate and skeptic, but somehow I decided to give it a try, and, omg, it worked!</li>
            <li> This product is extremely expensive for the quantify that you get in each bottle and the worst part is that it does not work.</li>
            <li> Their customer service is terrible and the way they set you up to automatically reorder and be charged again should be illegal.  </li>
            <li> A nurse from my dermo&#x27;s office told me to try this system before taking all the hormone crap the doctor wanted to give me.  </li>
            <li> Having bad skin is in my genes, my Mum and Dad both had horrible skin when they were my age.</li>
            <li> After week 3 my skin was so bad; i thought it was part of the &amp;#34; It may get worst before it gets better&amp;#34</li>
            <li> IT WAS BAD!</li>
            <li> It was so bad that not even a pound of make up could cover it up!)</li>
            <li> I hated having my picture taken or even walking out of the house with out</li>
            <li> I had got to the point of embarrassment and hated ppl seeing me without make up to hide my scars and acne.</li>
            <li> I HATED having to wear makeup to cover it up.</li>
            <li> I am stuck with a very bad feeling that I was sold a phony guarantee.  </li>
            <li> i had very bad ance</li>
            <li> Had a very ugly reaction to this product.</li>
            <li> Sometimes people might be put off by the price of a product line, but I assure you, you will not be disappointed in Exposed!</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed both in the product and the company that makes it.  </li>
            <li> I know how awful it is to worry about your skin all the time</li>
            <li> I know how awful it is to worry about your skin all the time</li>
            <li> It was embarrassing and awful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through two sets now, and the bottles have all been TERRIBLE.</li>
            <li> It was making me miserable</li>
            <li> and it just keep getting worst!</li>
            <li> About 3 years ago I got off birth control for health reasons, however, at the tender age of 27, i went through the worst puberty ever because of this.  </li>
            <li> It was devastating and embarrassing and I literally tried everything!</li>
            <li> I struggle with breakouts often, horrible ones.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s the worst that could happen ?!?!?</li>
            <li> I have had terrible acne since 4th grade and now at 23 I am still experiencing it terrible.</li>
            <li> this helped someone out there suffering from the awful damage acne</li>
            <li> Ever since I switched to Exposed my skin has been moister and I haven&#x27;t had the awful patchy look when I put make up on!  </li>
            <li> this gave me horrible clogged pores on my chin- not inflamed acne but just clogged</li>

            <li> This product helped clear up my skin better than any other system. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This company should be sending me a thank you for spending literally hundreds of dollars :) This is the only thing I have found that works for my oily skin to keep the pimples under control.  I have found that I have to follow the regime closely or I end up breaking out again.  I have noticed, however, that the products do not stay very consistent.  Sometimes the clear pore serum is sticky and a bit rubbery and other times it is completely different.  No matter what though, somehow this product works for my skin better than anything I have tried.  Unless I can find a product that works as well and doesn&#x27;t cost as much, I will continue to use this because of the results.  I do wish iit didn&#x27;t cost so much.</li>
            <li> more and more acnes are coming out everyday and whaaat? reduce inflammation? redness? my pimples got so red and my face&#x27;s tone got darker</li>
            <li> Exposed Skin Care has truly changed my life. It has made me so much happier and just wow. It takes a lot of time to work. Give it at least 1 month for you to see differences. After that your skin will heal on its own and you&#x27;ll be happier. Life changes when you use expose. Its not like any other product that says oh this will work and what not. IT ACTUALLY WORKS. Get it now and help yourself out! Its an amazing product!!!</li>
            <li> I am 20 years old and I have tried dozens of different acne treatments. The products I&#x27;ve tried range from Proactiv to Neutrogena and Clean/Clear. Nothing worked as well as Exposed. I&#x27;ve been using Exposed for about a year now and I have seen a great improvement in my skin. Even my acne scars have faded. With the other products, my skin would either get used to the product after using it for a while and stop working or make me breakout. Exposed didn&#x27;t do this at all. My skin is a lot clearer and a barely get any pimples! My skin looks and feels great! GREAT PRODUCT!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
            <li> Best acne treatment I&#x27;ve tried so far and I have tried quite a few. I find the best results with a combination of a good diet and Exposed treatment.</li>
            <li> Has lessened my acne and exposed skin care makes my skin feel good and look less blotchy. Proactiv was not effective nor did it make my skin feel healthy.</li>
            <li> Exposed works so well after the first two weeks your face will look rejuvenated. Don&#x27;t be alarmed if more acne shows after the first week or so because Exposed is just basically restoring your face by pulling all the acne out. Overall GREAT!!!</li>
            <li> I am in my late 40&#x27;s and still have problems with breakouts.  Sometimes i go onto the web to see what products are rated the highest.  Exposed Acne Treatment was one of those rated very well so i decided to try it.   I use all of the basic products including the scrub. It has made such a difference.  Not only does it help with acne, it makes my skin feel better too.  You can buy kits or buy individual products.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> After trying over the counter treatments for years I decided to give a treatment like this a shot and have been very happy with the results. My skin is noticeably clearer and as healthy as I can ever remember. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have now been a customer of Exposed Skin care products and I am very pleased. The products are gentle on the skin and the results are obvious. I have had many friends compliment me on how healthy my skin looks. I have no complaints about the product.</li>
            <li> I have been using Exposed for over a year now and i must confess, the results are amazing.  This product really works and i am grateful for them. I had bad acne and the product i was using before could not work anymore. Switching to Exposed has not only saved me but also, given me back the smile i wanted on my face.  Thank you Exposed.</li>
            <li> I had used Cliniques 3 step system for about 4 years and this past year I began breaking out all over my chin and it would not go away.  It was soo gross!!!  I was about to purchase proactive when I saw an ad for this stuff online and then I started researching it and reading reviews. They were so good that I decided to try it.  My face has never looked better.  It is clear and my skin looks great!  The microderm scrub has also helped with the scars that were left behind on my chin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Exposed Skincare products for years and have considerably better results with these products than any others I&#x27;ve tried (that includes Proactive and expensive RX products from the dermatologist).  My 13 year old daughter now uses the products as well.  I&#x27;ve also found that their customer service is excellent at Exposed Skincare.  Overall, I would say to try these products if you deal with frustrating unsightly acne, like I have since I was 12 years old (I&#x27;m now 38)!</li>
            <li> First off, \\&quot;Exposed, keep your credit...I won&#x27;t need it.\\&quot;  I have used this product for approximately 6 months.  Exposed worked wonderfully, for the first 2-3 months.  I have hit a plateau, no improvement.  My biggest problem with this product is \\&quot;freshness\\&quot; and customer service.    My first order arrived and I began using the toner.  It felt as if I was applying crushed glass with a cotton ball.  Since I was unfamiliar with the line, I fired off an email to customer service.  Then another, AND ANOTHER!  Never did I receive a reply to my question, \\&quot;Was this normal?\\&quot;.  I kept using it, being very delicate with my toner application.  The next shipment, no glass.  After 1 week, the \\&quot;glass effect\\&quot; was back.  The toner had crystallized.  I was mad.  Another email...another disregarding of my question.  It happened again the following month, but it stayed in a liquid form for about 2 weeks.      Then, my credit card company changed their processor and my card information.  I called customer service to inform them of the change, purposefully leaving a message regarding \\&quot;billing\\&quot;.  Did they call back?  NO.  I called again and left the message ( I never got anything but voicemail) \\&quot;My credit card information has changed.  I guess we will just let this subscription expire, unless I receive a call from you.\\&quot;  Customer service called back in less than 10 minutes.  I know where there \\&quot;customer concern\\&quot; lies.</li>
            <li> Great for adult acne. Does not over dry. My favorite product is the cleanser. I use it twice a day and it keeps my acne at bay.</li>
            <li> I started using this product months ago. I&#x27;ve had some pretty difficult times with my skin and at the beginning of summer last year it got really bad! I was at the point where I would try anything - literally. I surfed the net and actually found another product line that I tried first - not as good in my opinion. Then I found the Exposed line and I love it! I was hesitant to believe that a system could actually help my situation, since I was striking out left and right, but I was very pleasantly surprised! My face cleared up after having a serious bout with cystic acne. :(  If you follow the advice given with the system - such as diet recommendations - you should absolutely see some dramatic results. I&#x27;ve recommended this product line to others because it&#x27;s worked so well for me. Sometimes people might be put off by the price of a product line, but I assure you, you will not be disappointed in Exposed! Give it a try.</li>
            <li> I started using the expanded kit in January. I was nervous because I have sensitive skin, but it has worked beautifully. My acne had gotten so bad that I was embarrassed to go to the gym without makeup and I actually cried a few times looking at how awful my skin was.     After 30 days my skin looked WAyyyyyyyyyyyy better, but after 60 days my acne was gone. Now, it is April (3 months) and I don&#x27;t even need makeup. My skin looks so healthy and clear. I totally recommend the whole kit. You may find that some of the products work better then others for your skin. My only suggestion is to always use the cleanser, clearing tonic and clear pore serum. I use the acne treatment serum as a spot treatment.    Lastly, a lot of people think this is pricey, but I just have to say clear skin is so worth it!!!!!! When your skin is clear it takes way less time to get ready in the morning and you just feel better about yourself.</li>
            <li> Works great, awesome price</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I use the Expanded Kit every day and night. The facial cleanser is very light on my skin and doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation or redness. I use the moisture complex on my face, instead of lotion, because it moisturizes my skin without leaving behind an oily residue. It leaves my skin feeling smooth and refreshed.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product, works well.  I haven&#x27;t experienced any over drying like with most products.  The acne serum indicates you can wear under makeup but you can&#x27;t it gets gummy.  Overall, I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> My daughter has sensitive skin.  However, I researched and found this product&#x27;s claim to be promising.  I spent the money and my daughter began using Exposed faithfully.  We expected her skin to get worse initially but it kept breaking out even more than it was before using Exposed.  It wasn&#x27;t worth the money in our situation.  I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on this product if I were you.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for a few weeks now and i must say that its starting to clear most of my acne. i can see that my skin is getting softer. even the scars from past acne is starting to fade. i&#x27;m sure ill be able to have clear skin by next kit.</li>
            <li> I am 34 years old, I&#x27;ve had mild to moderate acne since my early teens. I have pretty much every type of acne, whiteheads, blackheads, cystic. I have extremely sensitive skin. I can&#x27;t use most benzoyl peroxide treatments because my skin gets extremely red, itchy, and peels. I&#x27;ve gone to the dermatologist in the past and tried prescription creams and antibiotics, but they were so harsh that I was embarrassed with the results. I had similar issues with Proactiv when I tried it many years ago. I had settled with regular OTC treatments like Olay and Neutrogena and resigned myself to having acne. About a month and a half ago I had a particularly bad breakout and I resolved to try something new. After researching several websites online, I decided to try Exposed. I liked the idea of it because of the natural remedies combined with the typical treatments. I&#x27;m about a month in and I am pleased with the results. My acne has significantly decreased. I do have some minor peeling in a few spots but I don&#x27;t have that burning or itching I normally get with harsh acne treatments. My skin feels smoother and I feel more confident in my appearance. My advice for anyone with sensitive skin is to start out slowly and let your skin build up a tolerance to the medications. A little goes a long way with all the products. It is expensive, but it should last for 2-3 months as long as you don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li> I am just an 18yr Old College Student, Male. I received my order just yesterday in the morning and used it that morning and evening. As I began using it this morning after I awoke, I had already noticed some inflammation EXTREMELY CALM DOWN. Especially one specific area that I had gotten from a breakout a couple of days ago... Honestly, it&#x27;s not the main ingredients like Benzoyl Peroxide or Salicylic Acid that make the product this good, it&#x27;s the other natural ingredients like their extracts that really mix well together. I have struggled and crippled myself with acne and acne products that don&#x27;t on me anymore, from over-the-counter(Murad, Proactive, etc), to Medication from my dermatologist. For me with this problematic and stubborn acne to have inflammation to calm down in only 24 hours..... I think this is my new best friend. Give it a try, it doesn&#x27;t hurt!</li>
            <li> Made my acne worse. I wouldn&#x27;t use it again.</li>
            <li> My daughter has been using this system faithfully for the last 5 months!  And her acne has not gotten better.  She eats healthy, drinks lots of water...even takes a couple of supplements.  We are going to try Proactive next.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Exposed Acne product for several months now and it&#x27;s been the best I&#x27;ve tried so far... and I have also used Proactiv and other over the counter treatments.  Exposed had the best and fastest results. Shipping was quick and easy. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it has not helped at all.  Some of the products made my skin worse.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Exposed Expanded kit for my teenage daughter after doing much research.  All of the over the counter products we had tried did absolutely nothing.  She had really bad acne on her forehead and both cheeks.  Within 2 weeks of her using this product as directed, I could already tell a huge improvement as the acne was getting smaller and wasn&#x27;t quite as red.  After approx. 4-6 more weeks, her acne was completely gone and her face was clear!  I really wish I had taken before and after pics of her face because the results were amazing!  She even goes to the store now without any makeup on because her complexion is so smooth.  My younger teenage daughter also developed bad acne on her forehead so I began ordering the expanding kit for her as well.  She received the same results as my oldest daughter, although, my younger daughter does have scarring from her acne.  I continue to purchase the expanded kits for both of my daughters to use because their skin is so beautiful now.  I have had friends ask what my daughters have used for their skin and I recommend this product every time!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using exposed for about 1 year now and the results are amazing. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and I&#x27;ve seen a huge difference within just 2 days of using the product. I&#x27;m a customer for life, I&#x27;m set up on auto pay every month so I don&#x27;t run out. It truely changed the way I see myself in the mirror. I am one happy customer.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT!! Better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried, would recommend it to anyone no matter your skin type. Both my sister and I started ordering the &#x27;Exposed Acne Treatment - Basic kit&#x27; after proactiv failed to give the results we would have liked and we would never go back to anything else.</li>
            <li> I decided to start using this product because it&#x27;s natural and I was tired of using harmful chemicals on my skin.  I have been using it for about 2 months and my skin is not clear yet but I had been switching products so much before beginning this one that I think I need to give it more time.  Being a woman in college also doesn&#x27;t help with all of the hormones and stress.  Definitely give it a try!</li>
            <li> Without question this product has been the most effective acne treatment for my teenage son.  He has been using Exposed for a year now, and he intends to keep using it.  Thanks Exposed for giving relief to the teen in our home.</li>
            <li> I switched to Exposed Acne Treatment about a year ago.  I am in my 30s and I was originally using Proactive Extra Strength, it worked for a few years for me, but then my face started breaking out again.  I also had super some super dry patches that would conveniently show up in the middle of the day that were not too appealing.  I then tried Proactive Plus for about 90 days, because that was new advertised great product, but that only made my acne worse.  I then searched online and found many great reviews on Exposed.  I still have a few minor (manageable) break outs, but at least my skin is more clear and feels healthy.</li>
            <li> Both of my boys have been using Exposed Skincare Products for the past 3 months. Both had been to the dermatologist several times, used prescriptions like Tazorac and Solodyn and it just wasn&#x27;t clearing up the acne on their face. We realize that some products work better than others depending on the type of skin you may have. Over the years, they have used just about every over-the-counter pads and creams there are and it just wasn&#x27;t helping. Every now and again, my 21 yr old has a breakout and uses Exposed Skincare products to treat until it goes away. With my 19 yr old, his face was red and some of the pimples started to turn black/blue, discoloring his skin. His face looked very dry and flaky and at one point, it appeared he had a black eye. The doctor suggested we think about Accutane. We did some research online to see what our other options were and this is when we discovered Exposed Skincare. We sent away for a trial kit and membership. Within just a few weeks of using the product, my son&#x27;s face began clearing up significantly. The redness was gone and the pimples were going away and what appeared to be some scarring seemed to have disappeared too. Best of all, the black/blue discoloration was going away and no more dry, flaky skin. After talking to his doctor about the effects from using the prescriptions vs the effects from using Exposed Skincare products, the doctor encouraged him to continue using the Exposed Skincare products. Thanks Exposed Skincare!</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I have combination oily/dry skin, so it has always been a struggle to find good face products that don&#x27;t dry me out but also don&#x27;t leave my skin shiny and cause breakouts. My face was often red and blotchy for hours after using any product. I tried Proactiv plus for about 6 months, and I wasn&#x27;t happy. It dried out my skin some and made the red blotchy texture even more prominent. So I went searching for another alternative and came across a blog that recommended Exposed. After a week, I was in love. I use small amounts of each product, and only once a day (instead of twice, and since there are two separate acne creams, one for day/one for night, I simply alternate them, washing my face just once a day). My skin is clearer, there is hardly any redness any more and my pores are smaller. My skin looks clean and smooth, neither oily nor dry. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now and still love it. I did see the notice saying that sometimes skin gets worse before it starts improving (as it adjusts to the products) but this did not happen to me. I also had zero burning and very little irritation when using Exposed (Proactiv included lots of burning and lots of irritation). The tonic was weird and required some adjusting since I&#x27;ve never used a tonic before. You have to wet your face with it before applying the cream. It seemed like a pain in the butt at first but I got the hang of it after the first week and it&#x27;s super easy now. Seriously love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Other products did not work for my daughters. After researching online for the best product, we chose Exposed-and it has worked at keeping their skin clear and beautiful for over a year. My son is now using it too.</li>
            <li> After years of trying different OTC products &amp; prescribed medications, I have finally found something that keeps my skin clear.   My skin looks so great!! I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have had trouble skin all my life. Now in my early 30&#x27;s I still struggle with acne, but my skin is super sensitive so it is difficult to find a product that is gentle and effective. I began seeing results within 2 weeks of using Exposed and while I periodically have breakouts, the serums calm them down quickly. I also have noticed that the redness had decreased dramatically and my pores are smaller as well. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Hi if you have bad skin or just mild acne this is for you. I&#x27;ve been on this product for the last couple of months and my skin has changed dramatically. I thought i was going through mature age acne, it was frustrating to see product after product failing EVEN pro active. This was the last product i was willing to try, after searching the internet for top 10  acne solutions i came across the expanded kit. I started using it and my skin cleared up gradually after a couple of weeks and felt softer and healthier straight away. Its now been just over a couple of months and my confidence is back, my skin is clear and i dont have to worry about my pimple breakouts anymore. So if your down and have tried many products i personally stand by this product. All the best!</li>
            <li> I have used Exposed for the past 2 months and it works really well. I don&#x27;t get breakouts as much no more and my skin feels smooth. This product has worked better for me than when I used Proactiv or other skin care products. The cost could be cheaper but you get what you pay for I guess. Overall, I would recommend this product for sure.</li>
            <li> i use everything in this set plus the mask and mircroscrub.  i won&#x27;t comment on the moisture complex because i don&#x27;t use it every day, and i only use it when i&#x27;m dry or remember. but if you use the day and night plus the toning serum plus the mask 1x a wk to prevent future breakouts - your skin will be clear. the mircroscrub is great especially if you&#x27;re skin is dry just don&#x27;t forget to moistureize. the moisturizer isn&#x27;t oily which is great from combination skin. i have trouble finding products that won&#x27;t irritate me. i used to use neutrogena skinID, and after awhile it just didnt work anymore and it was too strong. I recommend this product. buying the product from their actual site is cheaper.</li>
            <li> I have been using Exposed skincare for more than 3 years.  It has been the only thing that has worked on my skin without any negative side effects.  The ingredients are natural unlike some of the other products out there for acne treatment.  I have really sensitive skin to benzoyl peroxide which most of the other products on the market contain.  They would make my skin crack and break and over dry.  Exposed doesn&#x27;t contain that ingredient and therefore has never overdried my skin.  The reason I like this expanded kit is because it contains the moisturizer.  I would highly recommend this product.  My only complaint is that after a while, I barely needed the acne treatment anymore so I have tubes and tubes of it leftover!  That&#x27;s definitely a problem I&#x27;m happy to have!</li>
            <li> I have been using Exposed Acne product for a few months now and it&#x27;s been the best I&#x27;ve ever tried. Over the years I have used so many other products and finally found the one :)  My skin has never been so clear and Exposed has been the only one to get these great results. I highly recommend Exposed Skin Care becuase it had the best and fastest results. Thank you Exposed  :) i can finally smile and be proud of my skin.</li>
            <li> I usually do not write reviews. I&#x27;ve always read them but after using Exposed I was pleased that I wanted to write this review. Simple, gentle and effective describe Exposed my skin feels great. It&#x27;s incredibly smooth I actually look forward to washing my face and not worring about breaking out and last but not least, what an amazing price! Thank you, Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> I am 18 years old and have tried everything to get rid of my acne. Exposed is the best by far! I have tried proactive (the old one and the new one). I used it for about a year. I have also tried Murad. I have never gotten better results than I did with exposed. It hasn&#x27;t even been a week, only six days and many of my pimples have cleared up! It is really an incredible acne treatment and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase. Exposed is completely worth the money! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 30, a dude, and have been fighting with my skin since i was about 14. I&#x27;ve gone through cheapo in store products (too many to name) and some of the more expensive products: Murad, clinique, etc. No matter what i always had blackheads, a few random pimples, and about 1 to 2 times a month i would get a lovely breakout. my skin wasnt THAT bad but i always always always had problems. I found Exposed by accident. I went online looking for alternative ways to get my skin to stop screwing with me and i got a link for the exposed \\&quot;lifestyle tips\\&quot; page. That led me to looking into the actual product. I skeptically pulled the trigger and got the uber kit with all the goodies. First week was not that rough, i got a few new pimples but i noticed my blackheads were getting a little smaller. Most skin care programs will warn you that it usually gets worse before it gets better. It got better. Weeks 2 and 3 showed steady improvement, few new minor pimples and my skin started looking healthier. I&#x27;m on the middle of week 4 and my skin looks better than it has in longer than i can remember. I KNOW my skin is healthier too. I used to get up early so i could give my face time to calm down before i went to work. Even washing it gently with my hands would leave it red, patchy, and swollen. Lotion was also a daily requirement. Definitely not the case now, i scrub and scrub and no irritation. I also know it&#x27;s healthier cause of the comments i get at work. People complain about the tonic. It DOES hurt at first. get over it, your skin is jacked up. I started using it once every other day there was certainly a little discomfort. Now i use it 1 to 2 times a day and there is absolutely no discomfort. Actually, all of the products in this kit have a much shorter and extreme \\&quot;getting used to\\&quot; period than other stuff i have tried. I recommend geting the kit with everything on your first buy. Some stuff works better for certain people. I live with my sister and we both use the products a little differently. Try them all and then you can re-buy the ones you really like. Lastly, i like that this program addresses scarring. I&#x27;ve definitely got a few red marks from all the years of torment and like exposed claims, the marks are fading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked at the other reviews, definitely a few fakes, it&#x27;s kind of off putting but whatever. If you leave a comment i&#x27;ll try to respond. I know how awful it is to worry about your skin all the time and if my input can help another exhausted acne victim i will be glad to give it. No skin care program works for everyone, just make sure give whatever you try a fair chance. Nothing is going to happen overnight. I strongly recommend giving Exposed a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS, wash your pillow cases... a lot. people always forget to do that.differently.

            <li> I have always struggled with mild acne but as I got closer to 40, the more severe it seemed to become.  For the past few years, I&#x27;ve particularly struggled with 2 patches of acne; one on my chin and one near my temple.  I was considering going to a demonologist but was weary of taking pills or having to use a really harsh product.  I did some research on the internet and decided to give Exposed a try after reading many positive reviews.  It didn&#x27;t work overnight, but it worked!  It took about 3 weeks for my skin to clear and my skin tone is better than ever.  I occasionally get a pimple but they usually disappear within a day or two with continued use of the product.  My only dislike about the product is that I hate having to use 3 products at night and 3 in the morning, but seriously, that&#x27;s very little inconvenience for the results I have achieved.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I use the facial cleanser plus acne treatment and the moisturizer and I&#x27;ve had clear skin that Ive been able to maintain. The treatment cleared me up in a matter of weeks and I haven&#x27;t had a breakout since. Thank you exposed skin care!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a year and a half and I can honestly say it works better than anything else I have tried.  I have been struggling with acne for years and have tried pretty much everything.  I like the fact that it comes with a moisturizer that is specifically designed to not clog your pores.  A lot of other acne treatment systems don&#x27;t include a moisturizer and keeping your skin from drying out too much is essential to these types of products working.  The customer service department is also great and has always allowed me to make substitutions in my kits at no extra charge, which is great if you find yourself running out of one item and having a surplus on another all the time.</li>
            <li> I also tried Proactive before I found Exposed. Proactive didn&#x27;t prevent my breakouts, like Exposed does. I&#x27;m not going to rave on about Exposed and say \\&quot;it&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve ever tried\\&quot;, but for what it costs and what I need, it&#x27;s working to the extent that it can. Having bad skin is in my genes, my Mum and Dad both had horrible skin when they were my age. I use Exposed in conjunction with taking the Pill, which has helped calm down my skin over the years. That&#x27;s why I won&#x27;t credit all of the improvement to Exposed, but it is definitely doing its job. AND I&#x27;m super stoked - before I started using Exposed, I had a laugh line/wrinkle developing and I&#x27;m only 23!! Since I&#x27;ve been using Exposed, it&#x27;s been getting smaller and smaller. Awesome!!!</li>
            <li> I used this product as directed b/c I had mild acne and dark spots. This product did not improve my acne and neither did it work on my dark spots this product was a complete waste of money . I&#x27;m not saying it doesn&#x27;t work but I am saying it didn&#x27;t work at all for my skin!</li>
            <li> My son started using this product. He had tried several other name brand products prior to using Exposed and did not get the results he has gotten from Exposed. I am so happy there is a product out there that is made of natural ingredients for the face. It works great and would recommend it to anyone. So would my son. Thanks Exposed!</li>
            <li> I tried Proactiv and Murad before I tried this, and none of those worked at all. I&#x27;ve been using the expanded kit for over a year now, and have not had any breakouts. Before Exposed, I had breakouts all the time. All the Exposed products I have used have a really nice quality feel, and do not cause excessive dryness. Give this product a chance - try it for a a few weeks before making a judgement.</li>
            <li> Exposed is by far the best acne treatment I have ever seen.     I have 2 daughters, 21 and 14. Both have experienced troublesome acne, and I have had my share of adult acne. Needless to say, I have experience with a full range of acne treatments, from the basics like Clearasil to celebrity endorsed products like Proactiv. Fact of the matter is, most of these products just don&#x27;t work. Blemishes remain until the natural healing process clears them up, but the healthy tissue around the blemish is irritated and peeling, burned from the chemicals in the lotions.  My older daughter, having a slightly darker complexion, has even experienced bleaching, actual white patches on her face, from some of the more expensive of these products.     We have been using Exposed for about a year. I find the products safe, gentle, long lasting, and the best part is :  THEY WORK!!!!  My older daughter is a little less likely to follow the full regime, and so she still experiences some minor issues with her skin. However the younger daughter follows the directions exactly and she has rarely a breakout.  When she does, it is minor and easy to keep under control. I love it, as well. It is non-drying, and my adult acne is essentially gone.     The company offers great savings in a variety of creative ways, has reasonable shipping, and a combination of ways to purchase their products so you can affordably purchase what you need. I find the expense well within reason (esp. in light of how many products we have tried and how much it has cost over the years), and again, the best part:  THE PRODUCTS WORK!!!    I highly recommend trying EXPOSED ACNE TREATMENT.  They offer a great guarantee - who else will offer you your money back after 12 months??</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything...from Proactiv to Philosophy, including expensive lines like Dermologica and iS Clinical; but I&#x27;ve never had the kind of results I&#x27;ve seen with Exposed. After trying so many products over 20 years, with no results, I was frustrated and very skeptical about trying Exposed...Now I only wish I&#x27;d stumbled upon Exposed sooner! Not only has it cleared up my skin, (without leaving it dry and flakey), it&#x27;s also relatively inexpensive and they have fantastic customer service...After receiving a package and finding that most of the bottle of cleanser had leaked out during shipment, they quickly responded to my e-mail and sent a replacement. I&#x27;ve never had a problem that wasn&#x27;t quickly and appropriately remedied, in nearly 3 years of use and bimonthly delivery.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item directly from the Exposed website. They took payment immediately but it took them a full week to ship the order, despite their claims that they ship within 48 hours. It then took an additional week to receive it.    Once I finally received it, it was impossible to get the plastic seals off the bottles and I resorted to using tweezers to remove the congealed glue mess to make them function. The bottles do not close completely and are useless for traveling. What a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> I have sufferred from acne since i was 16 yrs old and I have used this product for about 2 years now. The first time i started using it, My face cleared up beautifully but however as has been my experience with most acne products that have worked for me, I started to break out again in about a yr and although i still break out, Exposed has definitely helped manage but not completely eliminate my acne and that&#x27;s why i give it 3 stars</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product for a couple days and my skin feels so soft and clean, and I can see my old acne scars starting to fade and new blemishes are shrinking slowly. Will definitely re purchase in the future.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I have tried and bought all kinds of different products and brands and have never been truly and completely satisfied. I am 29 years old and after having 2 kids, my skin and I were constantly at war. So I just resigned to wearing make-up everyday to hide my embarrassing skin (even in the summer going in the pool or to go to the gym). So I thought I would give this a try. I saw improvement immediately and it&#x27;s been 2 months and I am so happy! I didn&#x27;t wear any makeup today and I go without it all the time now! I have ordered some refills and other products like a mask that Exposed offers. My skin feels so soft, is glowing, and is clear. I&#x27;m so happy!</li>
            <li> I have only been using Exposed for about a month now and I have seen improvement in my skin tone and texture. The areas of my face that only had minor acne problems have cleared up, but I am still waiting for my chin (my biggest problem area) to clear up. Over all I like it. No irritation and definitely an improvement.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 30 days and so far I have seen a noticable difference in the tecture of my skin, and my breakouts are much fewer, still a few here and there, but overall I like what I see and feel. My dermatologist says you have to use something for at least 90 days to get the full affect, so I will continue and hope that even the few breakouts will disappear.</li>
            <li> I ordered this a month ago my skin has done a 360. I love how gentle the products are on my face. In the past every time I tried a new acne wash or medication I would get extremely dry skin. This has yet to happen to me even during this cold winter! I recommend this to my best friend to use also so we will see how he does with it. If you want clearer skin without being harsh Side effects order this product! And drink your water :)</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve only been uSing this for three days but wow! It&#x27;s cleared up instantly... IVe had breakouts on my forehead and chin due to stress and it&#x27;s happened consistently in the last two years. I never tried proactive or anything but I&#x27;ve always used clean and clear and Avon acne products and a few natural products, nothing really consistently worked. my face feels clean and soft with noticeably less oil and my blemishes are scabbing up and healing. A few new ones popped up but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s because they were already there to begin with and it&#x27;s clearing it up. Try this product! I researched at least 5 pages of Internet reviews on every site that google produced about best acne systems and their reviews... This one consistently popped up as number 1 about 75 or 80 percent of the time. It was eithEr proactive or exposed and I picked exposed because of the natural gentle ingredients alongside of the acne medication and proactive had a lot of reviews of skin irritation and redness, even flaky skin.... NO THANKS!</li>
            <li> I think that the Exposed line of Acne products are wonderful.  I struggled with acne through college and literally tried everything, including Proactive to Acne Free and even shifted to all natural products of Burt&#x27;s Bees.  None of these products worked for my face, and I really felt like I would never have clear skin again.  I didn&#x27;t want to get a prescription, which is what I was given through the dermatologist, which dried my skin like crazy and caused other issues, so I really wanted to find something that would work without one.  I looked online and found Exposed and loved that it was a mix of natural and other ingredients.  At first it didn&#x27;t work, but I kept with it and followed the directions completely, and I am so excited about my skin.  It has even helped in healing some of my acne scars from before.  I highly recommend this product.  It has boosted my confidence in myself, and I&#x27;m really thankful for this product.  I know it is a little expensive, but I think it really is worth it if you struggle with acne like I did.  I&#x27;ve hardly had any zits since, and I feel great about the skin I&#x27;m in!</li>
            <li> I had really bad acne before using Exposed, and no other acne wash was working for me. I have been using Exposed Skin Care for over a year now and I am acne free. I love the face cleanser and clear pore serum, and the clarifying mask works wonders! If you have acne and nothing else has worked so far, definitely try Exposed!</li>
            <li> of all of the acne products i have tried, including proactive, none have worked like exposed. I had noticeable results within 10 days and within a month my skin was clear! I RECOMMEND anyone who is struggling with acne to give exposed a try.</li>
            <li> I used Poractiv for over 5 years. One day it just stopped working. I started breaking out with many cystic zits. I decided it was time to switch to something new. When I found exposed I was skeptic at first because I hadn&#x27;t heard much about it. But the natural way was the way I wanted to go so I was sold. It was a good choice for me. My skin cleared up in less that 2 weeks. My skin tone has improved dramatically and isn&#x27;t dry and irritated like it was with Proactiv. I am way more confident and will never use anything other than Exposed for now on.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 8 months now and I absolutely love it! I have tried many different kinds of facial treatment products and this is the only one I have found that does not leave my face feeling oily. I highly reccommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> I started using this product a couple of years ago, and I am totally pleased with the results I have recieved from using Exposed. Before I discovered the product I was using oral antibiotics as well as prescribed topical ointments for my acne. They worked okay for a while, but it took a toll on my skin. After trying Exposed, I have been able to stop taking my prescribed medication and my face looks better than ever. I am just so glad that there is a product out there that actually does what it claims. THANK U!!!!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this. I only had slight problems with acne. It mostly flared up once a month, but was getting steadily worse (which is weird because I am an adult and used to have perfect skin). I thought I would give Exposed a try and it sucks! I have used it faithfully for 2 months and my skin is WORSE THAN EVER! Bumps all over my face all the time. I thought I just needed to use it for a while for it to affect my skin but I cannot give it anymore time. It looks like other people may have had the same problem. I am going to stop using it today. It has seriously made my skin emarassingly horrible and I wish I had never tried it. I&#x27;m not even going to attempt to return it after the horror stories I have read about customer&#x27;s failed attempts at doing so. I know my skin problem is due to using Exposed because it got worse right when I started using the product. I don&#x27;t eat chocolate, rarely eat greasy food and the only thing I drink is water. I take Biotin for skin, hair and nails. It HAS to be this product that did this. So disappointed. Don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
            <li> I love this kit!  I have struggled with acne for a long time and I have never found any product or treatment system that works nearly as well as exposed!  I love that this acne treatment system uses many natural extracts.  Many other acne products left my face dry and flakey, but this Exposed system works womderfully!  I like the expanded kit particularly because it comes with the moisturizer.  The moisturizer is so creamy and smooth on my skin.  When I would break out, my pimples were so deep rooted they would take weeks to heal.  Even without popping them they would always leave scars.  I am glad to say with the help of Exposed, I have been acne free for over a year!! And that is something I never thought I would be able to say!!  I LOVE EXPOSED!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Exposed Skin Care expanded kit every 3 months for about a year now and I absolutely love the products.  At the beginning it took about two and half weeks to show results that I was happy with and after that it was more of a maintenance process.  With that I have found that it takes less and less of the product to maintain the desired results.  Both the morning and evening application process are quick and easy once a routine is established.  I have tried the other competing products and I was never able to get the results i wanted so I usually just gave up on it. Exposed allowed me to get in a routine so that I was able to maintain clean and healthy skin.</li>
            <li> I have used this product off and on for a little over two years and it is the most amazing stuff! It doesn&#x27;t make my skin dry like most other products do and when you follow the routine, your skin will be clear and soft within 2 weeks tops! I am glad that I have found this line of products because I have struggled with skin issues since pre-teen stage and I am now 20 and still have problems. I would highly recommend this for anyone especially those that feel like they have lost hope in finding something that will clear up their skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve battled with acne since I was 11 years old - I&#x27;m 29 now, and still struggling with it.  I&#x27;ve tried all over the counter treatments and antibiotics and none of them work.  Add to the mix that my skin is sensitive, and it&#x27;s really very hard to find a product to help.  Then I found Exposed - what harm can it do to try, I thought?  And I was delighted when it really did help my skin.  I&#x27;ve been using it for around 3-4 weeks now and my skin is really clearing.  I have problems with the skin on my shoulders too - it works there as well.  I can&#x27;t use the products as often as recommended otherwise they do irritate my sensitive skin, but I&#x27;ve found how to use them so it suits my skin.  It may take a little longer to clear my acne this way, but at least I can avoid making my skin sore.  I love the botanicals in the products - I believe these are what allows my skin to tolerate the harsher active ingredients.  The moisture complex has helped to clear the scarring on my shoulders, and the cloth is an excellent exfoliater to help clean up any flaky skin and leave you looking glowing.  But the star of the kit has to be the cleanser, shortly followed by the acne treatment serum.  I would honestly recommend these products.  I was skeptical at first - now I&#x27;m a loyal convert.</li>
            <li> Although this item is a bit pricy, I think it&#x27;s worth the cost. I&#x27;ve used many other products, but this is the first that was able to convince me to stop wearing foundation because my natural skin looked better not covered up. I was using bare minerals. I had my dermatologist look over the ingredients and he also approved. If you&#x27;re having trouble maintaining good skin, I would suggest you look into this product.</li>
            <li> Love this product! After having tried many options for my daughter we finally found this product and it worked almost immediately. Now she swears by it. It is easy to use with the step instructions and clearly labeled bottles and has done wonders for my daughter&#x27;s skin and self esteem. In addition, the customer service is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the results of this product. I had moderately severe acne that wasn&#x27;t responding to drug store remedies. After reading a few reviews, I tried the Exposed system. The cleanser is my favorite, my skin feels smooth, clean and refreshed, no over-drying. The toner is average. The acne treatment serum (used in the morning) and pore clarifying serum (used in the evening) are wonderful and effective. After one month my skin was free of blemishes and redness and my pores were smaller. I don&#x27;t find use for the towel that was provided with the kit. I used the clarifying mask once a week and it left my skin soft and smooth. I did not find the moisturizer to be better than store-bought brands. A discount is given for signing up for the monthly program but it&#x27;s easy to discontinue online if you don&#x27;t want to get the product every month. I would absolutely recommend this product to help clear up mild to moderate acne</li>
            <li> I first started using exposed, because the product that I had been using was discontinued. And then I  had no idea what to use,and I came across this and gave it a try. At first my face broke out a little bit more, but then after about 3 weeks it got,  and stayed clear.I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year now and am really glad I found it.      A.Alexander,faithful exposed user.</li>
            <li> After trying many products on the market and nothing was making me happy, i researched online and decided to give Exposed a try...and I was sooooo impressed!!!! I am a personal trainer and often at the gym 10-12 hours per day and between my clients workouts and my own, my skin is under stress and lots of perspiration throughout the day.  Most products have never been able to help my skin from breaking out especially from extreme workouts but I love Exposed....it&#x27;s cleared up my skin and completely evened out my skin tone.  I&#x27;m telling all my clients about it and spreading the word that it works!</li>
            <li> This system works very well. I have been using Exposed for about a year now and am very happy with the results.  I no longer get large painful pimples and most of the time I don&#x27;t even have to wear foundation/concealer; whereas before, I wouldn&#x27;t dream of leaving the house without foundation on.  I do still have periodic breakouts, but it is not nearly as bad as it was before. The product was a bit drying to my skin at first, so I had to back down to once a day.  After about a month of use, my skin adjusted and I can use it twice daily with no side effects.  Just be patient, it will work.  As for the other review that claims there are false reviews posted because they are not \\&quot;verified amazon purchases\\&quot;....it is because Exposed has their own website for sales that is separate from amazon.</li>
            <li> Do not purchase this product does not work and you can&#x27;t stop the auto billing either.  Customer Service will not stop shipment.  You can get better and cheaper med by prescription. Strongly caution against giving this company your credit card number</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this kit for over 30 days now and am still getting spots! It&#x27;s not made my skin worse but also it has not improved it.   I&#x27;m going to ask for a refund if it doesn&#x27;t get better in 30 more days, because it is an expensive kit and Exposed do promise a full refund if it doesn&#x27;t work. Well, you still have to pay for the postage so I&#x27;ll be down about $40 anyway...</li>
            <li> I have tried expensive products, cheap products and everything in between for my adult acne with super sensitive skin.  Everything either makes my skin red and irritated or leaves it oily with breakouts.  I ordered Exposed because it contains natural ingredients, claimed it would not irritate my skin and does not contain any harsh chemicals like Alpha Hydroxy or Retin A.  My skin felt better after a few days and within 2 weeks my skin was clearer with a more even skin tone.  I am so glad I finally found a product that works for me.  A month later my skin has no breakouts and looks radiant.  Better than it has in years.  I will never use another product line.</li>
            <li> the product has not worked for me, its been a month and my skin is worse then it has even been.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product. I was super skeptical but with the reviews I had to try it. At 35 years old I was mortified when I started having adult acne. Mostly around my chin and some on my cheeks. It was embarrassing and awful. I tried this after trying Philosophy Clear days ahead line and also tried Dermalogica... Neither worked. This is WELL WORTH every cent I paid. It took about 2 weeks to see a big difference and by the time I went through all the products (about 6 weeks) and ordered more my skin was completely clear! I wish I had a before pic so I could post it next to what I look like now.  I seriously am so happy I took the plunge and bought this.</li>
            <li> I was using proactive for the longest time before I found exposed.  I have sensitive skin and proactive always seemed to dry my skin up and made me sometimes only use it once a day instead of the standard two times.  That in turn reduced its effectiveness.  Exposed doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out and works 100 times better than proactive ever did.</li>
            <li> I have seen a lot of improvement in my complexion over the last few weeks because of Exposed skincare. The only trouble I had was when I first started. When they say \\&quot;use Exposed products very sparingly at first\\&quot; they mean it. My skin dried up really bad. I stopped using it for a few days, then started every other day. Now, I use it every day and its working very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always struggled with acne a little bit, but it didn&#x27;t get out of control until my mid 30s for some reason.  Within just a few short weeks on the Exposed system, my face cleared right up and its been that way ever since!  I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> The only negative to this product is the priceline, and if you have more than one person using it. But for the price it works! So that is a huge plus. We saw results within 30 days, which I can not say when it comes to other facial products. It will be hard to stop using once you have started. The acne seems to come right back as soon as we stop using it. UGH!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this treatment! I have been using it for awhile now and it keeps my acne undercontrol. And the best part about it, it does it while keeping my skin from drying out like other acne medications have done.</li>
            <li> After using Exposed for one month my skin completely cleared! This product is amazing and I have been telling all my acne prone friends to use it.  I had tried antibiotics and Proactive but neither worked, I was completely astounded when I saw my skin this clear.  Everyone has noticed and told me how good it looks and I&#x27;m proud.  I no longer feel depressed because of my acne!:)This is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from moderate to severe acne for 15yrs now, spending thousands of dollars on every treatment imaginable(including lots of time consuming and costly dermatology visits). Just 6mths in and this stuff is amazing! It started working immediately, and has been great ever since. Run, don&#x27;t walk to get this product!</li>
            <li> My daughter was a little discourage with her acne and we tried a number of products that didn&#x27;t seem to make a difference. I searched and found a number of positive reviews and with the guarantee, we decided to try it. It has improved her skin and she is much happier. She is great about sticking to the routine and its improved her confidence.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Exposed for about four months now, and it has done WONDERS for my face. I had an unbelievable outbreak in February/March 2014, at age 24, and NOTHING I tried could clear up my face. I struggled for months, trying every product I could think of, before I found Exposed in September 2014. Once I got it (incredibly fast shipping!), it took about 8 weeks for my face to start getting better. My face didn&#x27;t get worse (because, honestly, I don&#x27;t think it could&#x27;ve gotten any worse) but eventually (after about 8 weeks of use) it did get SO MUCH BETTER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After only 4 months, my face isn&#x27;t 100% clear, but I feel comfortable leaving the house without makeup and I don&#x27;t worry that everyone is staring at me or thinks I&#x27;m gross. What few blemishes I do get (we&#x27;re talking a reduction from 40+ painful pimples to no more than 3 barely-noticeable blemishes) And most of all, MY FACE DOESN&#x27;T HURT ANYMORE. I used to not be able to open my mouth or widen my eyes without my skin searing in pain due to the acne. Now I can make funny faces all day long and my skin just feels like skin, not a fresh flesh wound. Not only that, my skin isn&#x27;t oily-looking anymore. My skin is soft, supple, non-greasy, and almost blemish-free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost everything is amazing about this product. There are only three small downsides I can think of:&lt;br /&gt;-It takes a little while to get used to the liquorice smell of the Cleanser, but I stopped noticing it after a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;-THE PACKAGING. I&#x27;ve been through two sets now, and the bottles have all been TERRIBLE. The Cleanser, Tonic, and Clear Pore Serum have all leaked out of their bottles while properly stored at room temperature, at sea level, in an upright position on a shelf in my bathroom. I&#x27;ve lost over half a bottle of Cleanser and nearly a whole bottle of Tonic due to leakage, and the Pore Serum is so caked around the end of the tube that I almost want to throw it out for being too gross and gooey to touch. But it&#x27;s still working, so I won&#x27;t waste it.&lt;br /&gt;-The cost. The price of the product itself isn&#x27;t so bad (comparable to similar products), it&#x27;s the shipping to Canada that kills me every time. I wish I could just order in bulk to avoid paying shipping so often, but I guess this is just how it has to be. The shipping is usually next-day (two days max.) so I can understand why it costs so much, but it doesn&#x27;t mean I have to like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exposed takes a while to work, but when it does, the results are incomparable. I&#x27;ve taken a picture of my face (almost) every day since before I started using it, and the change is remarkable. Exposed has done WONDERS for my self-confidence and is the single best thing I purchased in 2014. I am a very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t write reviews but this product has been a life saver. I have tried every product you could possibly think of and even been to dermatologist. I have always has really dry skin and random breakouts. Which I couldn&#x27;t cover up with makeup because it would Peel off due to my dry skin. This product completely reversed my skin, my acne scars are gone. But I will say your diet plays an important part too. Bc I am gave breakouts again but I know it is bc of my diet. I wash my face 3 times a day when I am suffering from a breakout. And the pimples dry up in a few days and don&#x27;t leave scars. I will never use any other product.</li>
            <li> I have two teenage boys who have acne breakouts.  We tried Proactive but it stained everything and was too drying for them.  Exposed takes everything in to consideration...oil, dirt, moisture, etc...  My boys love it, it works great, and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B002CSPIKA Expanded Kit - Exposed Acne Treatment]]    I really do reccommend this product. The price is the same as comparable products (murad, proactive) that i have tried with mixed results in the past.  It has made a serious difference in my skin, which is the most important thing. I was worried it would irritate my skin, but it hasn&#x27;t bothered me at all &amp; I have really sensitive skin!  It took me about 3 weeks to see my acne clear-up.  Now Exposed is now one of my favorite products - I couldn&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> This stuff is for real! I&#x27;ve suffered from chronic, painful acne since I was 12 years old (22 now). I have tried everything short of going to the dermotologist for a full on treatment. I never wanted to use prescription treatment for something that is a normal part of teen life, and I didn&#x27;t want them to make it worse! I&#x27;ve tried Proactiv twice with no results, almost all of Neutrogena&#x27;s line, Biore, Phisoderm, even an all natural witch hazel beauty bar. I ran my usual google search on acne treatments one day and came across Exposed. I was very dubious of the supposed effectiveness of their treatment, especially since it was structured like Proactiv and that hadn&#x27;t worked. But, I decided, what could be the harm in trying? I liked the minimal number of all natural ingredients and what they were. I ordered the expanded kit and haven&#x27;t looked back since! Almost a year and a half now with minimal to no acne! You can even run out of one of the treatments and not use it for a while, and it still works. Currently, I&#x27;m out of the clearing tonic, but still almost no bumps!    The ingredients they say they use is absolutely true. Everytime I wash my face I can smell the sage extract. I cook frequently, so I know what sage smells like and there&#x27;s no mistake. I love the caffeine and pumpkin extract in the mositurizer. It softens while waking up your skin. All of their products have very little scent, if any for some. If they do, it&#x27;s very mild and usually earthy smelling, like the sage and pumpkin. Although the kit seems like it has a lot of bottles to use, the way the treatment plan is set up, it doesn&#x27;t have you dumping 400 different things on your face everytime you use it. I only use maybe 1-2 products at a time, and all of them are light and airy.    Exposed can get a little pricey, but something I can deal with for finally having something that works. They also never claim that you will have 100% clear skin, with no breakouts. They claim that it works for the majority oftheir customers and offer several refund options, such as clearer skin in 30 days or your money back as well as the 1 yr money back guarantee. You can also send in your empty bottles of your old treatment that didn&#x27;t work for credits and free products. I don&#x27;t plan to ever go back to anything else again. Love love love Exposed!</li>
            <li> I first tried Exposed in 2006, just months before my wedding. I was desperate - I had tried EVERY professional and over the counter acne medication - both topical and internal - since I was a teenager. This time I decided to be smart, and I looked up \\&quot;best acne treatment system\\&quot; on several consumer reports websites. To my surprise, Exposed Skin Care popped up on almost every site with either a number one rating, or listed in the top five. At the time, I had never heard of this company. So I decided to give it a try. . . and WOW! There is no other word for it! I still get the occasional lonely pimple now and again, but major clusters of breakouts - GONE! And the redness and dry skin you get with Proactive? Not with Exposed! It leaves your skin soft and GLOWING! I recommend you buy the Expanded kit. The products work best when you are consistent, and use the entire system. And the Derm X cloth is PRICELESS for it&#x27;s ability to open pores and polish your skin.    A couple of notes - don&#x27;t use the clear pore serum near your eyes - that stuff is POWERFUL! Also, beware of over scrubbing with the Derm X cloth. A little goes a LONG way : )    There have been a couple of times I considered switching to a different systems, just to try something new, and I have ALWAYS regretted it!!! Oh, Exposed. I shall never cheat on you again!    Customer service is great, too. Seriously!!! Try this stuff. You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> I have been using Exposed Skin Care for almost three years.  The products are not irritating and they are pretty effective against acme on face and chest.  The only thing that I would warn people about is following the directions.  YOu have got to use it twice a day otherwise you will get small breakouts here and there.  You have to be consistent with this product.  Otherwise, I was say that this product is a good investment (better than proactive).</li>
            <li> I am in my early 40&#x27;s and had struggled with adult acne.  Found this product about 2 years ago and have been using it faithfully.  Cleared up my skin without drying it out, something that I hadn&#x27;t been able to find with other products.  My teenage son also began using recently and his skin looks great also!  We are both loyal customers!</li>
            <li> As a woman in my early 40s I&#x27;ve kept adult acne at bay for just over 10 years. The first few years I used Proactiv - which did a good job I thought, until I discovered Exposed! The difference is undeniable. I no longer have drying of my skin, and where my forehead used to always have a thin layer of teeny weeny pimples, Exposed keeps my skin soft, supple, and incredibly smooth.    The Clearing Tonic is the key, in my opinion. It does a great job of removing any excess dirt before I apply anything else. And I love that I get a new facial cloth (Derm-X Cloth) with every shipment. This all adds to the ultimate cleansing experience - far superior to Proactiv!    The only thing I kind of wish Exposed offered is an eye cream, and an extra strength pimple-zapper, as it would be nice to have all my skin care products in the one place. But really, that&#x27;s insignificant in comparison to how happy I am to have found Exposed :) I am an extremely satisfied, and thankful customer that&#x27;s not going anywhere!    UPDATE: AUGUST 21, 2014  I feel compelled to add that through trial and error over the years, I have learned the key ingredient to Exposed&#x27;s Acne Treatment Kits is the Acne Treatment Serum. I have found that even while using other brand toners, facial cleansers and moisturizers, so long as I continue to apply the Acne Treatment Serum my skin remains great. It&#x27;s the moment I stop using Exposed products altogether that my acne returns.    I&#x27;ve also found that as my skin matures, a deeply nourishing moisturizer has become a necessity. And for me, Exposed&#x27;s Moisture Complex isn&#x27;t enough - it&#x27;s a very light moisturizer that absorbs too quickly and leaves my skin wanting more. So after trying many products I now use a natural face cream by Ohio Valley Herbal Products, Inc. which leaves my skin feeling supple and hydrated. My skin has never felt or looked better!    Another great thing about Exposed&#x27;s kits is I can switch out products I don&#x27;t want, down-size or up-size my entire kitwhenever it suits me (currently I&#x27;m using the basic kit), and change my ship dates online at my own convenience. In every way this company is truly the best. For those of you still on the fence, maybe you could order a single tube of Acne Treatment Serum and give it a test run along with your present skin care routine - applying it after your toner and before your moisturizer. If after a month you see results, then you will know Exposed skin care products are the miracle you&#x27;ve been looking for!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since December.  I have Mild acne.  I have follow  the instructions,  I eat healthy and I drink plenty of water.  My face cleared up for the first month.  And the last two months my face has worsen I have bought the mask and scrub- No improvement.  Their customer line is never available. I am trying to get a refund and have yet to receive a response.  My face cleared faster when I used Cetaphil a mild soap and witch hazel.  I think this product is overpriced and not worth it.  GOOD LUCK!</li>
            <li> After trying many facial soaps from stores and even Proactiv Solution, I never saw any real results. I had tried the popular teen choices from the magazines, an expensive one from Clinique, and even the soap-free hypoallergenic ones; they would momentarily fix my blemishes, but as I kept using them, they stopped working. My face would continue to break out in all of my problem areas and the excessive maintenance caused dry patches on my face. I figured there wasn&#x27;t really a solution for my acne and I&#x27;d have to make a choice and fix only one of my problems with my combination skin at a time. However, my mom found out about a different facial step program called Exposed Skincare. We researched it and rifled through customer reviews, ending up very impressed. After my first three month supply came in, I loved the immediate results! The all-natural ingredients feel and smell great, and the multi-steps are not hard to keep track of. What&#x27;s the best part? IT&#x27;S STILL WORKING, and I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had horrible cystic acne since high school, and I&#x27;ve tried everything from ProActive to BenzaClin to Accutane. Everything. And Exposed is honestly the only stuff that actually cleared my skin up in any significant way without awful side effects. I&#x27;ve been using this for over a year now, and I will never use anything else.</li>
            <li> I have had long problems with my skin! Then I found Exposed and ordered it! I honostly can say that yess it really works! My skin is really much much better and healthy again! Thanks Exposed!!!</li>
            <li> I have tried EVERYTHING, literally EVERYTHING to get rid of my acne and this regimen has been infinitely better than Proactive, or Clean and Clear, or Neutrogena, or Acne Free, or any of those (I&#x27;ve tried them all).  This one gave me a noticeable change after just a week!</li>
            <li> I have been using exposed acne treatments for 6 months and have noticed a considerable difference in my skin.  I have tried many other products and find this to be the most effective.  My skin is clear for the first time and I feel confident without the need to cover up with makeup.  I have purchased this kit for my teenage daughter who is suffering from acne.</li>
            <li> this has worked much better for me than most other acne products out there. i still get occasional breakouts esp if its that time of the month, but this product helps a lot easing the break out when it comes. i really recommend the microderm scrub. its not included in the kit but it works great on acne scars. in due time, it lessens the appearance. it is a little pricy, but worth it!</li>
            <li> Exposed is the best secret in acne treatment, and more people suffering from acne need to know about it. I too tried every product worth trying....over the counter as well as Proactive, Murad, Max Clarity etc...... It wasn&#x27;t until i searched the internet for the top acne treatment. There was Exposed #1 on every review site i visited. My acne was not mild or moderate it was severe(painful cysts).None of the previously mentioned treatments were for severe acne only exposed. i was completely sold when i saw there was a full 1 year money back guarantee...it works. sometimes it takes longer than 30 days to fully determine if a product is working.You can&#x27;t beat there guarantee.</li>
            <li> Amazing. Just... wow. I have been struggling with acne for 12 years. Read that again, people: TWELVE YEARS. And it seems to have just gotten worse and worse since I hit my twenties. I have tried everything. Proactiv, Clean and Clear, Clinique, Vichy, Clearasil, Neutrogena, Murad, the Body Shop&#x27;s tea tree line... and on and on it goes. The only one that sort of worked was the Body Shop, but it just wasn&#x27;t consistent and only seemed to make my acne go away faster instead of preventing it from cropping up in the first place. Everything else dried out my skin to the point where even my lips were painfully cracked and peeling, and did absolutely nothing for my acne. Some products would seem to work for a little while but then just lose their effectiveness. Basically, it&#x27;s been twelve years of half-hour-long foundation and concealer routines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But THIS.  This stuff is so darn good I&#x27;m writing the only review I&#x27;ve ever written in my life. My all-over acne- which would always attack my chin, upper lip area, cheeks, and forehead with impunity- is almost entirely gone. And I&#x27;ve only been using this stuff for three days. THREE DAYS, people. Nothing has ever worked for me before at all, let alone in such a short amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And even better? The stuff makes your skin feel amazing. Nice and soft and supple. No drying. It&#x27;s just lovely. Bonus, I even love the smell of the products. Very natural and plant-like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I apply everything with clean hands. I haven&#x27;t used the cloth that comes with it, but other than that, I&#x27;ve been using everything as directed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, I&#x27;m off to perform a happy dance now. Preferably in front of a mirror so I can stare at my skin some more, lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re on the fence about ordering this, I say go for it. I had lost all hope that my skin would ever be beautiful, but thanks to Exposed I can see it happening in front of my eyes. I hope it becomes the Holy Grail for you that it is for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this after suffering months of adult acne on my chin. It was making me miserable and I was embarrassed to even leave my bedroom without makeup,. I wouldn&#x27;t even let my boyfriend see my face first thing in the morning! I bought this product feeling a bit sceptical due to the high price, but after a month a have to say my acne is significantly reduced and my scars are fading! It does make yor skin a bit dry so be careful about how much you use at first, but so far so good for me :)</li>
            <li> First of all, let me begin by saying that I tried tons of different products for my stubborn acne. I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve read that before just like I had. I know everyone is different, but this company is amazing and I love their products and customer service. The combination of benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid does wonders for stubborn acne. Plus, the fact that you have different products for different times of day also helped me to adhere to the instructions. Words can&#x27;t describe how happy I am with their products. It&#x27;s definitely worth the money if you want to enjoy clear skin and confidence. I&#x27;d say it took about a week or so to start to take effect and I&#x27;ve been acne-free for months! So what more can I say, this is just an honest review of my experience with this company and their expanded kit. It works great and you get what you pay for. Quality products and quality results. Just take a chance and go for it. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> bought for my son and it was worked better than anything he got from the dermatologist!!!! Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> Love it, but now it says i cant ship to Norway</li>
            <li> I have struggled with acne for years. I started out using Proactive, which worked for several years. The Proactive eventually stopped working, though, and I started going to a dermatologist. I started taking antibiotics and birth control pills and using prescription creams. Again, my skin cleared up for awhile. Six months to a year after stopping the antibiotics, my acne came back. I went through numerous prescription creams but my acne would not go away. I gave up on the dermatologist and started researching acne kits online. While I was researching Proactive again, I saw an add for Exposed Skincare. After reading numerous reviews, I decided to give it a try. I am so glad I did! Exposed cleared my skin up in 2-3 weeks.  It has worked better than any of the prescription creams I tried. It has been over 6 months and my skin still looks great. I even stopped the birth control pills 3 months ago and my skin did not have a setback. The kit lasts me over 2 months and is definitely cheaper than all the prescriptions I used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve battled skin issues as an adult for over a decade and this is by far and away the best I have found!</li>
            <li> Exposed is not the 1st product that I have tried for my skin.  After my frustration of trying all over the counter, Prescription, and mail order products, I stumbled upon Exposed.  I was hesitant just due to the fact that I had tried so many products that seemed to work at first, but then would eventually stop working.  I have been using Exposed for over a year and it is still working just as great as when I 1st started.  I love this product and would recommend to any of my friends or family.  Ordering is very easy and the smell of the products are pleasant.  5 out of 5 for sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had good experience with the Exposed Skincare line.  My skin is a lot better now.  However, it wasn&#x27;t enough for me to just use the topical treatment.  I had to change my diet and get my omega 6 and 3 ratio in line (more fish, less sugar / carbs)... which really helped.</li>
            <li> I bought the Expanded Kit for the first time and it truly is amazing.  I&#x27;ve used so many acne treatment out there but I was just never satisfied with any of them.  Exposed seriously works with all skin types!  My skin is very oily and acne prone - this product has been by far the greatest for my skin.  One thing I&#x27;m really hoping for Exposed to come out with is an SPF based moisturizer then my life will be complete :)</li>
            <li> I used Proactive for over two years. It worked great for about 18 months, but then my acne came back strong. Nothing like being in my 40&#x27;s with acne like a teenager! I searched and searched for something else to try, and came upon the website for Exposed. I figured I had nothing to lose, so I placed an order several months ago. It is definetly a better product. My only complaint is the price. It simply does a better job fighting acne than Proactive.</li>
            <li> My daughter tried so many different acne products and none were helping...Then she tried the Exposed treatment products. Within several days I noticed the difference and after faithfully using the products for about 3 months her skin is glowing and her confidence is back! The Exposed line of products are well worth the extra money. I highly recommend them to anyone having difficulty with acne and breakouts.</li>
            <li> I used to use ProActiv and my skin was clear, but it wasn&#x27;t healthy looking. I decided to get off ProActiv and my skin exploded with zits. I didn&#x27;t think my skin was going to recover! I tried the Neutrogena Skin ID and it did NOT work at all. I was frustrated. I did more research on the internet and found out about Exposed. I thought after all the stuff I had tried, why not?      With Exposed, it not only got rid of my acne but it also has actually made my skin look radiant. You know how some people, when they have a great complexion, they have this little shiny spot on their forehead. It&#x27;s not oily or anything, but it looks good. I actually have one of those now!     However, it is expensive, but I think it&#x27;s worth it. You can choose on the website how many days you want in between shipments. So if you have a tighter budget, you can stretch your supply and save some money that way. Also, you can buy a trial kit and test it out. It&#x27;s cheaper than a regular kit so you save money but also get to see if it works for you.     I don&#x27;t use the exfoliating towel. It is really soft, but I don&#x27;t think it does anything spectacular. It comes with the kit for free so no complaints there.</li>
            <li> This is easily the best product I have ever used on my skin. It not only cleared my skin up nearly 100% in about 3 weeks, but it is extremely effective at preventing breakouts!! I have insanely sensitive skin, and it worked well for me :) It is also wise to avoid touching or scratching your face throughout the day, in order to prevent the spread of bacteria. I love the all-natural ingredients in each product, and you&#x27;re skin really feels and looks healthier while using it! 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 years, and it still works like a charm. I love it!  It makes your skin beautiful, and prevents acne! I recommend this for everyone with acne.</li>
            <li> I started to use the Exposed Skin Care Expanded Kit last June.  Within a month, I already noticed improvement.  I used to have dehydrated but oily skin, so white-head is the major problem to my skin.  However, after I tried the Exposed acne products, the white-head started to disappear way before I finished my first Exposed Expanded Kit.  My skin looks more smooth.  I used to have few pimples on my face once a month.  Amazingly, this unhappy practice has gone since I have been using the Exposed acne products.  It&#x27;s been 9 months now and these Exposed products are still doing a great job to my daily facial care.  They never make my skin dry during the acne treatment.  My white-head, acne nor pimples are almost come to zero.  I would pretty much like to say my skin is at the ever best condition. Even my friends noticed this big change.    I would highly recommend their products especially to those are having adult acne problem.    One last thing I would like to compliment is their friendly, professional and prompt customer service. This compliment is especially extended to Amanda Hall!  I thank her for her prompt assistance so that my problem was solved reasonably fast.  I would say Exposed provides at least one of the best online customer services.  Keep up the good job:)</li>
            <li> I switched from Pro-active, and I will never go back to it ever again! My skin is so healthy now.</li>
            <li> I have used many products during my lifetime (Proactive, etc.), but NONE of them ever worked.  This is the first system that I have found that really works.  Even my friends have commented about how clear my skin has looked.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a year and have been pleased with its results thus far.  It has worked better than any product I have ever used before.  It beats proactive, that is for sure!</li>
            <li> Excellent service. Results in less than 2 weeks. Products are gentle on the skin yet somehow manage to do the job. I couldn&#x27;t recommend this more. The price may seem steep to some, but I promise you it is worth it. Just a little info, for me personally the facial cleanser is always the first to be used so it might be worth your while stocking up two at a time, that way you won&#x27;t run short.</li>
            <li> I have been using Exposed for over two years now and it works wonderfully for me. I love those products, better then anything else. (Proactive, etc)  When you buy a kit, it comes up much more cheaper, rather buying products individually. The best thing that I love about this company, that they provide excellent customer service.  Their stuff is very helpful and knowledgeable.</li>
            <li> PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT FOR MY 17 YEAR OLD SON, WHO HAD SEVERE ACNE. WITHIN A MONTH HIS SKIN CLEARED UP. EXPOSED SKIN CARE IS TRULY AMAZING AND I AM VERY GRATEFUL I FOUND IT. SO IS MY SON.</li>
            <li> The best thing about Exposed is how gentle yet effective it is. When I first bought a trial pack I was a bit skeptical as, the facial cleanser is so light (ie. Doesn&#x27;t have that \\&quot;burning\\&quot; alcohol feel so many acne cleansers have, which feel as though they are having some heavy duty cleansing effect). However, exposed does the trick and leaves skin hydrated/even&#x3D; perfect foundation for make-up application or simply a healthy all-natural look. I believe that Exposed also helped prevent scars from existing acne--no \\&quot;ice pick\\&quot; marks after they had healed. Highly recommended product.</li>
            <li> I used Proactiv for over a year, went with store bough brands for a few months and thankfully discovered Exposed. I&#x27;m 24 years old with very oily skin and this product has definitely done the best job at consistently controlling my acne. Of course its not perfect, but that all depends on your diet and water intake. Even with with oily skin type i think the moisture complex is a must once a day. It heals and soothes your skin and when i added that to the regimen its made a huge difference. I only give it 4 stars because i was under the impression it would not stain but it discolored my dress shirt a bit on the collar and my pillow case, but DEFINITELY not as bad as Proactiv ruined my towels and clothes.</li>
            <li> I have battled with adult acne for 15 years. I have tried all over the counter products available and Exposed Acne Treatment has been by far the best I have  ever used.  My skin is very tempermental and tends to dry out easy with most acne treatments. I have found that Exposed is very gentle to my skin but also very effective. I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I started using the Exposed system 6 months ago and it has worked wonders for my skin. I have used many onther products, including ProActiv, and they haven&#x27;t really worked at all. Exposed took a few weeks to clear up my skin, but my skin has been clear since. I have extremely sensitive skin and the products do not dry out or irritate my skin. This product is definitely different from other acne products and you definitely will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I never struggled with acne until I was 24 and onto my first job out of college.  I began to get those deep red blemishes all over my chin which hurt just to touch them.  I tried using Clearasil but that got me nowhere and just bleached my clothes.  I tried the Neutrogena acne kit which just left me with super dry and oily skin.  Finally I found Exposed Skincare.  I liked that the products have such natural ingredients and after reading dozens of reviews online I decided to get the Expanded kit.  The kit came with details on each product and the suggested regiment.      I immediately saw a difference after using the kit.  The red bumps receded and my chin started looking like the clear skin I used to have.  The Moisture Complex is a must, especially when you are starting out, so I suggest the Expanded Kit.  Since I was using a new product I did have a little dryness but the Moisture Complex took care of that and didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy.  Last year I expanded the products I use.  In addition to the Expanded kit, I also use the Microderm Scrub to further cleanse my pores and the Clarifying Mask for those spot treatments.  My two favorite products in the kit are the Facial Cleanser and Acne Treatment Serum.  I do use the Serum at night instead of in the morning since it does have a tendency to bleach clothes.  But anything with Benzoyl Peroxide generally does bleach.      It is now four years later and I am still using Exposed Skincare.  My face feels cleaner and those horrible red pumps have not returned.  I am an Exposed Skincare customer for life!</li>
            <li> Still breakouts&lt;br /&gt;Am disappointed  . Too much money spent when product doesnt work.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that truly works for me. I&#x27;ve been using it for 4 years now. I recommend to anyone I know who suffers from skin problems. Nothing worked for me before this product. It&#x27;s nice to know that if I get an outbreak that I can put a little cream on it and it will go away soon. It never turns into a raging pimple anymore.</li>
            <li> Just like the rest of the reviews for this product, I&#x27;ve tried absolutely everything to no avail. I&#x27;ve always had acne problems and nothing would ever work! Up until about last year I though I&#x27;d give Exposed Skin Care a try as I&#x27;ve read great stuff about them, you don&#x27;t need me to tell you that this stuff really works! As an adult in my 30&#x27;s you could imagine how distressing this could get, but after so many years of battling acne my skin has finally cleared up. I give Exposed Skin Care 5 very big golden stars! You&#x27;ve definitely changed my life!</li>
            <li> This is truly the only product that worked for me after so many years of struggling with Acne.  I wish I had found it in my younger years.  I struggled with Acne issues since my teenage years and finally found Exposed Skin care in my 40&#x27;s.  I tried every product sold over the counter, those sold in expensive spa&#x27;s, famous products sold on TV and in mall vending machines and I also sought help from the dermatologist.  NONE WORKED!!  Not only did I suffer with Acne, BUT I also struggle with sensitive skin.  Which many of these products would burn and peel my face.  In a desperate attempt, I googled ACNE solutions and Exposed came up as a hit.  So, I placed an order thinking well what do I have to lose.  OMG!!!  the results have been very positive.  First I noticed that as the breakouts were going thru their cycle, the healing was different.  It wasn&#x27;t the normal nasty stuff.  After months of using, the breakouts were well under control with maybe one every other month.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve shared my products with my niece when I went to visit her for a week two years ago.  My heart broke when I saw how she had such a sever case on her face.  She had never struggled with Acne, but now in her mid 20&#x27;s, had a mass case with nothing including the dermatologists working.  She tried all the typical stuff including lots of herbal/natural remedies.  I had brought with me new bottles of everything for the trip, thank God.  I gave her the products I was used to using normally (Cleanser, Towel, Tonic, Acne Serum, Clear Pore Serum and weekly mask).  I had such faith in the results and was not disappointed.  By day 3, we noticed a difference in my nieces face, almost a healing of sorts.  By day 5 we noticed more healing and clearing.  By the end of 3 months, her face looked very clear as if nothing had ever happened!!  She&#x27;s been a loyal Exposed user now going on 2 years.  We still marvel on how this was the only product to help her and continues to help her maintain a clear healthy face.  We&#x27;ve seen each other in person a few times since that trip and each time I stare at her in AW as it is so amazing to see such a clear and healthy face.  Even though I experienced personal results myself, it&#x27;s just so amazing to see how her face was sever to now so healthy and clear!!&lt;br /&gt;One more success story now includes my own 13 year old son as he is now entering his teenage years.  This last year he went from clear baby face to BOOM ugly outbreaks, ugh!!!  I started him quickly on the Exposed routine.  I could tell when he was using it faithfully and when he was NOT.  He&#x27;s learned that he can&#x27;t be lazy and skip on morning or evening treatments.  He&#x27;s good with his routine now and the results are so good.  When I look at him, I am so thankful to have found the Exposed products.  It&#x27;s such a great feeling to have such inner peace knowing he will not have to suffer with these problems like I did into adulthood.  He is also so very handsome, not because he is my son:), and I am so thankful I can enjoy his handsomeness with clear healing skin.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I have tried many other acne products that do not seem to work for me. It took a little longer to work that I would have liked, but after the forst 60 day package I seem to be on track.</li>
            <li> I have been using Exposed for less than a year now and I have seen great results from it. I would say I have moderate acne but no other product even compared to Exposed! I can now count the FEW pimples on my face and the last one&#x27;s seem to be slowly dissapearing! A lot of people complain about having to apply 3 creams of Exposed and that it takes a lot of time! But seriously what&#x27;s more important an acne free face, or 10 extra minutes of sleep before school or work! It honestly takes like 4 min. for each to dry! So those of you worried about your ten min. of sleep go back to bed, and those of you who want ance free skin try this product out!</li>
            <li> For the last 10 years I have struggled with moderate acne that mainly consisted of occasional breakouts. I have tried every product out there, from drugstore buys to high end products including Proactiv, Clinique, and products from a dermatologist. Nothing has ever cleared and maintained my skin the way Exposed has! Not only is my face pimple free, the acne marks left on my skin from past blemishes have faded considerably. While other systems have left me dry in some areas and oily in others, with Exposed my face remains shine free without over-drying.     I use the complete Exposed system including the microdermabrasion scrub and mask. I personally believe that treating acne is best when using a daily cleansing and treatment regimen and a scrub/mask twice a week. Doing this routine with Exposed has left my skin glowing, my complexion even, and me blemish free! I HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone, from those who get an occasional breakout to people with severe acne.</li>
            <li> The Exposed Skin Care system is a great skin care line that has really helped to control the oil in my skin and prevent the breakouts that I&#x27;ve been accustomed to for years.  It&#x27;s simple to use, and you start to see the results in a few days.  Great product!  I will continue to use this skin care system.</li>
            <li> I decided to try Exposed after using Proactiv for 2 years with moderate results. Proactiv was very drying to my sensitive skin and I still always had a least one blemish on my face. I searched online and read Exposed&#x27;s mostly positive reviews. I&#x27;ve been using it for just over a month and have been happy with the results so far. My face has been clear for the past two weeks and even the scars from old blemishes are starting to lighten. I only hope my positive results continue, time will tell but it&#x27;s about the same price as Proactiv and in my case more effective so I would recommend to anyone giving it a try.</li>
            <li> I started using this product about a month ago and absolutely love it!!  The acne serum is a miracle worker! I had a special occasion and of course my face decided to break out a few days prior. I used the acne serum as a spot treatment and within a couple of days my face was clear!!! I became a true believer after that and have now purchased kits for both of my daughters who are seeing positive results as well. I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but this product deserves all the praise I can give it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had acne since I was about 15 or 16, usually pretty mild, didn&#x27;t really get it on cheeks or forehead but consistently I&#x27;ve had breakouts (moderate to pretty bad) on my chin. I&#x27;ve tried Proactiv, some over the counter acne wash, nothing&#x27;s really worked for me. I&#x27;m 23 and it honestly hurts your confidence to be an adult with acne still. One of my friends bought this a few months ago, she had way more severe acne than I do, and she recommended I get it, so I gave it a shot. it&#x27;s only been two weeks and I see really great results already...It&#x27;s not all gone, but I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s 80% cleared up. A few warnings (And it says on the product), you will see it get worse at first before it gets better. I was pretty broken out on my chin and forehead for a few days, but it goes away. For me, my skin got a little dry and flaky and then it started to clear after the first week. So far so good, I hope the results remain positive. I&#x27;ll update again after 30 days and then 60 days and let you know how it goes! But definitely recommend it to people with moderate or severe acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I wanted to give you an update a month into using it. Exposed has done a great job. Old blemishes have totally gone away, I haven&#x27;t seen any new zits, and the pesky ones are starting to get smaller. I have two blemishes left on my face, when I started I had about ten. I&#x27;m confident another month using it, my skin will be nearly perfect. Again, I gotta recommend this! It&#x27;s worked wonderfully!</li>
            <li> I just received my first Exposed treatment kit in the mail today and used the evening routine (cleanser, serum and spot treatment) about 1 hour ago. I thought I would let everybody know in a few weeks if it works or not (crossing my fingers....)</li>
            <li> I started using the Exposed acne treatment about a week ago. I suffer from mild acne but it was still embarrassing for me to leave the house without makeup on.  Pharmacy products do not work too well for me, and Proactive worked but only temporarily. The first day I started using Exposed, my skin felt nice, but by day three I was covered in the worst breakout I have ever had. My acne went from mild to severe. My skin has not yet shown improvement, but I am hopeful it will eventually clear up. Since I haven&#x27;t used the product that long, I can not say that I hate it, I just want to strangle my boyfriend for letting me try it- I refuse to see him looking like this -__-.  Also it isn&#x27;t just the physical appearance of my skin, it hurts. I would try another acne treatment before Exposed and that&#x27;s all I&#x27;m saying. I also believe that there are a lot of fake reviews.</li>
            <li> After reading so so so many good, even great, reviews about this product I ordered it. BIGGEST mistake I could have made for my skin!! I didn&#x27;t get better at all, in fact I got worse! It made my skin dry and so itchy, which I could have dealt with had it made my acne better. My acne got worse (WORSE) as if I really needed that. This stuff exposed me in the worst way possible! If you still insist on trying this product then test it out on a small patch of skin for a week before putting it all over your face. I switched to the 3-step clinique face wash; it&#x27;s not a miracle regimen, but after about a month of using it my skin got under control. As long as I keep using it day and night I don&#x27;t break-out (unless of course my hormones are all out of whack). I also started taking birth control which cleared my skin up nicely (Loestrin24fe, for those of you women that want to maybe try that option). Anyways, I got sidetracked, the bottom line is that I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE!!!</li>
            <li> Before I started using this product I was having problems getting my acne under control. I was having a lot of problems with various products leaving my skin oily or excessively dry. Exposed actually helped control my acne, making it more clear than it has been for years. I have been using Exposed for over a month, and during that time I have not had problems with either the oily skin or the dry skin that I was having with other products. It is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> bought this product about 3 weeks ago. So far its done a good job at lessening the effects of the old acne. However, I am still getting new acne to pop up on my face. While I would have expected this to happen during the first week or two I did not expect this to continue to be a problem. I use this stuff twice daily like the directions say and it does do a good job at getting rid of the old acne. The new flare ups could be my fault which is why I gave this product a 4 and not a 3.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for over a month. Although it hasn&#x27;t cleaned up my skin completely, it definitely showed improvement, especially at the beginning. I believe my skin would probably be worse without the help of the product. I generally buy this set as I think they are the most essential ones, although once they sent me the wrong item. I hope the products can be a little bit more affordable and the shipping could be faster, because they are very quickly used up. I have used some other products before, and this one is the best set that I have used. Since I have not found better alternatives yet, I will be continuing using this product, unless their customer service really pisses me off.</li>
            <li> I have used benzoyl peroxide acne fighters (mostly proactiv) for years. My skin is addicted to them and breaks out every time I try to stop. I am now in my thirties and want to start giving some nutrients back to my skin instead of contunually stipping it. For me Exposed is a good middle ground. There is a little benzoyl peroxide and there is also lots of nutrients and botanicals to keep my skin soft and moisturized. Great porduct.</li>
            <li> I started using this product after using Skin ID for several years. Skin ID worked for a while, but recently it seemed to stop being able to control my outbreaks. I&#x27;ve been using Exposed for a month now. I have seen a marked improvement in my skin tone and clarity. I would definitely recommend this product for stubborn acne.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over 7 years now, with one year long pimply break. This seems to be the only product that works for me. It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin like Proactive did. My only non-positive comment is that the Clearing Tonic is a different smell and color every time I order it. Sometimes it&#x27;s clear and has a very strong sage smell, and others it&#x27;s more of a clear brown color and had barely any sage to the smell. Not sure about that inconsistancy. But I haven&#x27;t noticed my skin react to those changes. I recommend trying this!</li>
            <li> Really great! I had tried other products and they would work and then stop. Will be using it for as long as I need it!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product did not work for me. I gave it a month and my skin became inflamed and more broken out. I stopped using it and switched to clinique mild soap with gel moisturizer and now it is almost perfect. I would love to get a refund on this product because it was very expensive and I have limited finances for face care. I wish amazon provided customer satisfaction or a refund with such important issues, such as clear skin. Would not reccomend.</li>
            <li> I have tried every single acne product on the market from ProActiv to Clean &amp; Clear (the Advantage kit actually dried my skin so bad it looked sunburnt) to Murad.  NOTHING works like Exposed does. I had severe blackheads &amp; whiteheads which would turn into large zits because I had a habit of squeezing them. My skin also dries out from acne products, but I still get acne. I also had acne scarring.  I was in a pretty severe breakout stage when I got Exposed in the mail. Within 3 days, I seriously did not believe this stuff was true.  I was amazed at the results.  My makeup goes on so much better, and my skin looks completely different.  My skin did not dry out at all.  I read tons of reviews before I ordered, but I am always skeptical thinking that employees of the company write the reviews.  Trust me, I am not an employee, just an average person that USED to have acne.  Exposed is by far the best acne treatment out there!</li>
            <li> I ordered Exposed Skin Care a couple of months ago, and so far, dealing with this company has been one of the worst experiences. They have sent the wrong kits to the wrong address&#x27;s and then expect to charge the customer to re-ship. They have sent out double orders on kits, and then tell me I have to go pack it up and pay to have it shipped back. They also said they will contact you 5 days prior to any shipment being sent, whish was NEVER done.  Customer service has been extremely rude, and has even hung up on me. The product has really done nothing. I have had better luck with over the counter acne medicines. I had never heard of this company  before, and now I know why. Live and Learn. They promise you everything and you receive NOTHING!!</li>
            <li> I have had problem skin since a teenager, now I am in my 30&#x27;s and I still struggle with acne. I have tried countless products and have been to the derm on many occasions. I tried Exposed Skin Care in hopes to calm my acne, it is not 100% gone but it is a TON better. It&#x27;s not just the medication you need, you need to change your lifestyles and habits. They recommend to wash your pillowcases, often, something I do only 1 every 1-2 weeks. The old saying you are what eat, it&#x27;s probably true... eat healthy, drink more water. As for the treatment, it works but you need to be consistant. I am trying to dicipline myself and sticking with a consistant regiman, but with full time work, 2 small kids, a dog/puppy and a house... I am rushed in the morning and pooped at the end of the night. If you have you searched and tried products and nothing seems to be working, I would try Exposed. You have to find the right fit to your skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Exposed Expanded Kit after trying many other skin care products, including Proactiv. I have battled breakouts my whole life, and currently have moderate adult acne. There are several reasons why I like Exposed above and beyond anything else:  1. The products work. When used as directed, my skin cleared up within a week.  2. The products feel good &amp; smell nice. When I used Proactiv, I hated the rough cleanser, and the lotion smelled really strongly of medicine. These products don&#x27;t scream \\&quot;I&#x27;m for acne! No Pain no gain!\\&quot; They look, feel, and smell more like spa products than medicated treatments.  3. I really like that there are different products for treating acne and for shrinking pores. These are separate but equal problems for me, and Exposed addresses both.  4. The price is comparable to other acne treatment systems  Overall, I have been very happy with my purchase. My skin looks and feels good. Even though it looks like alot of steps, the whole system is really easy and quick to use. I would recommend this!</li>
            <li> I have tried many different products to deal with acne. Many people swear by proactive but that&#x27;s not the case with me. Proactive didn&#x27;t cut it and when I looked for other options, Exposed came up. I thought I would give it a shot and it has been outstanding. A highly recommended product!</li>
            <li> I am in my 3o&#x27;s and still had acne. After researching differently products I found Exposed Skin care. I noticed a difference within 2 days. After a week my skin was completely clear of pimples and blackheads. I will never use another product again[[ASIN:B002CSPKSU Exposed Acne Treatment - Basic Kit]]</li>
            <li> I got the expanded package because I really wanted the moisturizer as I am from Chicago and my skin dries out in the winter.  I have been using Exposed for a little over a month and have noticed a difference.  I have combination skin and normally break out along my t-zone.  It took about three weeks to see its effect, but my chin and forehead (which are usually always broken out) have finally cleared.  I gave it a four instead of a five because it is pricy and I am a college student, but I definitely think it is worth working into my budget.</li>
            <li> My daughter tried numerous products for skin problems-- including several trips to Dermatologist.  Nothing worked.  This skincare system did wonders and skin has improved after couple weeks.  I would recommend this in conjunction with the Clarisomic facial brush.</li>
            <li> When it comes to skin care ... I&#x27;m a really cynical and somewhat defensive person (I don&#x27;t want any \\&quot;product\\&quot; ruining my face!)  So I approached this kit with extreme caution.  Actually, I ordered the smaller, travel sized kit, that guarantees clear skin in 30 days, or money back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying a variety of cleansers, scrubs and creams, I have to say this.worked.the.best.&lt;br /&gt;After almost 2 weeks, all of my chin acne had cleared up (plus my scarring seems to have gone down! Amazing!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last time I had clear chin skin was when I was probably 13, I&#x27;m now 22.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I have is with the \\&quot;clearing tonic\\&quot;.  The formula is literally like water, and comes out too quickly (so I tend to waste a lot in the morning with quick wake-up rushes to go out).  I think the formula needs to have a bit more substance, or else it&#x27;s a potential waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise EVERYTHING works well.  I&#x27;m only going to buy the acne treatment serum, clear pore serum and clearing tonic in the future.  I will use another cleanser to save money ... but all you really need if you have bad chin acne like me is to buy these three products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so pleased with this! I&#x27;m truly stunned at the results.  My chin is so much smoother and cleaner now than before.  Will definitely continue using this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years.  In the past I have tried Proactive, perscription face products, Artistry, Neutrogena, Clean&amp;Clear, and many, many others.  The product that works best for me is Exposed!  My skin is acne-prone and also very dry, so I battle both oily and flakey skin.  This product along with additional face moisturizers work very well for me!</li>
            <li> I have been using these products for almost a year now and love it. It does keep my face clearer.</li>
            <li> After wasting tons of money and time trying to rid the pimples and oily appearance from my face, I finally found a treatment that works! Exposed Acne Treatment improved the appearance of my complexion without irritating it and drying it off  since the products have natural ingredients that leave my skin feeling fresh and clean every time. I must confess that I was very surprised by the treatment effectiveness due to disappointing past experiences with other acne treatments.  I have been using it for some months now, but I remember seeing results very fast. Even after my first day of using it, I noticed an improvement on my complexion. It looked cleaner and healthier, and I was complemented by the look of it!  As an extra bonus my skin looks brighter and younger. All the products in the Kit are amazing and effective, but I particularly love the cleanser, the acne serum, and the moisturizer. I do not have to use foundation anymore, and the recurring flare I use to have is finally under control. I loved this treatment so much that I also bought the scrub, and the mask, which are also very good, and I recommend it to anyone who asks me about the appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried every single acne product and nothing had worked for me.  I used proactiv, murad, clean and clear, neutrogena, etc. Nothing worked :(, one day doing research on the web I found this kit that sounded pretty promising since they give you not only a 30 day money back guarantee but a whole year!!! I gave it a try and have been using it ever since (this was 3 yrs ago).  I have recommended the product to my sister and a couple of friends. They are amazed by the results!!!  Thank you forever Exposed Skin Care!!!</li>
            <li> My first month of college in a new city my face exploded in acne. Having used Proactiv before I knew how the chemicals had an extremely harsh rash like effect of my skin it was time to start something new. I researched pretty much all of the over the counter acne medications and finally went out on a whim and got Exposed even though i didn&#x27;t know too much about it. BEST DECISION OF MY LIFE. I got a reaction the first usage and within a week I could feel that my skin was softer and smoother. Within a month almost every single zit was gone. I get this product every 2 months and without it I would be lost. Science and nature really do work together. It&#x27;s gentle yet effective and I can easily say I couldn&#x27;t function without it. LOVE.</li>
            <li> It was July last year when I found the cure to my endless breakouts. Before that, my skin was prone to breakouts whenever I eat nuts, chocolate, junk food or spicy food, or even when I get stressed or have my period. On average, I would have between 3 or 4 to 8 or 9 cylic acnes. It&#x27;s those big acnes that sit underneath your skin for days to develop, and can be painful if you touch them. Besides those big acnes, I also had many small pimples. Just to give you an idea, I am an adult, and I did not have serious breakout problems when I was a teenager.     I have tried so many different treatments and products. From the off the shelf products to facial sessions that cost more than $200 dollars each, and antibiotics and contraceptive pills. One of a world famous acne treatment product package also made my skin worse. My skin even continued to have breakouts and was more irrateds than before. Some gave me improvements initially, but the effect never lasted or I never got \\&quot;breakout free\\&quot; time after using it. Also, when I try those products, I didn&#x27;t just them for a few days or a few weeks. I used them for at least 3 months or more, because I know all the treatments will need time to \\&quot;heal up\\&quot; the skin. I did not have any confidence every time I look at myself in the mirror. But when I started using Exposed, I was so relieved. I used the Expanded Kit. I followed the instructions step by step, morning and night. My skin started improving within a week of using their product. It was only about 4 weeks later, my skin did not have any new breakouts. I felt my skin was \\&quot;peaceful\\&quot;, it was not angry anymore. I have been using it since then, and have recommended my girlfriends to use it. I don&#x27;t want to change to any other product again. The best of all, it is very reasonably priced and it really works. If you have any doubts, just give it a try, because they 1 year money back guarantee. You&#x27;ve got nothing to lose. Except the acnes and pimples.</li>
            <li> I have tried more acne products than I can count, ever since I was 12 - Proactiv, Murad, over-the-counter brands - and even medication including Accutane. I first tried this 2 years ago and it made my skin super sensitive for a couple weeks, but then my acne was GONE. I&#x27;ve been using it ever since, and I get small whiteheads/blackheads around my period, but other than that, totally clear. Everyone says I have beautiful skin! I LOVE Exposed.</li>
            <li> My facial skin has been quite oily, and had a lot more acne. But Exposed Skin Care system has made my face much clearer than before after about several weeks of use. Up to this point, I have been using the products for virtually 1 full year. And I am very satisfied with what it has done for me in terms of significantly reduced acne and clear skin, though the oiliness is still about the same.</li>
            <li> Believe me, it really works! I have been a loyal customer for many, many years now, and I have tried many other products. But nothing works as good as Exposed skin care. Just try it, and you will see the results within a few weeks! I started using Exposed when I was a teenager - now I am 27.</li>
            <li> Ever since OBAGI recalled its Serum Gel (part of their Clenziderm M.D. kit) for crystallizing, I have not found an effective treatment to replace it with. One overnight application of the gel virtually got rid of my acne and pimples and so you could imagine how disappointed I was when they replaced it with a lotion. I tried this out on a whim upon my mother&#x27;s insistence due to all the rave reviews (that I previously had known some of them were fraud). Unfortunately, I tried it and had no positive results. At least the Murad line had decent results that would keep the existing acne at bay. The Exposed line would neither prevent acne nor reduce existing ones. I continued to receive breakouts and my previous acne just got worse. Everyone has different results though so I wouldn&#x27;t write it off just yet. Try it and see if it works. Most acne treatment is trial and error in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I have PCOS and began breaking out at 10 years old. In my mid 30s, I still had acne. I have tried Proactiv with moderate results, Murad with some success, and every over-the-counter drugstore product on the shelves. I have taken pills, sipped on teas, completed detox programs. Nothing has helped heal my skin like Exposed. I have a hormonal imbalance that causes the acne, as well as many other symptoms, from PCOS, so I believed I would have acne my entire life. This product worked for me, but I cannot guarantee that it will work for you. I gave it 4 stars because I have only been using the products for about 2 months. If my skin stays clear after a year or more, I can comfortably give it 5 stars. I have a more detailed review here: [...]</li>
            <li> I returned it after it dried my face out terribly. I was expecting some peeling but not to the extent that it did. I stopped using it for a week and had to apply lotion every few hours to keep my whole lower face from flaking off. I wanted it to work for me but I just don&#x27;t think I have the right skin for this. The lotion it came with did nothing to help mosturize my face.</li>
            <li> I used it for more than 2 months. After week 3 my skin was so bad; i thought it was part of the &amp;#34; It may get worst before it gets better&amp;#34; thing, so i gave it 1 month and it just keep getting worst! then i gave it 2 more weeks because I still had hope, but my skin was just not improving, so i just stop using it!  It was just not for me!</li>
            <li> UPDATED REVIEW: I have been using the product for some time now and I still believe in my original review which is listed below.  My acne is none existing now and I love it.  My skin is looking great and even the redness is subsiding. I will only get one pimple due to not changing pillow cases as often as recommended. But all in all its the best product I&#x27;ve ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL REVIEW: I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now and all I can say is its fantastic! Leaves skin smooth and flawless with a glow. It&#x27;s definitely working I already have recommended it to friends and family.</li>
            <li> I tried using ProActive for years and eventually it stopped working. My face freaked out and I needed something that was effective, fast, and was safe for sensitive skin. Exposed Skin Care cleared up my acne in about 2 weeks and did not cause any irritation or redness. My face felt normal (not over dry or too oily) and I even noticed some scars starting to soften and fade (which isn&#x27;t even something that the company advertises for). I have been a loyal customer for a couple years now and will continue to be one for quite some time. They have even let me keep an extra kit they sent by accident for FREE. Great service, great price, and most importantly, great product!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for at least 6 months ago. Been battling acne since 13, I am now 23. In those 10 years I have tried proactive twice, every over the counter wash, Mary Kay, antibiotics, prescription creams, and finally accutane 3 times. The accutane worked wonderful the first time for about 2 years I had awesome skin, then it returned, the second go around lasted a year, then the last go around my face was only clear until I had finished the prescription. Thats when I started using Exposed treatment. I use the basic kit and I rarely have problems with my skin. If I&#x27;m bad about following the routine like I&#x27;m suppose to is the only time I break out other then an occasional single pimple...which I can live with. I can&#x27;t guarantee it will work for everyone but it has worked great for me and I will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had acne issues since teenaged days and I&#x27;m now in my 50s. I&#x27;ve tried many products but Exposed Skin, without a doubt, works the best. The company also gives good advice on cleaning up your diet by reducing sugar intake. I would recommend these products and company to anyone.</li>
            <li> This has definitely helped clear my skin up &amp; didn&#x27;t dry my skin out like Proactiv. I&#x27;m very happy with the products &amp; recommend them to everyone to try.</li>
            <li> This worked for about a week, it started clearing up my forehead but then I started getting breakouts again. This might work for some though.</li>
            <li> I just came upon these products and both my teams use it.  They LOVE IT!  It works great without drying out your skin.  My one teen gets small breakouts on the face &amp; the other gets the large cysts like ones on his back.</li>
            <li> I used this product religiously and never saw any improvement. I even bought their probiotic pills that says helps with ance. No improvement.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year now and I order it every month. I had moderate acne most of my life. Now for the first time I am getting so many compliments about how great my skin looks and that my skin is glowing. I have probably tried every product on the market. This is by far the best. I have had no irritation from this and i have very sensitive skin! This is definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> Before I purchased this product, I read several reviews on Amazon and saw claims of &#x27;false reviews&#x27;. It made me nervous, but I was so desperate to do something about my worsening acne I purchased the expanded kit anyway.  It took two days for me to see amazing results.  Seriously, two days.  It not only eliminated the huge and painful pimples, but actually changed the texture of my skin.  I don&#x27;t have nearly as many blackheads or red, dry areas.  My skin feels balanced FOR ONCE! I&#x27;m convinced it&#x27;s too good to be true and keep waiting for a break-out, but I have yet to see one.  I&#x27;ve been using exposed for over a month and my skin only continues to improve.  Try it and you will see!</li>
            <li> My daughter has been using this product for about a month and a half now.   I have seen an improvement in her complextion. I think the progress has been slow since she was still eating lots of her Halloween candy.   At least it is getting her into a regimine for good skin care.  So we will give it a few more weeks to decide how well it is working.</li>
            <li> Face Acne Treatment  As per your request , this is to notify that the treatment I&#x27;m doing is giving me gradual favorable result. Thanks for your follow up.  ,</li>
            <li> I never ever in a million years thought I would be able to walk out of my house without makeup and feel confident about my skin. I used to literally have nightmares about going out of the house without makeup and having people see my bad skin underneath. Through using exposed, I saw amazingly fast results in a matter of days and I actually felt confident and beautiful! Exposed gave me confidence and allowed me to be happy with my skin. This truly is the best solution to acne</li>
            <li> Has worked far better for me than any other product. It isn&#x27;t too harsh and everything smells great. I&#x27;ve been using it for half a year now and my skin is great. For it to work properly you must follow the tips it gives you in regards to your diet. Lower your sugar and dairy intake, oily foods and chocolate are prime suspects for me. Combined with a clean diet you could get clear skin within a month.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff...I went a weekend without using it and i saw a big difference that i did not like.  I have to use this acne tmt everyday or my skin looks like crap.</li>
            <li> Honestly, this is the first product that worked for my moderate acne! I&#x27;ve been fighting acne for 7 years and I tried everything! I was a little nervous to try this product because the reviews seemed too good to be true, but this product seriously works! After two months, my skin completely cleared up! I have no more acne! I can finally feel confident without wearing makeup and people noticed how great my skin is looking. The product is a bit more expensive then I would like, but it&#x27;s honestly worth it. It works so well without drying out my skin. You just have to keep up with it for a month or two and then you will see fabulous results!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my daughter from Amazon.  Although she followed the instructions exactly, her acne actually got worse.  I tried to return the product using the money back guarantee through Exposed. I was informed by Exposed that because I purchased the kit through Amazon, they would not honor the money back guarantee.  Although it has been less than two months since I purchased the product the return option from Amazon has expired.  I am stuck with a very bad feeling that I was sold a phony guarantee.  Amazon uses images throughout the product pages that clearly indicate the product is backed by a one year guarantee.  I am very disappointed both in the product and the company that makes it.  After a phone call with Amazon customer service, they agreed to refund the money however buyers should be aware Exposed does not guarantee the product when purchased through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Exposed is a wonderful face treatmen.I have been using it for a couple of years and it works great if you ise it actually how the directions tell you to. at one point I used.it wrong and was breaking out and had no idea I was but then as soon as istarted back doing it the right way my skin was beautiful.the kit with all the products are better skin heals way quicker and you will see your skin glow in no time.</li>
            <li> About 3 years ago I got off birth control for health reasons, however, at the tender age of 27, i went through the worst puberty ever because of this.  I kept hoping that my body would neutralize the hormones after a year, but it never did, and my face just kept getting worse and worse.  I remember there being a moment where i touched my face and couldn&#x27;t find one area that felt smooth! It was devastating and embarrassing and I literally tried everything! Proactiv would work for like a month, and then it would dry my face out so badly that i&#x27;d have to get off of it.  Then I tried every over the counter option, with no success.  I also tried Retin-A - but that just ended up burning my skin and causing big red patches all over it making me even more of a monster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, one day i was at my wits end (might have been the day after i was in bed crying to my husband about how i&#x27;m so ugly! major low point). So I went online and googled different things and randomly found this.  So i figured whats the harm in trying something else!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first two weeks I did have a little bit of a breakout - but it was a quick one, and their website said it would happen. Then everything cleared up! and at about the 5th week, i was visiting family and at one point in the evening, i went to wash my face, and i came out of the bathroom and my mom asked why i hadn&#x27;t washed my face yet, and I said i had, what is she talking about? and she said &amp;#34;oh! it looks like you&#x27;re still wearing make up! your face is so smooth and glowing!&amp;#34; and that was like the best thing I&#x27;ve ever heard. And since then, I&#x27;ve been hooked and I gladly recommend this to all of my friends.</li>
            <li> I have fairly mild acne along with some acne scarring, so decided to give this product a shot. Used it for about two and a half months. Initially my acne began clearing up, but after about two weeks my acne became worse, pimples were appearing on my face in areas where I&#x27;ve never previously broken out. I continued using the product for a time, even bought another kit when I was running low, hoping that I was still in the \\&quot;break in\\&quot; period. The product advertises itself as producing clear skin in 30 days, so after giving it well over two months I can say this product didn&#x27;t work for me, and even made things worse to an extent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also of note are the amount of fake reviews for this product. Though I&#x27;m sure there are exceptions among the reviews containing people that have legitimately purchased the product and have had it work for them, a large majority of the reviews I&#x27;ve seen are questionable, and sometimes blatantly fake. The reviews here, if you click the \\&quot;See all my reviews\\&quot; link, you&#x27;ll notice for many users this is the only product they&#x27;ve ever reviewed. Googling for reviews even brings up many questionable \\&quot;review\\&quot; sites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...] offers a review only for exposed. [...] offers an extremely long and detailed look at exposed, places ads all over its site for exposed, and then offers only short blurbs for other acne care products. [...] is a review for exposed, has a link that leads back to [...] along with many user comments that are garbled and don&#x27;t make any sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those are just a few examples, and there still others if you look closely. Pretty shady if you ask me.</li>
            <li> Great product!  I have sensitive skin and this works for me.  It doesn&#x27;t dry me out.  I have tried a lot of products on the market and this one is the best.</li>
            <li> I have used Exposed for a few years now and it really works to keep my skin clear. I also love that it does not bleach my clothes like a brand I previously used. I have always ordered on line or by phone and feel the service has been excellent.  They have been very flexible when I needed to swap out a different item in my kits or change the shipping dates.  I had hoped as a mom of 2 teen boys, I would no longer have to fight acne, but Exposed makes it manageable.  I recently started getting it for my 14 yo son and it has improved his skin as well.  Overall, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I just started using this product and I&#x27;m already noticing improvement in my skin. I have a strange skin type. Proactive dried my skin out so bad it made it crack and it didn&#x27;t do anything for my acne. 24 hours into using this product my skin feels softer, the cystic pimples I have are already shrinking, and the redness from the smaller ones is already fading.It also seems like the blackheads (with the Microscrub) are slowly reducing in numbers. I think I found my skin&#x27;s miracle. Thank you makers of Exposed. You gave me hope to having the skin I want.</li>
            <li> What BS - I ordered it once and paid $56.00 for a kit. Not bad I thought. - two months later what hap pens? another kit in the mail and another $56 out of bank account. This should be ilegal!</li>
            <li> I have had horrendous acne since I was 11 and this worked wonderfully. It didn&#x27;t dry out my skin and I&#x27;ve had a few compliments on my skin&#x27;s radiance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It won&#x27;t work right away, so don&#x27;t give up when your acne hasn&#x27;t disappeared within a week. Mine gradually improved over about 2 months.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for three weeks now and have seen no results yet. My face not only is still exactly the same but it feels so much more oily and sticky than before!! I feel like I need to walk out of class or my office at work to go to the bathroom and wash my face because of how oily it feels. I have changed my diet around and am drinking more water daily and still nothing. I&#x27;m going to give it another 2 - 3 weeks and then ask for my refund!! Proactiv definitely didn&#x27;t make my face feel this oily. I will update in three weeks if anyone&#x27;s interested in the results.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything under the sun moon and stars.  A nurse from my dermo&#x27;s office told me to try this system before taking all the hormone crap the doctor wanted to give me.  She said it worked wonders on her daughter.  I have battled cystic acne for so many years. I hated having my picture taken or even walking out of the house with out make up on.  Now after 4 months my face is 100% better.  I rarely have breakouts and when I do have them, i only get one or two very small blimishes.  My pores look tighter and the scars are reduced quite considerably reduced.  My skin looks and feels so soft and healthy.  I especially love the microderm rub and the charcoal face mask!!!!</li>
            <li> I began to use this product in January. I began to see results while being consistent in using it.&lt;br /&gt;I get breakouts when I don&#x27;t have it. Over all its a good product.</li>
            <li> This product works, my teen daughter had tried other products with little results, this one has cleared up her skin wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I struggle with breakouts often, horrible ones. And this is going on my 3rd week and it is already helping so much!</li>
            <li> Exposed is a high quality product sold by a high quality company. The high quality ingredients not only treated my acne but improved the look and feel of my skin. I tried Proactiv and Dermologica products but with little success. I followed the instructions and used them consistently for a month and saw great improvement. I have always been a fan of tea tree oil and was happy to find a product that incorporated its great healing ability in its products. The price was reasonable and I will continue to use this product line for life!</li>
            <li> I tried this product for the 60 days that it took to use up one kit. I have not noticed a change in my skin whatsoever, except that it seems to be greasy in the morning where it wasn&#x27;t before I began using this.    I have no issue with a product like this not working since everyone&#x27;s skin is so different. However, I do have an issue with exposed&#x27;s customer service. I purchased the kit directly from exposed, and I noticed a charge on my bank account for a second kit 3 months after paying for the first. Apparently when I ordered the first kit, I agreed to continue ordering one every 60 days. I contacted customer service to cancel the order and have my money refunded, which they agreed to do, but they were extremely rude about it. They told me I had agreed to this when I made my original purchase and that this is why they send an e-mail 5 days prior to charging your account. I looked back through all of my e-mails, including junk e-mail and trash, and found no such e-mail. I pointed this out to them, and they still insisted the problem was on my end.    If you decide to try this product, buy through Amazon. You do not want to deal with the customer service at exposed.</li>
            <li> The only treatment that really worked so far, at least for me</li>
            <li> My wife ordered the starter kit in Jan of 2013.  She tried it for several months and found it did not work for her skin type.  We returned the product in June 2013.  As of August 15 we had not received a refund.  I called there customer service and left a message.  Within less than 30 min&#x27;s a customer service rep called me back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I explained the situation and she stated they will process my wife&#x27;s refund (will take 2 - 3 business to complete).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rep was very nice and explained that they often receive returns with no RMA Form.  You MUST follow the correct procedure, print off the RMA form, fill it out and return it with the product otherwise they have no way of knowing who it came from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with the customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dave&lt;br /&gt;Ottawa, Canada</li>
            <li> like the quality of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying the moisture complex and I have been seeing tremendous skin tone color. Works great. I recommend it</li>
            <li> I have not had a breakout in months since using Exposed Acne treatment. After using proactiv and Murad for years and dealing with constant pimples it feels good to finally use a product that works. I love Exposed Acne treatment.</li>
            <li> First of all, I do not write reviews! I know it sounds cliche and it may seem like it&#x27;s meant to be some sort of bait and hook. But, the truth is I just don&#x27;t make the time to post a review every time I have a wonderful experience with a product or service. But, this time I had to MAKE the time! I have been an avid proactiv user for over 8 years.  And although I have never had full on acne I have definitely suffered from those nagging episodic breakouts that seemed to come from nowhere.  So I decided to try something new since Proactiv was just not getting the job done anymore. As a matter of fact, I was concerned that it was actually contributing to the problem.  I started researching Acne products online and came across Exposed Skin Care. I paid attention to the reviews, and did some research on the company. I contacted the company directly expecting to get a call center representative whose brain I could pick about what made the product so great.  Instead what I got was the a customer service representative who worked inside of the company itself. She told me that they did not have call center and that all of their business is from word of mouth. That was pretty impressive, no TV marketing, no &amp;#34;celebrity endorsements&amp;#34; just a loyal customer spreading the word.  I then preceded to ask her a number of questions about the product and she sat patiently and answered each and every one with in depth knowledge of her company and their products! I was impressed. So, I decided to go ahead and place my order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the products in the mail and loved the Derma cloth! I began using them on Saturday April 19th, 2014 and I am absolutely FLOORED at the results!!  I had 2 existing blackheads when I started applying the product and within 3 days they were completely invisible.  The toner is great and the moisturizer works effortlessly without leaving my face oily.  This stuff is truly a Godsend! If you are on the fence at all, just TRY IT! You will be so glad you did!! I know I am!</li>
            <li> I am lucky in that I am not a person who has a face that is completely covered with acne, however I do get frequent break outs, including those deep, painful ones that other reviewers have mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;I suffer with extremely oily skin, which makes identifying skin products very difficult. Subsequently I have tried numerous products that are available on the market, however they haven&#x27;t worked, or I have had to stop using them due to incompatibility with my skin type.  (oily)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I Identified this product I was very impressed by the money back, and after trawling through numerous reviews I decided to give it a go... What&#x27;s the worst that could happen ?!?!?&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased to report that the gamble paid off...  Exposed has been a perfect partner in my battle with Breakouts, even after a few months of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone !! (Especially with an oily skin type!)</li>
            <li> I have tried everything for acne, and i have been struggling with it since high school. I am now 29 years old and wish i could have found this product sooner. I have tried proactive, every over the counter products, natural remedies, and prescriptions. I had given up. When i bought exposed i told myself this is the last product i am trying. I was so surprised, this stuff really does work. I will never buy another acne product, except this one. I promise it will work, and you will love it. Also the body wash is amazing and it works.</li>
            <li> tried so many different acne treatments, majority of the dried my skin and it was peeling off. Combination of these products keep my skin clear, no peeling. Using it for over a year now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Proactiv religiously for YEARS. Then I went to Proactiv+ with much excitement, but it didn&#x27;t make much of a difference.  I always figured this was the best my skin was going to get, oh well.  Proactiv dries out my skin like crazy and irritates it so dark marks never seem to go away.  Who cares if Proactiv made my skin baby butt soft--it didn&#x27;t stop my adult acne!  I finally got curious and did a google search for better options a month ago.  I stumbled upon Exposed Skin Care and ordered the Expanded Kit with the moisturizer.  FINALLY - no more dryness and irritation while clearing up my skin!!  This stuff just plain works.  I wish I&#x27;d known about it 4 years ago!  And no more Proactiv randomly charging my credit card.  With Exposed, I buy when I need supplies and that&#x27;s it.  Sure I still get occasionally acne, but it&#x27;s a lot more manageable.  My skin just seems a lot happier.  And dark marks that I&#x27;ve had forever are finally fading.  I cancelled my Proactiv+ membership today and am never going back!!</li>
            <li> Works great! As soon as I started using it I noticed my face smoother and clearer! I totally recommend it.</li>
            <li> This kit has cleared up my teen&#x27;s acne better than any other product we have tried. She has been using Exposed Skin Care for 6 months and her skin looks amazing. Not only has it reduced the amount of acne she has but her skin also glows. We are extremely happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I mainly had acne because I work in a kitchen so every time I used this kit it&#x27;s usually after I work and the next day my face would already look better and now even if I have to work in the kitchen a lot I don&#x27;t get any more acne so highly recommend this to everyone who has acne even if it&#x27;s only because of what you do or where you work</li>
            <li> I was really optimistic about Exposed because of the many positive reviews and articles that I read about it. I have had terrible acne since 4th grade and now at 23 I am still experiencing it terrible. I&#x27;ve been desperate for some relief because not only does it look awful, but it leaves so many scars and most importantly it really hurts. I have been using Exposed for 2 months now never missing a morning or night, and I am disappointed; I wish I didn&#x27;t have to write that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I did like about it? I do love the moisturizer. It is the FIRST one that I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue on my skin and absorbs really well without feeling sticky or greasy. It makes my skin feel amazing. The cleanser makes my face feel clean, which is what it is supposed to do. I think I may be sticking with this moisturizer. I do have to say that other than the acne that remains and continues to come back, my face feels amazing. It&#x27;s very soft and feels well taken care of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately the product is *really* sticky on my skin and if I don&#x27;t use the moisturizer after it drys my face feels terrible. It doesn&#x27;t smell the best, but that was something that I can get passed and just got used to. I was hoping that after I got my initial acne cleared up that it would prevent new acne from coming back, but that didn&#x27;t happen. I&#x27;m still getting really bad breakouts on my chin that will not go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just don&#x27;t feel like Exposed worked any better than any other skincare product I&#x27;ve tried, and I feel like throughout these years I have tried them all. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s a bad product, because every one has a different skin type, but it certainly has not worked for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many products in the past and either got no results or my skin would be dry, dull and not look healthy. I&#x27;ll admit I didn&#x27;t have faith in this product but I liked that it had natural ingredients as well as the usual salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide. So I tried it and I finally found a skin care line that made my skin better, not only helped keep it clear but also MUCH less oily and it felt soft. Id definitely recommend this line to anyone who wants to clear up their acne as well as make their skin actually look nice!</li>
            <li> I rated this product 4 stars because I have been struggling with acne for a while and I have never found a product that calms my acne and reduces it. I have tried so many over the counter products and nothing seemed to work. Exposed has really helped me a lot. My favorite is the probiotic complex, because it is just a pill and it works inside and out! I am not completely acne free at the moment, but I have seen a lot of improvements. No more flaky dry skin, discolouration and huge zits all over. PATIENCE is all that matters &amp; i am not giving up. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The exposed skin care products are amazing! I&#x27;ve tried everything you can think of to try to clear my skin up and nothing worked until I found this. It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin... it just leaves is clear and clean feeling!</li>
            <li> I have tried just about every product out there.... Cheap product, extremely expensive product, product with celebrities, etc.... nothing worked! I have an extremely sensitive and oily skin... Exposed SkinCare is the only product that works!</li>
            <li> I bought the Exposed kit for my teenage son and daughter. They have been using it for over 6 months and it controls their acne and keeps their skin healthy and glowing. The Exposed website is easy to use and I can easily change my products and shipment frequency. The price is reasonable and less than other similar products, like Proactiv.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.  I have suffered with problem skin since I was a teenager, and have tried nearly every product on the market.  I love EXPOSED because my skin FEELS good.  It&#x27;s still oily but my pores are smaller, my face is softer and smoother and when I do get a breakout, I don&#x27;t feel the need to pick at it as much because this product clears it up quickly.  I also like the smell of exposed, it&#x27;s light and fresh and there is no lingering odor like some other products I have tried.  I also think that exposed has reduced my scarring which I wasn&#x27;t expecting.  All the red marks I had have faded and my skin LOOKS and FEELS great!</li>
            <li> I have used exposed skin care for four years now. This year I was getting frustrated that my skin was getting new large zits that were really uncomfortable and embarrassing. On top of that the price, while it is in truth competitive with other top sellers, it is completely out of my budget especially now being recently laid off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to switch to another top brand, Murad, that was offering a special deal at the time. I tried it for two months and was so disappointed. My skin had a severe chemical reaction to the product and I was now even more embarrassed to be out in public.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then switched back to Exposed and I am glad I did. Within a week my skin cleared up and was no longer painful. I still get breakouts because of hormonal changes in my life (I realize this now) but it is nowhere near as awful as it was a month ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend this product and I will probably keep using it for my kids when then start needing to do a regular skin regimen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this product! Before I found this amazing kit I was using hand soap for face wash. I had tried absolutely everything. It&#x27;s all natural and gentle on your skin and has all the best ingredients in it! This cleared up my whole face and I&#x27;m so much more confident now in my life! Work is a breeze and I don&#x27;t ever think about how ugly my skin is any more. It&#x27;s honestly great! I&#x27;ll be buying exposed products for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Plain and simple this stuff works. Been using it for 3 months now and now have gone from 5 or 6 pimples at a time to maybe one every week or so. Would highly recommend to anyone with acne problems.</li>
            <li> If your looking for the best acne treatment on the market it is exposed acne treatment by a land slide! I have tried everything from 20 to 500 dollars and exposed skin care is the best and most consistent acne treatment out there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not normally someone to write a review but this product genuinely had a great effect on my life so I thought it was worth telling people about. Since I was about thirteen I&#x27;ve struggled with acne and it seemed to be slowly progressing and getting worse and worse. I tried many things. About half would clear up my skin most the way or reduce the amount of acne I had but then they would stop working after a short while. I&#x27;ve only been using exposed now for a month but after the first two and a half weeks my skin started to clear up and it is now completely zit free for the first time in I don&#x27;t even know how long. My complexion even seems to be evening out. I have oily skin but some products still managed to give me red and dry spots where I applied them. With exposed I have had no issues with dryness or redness whaysoever. Overall so far I&#x27;d say if you give it the two to three weeks at first and use it as directed it will be an awesome product for you as well. Five stars in my book.</li>
            <li> My son started getting acne at 16. He lived with it thinking it would get better. By 20 he had become frustrated and self conscious. He had done everything the dermatologist had reccomended short of Acutane. Nothing helped. His entire face was constantly covered in new breakouts and was  red and painful. I ran across an ad for &amp;#34;exposed&amp;#34; and decided to give it a try. I purchased  him the expanded acne care kit. We weren&#x27;t too optimistic, but within a few weeks we were seeing the results we had been searching for. Now, 5 months later his acne is completely gone! His skin looks amazing. He rarely even gets one pimple anymore. This product has given him such a new outlook. Thank you exposed for developing such a wonderful product.&lt;br /&gt;It has worked for us!&lt;br /&gt;Pam Lafayette, NJ</li>
            <li> Ok so I&#x27;ve been using it for over a month now by about two weeks. Clear skin? No. Rashes covering my forehead? Yep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BE VERY CAREFUL -- I overused the acne treatment serum and my forehead and now it&#x27;s covered with itchy distracting rashes that are impossible to cover or forget about. They are very depressing and IMPOSSIBLE to cover with makeup. They also won&#x27;t go away despite discontinuing use and drowning them in makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So please note: acne treatment serum works great as a spot treatment but do NOT get it on the surrounding skin, especially if your skin is sensitive. I may have to send the product back, or at least diminish use. African black soap + coconut oil has worked much more nicely for fixing up my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: Over a week ago I sent them an online request through their form to return the kit and get my money back. They have failed to reply and when I called them, it repeatedly said that the operator was not in order and directed me to a voice message. THIS SEEMS TO BE A SCAM, BEWARE OF BUYING FROM THIS SELLER</li>
            <li> I have used every product out there, including Proactiv and Neutrogena Skin ID, and nothing has worked as well as this one! I really think it is the combination of the salicylic acid and the benzoyl peroxide. It&#x27;s worked wonders on my skin! My favorite items in this line are the Derm-X Cloth which I feel gets every bit of makeup off my face at night, and the Moisture Complex that leaves my skin feeling like satin!! Acne products tend to dry my skin out a lot, and leave flaky spots that are hard to then cover with makeup, but this moisturizer works wonders, and it&#x27;s not greasy!! Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost 30 and have been dealing with acne since middle school.  I&#x27;ve tried practically everything there is and hadn&#x27;t found anything that would work for longer than a couple of months.  I had the acne that came in all different forms.  I had the deep cystic ones that were extremely painful, the little bumps that were hard, the black and whiteheads, and the regular acne that could be popped...yuck!  I came across Exposed Acne Treatment while scouring the internet for different ideas/treatments.  I had never heard of it so I did my research.  What pleased me was that it was a mix of natural extracts and acne medicines as well as the one year money back guarantee.  I figured why not and ordered myself a kit (off of the actual website, not Amazon).  After about a week, I started to see a difference.  My redness was beginning to lighten, the large cystic ones were decreasing, and the pimples were becoming fewer and farther between.  I have been using Exposed for about 6 months and I haven&#x27;t had any desire to change my system.  I have had a very stressful and anxiety-filled 6 months of work and normally that would mean plenty of breakouts for me but not this time around!  I strongly recommend Exposed Acne Treatment to anyone who is looking to try something new!  I mean, why not, right??</li>
            <li> Been using this for 2 wks. After a few days existing pimples were shrinking. Never had acne problems as teenager, but after having children, it has gotten bad.  I&#x27;ve always scarred from acne, but every month, 2 wks before my menses, I would break out and it would last for couple wks then leave scars, so basically I&#x27;d have pimples almost all the time. My skin is combination, but more on the dry side, &amp; sensitive.  My pores are smaller, existing whiteheads/blackheads have also been clearing up. OTC products, left my skin pink &amp; dry. I have neither with this product. Love the moisturizer. I havent used the exfoliator yet. Loving this so far.  Gave 4 stars since I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough. I&#x27;ll try to post an update!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product about two weeks ago and have been impressed since the first application.  I am 47 and have always had really nice skin but about 1.5 yrs ago I started having breakouts on my nose.  I went to a well known dermatologist in the Portland area and she did a couple of cultures thinking that I had a staph infection but each time the tests were negative.  She concluded that I have rosacea and prescribed azelaic acid, which has done virtually nothing to improve the situation.  I decided that I would try something for acne and was going to purchase another well-known product that my son had used several years ago, that is when I came across the Exposed product line.  I use the products as directed and continue to use the azelaic acid as well, I am very happy with the results.  Prior to using Exposed, I would wake up in the morning dreading looking in the mirror because my skin was always at its worst in the AM.  Now I look forward to seeing the improvements each morning.  The skin on my nose is so much better so I am no longer worried about what my clients or colleagues are thinking about my skin.  This is the first time I have ever written a review about any product that I have purchased online...I feel very fortunate to have found a product that works.  Although the product is relatively expensive, it is worth it to me to have healthy skin.</li>
            <li> Only thing that&#x27;s ever worked</li>
            <li> I do not have regular acne, I get breakouts once every 1-2 months. I have tried every drugstore type of treatment you can get as well as Clinique and prescription creams, etc. This is the best thing I have tried! I was a little hesitant because of the cost and thought this would only last me 30 days but I use a tiny bit 1-2 times a day and am still on my first order! I will be ordering this again soon and have recommended this to others.</li>
            <li> Did not help my son very much</li>
            <li> I am 22 years old and I have had acne since I was 15. I have tried absolutely everything from OTC products to precription topicals to oral medication and nothing ever helped. I heard of EXPOSED on the internet and figured I&#x27;d try another product that probably wouldn&#x27;t work; a month later I was sure happy I tried it. my skin is pretty much blemish free and so much more soft and less oily. The face wash makes my skin feel so clean and the toner really helps to shrink my pores and take away the redness. I love every part of this acne system and I never have to worry about what product I should try next. I am getting married next month and I am so thankful i tried EXPOSED ACNE TREATMENT and I&#x27;ll be able to have a clear complextion for my wedding day.</li>
            <li> This product is just about like every other acne care product out there. As someone with very mild acne still clinging on after my teenage years, I&#x27;m looking to eliminate it. Have had better success with basic soap and a touch on spot healer. Would not suggest, especially not for the price.</li>
            <li> I love this product because there aren&#x27;t any harsh chemicals yet it totally cleared up the very deep and painful pimples I was getting. I came across this product after doing some research pertaining to hormonal acne. I had recently gotten off the birth control pill and I learned that not only was facial cleansing a vital part but diet as well. One of the Exposed packages comes with a Probiotic which is great for digestion, which could be a major cause of breakouts. I&#x27;ve been using Exposed for a little over 3 months and I hardly ever break out anymore, not even around that time of the month. Thank goodness! I&#x27;m still working towards clearing all the blackheads in my nose though...it seems like they&#x27;re getting better after using the mask and scrub but they are still there which is the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical about getting this but decided to grab this after using proactive for quite a while and that wasn&#x27;t working out.  After using this product for a good few weeks.  I&#x27;ve to say.  I would recommend this to anyone that has been having trouble with any other product.  It seriously work and of course like any other product just wait it for a good two weeks.  And results will show.</li>
            <li> As a guy who has struggled with acne and oily skin throughout my teens and 20s, I&#x27;ve tried tons of products out there with minimal success.  Exposed was the first thing that consistently kept my skin clear.  I&#x27;ve been using it since early 2014.  It could be that I&#x27;m more religious about keeping to the routine of washing my face every morning and night, or it could be the products themselves.  Either way, they&#x27;ve earned this 5 star rating!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every morning, I wash with the Facial Cleanser, use the Clearing Tonic, and then apply the Clear Pore Serum.  Every night after my shower I wash with the Facial Cleanser, use the Clearing Tonic, apply the Acne Treatment Serum, and finish with the Moisture Complex.  Once per week, I wash with the Derm-X cloth.  This schedule holds me accountable to the routine, and it takes hardly any time at all.  If I feel a pimple coming on, I apply the Acne Treatment Serum to it and it rarely ever surfaces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels great, not overly dry or super oily like before.  Although, I seem to run through the Clearing Tonic faster than the average person.  Other than that, no complaints.  I chuckle every time I put on the Clear Pore Serum because it reminds me of the smell of salad dressing, but the odor is gone once it dries.  Plus, it&#x27;s proven to work... who knew!? Also, don&#x27;t, I repeat DO NOT, over scrub with that Derm-X cloth.  I spaced out one time and totally took off a layer of skin.  My face did NOT feel good for a few days.  When I&#x27;m not laughing at the smell and I&#x27;m not accidentally scrubbing off my skin, this product rocks!  Haha.  (The over scrubbing only happened once, I promise.  I&#x27;ve learned my lesson to pay attention.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To top it all off, as a member Exposed makes it incredibly easy to adjust the frequency of your recurring order online.  They send an order notification about a week prior to being billed, then also email confirmations once the order processes and ships.  Simple.  Done and done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other products tried with no luck: Clearasil, Stridex, Oxy, ProActiv, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Product tried with minor success: Neutrogena Oil-fee Acne Wash</li>
            <li> After trying a variety of acne skin care products and &amp;#34;kits&amp;#34; that didn&#x27;t work, I was really worried about trying Exposed and wasting money.  Boy am I glad I did give it a try!  It is by far the best of anything I have ever used and it leaves my skin looked fresh (not dried out and red) and acne-free.  It only takes a couple of minutes as a part of your routine in the morning and at night and is WELL worth it!  I have been using Exposed for almost 2 years now and it&#x27;s so rare that I ever have even a mini-breakout that I&#x27;ve almost forgotten what it&#x27;s like.</li>
            <li> I have struggled off and on with skin issues including rosacea and regular acne. I would say my skin has never been absolutely terrible even in middle/high school, but it has been kind of bad at times and always been something to have to think about and screw with. What&#x27;s worse I never knew what to expect from one day to another. For the last couple years (mid 30&#x27;s) other than the few occasional pimples I was in pretty good shape and didn&#x27;t have to mess with it much. However, 6 months ago I suddenly started getting a bunch of pimples on my forehead and cheeks. I tried changing up a few things (had been using a very gentle cleanser and switched to some salicylic acid cleansers). Due to the rosacea anything I did for the pimples seemed to just make everything red with a slight reduction in pimples. Either way it didn&#x27;t look much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was initially going to order proactive but after looking at reviews for both products I decided on Exposed. I nearly didn&#x27;t buy Exposed because some reviewers indicated they thought the reviews were staged. I think there may have been a few of those, but there are also buyers like myself who have never reviewed a product before. The reason I&#x27;m doing it now is I am thankful for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it about a week, within the first 24 hours I could see a very noticeable improvement. What&#x27;s more the product is very soothing to the skin and an added bonus for those with rosacea -- I was using a product called Finacea that is basically an azailic acid compound (prescription) that costs $150 every couple months plus the aggravation of having to go to the doctor/derm for refills. This product should be over the counter but that&#x27;s beside the point.  In any event the Exposed clearing tonic contains azailic acid and seems to work great in place of the prescription Finacea. The kit comes with a moisturizer that I fully expected to use but my skin has been so healthy with the rest of the system I haven&#x27;t needed it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in summary:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- product looks healthy in the bottles (not some toxic acne med you don&#x27;t want sitting around in your bathroom)&lt;br /&gt;- product works really great ****&lt;br /&gt;- product smells good/natural&lt;br /&gt;- product is very gentle and doesn&#x27;t leave you all red and flaky in an attempt to stop pimples&lt;br /&gt;- you actually want to use it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously can&#x27;t guarantee it would work for you, but I wish I had found it a long time ago.. really a great system.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more than happy to give feedback about this product as it appears to be the only brand I have tried where I received results. I came across the product when looking for an alternative to proactive, as my skin wasn&#x27;t that bad and I found that proactive dried my skin out too quickly. I like that this product had better and more natural ingredients&lt;br /&gt;Like I said my skin wasn&#x27;t that bad or so I was told but I didn&#x27;t feel like it was good enough, the product has broken the regular cycle of one spot coming up as another one goes and I feel my skin has better even tone to it&lt;br /&gt;My only dislike is that if I&#x27;m not organised and forget to order the product on time I do need to wait for it to come from America to oz, but the wait time isn&#x27;t too bad, but it would be great to have the option of purchasing the product here in oz&lt;br /&gt;Will happily continue to purchase the product - give it a try you&#x27;ve got nothing to lose!!!</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes but I&#x27;m going back to my original idea. This product burned my skin. I&#x27;m going to try Pro active instead.</li>
            <li> I have dealt with acne since my teens. I have combo skin- dry cheeks and very oily T-zone. At different points I have used products from Mary Kay, Proactiv, Cetaphil, Avon, Neutrogena, Juice Beauty, Clinique...more than I can remember!  For years I have been able to keep it under control (I get occasional blemishes and white/blackheads) using a combination of Neutrogena and Clinique products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now in my 30’s and about 4 months ago started to develop cystic acne on my chin and temples.  The only thing I had done differently in my routine was try a new primer from Smashbox but even after I stopped using it (and got a refund!), my skin would not calm down!  None of my regular go-to routines were working to clear up my skin and I even grew more obsessive about cleaning my makeup brushes, not touching my face, and changing my pillow case every few days. I even looked into face mapping and started taking daily probiotics. No Bueno- acne was growing larger and redder. I made an appointment to see my doctor but couldn’t get in for a few weeks so in frustration I searched acneskin care products online and came across Exposed.  It had great reviews with a money back guaranty plus I could order on Amazon Prime.  The system is straight forward containing the ingredients you need to fight acne- benzoyl peroxide &amp; salicylic acid.  I didn’t have any side effects like stinging or peeling (I think my face is used to all the ingredients already) and my skin started to calm down (less redness) within a few days.  Within a few weeks I didn’t have any new breakouts and the cystic acne was finally shrinking. I use this twice a day along with my now doctor prescribed topical antibiotic and Retin-A.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used Exposed for 6 weeks now (4 weeks alone and 2 weeks with my doctor prescribed add-ons) and my skin is almost back to normal. I still have small blemishes and redness but can actually notice significant improvement and haven’t had any new breakouts. I’m surewithin a few more weeks I will be completely blemish free! I’m curious/hopeful for to the claims of improving acne scars but I haven’t used it long enough to see those results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked for me and I will continue to use Exposed- I have thrown away my Clinique &amp; Neutrogena! I also like that Exposed hasn’t “bleached” my pillowcases. Everyone is different so this may or may not work for you but at least you get your money back if it doesn’t.</li>
            <li> I never had acne growing up. Even through my teen years. After my 30th bday I began suffering from adult acne something awful! The deep cystic kind, blackheads, whiteheads, etc etc. My dermatologist prescribed me both oral and topical medications. They didn&#x27;t work. Even after trying a few different prescribed options I was still a mess! I&#x27;m a compulsive picker on top of this and therefore have endured many nasty infections, including impetigo a few times. I missed out on so much during that time just trying to avoid anything social where I had to show my face. Soon I went into a deep depression which only made my acne and picking even worse. I began using Proactive after a friend of mine had referred me to it after she&#x27;d had great results. I was really pleased at first and began seeing results pretty quickly. As soon as my face began getting better it also became extremely dry &amp; irritated. I have very sensitive skin and it began peeling and cracking like crazy! It was painful to smile and at times it&#x27;d crack and bleed. I couldn&#x27;t wear makeup, it was too painful and it made the dryness look worse! It wasn&#x27;t fun, but in my opinion it was better than the acne! Which had improved a great deal. I decided to try Exposed after reading all the great reviews. Not only did it work equally as quickly as Proactive in ridding me of the acne, but it has never left my face irritated and painful feeling. It&#x27;s not only helped to clear my acne but it has also helped my skin heal from all the awful damage I caused from the many years of acne and picking. It&#x27;s packed with healing/soothing ingredients on top of the strong acne preventing ones such as benxoyl peroxide. I LOVE Exposed!! It has saved my face! For me it works! My skin hasn&#x27;t been this healthy or looked this good in a very long time! Hope this helped someone out there suffering from the awful damage acne can cause.</li>
            <li> I have never found a product for my skin that works as well and as fast as exposed!!! I have tried them all and was starting to give up on clear skin and I saw exposed and thought well I&#x27;ve wasted way more money on other treatments that didn&#x27;t work let&#x27;s give it one more try, and I am so glad I did! I&#x27;ve never been happier with my skin:) thank you so much!!!!!</li>
            <li> i had very bad ance i try so much stuff i just final give up.i real hard lumps and scar because every thing i try would&lt;br /&gt;either burn my face or just give more ance or big ones that were i had have them removie  and got more scars.i try it work for while on first kit.so brought one more that is when got the kit it just burn my face i had 2 degree burn.i just cry now nothing works on my face.i just get looks from people if i do not know how bad i look . just do not know if any thing going to work.i say do not buy it.just use plane soap.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews but I feel so passionately about this product I had too. I have tried every pill and potion for acne but nothing has worked, I started exposed skin care at the end of May and I am delighted with the results. Excellent. Give this a try. I also drink green tea too which may have helped too.</li>
            <li> Started using this product 10 days ago and already I can see a major difference in my skin. Love this product and anyone with acne should try it!</li>
            <li> I really love this acne treatment, and rather than repeat myself, I suggest you read the reviews for the Full Kit. The Full Kit includes the scrub, the clay mask, and the oral supplement. I&#x27;ve never had an acne treatment kit that&#x27;s work as well as Exposed has.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using exposed since I was about 13 and i&#x27;m almost 16 now. I used to have little pimples all over my face especially on my forehead and it made me very selfconsciuos. I tried sooooo many different acne treatments and it never seemed to help. I decided to try exposed and it seriously have changed my life (no over exaggeration). I have no pimples now except for the occasional teenage pimple and i can not begin to describe what it has done for my confidence. I even get compliments and people telling me they wished they had my skin :) i&#x27;ve never written a review before but exposed seriously deserve it!</li>
            <li> Hello,&lt;br /&gt;Before I used exposed skincare I had tried every kind of products but without results.. one day I find these products on internet and I decided to proved them..from that day my skin cleaned up  ..now I have no more skin problems and I had recommended to my friends too.. and they are satisfied too. so I recommend to all of them who have skin problems [[ASIN:B002CSPIKA Exposed Acne Treatment - Expanded Kit]]</li>
            <li> I have struggled since teenage years with moderate acne. I have tried every pill, antibiotic, cream and drug known to man, including roaccutane (twice). My sister introduced me to Exposed. My skin has never been clearer and I very rarely now suffer from any spots at all. I would highly recommend anybody to give it a go. I thought I was stuck with my acne, now at 35 my skin looks better than it ever has!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t suffer with acne, but get a blemish or two here and there...often enough where it bothered me.  I tried ProActiv but it did not do the job.  After months of researching and procrastinating, I discovered Exposed.  I read reviews, did my research and decided to try it.  I ordered the kit and began using it.  A month went by and no blemishes; two months went by and no blemishes...that was over a year ago.  I absolutely LOVE Exposed - by far the best face care line I have used! Not only does it work, but it is not harsh on your skin like some others.  I highly recommend this facial cleansing system to anyone...whether or not you have mild to severe acne, or anywhere in between.  The extras I like that don&#x27;t come with the kit are the microderm scrub (which I use a couple times a week) and the clarifying mask (which I use about once a week).  You will get samples of these with your kit and try them for yourself.  You will be happy you tried Exposed, I promise!</li>
            <li> I have had issues with break out since I was a teen, I am 35.  Proactiv worked but I didn&#x27;t like all the chemicals that were added.  This seemed to have more natural ingredients that were less drying on my skin.  I didn&#x27;t like that it would work as well but I love it.  I do have to supplement the kit with more the tonic because I use more of that then the other products.  I also like the micro scrub.</li>
            <li> The Exposed Acne treating system is, by far, the best system I have ever used. I&#x27;ve been an acne sufferer for many, many years, and like others, I&#x27;ve used almost everything available until I&#x27;ve fortunately found Exposed! By using many of their products, my skin quickly cleared up, became smooth and radiant, and didn&#x27;t dry up my skin or made it oily. I honestly have no complaints! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND EVERYONE TRYING IT!! You have nothing to lose with their terrific return policy, but I promise you won&#x27;t be returning anything but your old acne products! It&#x27;s an amazing product, I use it everyday and it lasts me as long as it should. Between 45 days and 60 days. A nice feature Exposed has is that you can have them automatically send you a new Exposed Acne Treatment system so you won&#x27;t have to ever go back on the site unless you want to order other products, which I also recommend. The pills are great for clearing skin from the inside, and the clarifying mask is probably my favorite. I haven&#x27;t tried the other few products but I&#x27;m sure they work as well as they should!</li>
            <li> I have used other various products that have provided decent yet short lived results.  With the Exposed Skincare line of products, I have not only been able to rid myself of the acne I had, but help reduce new pimples/cysts/blackheads from forming.  What I like most about this product is that they combine all natural ingredients with proven acne fighting products (i.e. benzoyl peroxide salycic acid).  If you are looking for a product that is gentle on your face and won&#x27;t irritate your skin, I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I am using Exposed Skin care for more than 1 year and I am not disappointed. I have tried lots of different products previously and had quite severe acne. I also went to the dermatologist for years and the result was that I always had outbreaks even though I was prescribed quite serious pills for my skin. I got visible scars on my face and I thought there is nothing really that would help my scars and I still had outbreaks. Then I tried out exposed skin care and it actually does help. The outbreaks are gone and the scars on my face are getting smaller and smaller. It is the same with pores, they look soo much smaller and my skin looks more and more natural the more I use these products. I started with the basics pack because I was suspicious at the beginning, now I am always buying the big pack incl. the face scrub and mask as well as the probiotic product. It is seriously a good combination which actually works. I wish I had found out about exposed skin care earlier! I recommend it anyone who has serious acne problems without any hesitation and the sooner you start using it the earlier you will benefit from it.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new skin care line.  I was ready to buy Proactive when I came across this product.  I decided to try it and loved it.  It does not have harsh chemicals nor did it dry my face it.  My skin felt very clean after washing it and blemishes went away within days.  It is a great product.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone. I have been using these products for about 6 months now. If you follow the steps and use it every day, you will see great results.</li>
            <li> This product is much better than Proactive.  I used Proactive for a year and saw no new results.  I still had acne on my chin and forehead.  My boyfriend started using Exposed and recommended I try it out too.  So, I tried it out and started seeing results faster and sooner than Proactive!  I have now been using Exposed for two years and have no acne, pimples or blemishes what-so-ever!!! I love it! The only problem I have with Exposed products is the consistency of the product.  It seems as though every time I get a new shipment or a new package/bottle of it the consistency is different. It has been everything from thick, thin, watery, runny, clear, cloudy, rough and smooth to even smelling different each time.  That is the only complaint I have.  They are also very helpful and customer friendly as well. They will gladly personalize your shipment if you have too much of one product and need more of another.  Overall, great product and company...very refreshing on your skin!</li>
            <li> This works extremely well.  I have had a problem with red cheeks / forehead -- very seldom with acne/pimples -- but was unable to track down what the culprit was.  After looking into anti-acne treatments on a whim, I settled on this -- and absolutely adore it. My face is super clear, and my skin is very soft.  After using this product, my skin feels very very fresh.</li>
            <li> I had previously used proactive for a year and initially had good results but my skin was incredibly dry and burned, so I tried exposed and have had amazing results! My skin is clear and best of all I haven&#x27;t had any dry or burned skin. I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using exposed for a little more than 6 months now. Keeping in mind that every face works differently for different people, I am Female, 18-25, mild to moderate acne, Asian.  I would consider this product better than ones I&#x27;ve tried. Although, it did not entirely clear my face as guaranteed in the 30 day period, it showed significant improvement than the last two products I&#x27;ve used (which seems to be an endless process). Since benzoyl peroxide started to irritate my skin I had to cancel an acne treatment that worked really well and switched to using those with salicylic acid, which does very little to clean my acne. Interestingly, my face doesn&#x27;t irritate with exposed as it uses both benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; During the second order, my face started to clear dramatically with the exception of black heads and dark spots. This product does not seem to heal those. Additionally black heads in general should be treated with gentle scrubbing (which the expanded kit does not offer). Without any treatment, my face typically breaks out constantly (white heads, more apparent black spots, nodules, ect),  I&#x27;ve noticed that does not happen with exposed. I&#x27;m not too sure if this would heal those with severe acne as mine is typically moderate at worst.  Additionally when less pimples appear I stop touching my face, which is the biggest issue causing my acne. After the second order, I also did not need the moisturizer anymore. Although it may be good to use it, I&#x27;ve switched to one that would heal dark spots and pigmentation instead. I do not find it necessary to order the expanded kit, however it may be recommended for the first time.</li>
            <li> When I turned 40 I began struggling with adult cystic acne.  Tried every product you see advertised and lived on antibiotics for years.  If anything worked it was just for a short time. and then my skin would seem to reject it.  I&#x27;ve been using the Exposed products since March of 2013.  I began to notice a difference in my skin a couple of weeks in.  My skin is not as oily but yet these products did not dry my skin like other products had in the past.  I think I&#x27;ve gotten 2 or 3 of the horrible giant cysts since starting on this line, but nothing - nothing like before. I love that this kit comes with the moisturizer.  I was never really able to use one in the past without causing a breakout.  I highly recommend giving these products a try!</li>
            <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;My teenage daughter was suffering with acne. I brought her to a skin specialist who said that they would prescribe her with Roaccutane as a form of medication to alleviate her condition but after reading the possible side effects of this drug, there was no way we wanted to go down this route. I spent a lot of time searching online for an alternative to medication for her. After reading much reviews, I decided that I would order Exposed skincare products for her. She began using them and within a short period of maybe 2 weeks, her acne began to disappear completely! This stuff is amazing. It truly works. Shes been using it for the past 2 years and its kept her acne away. Apart from a time where she ran out of the products and I had forgotten to reorder a new batch for her and the acne returned. So this really works. She will continue to use it as long as she needs to. Plus, they are a fantastic company to deal with. Customer service is excellent. I would highly recommend this company and their products.</li>
            <li> Most of my whitehead pimples are gone, but my blackheads are still an issue.  I was expecting more of a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Unlike other reviews or obvious paid testimonials you see on tv (namely, celebrities who endorse proactive), I will tell you only THE TRUTH. Although I have a very interesting story to tell, I will not tell it because I believe people prefer shorter reviews. If you want to hear my full story, then please ask by commenting on my review. I am male and 24 years of age who had severe acne problems. I consider myself as the 1% who understands the causes of acne and its treatments better than most. Let me give you an example of the knowledge I possess. What is the cause of acne? It&#x27;s not bacteria like they say. If it&#x27;s not bacteria, then why use an acne kit? Because effectively treating the root cause of acne is difficult, it requires a dramatic change in your diet; if you can do it, then tell me about it. I had this knowledge since I was 12 (year 2001). I&#x27;ve been using exposed for more than 2 years. If you discovered that salicylic acid and/or benzoyl peroxide has helped treat your acne, then stop looking for other products and buy this one. Murad focuses on salicylic acid and proactive focuses on benzoyl peroxide. Exposed combines both as well as other natural ingredients (see [...]). Why is exposed better? because it uses patented technology when they formulate benzoyl peroxide. There is more details on their website. The benzoyl peroxide is the same as any other product EXCEPT it does not irritate your skin at all because the compound of benzoyl peroxide is encapsulated. This is one main reason for why I use exposed. Why should you buy exposed? because they offer a higher statistically significant success rate of 98% This has always been higher than proactive&#x27;s success rate. 2 years ago, Exposed success rate was only 90%, and now its 98%!!! That&#x27;s unbelievable. And they will continue to keep improving their products. One last thing, Exposed is so confident in their success rate that they offer 1 year money back guarantee. 2 years ago it was 60-90 days money back guarantee (when they had a 90% success rate). Go and google other companies and let me know if you see a company offering something close to that. Good luck with finding a company that is even close to what Exposed offers. Just try Exposed because there is absolutely no risk. Additionally, the staff is very friendly and will refund you ASAP if there was a mistake on your purchase. I wish you all a good and healthy life.</li>
            <li> I have used everything from the cheap over the counter acne treatments to pro active and prescription benzoyl peroxide washes. Nothing has worked as well as Exposed. Not only does it clear my skin of blemishes but it also smooths out my skin, which makes my face look even better. If you&#x27;re thinking about trying exposed you should.</li>
            <li> Had a very ugly reaction to this product. It&#x27;s day 3 and I woke up to a very bright red, itchy, angry face. I had to take Benedryl. My advise is if you have allergies or sensitive skin might be to find another product.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for a friend and she loved it.</li>
            <li> BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT FOR MY TEENAGE DAUGHTER AND SHE LOVES IT! IT DOESN&#x27;T SEEM TO BE AS STRONG AND IRRITATING AS SOME OTHER PRODUCTS.</li>
            <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve tried everything. Dermatologist prescriptions that were too mild or strong, from Proactiv (which was WAY too strong), to Clinique (did next to nothing after almost 3 mos of religious use). I&#x27;ve used every hypoallergenic product there was and some that weren&#x27;t. Then I went all natural with tea tree oil, castile soap, and shea butter. Nothing worked as well as I&#x27;d hoped, even after 6+ months of use. I have mild to moderate acne, large pores and oily skin, with a few cysts back from my bare minerals days that I could never get rid of (the bare minerals story is a rant that I will not go into here).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, three weeks into it I have noticed a definite improvement in my skin. Day 1 I began the system in the morning, following the instructions exactly. At night I noticed my skin felt a little softer and seemed less irritated. Week 1, I noticed there were very few new blackheads and small pimples. After Week 2, I noticed a definite improvement in my skin&#x27;s tone and texture, and that one of the persistent cysts on my chin was more apparent, but felt smaller. Well into Week 3, that cyst is gone and the remaining ones are behaving that way as well. I hope that very soon they will all disappear!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I have used this system just as religiously as I used to use Clinique, with a few exceptions. The system tells you to first wash with the cleanser, then apply the clearing tonic with just your fingers (I use a cotton pad as lightly as possible since the liquid just slips right through my fingers), then apply the acne treatment serum in the morning. At night after cleanser/tonic you apply the pore clearing serum, let dry, and then pat a small amount of moisturizer into your skin. Every now and then I find that the clearing tonic/acne treatment serum is drying, so on those mornings I skip the tonic and acne treatment, and then apply the moisturizer and the dryness clears right up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I am really enjoying the effects. I would recommend that you give this product a good honest try, as I fully expect that in 2-3 months I will finally have the clear, radiant skin I have been trying to get back to since puberty.ecommend that you give this product a good honest try, as I fully expect that in 2-3 months I will finally have the clear, radiant skin I have been trying to get back to since puberty.</li>
            <li> This is a good product. It cleared up my skin. The only thing is they don&#x27;t have anything for scars.</li>
            <li> My Mom found this Skincare online after using multiple products in the past. She wanted me to try it and I reluctantly did. After 2 weeks, I noticed a huge difference. Proactiv was too harsh on my skin, but this Acne Treatment worked phenomenally. I&#x27;ve been using it for a year now.. and I cannot see myself ever looking for anything else to replace it!</li>
            <li> Once you order this product it is way to hard to return. The company will give you the run around trying to get you to wait out the year, I guess they want you to forget. Ive spoken to some one over the phone that told me to follow the e-mail instructions, which I did. All it does is keeps sending me the same e-mail and form to fill out. The e-mail states that there is no need to rush sending back the product because I have a whole year!!! Why keep such an expensive product thats not being used?!? If you&#x27;re anything like me, if I don&#x27;t return it now the year will pass me by and I will be stuck with this product!! :(</li>
            <li> I am in my late teens and have had skin problems since I was 13. I was always insecure about it and so have tried just about every product out there to clear up my skin. Clean and clear dried me out, proactiv made my skin scaly and sensitive. Murad was the only thing that ever came close to the results that I have seen with exposed and that was simply too expensive and the results short-lived. I decided to buy exposed after seeing all the positive customer reviews and their money back guarantee. I would never dream of sending this product back, I began seeing results in about two weeks; have been using it over a year now and it&#x27;s like my skin can&#x27;t live without it. I definitely recommend getting the expanded kit, it&#x27;s worth the extra couple bucks to get the full results.</li>
            <li> The product is great, especially with the moisturizer. It does not leave your skin dry or peely. It&#x27;s not an overnight process, but even the company tells you that but you notice healthier skin in just a few weeks. Love this stuff. Bad skin doesn&#x27;t just explode and return if you stop the product for a few days. It really works.</li>
            <li> I been having my face clean all my life but once in a while theres an imperfection, I try the leading brand and didn&#x27;t work for me, once I purchased this product my skin looks healthy.</li>
            <li> I was one of those who thought there is no help for my skin, it is a hormone-thing and that´s why all the creams and treatments don´t work... When I found online about Exposed, I was a bit desperate and skeptic, but somehow I decided to give it a try, and, omg, it worked! It honestly saved my face, and freed me of wasting so much time covering my spots when going out.&lt;br /&gt;Now with 28 years of age I can finally enjoy having a ´normal´ clear skin, and that happened after only month and half of using. I can strongly recommend you to give it a try, and definitely be persistent in applying it as recommended. I had only somewhat dried skin at the beginning, but no redness, no pain, nothing...I found it actually quite gentle to skin, comparing it with some other products that did nothing to me except irritations. Try it, and hope you will also have a desire to write excited review here like me:)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 33 years old.  My skin was always pretty good with the occasional pimple until last year.  I developed cystic acne which I found very hard to cure.  I tried 3 expensive product lines and some beauty tools (clarisonic/zeno) and spent $100&#x27;s of dollars before stumbling upon exposed skin care.  I was frustrated because I kept spending money, using a product for 6-8 weeks and never seeing any results.  I went online and started to research.  Exposed Skin Care kept popping up.  I had never heard of it but it was the highest customer rated product out there.  So I tried it, my cystic acne is gone!  I&#x27;m back to the occational pimple but then I use the treatment serum and it is cleared up the next day.  I&#x27;ve been using the Exposed line for 3 months now.  Just so you know it didn&#x27;t happen overnight for me, but after a month I definately saw my skin going in the right direction, and now my scars are almost all gone!  The products last approximately 1 1/2 months so its a great value as well.  I just upgraded my kit so I can try the probiotic and the mask. I also did not have any flaking or redness like you can have from some acne lines.  Even though my skin is cleared up I am going to continue to used the line because my complextion looks better than it ever has!</li>
            <li> Oily skin with regular outbreak of pimples has been a problem since adolescence. I have tried anti acne creams and antibiotics which do not seem to have a lasting effect. In my early 30s, I tried proactive which appeared to clear the pimples but was extremely drying for my skin and I ended with flaky skin instead. Then I stumbled across exposed products on line early 2006 and this is the only skin care I have been using since. My skin looked terrific within 3 weeks of using the products and I have had minimal problems with pimples since. Moreover, my skin is never overly oily now so make-up sets well and stays put through the day. I find the price reasonable and I always buy the expanded set as I like the moisturiser.</li>
            <li> Tried everything on the market and pills from a derm doc with little to no result until exposed. Been a user and fan for 2 years and it still keeps me clear,love it!</li>
            <li> I have been using Exposed skin care for just about a year now and I LOVE it. I have tried many different acne products in the past and this is the first acne fighting set that I have found that not only works, but gives great and lasting results. My skin does not dry out, it doesn&#x27;t get or oily, it is perfect! I have already reccommeneded this set to three of my friends and they love it as well.</li>
            <li> I have been extremely happy with these products. I am a 30 year old female who has struggled with mild to moderate acne for the last 15 years. I have tried many of the other acne lines out there, including Proactiv, and did not have good results. They seemed too harsh and drying for my sensitive, combination skin. When i started using the Exposed line almost a year ago, I noticed an immediate difference in the quality of these products. My skin began to clear up within a few weeks and the i didnt have the drying factor that i had with previous products. I noticed also that eliminating dairy, grains and processed sugar from my diet has helped tremendously. I am very happy with these products. I would highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> I decided to try Exposed products because anything and everything ranging from antibiotics to Proactiv simply hadn&#x27;t worked for me. I was a little intimidated by the price to begin with, but I have to say so far it&#x27;s been worth every penny. The cleanser is easy on your skin and washes off quickly (especially with the included DermX cloth), and the tonic isn&#x27;t nearly as harsh as others I&#x27;ve used. The Clear Pore and Acne Treatment serum&#x27;s work exactly as they should, and the moisturizer works miracles, especially during the initial adjustment period. Recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Skin ID by Neutrogena for a long time.  It kept my skin relatively clear, but I&#x27;ve had breakouts every now and then, especially when I&#x27;m stressed out. I started suffering from acne around the area next to the eyebrows, and Skin ID couldn&#x27;t control it any more. I decided to try Proactiv.  It worked amazingly well at first (for about 2 weeks).  But then, it started breaking out around my jaw line.  I was sticking to the skin care routine very well, but I kept suffering form this jaw-line acne and Proactiv wouldn&#x27;t cure it.  I surfed around to do some research, and I finally decided to give Exposed a try.  The result:  it WORKED!!!    I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks, and the acnes completely gone!!! Besides my jaw-line, I had break outs on my cheek (one pimple), above my lip (one), and around my eyebrow, but they were all gone with in 48 hours using Exposed skin care system.    I will keep using this product, and I just hope that this continues being effective.  I will follow up within next few weeks.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I used Proactive before this and it did the job. But my skin got used to it, it dried it out, and i got terrible sunburn. This product however is gentle , my skin feels great. It also sort of covers your face up. It cleared my face in 2 weeks, i still get pimples. Put i am no loonger afraid to go out in public.</li>
            <li> Exposed Acne Treatment has helped my face tremendously! I really like the outcome of it and recommend it to those also struggling with acne. Also, be sure you are drinking plenty of water, getting good sleep, and eating a well balanced diet. There&#x27;s way more to it than just dirt, oil, and hormonal imbalance.   :)</li>
            <li> I PURCHASED MY FIRST KIT IN OCTOBER 2011 AND MY SKIN WAS CLEAR IN 2 WEEKS.  I NOW JUST APPLY TO MY T-ZONE AREA (NOSE, CHEEKS, CHIN) DUE TO THE WINTER WEATHER CAUSING EXCESSIVE DRYNESS, AND I HAVE ADDED AN OIL FREE MOISTURIZER AT NIGHT AFTER THE PRODUCTS.  I ONLY OCCASIONALLY HAVE A MINOR BREAKOUT, BUT IT CLEARS UP OVERNIGHT WITH THE ACNE TREATMENT SERUM.  I USED TO WEAR A HEAVY OIL FREE FOUNDATION TO ATTEMPT TO COVER MY IMPERFECTIONS, BUT NOW HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CHANGE TO A LIGHTER PRODUCT DUE TO MY CLEAR, SMOOTH, ACNE FREE COMPLEXION.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently had a lot of trouble with acne breakouts. My skin went from being relatively clear for the last several years to non-stop breakouts in the last several months. Some of my acne has been incredibly bad lately as well, even causing a few scars - which has never happened to me before. I started using exposed several weeks ago and although it did take a while to get going, my skin is finally beginning to clear up and it feels great. My only issue was that I didn&#x27;t heed the weaning in period, so I did experience some extensive over-drying. I just backed off to washing my face once a day until I was a bit more acclimated to the system, and now I&#x27;m up to washing twice a day and everything is great!! The clearing tonic does occasionally cause my face to sting, but only where I have a really bad pimple, and not always. On the whole, the system is a little bit expensive, but I have the feeling once things are clearing up I can probably switch down to the basic kit and it will still be fine. Good luck to those trying it out!</li>
            <li> I began using exposed after seeing SOME results from the Proactive Solution. I was disappointed however in the lack of complete removal as well as how it irritated my skin, so I began searching for another topical solution. To my excitement one of the best options available Online (According to my own research into the user and medical reviews), was an all natural line of products known as Exposed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right away I noticed that the creams were less irritating than Proactive, but were showing the same results. Indeed, the results ended up surpassing Proactive, despite application being no more complicated or time consuming. That being said, a large portion of my acne problem still remains, which I hold out hope is a situation which will change, but I know that my acne is an exceptional case which topical creams can only do so much for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact is I applied product morning and evening as instructed and it has showed considerable results. Exposed is a great product to at least give a chance to, especially with their great money back guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to continue buying Exposed products :)</li>
            <li> This product so far is the best one that I&#x27;ve used for acne problem. The only reason why i didn&#x27;t give this a 5 stars is because once in a while I do have a couple of acne breaking out. Maybe just that time of the month? But overall customer service was great and product is good! Just a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> This is really working well to clear up my daughters acne. I am so glad we discovered this product.</li>
            <li> Best results so far.  And I have tried so many products. Very happy.  THis product didn&#x27;t dry out my face and I got excellent results</li>
            <li> Warning, I purchased this product and I tried it for 30 days. now my whole face is acne . and this product increased my acne instead decreased or reduced. unfortunately, after 30 day including shipping, they will not accepting returning option. Therefore, I want to return it. but the amazon after 30 days will not give you returning option. honestly, I am saying that this product is only spending money on nothing.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this a try after using almost every acne product at the pharmacies and beauty supply but only made my acne worst. Im 29 and my acne just started I got breakouts on my side of face  and my face outline. Just started this product and this is my second week and my redness is gone my pimples have healed. I get a few Pop ups once in a while but I&#x27;m gonna continue to use for a few months till my face is clear I honestly and faithfully am using this product</li>
            <li> I used Proactiv in the past, but it tended to leave my skin dry and flaky.  Ever since I switched to Exposed my skin has been moister and I haven&#x27;t had the awful patchy look when I put make up on!  It also manages to control the deep cystic acne, but I&#x27;m struggling with smaller breakouts, so I may need to research something internal to take as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had problem skin since I was 7 - it&#x27;s highly reactive, which means I don&#x27;t only get acne, but eczema as well. That means there are very few products I can use, since most of them are far too harsh and just leave me with eczema instead of (or as well as!) acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These products, used in concert, are brilliant on that score. The system calms the skin down and resolves the acne with natural ingredients and no harsh chemicals. I can even use the scrub without it causing any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t get a perfect result from it, but it contains the worst problems pretty well. I still get regular breakouts, despite good diet, frequent washing of bedding, etc. My skin is just very reactive, so I think I will always get problems if I am tired, or ill, or stressed. But I can calm the skin down pretty quickly with this - it is the only thing I&#x27;ve ever tried that brings my skin vaguely under control, letting it heal. And that includes prescribed medication, all of which was useless or made things much worse. Using these products definitely makes a noticeable difference. Most days, with a touch of good quality non-codemic mineral make-up, no-one even would know that I have acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I will definitely carry on buying Exposed. The products really do work. I should say don&#x27;t expect miracles if you have very persistent or very bad acne, but you will see a noticeable improvement, and quite quickly. I&#x27;m 49 and have been using it for about 2 years now. Shame it took me 40 years of quite severe and uncontrollable acne to find out about it!</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products out there from Proactive to Skin Id to Murad...etc. And i have been extremely frustrated that nothing out there seemed to work for me. So I came across Exposed Skin Care expecting the same results as everything else i have always tried, NOTHING! But Wow was I surprised! I have oily to normal skin and was pleasantly surprised that this 6-piece kit didnt irritate my skin like other products did. It feels so refreshing and light. Literally after about a week my skin was showing improvement and it continued week after week. Ive been getting compliments on my skin and I just Love these skin care products. Not only that but there&#x27;s a 1 year warranty! That&#x27;s just un heard of with skin care products! Please Try it, You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> I had such high expectations for this product. Almost every single one had nothing but good things to say for this product: \\&quot;Best acne product ever!\\&quot;, \\&quot;Made my skin super clear\\&quot;, \\&quot;I&#x27;ll never need to change products ever again\\&quot;! But, honestly, this product did little to nothing for me. After the first couple of days, the small bumps that I&#x27;ve had since the beginning of April (2012), and they DID become smaller, but they&#x27;re still there. They haven&#x27;t changed size very much at all. And it even made me break out more! So, I&#x27;m probably not going to re-purchase this product, unless some magical event happens and my face clears up. But until then, three stars for this product.</li>
            <li> It REALLY works and works fast! Very gentle too.&lt;br /&gt;One of mine favorite products is the scrub. Makes my skin so smooth and even less breakouts!</li>
            <li> I could feel the difference the first day and my skin after a few weeks looks like I never had any skin issues. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I was very pleasantly surprised how effective this product is.  I completely stopped using proactiv and now only use exposed.</li>
            <li> I was definitely skeptical about this purchase, especially after reading the remarks about fake reviews. Fake or not- this stuff cleared my skin. I have suffered from moderate acne for years and this is the cleanest my face has been since before I can even remember. Additionally, I have not used makeup or concealer for a week now because there is no need to hide my skin! I never used to walk out without covering my blemishes so this feels great!</li>
            <li> This is the best acne product I have ever used and the only one that has worked for me. I have tried the expensive creams and antibiotics from the dermatologist without much improvement. This 4 step skin care system is great. It cleared up my acne and hasn&#x27;t caused over drying. I am a 42-year -old female and I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This dried out my face just a little around my nostrils, but the product works VERY well. I must admit, I am inconsistent. I don&#x27;t always use it twice a day as recommended. Stay hydrated and use as needed. You will be happy with what you see.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product first for my 16 yr old daughter, saw good results in 3 weeks for her and she uses it as intended. She has been using it for 3 months and after 6 months we will determine whether or not to continue.  She was happy with it so we figured why not try it on my son. i bought the basic kit for my 19yr old son.  His face was a mess and after 2 weeks he looked 10x better. His friends even noticed it when he was home from school. I think it works better on my son than it did on my daughter.  Can&#x27;t hurt to try the product. Both use it according to the directions.  Worth a try.</li>
            <li> I have been using the exposed skin care kit for a couple months now.  It works great. People compliment me on my skin all the time now, it feels amazing.</li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic product. Skin feel smooth and soft. Highly recommended to everyone !!</li>
            <li> I bought just the acne serum and moisturizer and I use them everyday. The tea tree oil and and the green tea extract really soothe my face without getting oily. Highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking for something gentle to provide long lasting results</li>
            <li> I  have been using this product for 6 weeks and saw no changes in my skin&#x27;s overall condition.&lt;br /&gt;I still wake up with white heads all along my chin and jaw and the cystic acne on my forehead seems to be worse.&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Exposed and they are refunding my money when I send back the kit.&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t work for me but at least I&#x27;m getting a refund.</li>
            <li> My now 15 year old daughter had been struggling with face and body acne since 5th grade, so bad that she was embarrassed to wear a bathing suit or a tank top because of her body breakouts.  We tried proactive, proactive plus, and others, and nothing worked UNTIL Exposed Skin Care.  Her body acne is gone, her face breaks out during &amp;#34;that time&amp;#34;- she is SO happy with the results!  I really believe the key is the whole system, INCLUDING the pro-biotic.  Is makes sense to cure the body from the inside out, and the pro-biotic is key. We love this product!</li>
            <li> My daughter has been using exposed for 3 months. After years if issues with acne this product works great for her!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing. Holy grail for skin</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Cleared my face up very quickly. I have used Clinique and rhodan fields in the past and nothing has worked as effectively and quickly as this product.</li>
            <li> Something changed in my hormones this year when I turned 30, I have tried dozens of products and medicines and nothing has cleared up my acne by my chin. I use to not need to do anything and now it&#x27;s the opposite. My face had never looked worse. A month ago I did research and heard that Exposed may be the perfect option for me. A little expensive to try out, but I was desperate to see if it&#x27;d work. So far it&#x27;s erasing the scarring along my jaw and bumps from previous acne. I went home for xmas and my mom even commented that it&#x27;s like my skin is back to the way it was a year ago. It&#x27;s not perfect now, but I&#x27;m definitely going to keep using and see what it can do in another month.</li>
            <li> I started using Exposed a little while ago because Proactiv was too hard on my skin and Exposed is made for sensitive skin. Long story short, my skin has cleared up A LOT and many people have told me over and over that my skin is amazing- people that I barely even talk to. But the catch to the AMAZING outcome is that once you stop using it, you&#x27;ll break out again. Also, It may not clear EVERYTHING, there may be that one tiny spot that never goes away- or maybe thats just me! For sure this product is very good and is worth buying.</li>
            <li> i used to have a lot of pimples then it came up to the point that i had uncontrollable breakouts.my face so messed up,forehead,cheeks,chin.so desperate,i search for top acne treatment in the Internet,then I found exposed products.i gave it a try.i am so happy with the result.everyday i can see the improvements.i started with the exposed basic kit,in just 2mons it was excellent!i see a lot difference.my breakouts was gone.im on the expanded kit right now and is better than ever.each treatment you can see and feel how it works(right after you apply it).been using this product for 4mons.my face is not oily anymore(can go out w/o powder)but not dry either,i also noticed my face whitens and softer!no more pimples.very happy &amp; satisfied.i recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My skin was amazingly clear until around the age of 16-17, when I began to get spots.  This increased over the next few years and it got to the point where the acne was often painful, especially around my chin and jawline, and the spots, redness and scars covered the majority of my face.  I wouldn&#x27;t go anywhere without makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried various products to combat the acne but nothing worked for me until I used the Exposed system at the age of 22.  I chose the expanded kit because it includes a moisturiser - my skin might be acne prone, but it&#x27;s not oily.  If anything it&#x27;s a little dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The exposed system guarantees to give you acne free skin in 30 days.  I wasn&#x27;t *quite* acne free in 30 days, but I saw an amazing improvement.  In probably 5-6 weeks I had almost stopped getting new spots, so my skin was finally getting the chance to begin to heal.  Now, it&#x27;s around 6 months after I first started to use the exposed system and I only very occasionally get a new spot - and that&#x27;s ONE occasional new spot, not the many I would get before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin doesn&#x27;t look entirely clear due to the redness and scarring from previous spots, but even that is gradually improving.  I&#x27;ve actually had a couple of compliments on my skin - one noticing that it looked so much clearer (I was wearing makeup, but now I can get my skin looking practically flawless with a bit of makeup - before, I could only really cover the redness) and the other thinking I was wearing makeup when I wasn&#x27;t!!  It&#x27;s definitely given me a confidence boost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is a little on the high side for me, especially as I also have to pay higher postage fees to have it shipped to the UK, but I consider it absolutely worth it for the results I have had.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this acne kit. I&#x27;m seeing results and it only been a week. My skin look so rich and vibrant. I would recommend this to everyone. I no longer need make up that&#x27;s how beautiful my skin have become.</li>
            <li> I started using exposed skin care about two years ago.  Prior to that I had been struggling with breakouts since I was a teenager.  Advancing into my 20s I was sick and tired of having unhealthy skin.  While googling skin care products I came across Exposed and all I can say is I have never looked back.  My skin is 100% acne free and not dry to top it off!! I absolutely love Exposed skin care, it really has made a difference in my confidence with my skin.  I highly recommend this product if you have been struggling with over the counter brand. Also priced right for the results!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 29 year old male who has suffered from acne since I was an adolescent. Fortunately I only had mild acne on my face, but severe acne on the back of my neck, as well as the rest of my back. Bacne has been a consistent problem for me for the last 15 years, I would never take my shirt off during the summer because I was embarassed by my back. It has also been extremely painful and I generally had anywhere from 5 to 15 painful breakouts on any given day. I still haven&#x27;t grown out of it and no other acne treaments worked. I was considering trying oral medication but the possible negative side affects made me search for other options. I did an internet search for the best acne treatments available without a prescription and came across Exposed Skin Care and decided to give it a try. It has been well worth the expense as I now have a clear neck and back with only occassional breakouts. I began using Exposed at the end of last summer and this year have no fears of taking my shirt off in front of others. My skin isnt perfect as I have many acne scars still healing, however I&#x27;m happy to say new breakouts are a thing of the past. If you&#x27;ve tried everything else and nothing has worked, give Exposed a try before going to more extreme treatments such as oral meds or surgery.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I have used a TON of acne products. My skin has never been perfect and I have just tried to keep it under control. Once I started using exposed skin care I noticed a difference. My skin is so soft and blemish free. It keeps the zits under wraps and my breakouts have been less excessive. I love this product!</li>
            <li> This product works!!!!! My daughter tried everything out there and this is the only thing that has worked!</li>
            <li> I have been suffering from acne for about 10 years, and after I turned 30 and tried EVERYTHING - I thought this is my destiny. TO always feel ugly and dirty and to never be able to look to peoples eyes. Exposed has truly changed my life! I used to take Raouctan and my skin was always very sensitive and dry. This product ? It took 2 weeks and ever since, for now 6 month, I am acne free and my life is so much happier and easier now. I feel so much more beautiful and clean. The morning routine is faster and easier. I can&#x27;t say enough about this line of products. IT IT SUPER!</li>
            <li> I had beautiful skin until I was a senior in high school. Then, I begin to have really bad acne and tried every product on the market. I visited a dermatologist and tried over the counter medicine as well. I have VERY sensitive skin so I always had to be careful what I chose. I happened upon Exposed Skin Care after Googling the best reviews and decided to give it a try. I bought the starter kit with the cleanser, toner, acne treatment, clear pore serum, and moisturizer. I also started taking the probiotic and WOW!! The results I have from this product are better than I have ever seen before. The price is kind of high but they last a good amount of time, they offer coupons and special deals, and you can buy any product individually if you use one faster than the others. I recommend this product to anyone that knows me because they know how much I struggled before and now I have the pretty skin that I used to have.</li>
            <li> You really have to be patient to use this product. It works and it smooths your skin so that you wouldn&#x27;t feel the bumps from acne. I still have red marks on my face but they are clearing up. I plan on buying another kit just because I see progress coming along. I&#x27;ve never used any other treatment before so I&#x27;m sticking with this one. I still have some left in the tubes that I have. I just apply on my left and right cheek.</li>
            <li> Ok so I was a little sceptical when I first bought this, so I only bought the travel kit to start off with.  I have moderate acne but my skin is actually really oily and this is what bothers me the most.  In the first two weeks my skin was quite irritated but I applied only every other day to ease this off until my skin got used to it, which it did and I am so pleased that I persevered!  I now have no more spots, and although my skin is still oily, it is significantly reduced.</li>
            <li> Went to dermatologist and I was told to stop using it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 17 yo son after he had been on dermatologist prescribed oral meds for 3 months with no change in his acne, but some change in his personality.  The dermatologist just wanted to put him on stronger oral meds (Accutane) and didn&#x27;t seem too concerned with my concerns about side-effects.  Exposed Skin Care acne treatment has almost completely cleared up his back and face.  His face still gets a few break outs, but nothing like before.  He is careful to change his pillowcases, too.  I highly recommend this- no side effects and it does work.  We are on the auto ship plan from the Exposed Skin Care website.</li>
            <li> This product is okay.  I was not excited about it though.  The description made it sound like it was way better than proactive and all other brands, but it&#x27;s all about the same to me.</li>
            <li> This product has definitely reduced blackheads/whiteheads and overall breakouts.  Reducing milk and sugar at the same time I started using this product has been a factor, but the naturalness of Exposed and variety of products within this box have all worked together to give me less concern for acne in my life.  I tend to have a very oily face and it does nothing to help that problem, but at least the acne that used to be a big concern has been reduced by 85%+!!  If you have acne issues, it&#x27;s worth giving this product a try.  I&#x27;ve considered Accutane with all it&#x27;s risks and feel this product provides a much wiser, safer option.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost 2 years now and my daughter who is a teenager just started using it also.  Her face started breaking out and just wasn&#x27;t clearing up as it had in the past.  She started using the system and within a week her face was looking so much better.  Now she has clear skin and feels so much better about herself.  This system really does work, honestly.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I first ordered Exposed. I had used Proactive for a few years and it cleared up my face, but never really got rid of my acne and after awhile, it didn&#x27;t seem to be working anymore. I tried many other products - I have very sensitive skin and they all either made my face super red &amp; dry or made me break out worse than before - none of them worked. I came across Exposed and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. It is amazing! My skin was 100 times better after the first month. It is the only thing that has really seemed to make the blackheads go away &amp; make my pores look smaller. I don&#x27;t break out at all anymore! I use the moisture complex, it&#x27;s great because it keeps my skin smooth, but doesn&#x27;t clog my pores. You can tell that they use natural ingredients, the products smell natural &amp; I think that makes them less harsh on your skin. I know that not all skin solutions work for everyone, but definitely give Exposed a try, it was a life changer for me.</li>
            <li> This product has been working real well for me! I have been using for about a month now, and have noticed big changes in my skin. It is still a little dry from getting used to the difference in this product from others i have used, but my black heads are gone and my pimples have dried out. Granted my skin is not completely clear yet, but i can see the changes it is making.  I would recommend this product, but I would suggest getting the basic kit (it comes without a moisturizer) depending on your skin, if more dry than oily, you are better off using a moisturizer your skin is used to.  Try out the CeraVe moisturizer. It is in a very generic bottle but is great! It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy, and also keeps your skin from drying out.  Its perfect!  I do recommend this product.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B002CSPIKA Exposed Acne Treatment - Expanded Kit]]  I was a little skeptical about Exposed Acne Treatment. I have severe cystic acne. I tried Proactiv, Clinique, Murad and Dermatology Doctor. I was even on Accutane back in 2003 (which cured my acne until 2010). But Accutane is very hard to get and a very dangerous drug so I wanted to find something that would hopefully work. Since all the other products failed me, I didnt think Exposed would be any different. But I would still give it a shot anyway. I have been using Exposed for a little over a month now and I have only gotten 3 small pimples compared to the 8-10 cystic ones that I would get on a day to day basis. The product is not overdrying and the smell has a natural herb like scent to it. I am not over powered with the smell of alcohol or menthol. I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> So far it aint perfect but Its working better than Proactive for me, Proactive didnt do anything. Right now Im breaking out pretty bad, but only because I have very compacted skin so a lot of stuff is coming up. However, my skin isnt oilily and I love the feel of my skin and the smell of the mositerizer is awesome. I just wish the core clear serium wasn&#x27;t so sticky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Exposed Skin Care for about 2 months now and so far it is the best product I&#x27;ve tried. After months of using Proactiv with no results and horrific customer service, it&#x27;s nice to use something that helps and doesn&#x27;t completely dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t EVER take the time to review a product unless it&#x27;s honestly worth it! This product is! It may not work for everyone, but you can&#x27;t bash something if you haven&#x27;t actually tried it. All those reading these reviews...keep an open mind! There could be a few fake reviews, but I&#x27;m a real person who took a chance ordering Exposed and it worked! All those insisting these reviews are fake because they use the same (or similar) wording- why wouldn&#x27;t we?! People can only use so many terms to describe acne suffering and what a product has done to help that! I used to hate my skin, fearing I would struggle with acne my whole life. I tried this after researching (and yes, reading these reviews) and now my skin feels like the skin I should&#x27;ve been born with! It seems unbelievable, but this is the ONLY product that has EVER worked for me and I will keep using it long after this review!</li>
            <li> Looks like Proactive has some competition, yea right this is better than Proactive! Works wonders, in 5 days I noticed my skin starting to clear up. I have tried Proactive and for some reason, it just wouldn&#x27;t get the job done as I hoped for. If you have an acne problem, Exposed Acne skincare is the way to go hands down!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of buying this product at first, but after reading so many customer reviews, I figured I would give it a try. I noticed an improvement from day one. Tiny bumps on my chin began to disappear, and some of my other breakouts were decreasing. After 3 months, I felt that the product had plateaued because my skin didn&#x27;t seem to be getting better, but it also wasn&#x27;t getting worse. I decided to change some of my makeup products and I bought a Clarisonic Mia to use with these products. What a dramatic difference! I think that some of my makeup products were making me breakout. Also, the Clarisonic got my skin 10 times cleaner than my hands alone did, which helped the Exposed products to seep into my skin better. Since I made those 2 changes my skin has been getting clearer and clearer. Some of my friends have noticed how clean and smooth it is. I highly recommend this product. I thought I&#x27;d never have clear skin again, but this kit changed all of that. Now I just have to wait until the red marks fade completely and I will have a perfect complexion again! :)</li>
            <li> Great product but I recommend a benzoyl peroxide cleanser that you can use before the facial wash. Must use consistently for results and don&#x27;t pick!</li>
            <li> I have had mild but consistent acne for years and I didn&#x27;t find Exposed until I was in my mid 30&#x27;s!  I sure wish I would have found it sooner because within a few days of using it my face was completely clear.  I was on antibiotics on and off from the time I was in my 20&#x27;s until I found Exposed Skin Care.  If I run out of product my face goes right back to where it was so I know it&#x27;s the product that makes my skin look so good.  I&#x27;ve tried every product you can imagine and Exposed was the only one that helped.  I am so thankful for it and so is my skin![[ASIN:B002CSPIKA Exposed Acne Treatment - Expanded Kit]]</li>
            <li> I originally bought this to try out for my boyfriend. He has real oily, sensitive skin. Nothing was seeming to work on his constant breakouts. So I said, what the heck, let&#x27;s give this a shot. And we are both so happy that we did! Within the first week his breakouts started to lessen and within the second week they disappeared. I have dry, and also sensitive skin, and wanted to try it out. I do not get a lot of break outs, but since I starting using Exposed I don&#x27;t get any breakouts. My pores are minimal. My boyfriend and I work in front of a computer all day, and for some reason our faces just build up grease throughout the day. Exposed actually severely help with that. We started using it twice a day as recommended, but now we only use it about 3 or 4 times a week. This is the only face care product I will ever buy again.</li>
            <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t work. Dont trust the gurantee that it gives you clear skin in 30 days. I&#x27;ve been using it for like 3 months and it&#x27;s actually made my acne worse. Thanks a lot for making me waste my money.</li>
            <li> I have been using exposed for about 3 months now and it has worked wonders on my skin. I moved from the Midwest to Los Angeles 2 years ago and started to get really bad, continuous breakouts. I tried multiple product and nothing would work very well at all. Exposed was suggested to me but I kept avoiding it because it was much pricier than the other items I was trying. I finally gave in and tried it since they have their 30 day guarantee. I&#x27;m so glad I finally gave it a try; I used it for about a week before I started to see results. It is more rigorous that other products I have tried but is totally worth the extra time and money to have clear skin again!! Definitely try this product!</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for about a month now, but it is working great so far. Prior to using this product, I was using another very well-know, very celebrity-endorsed, well advertised acne system for over a year, but I never got the clear skin it promised.  With this other acne system, my skin was also very red, irritated, oily, and I also would get those large, painful, cystic acne pimples.  At 30 years old, I finally became so frustrated that I started looking for yet another product.  I was interested in the Exposed product because it promised use of both &amp;#34;science and nature&amp;#34; -- science to treat the acne and nature to help heal your skin.  Since using this product, I have fewer pimples, my skin is no longer red or oily, and when I do get pimples, they last only a day or two.  My skin just overall has a healthier appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sorry to those reviewers for whom this product has not worked. Acne can be very frustrating, but it is important to know that not every product works for everyone.  Sometimes you have to go through a few before you find one that works for you.  It is also true that your skin can eventually get used to a product and suddenly it no longer works for you.  Sometimes you have to switch around with different products to keep the acne on its toes, so to speak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend this product -- my skin looks better now that it has in a long time.  If this product doesn&#x27;t work for you, don&#x27;t give up and keep looking for the one that will.</li>
            <li> Product works if used properly. The price is a bit steep, which is the downside. Overall a four star rating</li>
            <li> I have tried 10+ different brands of face wash and acne treatment, incl. Neutrogena, Nivea, Clearsil, etc. None of them work nearly as well as Exposed. I don&#x27;t have much acne to begin with, but after using Exposed I have practically none and my skin looks noticeably better. The only two drawbacks to Exposed are (1) you have to apply 3-4 products morning and night, and (2) it is relatively expensive. I still give it a full 5 stars because no other product I have tried to date comes even close to providing the same result.</li>
            <li> This is a miracle product! Simply Amazing!!! I purchased it for a friends daughter and within a week her skin had cleared up dramatically ... I have and will continue to buy this product .</li>
            <li> This product is extremely expensive for the quantify that you get in each bottle and the worst part is that it does not work.</li>
            <li> This product has worked better for my skin than any other acne product I&#x27;ve used. Sadly it still doesn&#x27;t work as well as the company promises. On the up side, it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out like most skin care products and is more natural than previous ones I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> I buy the expanded kit every 3 months or so and I use it almost everyday. Each of the items are very useful and helps getting through the day. Highly recommended. I don&#x27;t use the towel much because its not as smooth as I expected it to be and not long lasting but it&#x27;s free so I&#x27;ll take it!</li>
            <li> Works great! I have struggled all my life with acne proactive helped some but would never get rid of the cysts. Started using exposed have not had any acne cyst. Face is clearing up starting to feel soft.</li>
            <li> I am mostly skeptical about using commercial face treatment products as none of them has actually worked on my face. Thus, back home in Indonesia, I always went to a dermatologist to get prescription. FYI, my face skin is a combination of oily in the inner circle and normal at the outer circle of my face. The most susceptible area of having acne is around the cheek and chin area. Problems occur when I moved to Europe, for the first 3 months, I depended on the supply I brought. However, when the supply was all used, It&#x27;s freakishly expensive to consult to a dermatologist. And I&#x27;ve tried many other commercial products, which all resulted more breakouts. So I found about Exposed, I thought, nothing to lose after all to try. I&#x27;ve been using the products for 3 months, my skin has become brighter, dark spots are slowly disappearing, once or twice pimples occurred but they became healed quickly. I recommended the products to my brother who has similar skin problem. He&#x27;s quite satisfied so far with the results. And with the international delivery services, I don&#x27;t have to worry about running out of supply.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my wife after trying everything else on the planet. She loves it!! It&#x27;s the only thing that works for her.</li>
            <li> Exposed skin care is a scam. First I order online and for the first few days of use the product was ok. But after a while my face became very dry. So I stopped using it and a month later they charged my credit card automatically ! So I want to return it and get my refund but everytime I call the number on the website the automatic machine says the office is closed. When clearly it states M-F from 8 to 4 pm they are open. Clearly that is a lie. Never will I recommend this product</li>
            <li> Exposed Skin Care has to be the best Acne treatment out there. This is truly the secret to getting clear skin. I was breaking out badly until I did some research and seen all the good reviews and decided to give it a try. The best decision I ever made. Along with a healthy diet cutting out the usual, dairy, sugar and flour product consumption helped alot. So if you have tried everything but haven&#x27;t seen the results you wanted, give this system a try. It sure has changed my life. Your skin will thank you.</li>
            <li> I have been dealing with awful cystic acne for the last couple of years (several times worse than anything I had had as a teenager) and nothing has worked on it.  I finally decided to give Exposed a try and I love it.  I have now been using Exposed for almost six months and my acne has done a complete turn-around.  I started out with the Expanded Kit and changed to the Ultimate Kit shortly thereafter.  I like all of the products, especially the moisturizer, the microderm scrub, and the clarifying mask.  I have to use the system exactly as the instructions tell you to, but if I do that I am able to maintain good control over my acne.  I do still get some pimples sometimes, but they are much smaller (and most of the time they are whiteheads instead of the cystic type I used to get) and go away quickly.  The Exposed products don&#x27;t irritate my skin (although, if I don&#x27;t use the moisturizer enough, my skin will get a little dry and I tend to go through the moisturizer faster than the other products), which is great for sensitive skin like mine.  The only reason I gave this product 4 stars is because I do go through the moisturizer quicker (it is probably normal for most people to go through on or more products faster than others) and then I am forced to buy more of it before my next kit comes and it gets expensive.  I am so glad I finally found something that worked for me.  I will never go back to another product again!</li>
            <li> I made the purchase too quickly without making sure that all these glowing reviews were real. I checked each and every reviewer on this product and all except a handful (3-5) reviewers who gave it 5 stars have no other product reviews, or if they do, it&#x27;s only stuff made by Exposed skin care. This seems incredibly suspicious to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Add that to the fact that I have been using this product for over a month now and my skin is the same or worse. It said guaranteed clear skin in one month and that didn&#x27;t work for me so far. I know I shouldn&#x27;t expect overnight miracles but I decided to go back to my old routine, which at least kept my skin manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just very disappointed that this product has so many manufactured 5-star reviews. I think this is a shady business practice at best.</li>
            <li> I am a 24 year old mother that has been dealing with mild regular and cystic acne for a few years now. I can say pretty confidently that my acne is probably hormonal - I never had acne as teen (aside from a few pimples here and there). My flare-up battles with acne started when I first tried the BC pill, which had bad side effects for me, including acne. I continued to struggle with acne, not finding a product that would work and CONTINUE to work on a consistent basis. When I got pregnant with my son, my acne just got worse, and ever since I feel like it&#x27;s been a constant battle - every time one or two pimples/blemishes would clear up, 3 or 4 more would pop up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I researched and researched acne treatments, natural remedies, changed my diet, etc. Nothing really worked for me, I was about to give and try Proactiv (which I&#x27;ve always been pretty skeptical about - it may work for some, but I don&#x27;t know, I just wasn&#x27;t convinced enough to try it, PLUS I had heard horror stories about their customer service). That&#x27;s when I stumbled upon Exposed. I was really hesitant to buy it, considering it was something that I hadn&#x27;t heard a whole lot about in the past, but my husband convinced me to go for it (what did I have to lose, right?). So I ordered it and was anxious (but still skeptical) to receive my first kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be honest and say I noticed improvement in regards to the acne breakouts on my face within the first two weeks, BUT the product caused some severe drying and flaking of my skin for about a week - I was pretty bummed about that. As a disclaimer, I do have very sensitive skin, so this may not be the case for everyone. But as I said, I did notice an improvement, and in the hopes that my skin would get used to the product and stop drying out, I kept using it. My skin did get used to it, the occasional exfoliating helped with any flaking, and my skin stopped drying out. I continued to notice improvement, less and less new pimples, and when I wouldget new ones, they would definitely go away more quickly than before. Exposed is not a miracle product, nothing really is. You have be consistent with it, you have to be willing to make other changes (diet, water, etc.) if need be, and still it may or may not work for you. Not all products work for everyone. This one just so happened to work for me. Now I don&#x27;t have to put on makeup just to take some picture of me and my son, I don&#x27;t have to slather on concealer just to go to make a quick trip to the store. Do I still get the occasional pimple? Yeah (usually around a certain time of month), but it really does clear up almost overnight now. I love this stuff. Granted, I am only on my second kit, so I can&#x27;t vouch for the long-term consistency, but I do know that it is working better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried, and that&#x27;s good enough for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And in regards to the price - it seemed a little much to me at first, but taking into consideration how much I was spending on random stuff I kept trying (that wasn&#x27;t working), not to mention makeup. And knowing how many different products you get that last for two months - the price was worth it for me.</li>
            <li> My 15 year old daughter had tried everything from prescription medication to you just about name it including some of the \\&quot;eating green apples\\&quot; type treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy to say that Exposed Skin worked and is still working for her. Her complexion and feelings about her self have greatly been enhanced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are on the automatic send program and it is,for me, the only way to go as I am sure I would forget to order. I don&#x27;t want her to be without this product for even a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To top it all off, when you call the company you actually get a person to talk to. None of this, press one etc. or \\&quot;we are busy now and will call you back\\&quot; stuff you get from other companies. And, if by some reason they do have to call you back, it has been immediately. The customer service is outstanding and every person I have spoken with has been very helpful and professional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the product and the company.</li>
            <li> I have used other skin care products of this genre but they always dry out my skin pretty quickly.  However, I have not had this problem with Exposed.  I have recommended this kit to others and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my grandson that is in South Korea.  He said that it worked.  Thank you for your concern</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, Exposed did not work for my skin. In fact, it made it worse after using it for two months. It made my skin extremely oily and break out more than normal. I did return the product.</li>
            <li> I never suffered from any severe acne, just an occasional blemish here and there that i was hoping to avoid. I ordered exposed after reading many positive reviews. Within the first few weeks I began to breakout (which I fully expected). I continued to use the product for 4 months. About a month and a half I did begin to see mild improvements. Shortly after my skin took a turn for the worst. I developed cyst like bumps over my entire face. I stopped treatment and canceled future orders. I requested a refund, however when exposed responded they said in order for a refund I would need to send back any UNOPENED, UNUSED product. Since I tried the product first it was obviously opened. After I stopped treatment it took months for my face to back to normal. That being said I do have very sensitive skin, but exposed definitely wasn&#x27;t right for me.</li>
            <li> I am a 21 year old male who has been battling cystic acne for several years.  I have tried numerous products, both over the counter and prescription.  I have even taken antibiotics.  Since a steady regiment of Exposed products I have seen great improvement.  My physician reviewed the product and gave it a thumbs up.  While I still am fighting the acne I am feeling better about myself as I continue to see daily improvement.  Just received more of this product in the mail today.</li>
            <li> I looked at reviews for all acne treatment and found Exposed had the best overall. My daughter uses it and likes it. It&#x27;s nice to have it automatically shipped every month so I don&#x27;t forget. I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> At first it didn&#x27;t seem to be as effective as I thought but after several weeks I started to notice a HUGE difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I am a 40yr old woman tired of teenage acne products. I was looking for something to help my skin fight aging and clear my occasional breakouts. I did not have chronic outbreaks, but always had 1-3 large red ones I had to hide with makeup. I have been using the kit for 60 days now and completely satisfied. My face does not feel dried out and there is no harsh smell from products. My face is clear and I am able to wear blush/bronzer for the first time with no breakout. I wanted to try these products because of the natural ingredients and beneficial age fighting products. The only downfall I see is that since you use the cleanser and toner twice a day, you run out before the products you only use once a day. So I found myself having to purchase additional cleanser and toner before the new kit arrives in 60 days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year, and I love it. After the first two months my skin started looking different. This works!</li>
            <li> Good product. It&#x27;s taken about 4 months to start working but it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 14 year old and he is quite happy with the results so far.  He has had issues with products that cause redness and burning, but has had no issues with the Exposed products.  He is also seeing obvious results in a short period of time.</li>
            <li> With Exposed, less is more; I use very small amounts for it to work. Since my breakouts were so bad in the beginning, I felt as though I needed to use more product, but that actually made things worse. I was about to give up on the product but decided to try using less of it, and that was very effective. A dab will do. The kit is advertised as a month&#x27;s supply, but I have been using this product for a little more than 5 months and have had to reorder the kit once. I started using the cleanser and toner from the new kit about two or three weeks ago, but I am still using the moisturizer and acne and pore serums from the first kit. That should give you some idea of how little of this product I use. As for how I use the products, I follow the directions that are provided with the products and on Exposed the website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began using this product due to a terrible flare-up of acne this summer. My bumps/pimples were painful and large and would leave awful scarring on my face. It took me about three weeks to figure out how to best use this product, but once I did, I began to notice the difference; my breakouts began to greatly improve. Since my acne is mostly due to what I eat (sugar), and I have been &amp;#34;enjoying myself&amp;#34; for the holidays, I am not pimple-free at the moment. However, there are only a few of them, they are very small, and not painful. Exposed has helped to keep them under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cloth that is included has been helpful in cleaning pores and exfoliating my skin, which has caused my terrible dark spots to slowly start fading. I was not expecting to see any improvement with my scars without some other type intervention, so I actually see this as a bonus. In fact, if I remain patient, in a few more months I think there will be enough improvement for me to feel confident enough to drop my concealer from my daily routine.</li>
            <li> The products are very easy to use and work extremely well. Fast and simple shipping of reorder products. Love how I have such sensitive skin and the products aren&#x27;t harsh at all.</li>
            <li> I gave this product four stars because it does what it says it will do without over drying my skin,  The only reason I did not give it five stars is because it is pretty expensive.</li>
            <li> My 14 year old son&#x27;s face was covered with acne....this has worked a miracle....when he starts to run low...he tells me....&amp;#34;I need more of my face stuff!&amp;#34;....that should tell you something.&lt;br /&gt;traci</li>
            <li> I had a bad reaction to this and had to return it. This does not mean it is a bad product. It&#x27;s just that I had a bad reaction.</li>
            <li> I have only been using the exposed treatment for a week.  To give some background on my skin, I get probably 6-7 very big pimples that just do not go away, and as some do, others pop up.  When I am experiencing any sort of break out time with my skin (depends on stress, time of year) this is how it starts, and once it does, I have had a difficult time getting rid of pimples and it seems to get worse once I break out.  I am in my mid 30&#x27;s, so at this point, it&#x27;s beyond frustrating and after research, I decided to give exposed a try.  I had used proactive, but it was never the skin saver for me it promised.  It made my skin very smooth, but only if my skin wasn&#x27;t already broken out.  It didn&#x27;t heal my skin if it was in a bad state, only helped it if I did not have any major breakouts, so not worth the money.  (I still like proactiv&#x27;s face wash to pick and choose.)&lt;br /&gt;I like anything with a money back guarantee, and knowing what it&#x27;s like to battle with bad skin, I would pay money for things that work.  I go to a dermatologist, which in the past has helped, but I have had times where I can not go quickly and this was one of those times.&lt;br /&gt;1 week: After a week, I have to say, my cyst like pimples have really shrunk into small red marks I can cover up with makeup.  I am aware and know from experience that products do not work quickly.  It takes a while before you see improvement, but I am happy to already see improvement in a week.  I never post reviews, ever.  But I value them before I make purchases and I know what it is like to continue worrying about your skin long after the days you are supposed to.  I will post another review in a few weeks for an update, but I am already happy with the product, which has never happened to me before with skincare not received from a doctor.  i did not buy on Amazon.  Go with the website - this way, you have the money back guarantee.  I got the expanded kit with the lotion because my skin gets dry, but I think the basic would work as well.</li>
            <li> My review is not going to focus on the product, but on customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is amazing! And I would highly recommend giving it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However I was not moved nor inspired to write this review because of the product (although it would have been warranted) but because of the customer service I have received from Exposed Skin Care and more specifically from Kelly who works for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a brief overview of what happened. I won&#x27;t go into details.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently switched addresses while using Exposed Skin Care and changed my billing address thinking it was my shipping address.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t know this until I began a dialogue over email with Kelly and she let me know that politely and very professionally. Long story short they reshipped my package to the correct address with very little hassle  and at no extra charge. The entire process took literally 15 minutes (if that)....over email! The email was replied to within 2 minutes. (NO JOKE)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK skip forward to now (3 months later) I had packages stolen from the front of my apartment door ( I found this out through intensive detective work with my local post office and mail man inspired by Kelly&#x27;s advice) one of those packages being the exposed skin care package. OK there was no way I was going to get that package back and if I were customer service I would think that this guy (me) was pulling a scam trying to get free product. I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a couple of questions from Kelly about the circumstances and such she let me know that they were going to ship the new package the next day.....without me EVEN asking for them to do that!! I was going to try and work something out (discount or something) eventually but I ended up not needing to.. I didn&#x27;t even know I was talking to Kelly this second time until I investigated further to realize that she had helped me both times!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I want to just say this about Kelly/ExposedCustomer Service:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She was extremely prompt and quick to reply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She trusted me as a customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(She was with me not against me! (How many times have you fought with customer service?!? I have tons!) She looked at the  problem with me not at me as the problem.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She was not some automated customer service person but someone with personality and a desire to help! It was easy to talk with her and reach a solution!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope Exposed Skin Care sees this and does something special for her, if at the very least an acknowledgement and pat on the back. (But I am sure they will take it a couple steps further, right guys?? ;) )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers to Kelly! You are fantastic at your job and I hope everyone takes you as a model for the best customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(My writing skills aren&#x27;t the best and I know that this small passage will be inadequate to express how happy I am at the moment but I just wanted to make sure Kelly/Exposed Skin Care was acknowledged and thanked)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I encourage you to try this product if you haven&#x27;t already. Thanks Kelly for making me a happy customer! Its a great feeling!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
            <li> Good products.  My son gets on with these and has had good results.  Didn&#x27;t realise we had signed up for monthly deliveries with debits automatically going from our account, these turned out to be rather erratic and too frequent.  Otherwise very pleased and wish I could get them locally.</li>
            <li> Like many been dealing with acne most of my life. Started in my teens and continued to my adult years. Have tried many things out in the market some have worked fairly well some not so much. About 2 months ago was doing research on many brands and products for my acne because what I was using what not working. While doing my research I came across exposed skin care. Liked the fact that it was a combo of natural and science. From what I have tried in the past that combination had always worked well. After 2 months of using these products my acne has been clear and only once in a while get a light breakout which for my acne that&#x27;s normal. Skin feels great healthy and looks 10 times better then when I started. Great products and I would recommended them to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have mild to medium acne. I have been using this skin care line for over 2 weeks now and I haven&#x27;t seen a dramatic difference in my skin yet. I used many acne skin care lines over the years from over the counter to prescription level so in comparison, this line feels gentler on my skin and because of it, I haven&#x27;t broken out more. I don&#x27;t really care for the other products in the line but I really like the Benzoyl Peroxide for spot treatments. This actually works to shrink the inflammation and the pimple.</li>
            <li> Exposed is the first acne treatment system to completely get rid of acne. I love it! This is great stuff!</li>
            <li> I have tried just about every skin care system out there and Exposed was the only one that worked for me.  It clears my skin without drying it out.  It&#x27;s affordable and easy to use!  Love it :)</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;d been using a natural tea tree oil face wash for a long time and I didn&#x27;t really have acne until I was out of my teens. I have blackheads, cystic, and the whiteheads, not a lot of each, but all together they add up and they take FOREVER to go away! I was having more and more breakouts and my family was commenting on my skin a lot so I decided to seek out some kind of acne treatment. On a doctor review site I saw that they recommended this one over proactive and even though I had never heard of it, it seemed like it had a lot of active ingredients that would help and I liked that it used natural things too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I had a cystic breakout before I started using this and after two weeks it has almost gone away totally. I&#x27;ve had a bit more flare ups here and there, but it says it gets worse before it gets better, but overall it seems to be getting better. It is very refreshing, but definitely has a bit of a sting at first, but at least you know it&#x27;s working! The moisterizer helps the sting. I&#x27;m definitely excited to see the results after a couple more weeks. I&#x27;ll post an update after another month or so. With how well it&#x27;s worked so far I&#x27;m definitely optimistic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product can get a little crusty on your face throughout the day, but that might be because I&#x27;m putting to much on. One thing I&#x27;ve also noticed is that when I take a shower with the product on my face that it makes my face really red, irritated, and hot. It might be a reaction with the direct constant hot water. I&#x27;ve figured out that if I rinse my face off in the sink with cold water before I shower that the reaction isn&#x27;t as bad! Even with these little negatives, I think over all the product is really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in my early twenties and was worried this acne would never go away! I already kind of have a baby face and the acne was not helping me look my age at all! I would definitely recommend Exposed to anyone! Keep up with it and you will for sure see good results!</li>
            <li> Yet another disappointment... It kinda works but is no better than any other product I have used yet. May as well stay with the cheaper stuff...</li>
            <li> I tried this kit for 2 months following the instructions carefully. At first it gave me small bumps all over my forehead, not itchy or anything just clogged pores. I figured this was the &amp;#34;gets worse before better&amp;#34; stage. Well that did seem to eventually die down a little, but this did nothing for my hormonal acne on my forehead and chin. This made my skin dull and dry, even using small amounts once a day. The moisturizer was useless for me. The BP died my clothing which is to be expected with BP.&lt;br /&gt;The two biggest negatives:&lt;br /&gt;1) this gave me horrible clogged pores on my chin- not inflamed acne but just clogged and this didn&#x27;t go away until I stopped using this after two months.&lt;br /&gt;2) this made my eyelashes fall out at a much faster rate than normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed with this. Overpriced. Sulfur products work the best for me.</li>
            <li> I used to get sporadic acne that would leave my skin looking less than perfect.  About 8 months ago, I started used Exposed Acne Treatment, it was a miracle.  I had tried every other acne product (Proactive and kits from the local drug store), but nothing worked the way Exposed does.  I haven&#x27;t had a single break out since I started.  Additionally, the products do not smell like medicine and they are extremely gentle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had problems with acne on top of having super sensitive skin.  Hearing good reviews I decided to try a kit and figured, why not.  I have been using this kit for the past 2 months and I would say that my skin has improved.  I do not break out nearly as much and if I do, it is nothing unbearable.  Regardless, not all of my problems have been cured, but this was definitely worth the try.  It was also SUPER nice on my sensitive skin, which has been my biggest issue with other acne kits.  My face wasn&#x27;t peeling or extremely dry so that was a big improvement!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product hoping to have some relief from my acne. After the first night of using it, I woke up the next morning and my face was swollen and red. I went to the doctor and took the product with me so they could ID if this was the problem. The doctor told me the combination of the acid and peroxide was TOO STRONG for most people&#x27;s faces. After discontinuing use, my face has returned to normal after ~30 hours. Please be careful if you buy this product...maybe starting with a doctor&#x27;s opinion first would have saved me from looking like a circus clown.</li>
            <li> its make me more dry and no good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this one 2weeks and throw away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw this product online websit. but i dont like it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my twenties, and have never suffered with acne. Recently however, I developed SEVERE adult acne. I tried Proactive, Clearasil, Clean &amp; Clear and Neutrogena. ALL of these products left my skin in significantly worse condition than it originally was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EXPOSED: I started seeing results in about 4 days. Within a week and a half - I had NO new pimples, and present ones were almost gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By 2 weeks, my face was completely clear, and I was seeing siome improvement in the look of the acne scars. At 3 weeks, I had a flare up - but the overall condition of my skin kept improving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to ANYONE who suffers from any kind of acne - mild/moderate or severe. Plus, they have a money back guarantee - so you really can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my son and he has only been using for a couple of weeks but so far I have only noticed a small amount of change.  I am hoping after using for a little more time we will see better results.  Not giving up yet.</li>
            <li> My daughter used this product as described in the regimen for three weeks. There was zero improvement. I contacted them to get the money back guarantee and received no response.</li>
            <li> I was afflicted with adult acne in my early twenties. I have tried a wide range of acne treatment systems (including the award winning La Roche Pose) and this one is by far the best. I have been using it consistently for about two years now and my skin has never looked better. Use the system as explicitly instructed by the Exposed pamphlet, according to personal needs, in conjunction with improved diet excluding refined grains and sugar, and you should have great success in getting rid of your mild to severe acne. Acne Treatment Serum during the day &amp; Clear Pore Serum at night. Wash with Cleanser and Tonic in the morning, at night, and immediately after each sweat.  I also suggest using sensitive skin type SPF face lotion and SPF eye cream in conjunction with the products as they do not contain ingredients that will protect you from the sun. Your face needs to acclimate to the products so give it time and perhaps up your dosage over time. Monitor your skin and determine what is best for you. Don&#x27;t expect it to solve all your problems overnight. Results may be gradual, but they are amazing.&lt;br /&gt;Stick with it and be consistent in your habit of using it &amp; here may be your solution to a life-long acne problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything from Clean &amp; Clear to Proactive and none of it worked for me. It made my skin either dry and flakey or shiny and tight. After discovering Exposed, I don&#x27;t think I could ever use anything else. It only takes about 3 minutes to do and they offer so many other things to help make your skin perfect. My face and chest have never been so clear. Try it and you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this kit and ill never use another skin care product. This is so gentle on my skin and clears it up fast! And the clarifying mask gets rid of any acne in about a day. I love it !</li>
            <li> Works wonders for my daughters skin.  She was developing fairly significant acne, I researched and found that this product in general had great results.  It took about 3-4 weeks and my daughters face was completely blemish free.  I just reordered so it lasted just over 2 months.</li>
            <li> Product is consistent and if you use it you will see positive results. Speaking from personal experience, I&#x27;ve been using this line for over two years, and it is the cornerstone of my skincare. Customer service is always verry easy to work with.</li>
            <li> This is the best acne system i have EVER USED...hands down!! I have used a ton of OTC products (Neutrogena,etc..). I have even tried Proactive along with other prescribed medications. I have been using this system for about three months now and my skin has never looked so flawless, hydrated, and blemish free. I&#x27;m a 28 y/o woman.</li>
            <li> It works and is gentle on the skin and has a nice smell. One of my favorite products is the exfoliating scrub. I&#x27;m really glad I stumbled  upon Exposed. I wouldn&#x27;t use any other product.</li>
            <li> I am 60 years old and have been fighting menopausal (hormonal related) acne for the last 10 years!!  I&#x27;ve been told by my dermatologists that the only way to control this kind of acne (cysts) is by antibiotics.  I tried those for awhile, but did not want to continually be on antibiotics, which seemed to have their own set of bad side effects (skin darkenening, etc.).  So i reverted to just trying to keep my skin clean and putting topical solutions on blemishes which appeared.  Well, my skin was getting to the point where as soon as I cleared up one pimple, another one popped up.  My skin was never clear!  I was ready to buy ProActiv (the name I seemed to hear most often), until I did a Google search for the best product.  Exposed Acne Treatment come up as a product and when I saw the ingredient list, it seemed to have all of the ingredients necessary to help with my acne.  I bought this product, fully expecting to take advantage of the money back guarantee, because I was skeptical that it would work.  Well, I have to tell you, that since i started using Exposed Skin Treatment in February of this year, I have not had another pimple!!  I know it sounds like it is too good to be true, but this is a real review from a real person!!  I have done nothing else different, except to use their products!  My skin is soft, NOT dry, NOT red - just free of blemishes!  I will continue using this product forever!  I am still using the first products that I bought in January, so the products last 4-5 months.</li>
            <li> I had good succes with this.  My favourites were themoistuerizer and toner.  Overall good reults after first couple of weeks adjusting to bew product.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Has helped with breakouts and even to just maintain clear and healthy skin. Also very reasonable for the price.</li>
            <li> I have tried almost everything you can think of when coming to skin care. One day I kept researching for something better that would be good for my skin and came upon Exposed Skin Care. I decided to give it a shot, I mean what could I loose? And It has worked wonderful for me as well as my brother whom suffers from acne a lot worse. We both absolutely LOVE it. It works great and as long as you stick with it, you will definitely see results. Give it a try, you won&#x27;t regret it! :)</li>
            <li> I started using the facial wash a while before I started to use the body wash. The facial wash worked so great that I decided to give the body wash a try. After just a few days I noticed improvements. And after a while it started to clear up great. I haven&#x27;t been using the body wash that long and it is already way clearer than before! Im sure after using it longer it will continue to clear up even more. So glad i gave it a try, works great!</li>
            <li> I tried exposed acne treatment, and have been very happy with the results..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding products that actually clear my skin without completely drying it up or making it worse before it gets better. Exposed skin care was absolutely perfect for me and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone! I saw improvements right away and my skin feels and looks great!</li>
            <li> I bought a kit to treat frequent breakouts.  I followed the kit instructions and my face was clear in 5 weeks.  I started eliminating the products one-by-one to find out which ones I really need.  It turns out that the only product that actually prevents my breakouts is \\&quot;Step 3\\&quot; - the acne treatment serum with Benzoyl Peroxide.  If I put a very small amount of this on my face preventatively each day, then I never break out at all.  This is not how Exposed recommends using the product, but it is what works for me.  The rest of the products are just expensive and irrelevant.  Their customer service is terrible and the way they set you up to automatically reorder and be charged again should be illegal.  I don&#x27;t like this company at all, but I have to admit that they have at least one product that works.</li>
            <li> I love this product!! Started using explode skin 14 months ago and couldn&#x27;t be happier!! Tried every product under the sun, over the counter and prescription included! This is the only thing that cleared my acne 100%!! I had got to the point of embarrassment and hated ppl seeing me without make up to hide my scars and acne. But about 6wks after I sarted to use exposed skin my face was clear and my confidence returned!! Couldn&#x27;t be happier! I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Love it. really helped my skin!</li>
            <li> OKAY HELLO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I REALLY WANT PEOPLE TO SEE THIS!!&lt;br /&gt;HELLO! READ ME!&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!&lt;br /&gt;I am no Whitman with words, or Fitzgerald or Shakespeare, but if you take the time to read this, you won&#x27;t (hopefully) be sorry.&lt;br /&gt;I am taking a lot of time and thought to write it. So just read it :D&lt;br /&gt;The reason I want people to read this review is because ITS NOT A SCAM!! I was so hesitant buying this product because I know for a fact a lot of the reviews on here are a straight out scam, from people the company hired to give their product high stars. Same thing with Clearzine, which was expensive and did not work for me. THIS WORKS.&lt;br /&gt;Okay, I am an 18 year old white female with semi-dry, flaky, sometimes red skin. I have been struggling with acne since sophomore year when I was about 15/16. I had clear skin before that but then BOOM! Break out city. Lets be clear.. it wasn&#x27;t just break outs. I had a face full of red irritated heaps of acne. IT WAS BAD! I once saw an esthetician  who said my face was at a level 4 out of 5 so it was about moderate/ severe but I felt like it was at the severest of severe. I&#x27;ve been struggling with acne so long and my main motivation was that I DID NOT want acne when I was going to college. It was embarrassing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really became self conscious about my horrible acne because I felt so pretty when I had smooth skin, but when I started to get acne I felt like my skin just LOST all of its beauty. It became a horrible mess that I had to paint with makeup whenever I went to school to cover up my acne, and I always washed it off right when I get home. I HATED having to wear makeup to cover it up. I love makeup but when I put it on with acne it just cooks dry around my scabs and you can see the dark spots underneath along with all the redness that comes along with acne. I felt ugly all day. I know beauty is on the inside too, but its hard to laugh and smile and be happy when you have huge acne.. thatliterally causes pain if you move your skin. I would never wear makeup at home and tried to as least as possible when I went out to stores on weekends or during break. I felt so ugly and like people were staring at my red face, but I thought my skin would clear up, or look a little better if I didn&#x27;t wear makeup for a couple days. or weeks. or months. but it never worked.&lt;br /&gt;EXPOSED SKIN CARE WORKS!! It really does. I have tried so so so so so so so many products, (mostly all over the counter because i&#x27;m too poor to go to the doctor).&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many different of the following&lt;br /&gt;-medicated washes (st.ives scrubs, Neutrogena clear pore, many MANY more, but those 2 were my favs.)&lt;br /&gt;-lotions (with medication &amp; without)&lt;br /&gt;-spot treatments&lt;br /&gt;-vitamins&lt;br /&gt;-Clearzine&lt;br /&gt;-birth control (doesn&#x27;t do anything. tri-cyclen)&lt;br /&gt;-antibiotics from doctor&lt;br /&gt;-no make up&lt;br /&gt;-healthy diets&lt;br /&gt;I have never had anything for the past 4 years work like exposed skin care.&lt;br /&gt;It is a great combination of products that balance and help eachother out to get rid of acne and give you clear skin!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OKAY down to the experience of it.----------------&lt;br /&gt;It comes with 4-5 products depending on if you get the moisturizer or not, which I highly recommend for clear skin.&lt;br /&gt;I used it for the first week and followed the directions every morning and night, strictly.&lt;br /&gt;The first week was horrible :( I didn&#x27;t want to leave my room because my acne broke out super bad, but it was already worse enough. The fact for my experience is that is did get worse for a week before it got better. I was so frustrated. Then after 2 weeks. BAM clear skin. Heaven. Its really working and I feel great and confident that I know its working so much. I FEEL LIKE I FOUND A CURE. I love waking up every morning seeing more and more improvements.&lt;br /&gt;Just warning you that you might want to set aside a week where you don&#x27;t plan on wearing make up and don&#x27;t see people unless you don&#x27;t mind them seeing you, because my acne got flaky and it looked a little irritated. It&#x27;s just not pretty, then week 2 starts and BAM your a total hottie.&lt;br /&gt;The wash is good, cloth I use sometimes its alright. Benzoyl Peroxide acne treatment is heaven after 2 weeks once you adjust because it can get harsh (this is the main acne product I believe). Everything is just good. lets leave it at that.&lt;br /&gt;Get the product.&lt;br /&gt;It was the only thing that worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if anyone has taken the time to read my annoying novel, but I want people to have the same confidence that clear skin gives you.</li>
            <li> My son started using this and his skin was clear in days. This is a product that actually WORKS!!</li>
            <li> Never was great 5 stars</li>
            <li> I use to have many problems with my skin and acne. In fact , I tried a lot of product such as the famous proactiv but that did not working for me. And one day while I was browsing on Internet about some good product for skin , i found Exposed Skin Care , I bought the skit since 4-5month now and Im still using because it made a change . I appreciated that</li>
            <li> I used all other products and they had the same thing; works the first 3 weeks then back to misery. Out of all the products this is the most consistent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product overall, but it really depends on the person. For me it took a good two months or so before it really started to work. The only complaints I have is that it took a while for it to work and I needed to use products that weren&#x27;t in the kit like the clarifying mask and probiotic (I got them for free though). It is a pretty pricy but there are usually coupons and deals going on and it does actually work, and how long depends on the person. My skin is pretty clear now except for the occasional outbreak and some fading scars so if your thinking about I say give it a try it&#x27;ll most likely work for you.</li>
            <li> Helps prevents breakouts and promotes smooth skin.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t finished using the whole kit yet but so far the only thing I&#x27;ve noticed is it makes my skin dry. I haven&#x27;t noticed any rashes or red spots that other reviewers have talked about. I&#x27;ve noticed a bit of improvement with my acne but it hasn&#x27;t completely cleared up yet.</li>
            <li> I had good success using Exposed Skincare Products. Overall, results were clear after the first few of weeks of using their products and continued with further use.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if this face acne medicine was going to work or not. I started using this medicine on December 27th, 2013. I used the Facial Cleanser every morning when I first woke up and every night before bed (on my face, neck, shoulders &amp; chest), and then I used the Clearing Tonic and would let it air dry off my face &amp; body. At night before bed I would use the Facial Cleasner and then I would use the Clearing Tonic and waited for it to dry before i would put on the Clearing Pore Serum and leave it on my face over night. It took several weeks before I started to notice a little difference. (I had horrific acne and pimples all over my face, cheeks, nose, chin, forehead, hairline, jawline, neck, on the back of my neck, behind my ears, on my chest, on my shoulders, behind my shoulders and on my upper back--basically EVERYWHERE. It was so bad that not even a pound of make up could cover it up!) Then around week 12 (middle of March) is when almost 80% of my acne and pimples were gone! I then went back and read all the directions and tips that Exposed Skin Care Company suggested. I then decided to start using the Acne Treatment Serum every morning (after using the Facial Cleanser &amp; Clearing Tonic). I started putting a thin layer of the Acne Treatment Serum all over my face, jawline, chest and shoulder area. During this time I stopped using the Clearing Tonic because I felt it was drying my face out. After I put on the thin layer of Acne Treatment Serum and I let it air dry for a few minutes...I then go ahead and put my make up on and my face foundation on. (If you put a thin layer of the Acne Treatment Serum on it will dry clear-so it looks like nothing is on your face). Around week 18-20 (beginning of May) is when ALL of my acne and pimples on my face, neck, shoulders and chest disappeared!!! Today is August 5th and it has been 32 weeks (7 months) since I first started using Exposed Skin Care medicine. All the acne and pimples on my face, cheeks, nose, chin, forehead, hairline, jawline, neck, back of my neck, behind my ears, chest, shoulders, behind my shoulders and on my back....ALL areas where I had acne &amp; pimples are ALL cleared up and gone! Since May I have had only a few pimples-about 4 (only one at a time when I do get one) and today is August. So in 3 months I have only had about 4 pimples. (One pimple was my fault because I fell asleep with my make up and I never washed my face the one night.)&lt;br /&gt;*TIPS*&lt;br /&gt;-DO NOT NOT NOT PICK YOUR FACE. DO NOT NOT NOT KEEP POPPING, SQUEEZING &amp; TOUCHING YOUR FACE.&lt;br /&gt;-When washing your face GENTLY use your bare hands while using cool/warm water.&lt;br /&gt;-Use a clean cotton fabric to GENTLY PAT dry your face. (Try washing your pillowcases &amp; wash cloths with fragrance free laundry soap)&lt;br /&gt;-Clean pillowcase every other night.&lt;br /&gt;-Pull back hair from face at night while sleeping.&lt;br /&gt;-Be consistent EVERYDAY with the facial treatment plan.&lt;br /&gt;-Drink plenty of water. (Half of your body weight in ounces is what a person should be drinking each and everyday. Example: 150 pound person should drink 75 ounces each day. 150 divide by 2 &#x3D; 75 ounces each day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***OVERALL REVIEW***&lt;br /&gt;I am VERY pleased with this treatment medicine that Exposed Skin Care has created. I definitely would recommend this treatment plan to anyone who is struggling with acne and/or pimples anywhere on the face and body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***My Daily Routine***&lt;br /&gt;Morning Routine (within one hour of waking up):&lt;br /&gt;Step 1: Facial Cleanser&lt;br /&gt;Step 2: Acne Treatment Serum (Thin layer)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Night time Routine (within 2 hours before bed):&lt;br /&gt;***If I am wearing make up that day I wash my make up off using Cetaphil Gentle Cleansing Antibacterial Bar Soap.***&lt;br /&gt;Step 1: Facial Cleanser&lt;br /&gt;Step 2: Clearing Pore Serum (Thin layer)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****Be Consistent &amp; Take Care****</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since 2010 and absolutely love it. I  have tried everything from Accutane to Pro-active and nothing seemed to work. Since I have used this product, I have not had any major breakouts. It is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> It has been a little bit over a month and it has done nothing! I think it has made my skin worse! Although that&#x27;s what they said would happen... I hope it starts working soon!</li>
            <li> Its very good i tried so many products and its the best</li>
            <li> For the most part, this product deserves the praise it&#x27;s getting. For some reason when I hit 22 I broke out with a ton of white and black heads and nothing worked to clear my usually good skin. After quite a bit of research, I kept coming back to Exposed and finally ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product ships incredibly fast and comes with detailed instructions on what to use and when, which really helps. If you follow directions and use it twice per day, you see results pretty much overnight. It&#x27;s powerful stuff. I have largers nose pores, have mostly black heads all over my nose and get white heads on my cheeks and chin- I am starting to see a very visible change in just a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things to note:&lt;br /&gt;1. Try and order at least the expanded kit because the cleanser, tonic, acne serum, pore clearing serum and moisturizer are all things you really do need.&lt;br /&gt;2. Apply the moisturizer 3-5 minutes after you use everything else.&lt;br /&gt;3. A little of this stuff goes a long way! Because they are smaller bottles, make it last and only use a little bit at a time. Everything goes on really easily and lathers well.&lt;br /&gt;4. The one thing that sucks is that for the price, the bottles are very small. The stuff works, but you probably need to buy this every 4-6 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure what will happen to my skin if I run out and don&#x27;t buy more, which is a bummer, but for now I am hooked. It&#x27;s good stuff.</li>
            <li> for as far as i can tell, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be disappointed&lt;br /&gt;I found this product after a review I read on FacingAcne.com, and I researched this quite a bit before purchasing today&lt;br /&gt;I am looking to clarify some of the statements going on about the possibility of this being a scam.&lt;br /&gt;What seems to be one of the top concerns is the automatic charge for you to get another set- this means you probably signed up for a membership to get the discount if you got the product straight off their site. When you read through your emails, it says the following&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;#34;Club Exposed Membership details: If you ordered a product including a free membership in Club Exposed, you will receive the following benefits:&lt;br /&gt;  1. Automatic re-delivery of a new Exposed Acne Kit every 60 days, so you are never without clear skin. (Shipping times can be adjusted to fit your schedule)&lt;br /&gt;  2. Special Member Rates: With a membership you&#x27;ll lock in our special Member Rate and save $10 on every kit...&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;It is true that this is not clearly stated with the membership upfront, however it really should be the responsibility of the consumer to see what they are signing up for. I suppose that is more of a scheme of tactics significantly over scam knowing that consumers and people in general only read what they want to read while skimming over the words in emails and websites. The thing that made me skeptical about this site before is that I couldn&#x27;t have made the transfer using PayPal, however seeing that Google verification was available (which I personally trust with loyalty, if you don&#x27;t feel comfortable about the lack of security other than Google, that is completely fine) I do have the intention of cancelling my account after I receive my first order and if I like it, sign back up.&lt;br /&gt;^^^It is important to note that not many people notice this, the membership notice is also noted on the bottom of their site^^^&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you go through the site, if you look at the products individually, you have the access to see the list of ingredients for the specific product, so you may check to see if ANY of them include anything you may be allergic to and/or anything that might might effect you otherwise- I love the fact it lists all of the ingredients rather than the key ingredients or the ones that would make consumers think that they are special. There are going to be cases where this product simply wont work for them, and that is completely fine. It may either have to do with their complexion or irritants or maybe perhaps something else. One thing that throws me off about this product is that they recommend to wash your face way too often in my opinion- for some skin types twice a day is fine but it is NOT for everyone. I may test each product to see how strong and well they work before I decide upon the frequency of applying the product. I might only limit the washing to once a day before going to twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another concern is the horrible customer service and honestly how many companies can you think of that has never gotten a comment on bad customer service? Probably zero, and if anything more, it is probably too good to be true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In regards to the membership itself, I am coming to the conclusion that you may need to call customer service to change the time between automatic delivery (by default 60 days).&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;#34;How often do you ship member orders?&lt;br /&gt;  A: It&#x27;s completely up to you. The default is 60 days but we can adjust that period to best fit your individual needs.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;To me it seems like a kind of thing you should be able to take care of online, but I couldn&#x27;t find how. I personally would like to avoid speaking to others over a phone whenever I can, since I have the worst time speaking to other people, especially in the case of an official transaction in need of a conversation (which does not exclude ordering pizza and/or talking to officers to report a problem) so a downside (which would have been minus 1/2 star if possible) effected me out of personal preference rather than the product itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will post another review if not completely update this one once my skin care arrives, but before I did the research to inform myself, I was skeptical due to the numerous amount of negative comments, and you should be able to make your own informed decisions about what you are buying.&lt;br /&gt;It is not likely that this site is trying any tricks on their customers. If so, this is an INCREDIBLY elaborate one that they haven&#x27;t already been legally charged for yet...</li>
            <li> so far working well, makes my face really dry so i alternate every other day with the serums..</li>
            <li> My skin isn&#x27;t completely covered in acne, but I get frequent break outs, including those deep, painful ones. I was diligent about my skincare a few months ago because I was tired of being in my mid-twenties with the skin of a teenager. I tried Proactiv in the past, but I was left with skin that was red, flaky, irritated, and STILL breaking out. Not exactly a great combination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first tried this product, I was slightly skeptical because everything else on the market seems to operate under the assumption that it has to be harsh to work. Thankfully Exposed made an effective acne product that doesn&#x27;t leave me red and flaky, even after a few months of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The way my daily regiment usually shapes up is this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Morning: Exposed Facial Cleanser and the Exposed Microderm Scrub and as well as two capsules of  [[ASIN:B004LJ0ZK6 ClearZine (2 Bottles) - The Top Rated Acne Treatment Pill. Eliminates Blotchiness, Redness, Blackheads and Zits]] which helps stop breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;Night: Exposed Facial Cleanser to start, then the clearing tonic (so it can work it&#x27;s magic at night) as well as two more capsules of the Clearzine.&lt;br /&gt;So far after only two weeks my skin has completely cleared up as well as the blotchiness is now gone.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, but I hope this was helpful and it works. Good luck!</li>
            <li> This is a good product and I don&#x27;t regularly use acne products. My family uses it every day and I can definetly tell the difference.</li>
            <li> My son had tried many products, but he often abandoned them when he didn&#x27;t see results in a reasonable period of time.  I was skeptical about purchasing this kit, as it seemed as though there were too many steps to follow, and the products would end up in the trash.  He committed to their regular, consistent use, and he is sold!  The products have been very effective in the cystic acne he had been experiencing.  He tried, then disbanded use of the moisturizer, with better results no using the moisturizer.  The investment was worth it, and he continues to use the products more than one year after first trying them.  We would highly recommend this line of products!</li>
            <li> I love this system. Cleared all my breakouts and now I barely even get a pimple. Highly reccomend.</li>
            <li> Their products have really helped me.  They are not too harsh and really work.  Finally at 55, my face looks good enough where I don&#x27;t  have to where make up to cover up the acne.  The moisterizer is great, not heavy or greasy.  The mask does not dry out your skin.  These products are a must try for anyone struggling with acne.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. After trying many over the counter and perscription products this finally worked!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE exposed acne treatment! My skin has cleared up significantly and when I do breakout, it goes away much faster then before. I am traveling abroad soon and was excited to see they have a travel size kit as well. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works, for the longest I used so many different products until I started with Exposed! I now have clear skin that feels and looks great!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 8 years and love it.. works great!!!</li>
            <li> My daughter started using this over a year ago and will not use anything else.  She follows the proram closely and her skin has never looked better.  I would recommend trying it!</li>
            <li> My son had tried all kinds of acne treatments - Acne Free, Clearasil, Neutrogena, etc. - but the results were disappointing.  I had heard of ProActive and researched it.  Majority of reviews I read said it worked at first but then either acne returned or skin became red, flaky and sensitive.  So I tried the Exposed Acne Treatment.  It works!!  My son&#x27;s acne has cleared up and his skin is not red or flaky.  It looks smooth and fresh.  In the past, he would use something and then be ho hum about it.  But now he checks to make sure the new kit is coming before he runs out of the current.  They have a money-back guarantee so it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything, but then i finally found a product that cleared my acne. I saw the difference after the first week.</li>
            <li> This is a really great product. I have always had acne and could never find anything that got rid of it. Then I found this product and within a month my face was already looking better. Although sometimes it gets worse before it gets better it goes away after a few months.</li>
            <li> Whats works real well for me is zinc pills for acne and green tea tree oil bodywash best cleaner there is</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 38 year old male who has had acne of varying severity since my teens. Everyone says this but I felt like tried everything. I switched from high end products to more natural treatments like honey, lemon, even clay.  It seemed like this only got worse at that point. Exposed Skin was basically just my newest, latest product. I ordered the expanded kit and saw a difference almost immediately. After having at least 6-7 deep pimples consistently, my skin was basically clear in a week.  I waited another 4 weeks before writing a review. This kit has done so well for me that this is the first review I&#x27;ve ever written.  About a month into it and I&#x27;ve had 2 small pimples, both of which cleared quickly.  I feel for those who didn&#x27;t get results with this and I hope that mine continue. As of now, I can&#x27;t recommend a product more.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything possible to clear my acne.  This product works wonders. It is gental on your skin and does not over dry like \\&quot;Proactive\\&quot;  I can finally not be ashamed of walking around without make up.  I have been using this product for about 8 months and I recommend it all the time. IT WORKS!</li>
            <li> This is a great set for someone who keeps up with their skin care. I&#x27;ve tried every combination and this seems to keep my skin consistent. I love that it has soothing elements and only very little harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried neutrogena, I&#x27;ve tried proactiv, I&#x27;ve tried at home remedies and just when I&#x27;d had enough with my acne prone skin and was about to give up; I came across exposed online. Naturally I was skeptical, even after reading the amazing reviews because they all have great reviews. Turns out that this time they were true! My skin hasn&#x27;t been this great in years! It&#x27;s smoother, my pores are smaller, no more black heads on my cheeks or chin and I haven&#x27;t had a break out in over a month, which is a huge milestone for me! Bottom line... IT WORKS! Worth every penny... you won&#x27;t regret it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. they offer the best customer service you&#x27;ll ever experience! It was so refreshing, surprising even, after my wars with proactiv.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews for items I purchase but I know how hard it is to find skincare that actually works.... so here I am.&lt;br /&gt;I started using this kit about 6-7 weeks ago and absolutely love it. I don&#x27;t suffer from severe acne but have been getting small breakouts consistently for the past 6 months, I also had red scars from these breakouts. The first 2 weeks of use were worrying because I broke out pretty badly on my cheeks (where I usually never breakout). I then learned that the initial breakouts are caused from the treatment clearing the pores from the inside out and bringing everything to the surface. After the second week my skin began to clear and the scars started to fade. By the fourth week my skin was completely clear and the scars continued to fade.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m currently finishing my first kit and my skin remains completely clear and the scars are almost completely gone.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product. I also recommend using a moisturizer in conjunction with it due to the salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide drying out the skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally leave feedback for a product,  but since this product really is working for my adult acne, it&#x27;s worth a write up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Expect a week of break out while using this product, then after that, you will see a big difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used a lot of product so far, from Obagi, Murad, Kiehls, Tea Tree etc, but so far this is the best acne treatment I had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And when you use this product, make sure you have a regular facial to clean your face since what this product does is to clear all the black heads and white heads.  Once your face is clean, then the product prevents the new break outs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps.</li>
    </ol>
