            <li>I love these!</li>

            <li>Nice</li>

            <li>Pretty Nice Quality and Very Cute</li>
            <li>Quality looks a lot better in picture, but still excited to use them to add some favor!</li>
            <li>Easy to grab with tweezers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ll use most of them.</li>
            <li>Also you will need nail glue to secure these, and it does not come with it.</li>
            <li>Overall great value for the purchase.</li>
            <li>received prior to the date listed great product</li>
            <li>They look nice for the price and if you&#x27;re into doing your own nails you&#x27;ll save big by choosing these over going to the salon</li>
            <li>these little gems are great.my grandaughters do their own nails and love them.they can create their own designs</li>
            <li>These are so cuuute and so worth the wait!</li>
            <li>This is a good product however when i recieved it all the studs were disorganized, mixed together</li>
            <li>yes the tray is full and the colors are perfect..just like the picture.</li>
            <li>I like the simple look and these are quite cute ,and sophisticated.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>Exactly as described!</li>
            <li>Totally worth what I paid and</li>
            <li>so i can get the right studs.</li>
            <li>These little charms are really cute &amp; fit really well on the nail I really love them.</li>
            <li>Packaged in cute little case as well. :) .</li>
            <li>Shipping took a little long but great price and love these for my nails</li>
            <li>This is my first time buying stud nail deco</li>
            <li>It looks pretty n makes your nail stand out.</li>
            <li>I will go for better quiality next time</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get EXACTLY what is shown in the picture though.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t mind the size all that much either!</li>
            <li>They were exactly what I was looking for, and they are just as described in the pictures.</li>
            <li>they are pretty like picture of stubs, but amount is incorrect.</li>
            <li>love all the different shapes and sizes.</li>
            <li>They stick well with a top coat but would probably last longer with nail glue.</li>
            <li>Good quality too except after a few days of wearing them on your nails the gold will fade off and they&#x27;ll turn silverish.</li>
            <li>it has a secure little case and the top swivels around</li>
            <li>Better quality than I expected  and even though it said it would take over a month to receive</li>
            <li>you really should offer the nail glue with this item</li>
            <li>Love these little accents.</li>
            <li>The shapes were mixed in mine because the lid didn&#x27;t fit well on the storage wheel, allowing the shapes to slide around into different compartments.  </li>
            <li>The case is exactly like the picture also, and it very tiny.</li>
            <li>Very little and cheap bendable product</li>
            <li>It came a week and half early which was a nice surprise, and they apply with regular topcoat or clear polish, I just put a dot of topcoat where I want the bead to go place the bead down and position it with the back of my tweezers and seal over with topcoat</li>
            <li>they were for my daughter and the big hug that I got was thanks enough for me.</li>
            <li>came pretty fast, 2 and a half weeks!!</li>
            <li>and I only used clear nail polish I had for putting it on.</li>
            <li>A tad bit bigger than other jewels but still small enough  to fit multiple on nail.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> A tad bit bigger than other jewels but still small enough  to fit multiple on nail.</li>
            <li> I thought this is a gem type of thing that the bottom is flat</li>
            <li> The stones dont lay flat on the nail... wouldnt rebuy</li>
            <li> I do have to say that the wheel is REALLY tiny; waaay smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> I had received this earlier than expected, so that was a big plus!</li>
            <li> The case was way smaller than I expected</li>
            <li> They came earlier then expected too.</li>
            <li> Took a long time to get here</li>
            <li> Some gems repeat but in different colors they are silver, gold and one section of black gems.</li>
            <li> only thing is there was a little  inconsistency.</li>
            <li> I received these 2 weeks before the expected delivery date.</li>
            <li> Which makes it harder to place them on the fingers.</li>
            <li> exacly as I expected.</li>
            <li> Faster shipping than expected, but not very many of each thing in the little case as shown in sale picture.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s less than half the size of my iPhone 6.</li>
            <li> Half the size of iPhone 5.</li>
            <li> a spill ever happens you won&#x27;t have hundreds of little beads all over the place.</li>
            <li> nothing will go to waste</li>
            <li> Like, instead of the silver rectangles and gold squares, I got silver teardrops and small silver circles.</li>
            <li> Small wheel.  </li>
            <li> I should have ordered these sooner than a few weeks ago!</li>
            <li> but it really makes it annoying to use.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m waiting on my fake nails</li>
            <li> for fake nail save your stinkin money bro</li>

    <ol>
            <li> The case was way smaller than I expected and it took forever to be delivered but they are very nice and just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> This is my first time buying stud nail deco and I love it. It looks pretty n makes your nail stand out. They stayed on my toe nails for about two weeks and I only used clear nail polish I had for putting it on.</li>
            <li> Love these gems! Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> This is a very good product at a great price, it comes exactly like the picture it has a secure little case and the top swivels around so you don&#x27;t ever take the top off which is good just in case a spill ever happens you won&#x27;t have hundreds of little beads all over the place.

            <li> they were for my daughter and the big hug that I got was thanks enough for me.</li>
            <li> Extremely satisfied! I received these 2 weeks before the expected delivery date. They are very full and all organized nicely. I haven&#x27;t used them yet tho, I&#x27;m waiting on my fake nails so I can put them in use. :)</li>
            <li> I thought this is a gem type of thing that the bottom is flat but it&#x27;s not. Which makes it harder to place them on the fingers. You only have the outer edge to put a glue/polish on. I guess you get what you pay for. I will go for better quiality next time</li>
            <li> Very little and cheap bendable product</li>
            <li> I CANT WAIT TO TRY THEM OUT. THEY CAME IN A NICE SECURE PACKAGE.</li>
            <li> These are so cuuute and so worth the wait! I didn&#x27;t get EXACTLY what is shown in the picture though. Like, instead of the silver rectangles and gold squares, I got silver teardrops and small silver circles. I don&#x27;t mind at all though!! I do have to say that the wheel is REALLY tiny; waaay smaller than expected. It&#x27;s less than half the size of my iPhone 6. I will be buying again so I don&#x27;t mind the size all that much either!</li>
            <li> This is a good product however when i recieved it all the studs were disorganized, mixed together and it was a pain in the neck to fix so i can get the right studs. But i was still happy with it and i got a ton of compliments on my nails.</li>
            <li> A nice set of metal looking nail embellishments. Better quality than I expected  and even though it said it would take over a month to receive I got it in two weeks. Very glad I purchased these instead of paying triple the money at the beauty supply.</li>
            <li> These are great, and I already tried them out on one nail just to see how I like them. They were exactly what I was looking for, and they are just as described in the pictures. The case is exactly like the picture also, and it very tiny. Also you will need nail glue to secure these, and it does not come with it. Overall great value for the purchase.</li>
            <li> these little gems are great.my grandaughters do their own nails and love them.they can create their own designs</li>
            <li> Perfect sizes and assorted shapes. Good quality too except after a few days of wearing them on your nails the gold will fade off and they&#x27;ll turn silverish.</li>
            <li> A tad bit bigger than other jewels but still small enough  to fit multiple on nail. Easy to grab with tweezers.</li>
            <li> Great assortment. These are actually perfect size to enhance my handmade cards.</li>
            <li> Totally worth what I paid and then some! I think I&#x27;m going to order another 3 for when I run out of these!</li>
            <li> They were easy-to-use and I love the way they make my nails pop.</li>
            <li> received prior to the date listed great product</li>
            <li> I had received this earlier than expected, so that was a big plus! The gems are cute. Some gems repeat but in different colors they are silver, gold and one section of black gems. However, I didn&#x27;t receive any hearts which was upsetting because that is what I thought I would be getting and was what I wanted. I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ll use most of them.</li>
            <li> Nice selection of shapes and sizes, but docked a star because the wheel isn&#x27;t well made and some of the shapes looked worn/dull instead of shiny.  The shapes were mixed in mine because the lid didn&#x27;t fit well on the storage wheel, allowing the shapes to slide around into different compartments.  I know this doesn&#x27;t affect the quality of the studs but it really makes it annoying to use.</li>
            <li> Item was delivered on time. they are pretty like picture of stubs, but amount is incorrect. Small wheel.  Half the size of iPhone 5. About 6 different stud designs, silver and gold color. Nice but i don&#x27;t know if I will re purchase. I though it had a heart shape stub but I didn&#x27;t receive that. It had circles, triangles, rectangles, tear drop, diamond, and star.</li>
            <li> The stones dont lay flat on the nail... wouldnt rebuy</li>
            <li> cant wait to use these on my nails</li>
            <li> Faster shipping than expected, but not very many of each thing in the little case as shown in sale picture.</li>
            <li> for fake nail save your stinkin money bro</li>

            <li> Nice! Lots of different shapes. Love em!</li>
            <li> Adds the perfect touch to any manicure/pedicure. Love these little accents.</li>

            <li> Beautiful! Just like the picture! I can&#x27;t wait to try them! Great price too! Yes I would recommend to a friend!</li>
            <li> Very cute and not too over the top. I like the simple look and these are quite cute ,and sophisticated. They came earlier then expected too. Packaged in cute little case as well. :) .</li>
            <li> I love the way they lay on my nail and the size is perfect. The quality is awesome and they do not look cheap</li>
            <li> These little charms are really cute &amp; fit really well on the nail I really love them.</li>
            <li> you really should offer the nail glue with this item</li>
            <li> Quality looks a lot better in picture, but still excited to use them to add some favor!</li>
            <li> Took a long time to get here thats my only issue, the rest is awesome</li>
            <li> came pretty fast, 2 and a half weeks!! yes the tray is full and the colors are perfect..just like the picture. only thing is there was a little  inconsistency. i got no hearts and no squares instead i got ovals and and all circles are the same size. also i got duplicates just in a different color. but for the price im happy with what i have. nothing will go to waste</li>
            <li> I take this with me to the nail shop my hands look very good people always looking at my hands ask me who do that.</li>
            <li> They make your nails look gorgeous</li>
            <li> Took forever to get here, but they are cute and can create nice manicures!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described!</li>
            <li> Pretty Nice Quality and Very Cute</li>
            <li> I should have ordered these sooner than a few weeks ago! I love these!</li>
