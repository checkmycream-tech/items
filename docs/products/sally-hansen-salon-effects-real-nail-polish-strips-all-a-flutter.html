            <li>these are my favorite strips!  </li>
            <li>lasted me more than two weeks!</li>
            <li>Incoco&#x27;s designs are beautiful and more appropriate for women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIPS</li>
            <li>end product looks nice, but some places are curling in areas</li>
            <li>I liked the butterfly design</li>
            <li>Kind of washed out in colours</li>
            <li>I really liked these nails.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did apply a good top coat (OPI)</li>
            <li>I love this product and I love decorating my fingers and toes with these!</li>
            <li>I tried the incoco nails polish strips before trying this one and I liked the ncoc better because they are not so flimsy.</li>
            <li>Wish I could afford some of the more popular patterns</li>
            <li>sure the room is WARM.  </li>
            <li>If they were cheaper I would probably buy them more often.</li>
            <li>They are ultra cute</li>
            <li>but I do use the Sally Hansen Gel Polish top coat over it and cure it with the mini UV.</li>
            <li>I love about these nails, though, is that they&#x27;re so convenient.</li>
            <li>They do have lots of different designs, maybe this one wasn&#x27;t the best!</li>
            <li>I have purchased these at Target and they are fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I love using the Salon effects.  </li>
            <li>I love using them</li>
            <li>I love the patterns</li>
            <li>Script these are way better than some of the after market/non-name brand</li>
            <li>Most of Sally Hansen&#x27;s patterns are targeted at teens.  </li>
            <li>they are VERY easy to apply and go on quick!</li>
            <li>and they are SO super cute!</li>
            <li>These salon effects are perfect for a quick manicure and pedicure, very simple and easy to do and they work great for anyone who wants to do their nails for any event.</li>
            <li>I learned how to smooth the edges better so no chips.  </li>
            <li>agree with most that the pricing is rather high, so it is nice to be able to get some at a lower price.</li>
            <li>These are probably defective and that&#x27;s why the are so cheap.  </li>
            <li>The not only look great</li>
            <li>/&gt;*Sally Hansen&#x27;s strips are often available on Prime</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick, easy and takes about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Makes it sooo worth it!</li>
            <li>They last well over a week, are easy to apply, easy to get off with nail polish remover, and come in so many cool designs!  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did because thanks to her advise</li>
            <li>This particular pattern and coloration would look better with added rhinestones, I tried a bit of line painting on the bodies but that didn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li>These give such a GREAT look, they last for two or more weeks (longer but as your nails grow out you can see the line)</li>
            <li>They are super easy to use and cheaper even than at Walmart and MUCH cheaper than going to the salon.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, cute, and they last forever plus zero drying time.</li>
            <li>All in all great way to spend a few bucks and save a lot of time!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did put a clear coat on top of it</li>
            <li>All in all I don&#x27;t think these are worth the $9.</li>
            <li>This look was okay  not really for me if you really love butterflies ..</li>
            <li>They take a bit of time to apply (about an hour) but once they are on, I top them with a clear coat</li>
            <li>I wore them on the beach, in and out of the ocean, for 10 days and they looked freshly applied.</li>
            <li>a clear top coat within 24</li>
            <li>You have to put them on right for it to work...</li>
            <li>sure to smooth the tips well - any rough edges will \\&quot;catch\\&quot; on fabric and chip&lt;</li>
            <li>Gave to my Son&#x27;s wife as a little gift and she loved them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are really pretty and super easy to but on but once you open the package, they don&#x27;t stick anymore.</li>
            <li>Fast service and quality product!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Honestly, the first trial didn&#x27;t go well.  </li>
            <li>second trial was much better-</li>
            <li>a second top coat after 3 or 4 days.</li>
            <li>I would give them a higher rating if they had a few more sizes available.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty much just sticking to KISS.</li>
            <li>They last for days and come off easy with nail polish remover.  </li>
            <li>great product, as expected, high quality, last for days, will do business again!</li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B007P0IS3O Opi Pure Lacquer Nail Apps Peacock]]</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think it helps much.</li>
            <li>I got this and it smelled straight up like acetone nail polish (which I didn&#x27;t really have a problem with).</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a straight edge</li>
            <li>Then you peel off the top clear coat and then the back coat and apply it to your finger.</li>
            <li>It lasts really well that way giving a full 10 days before it starts to wear and I constantly rub my nails (nervous habit).</li>
            <li>I thought white nails would be cool</li>
            <li>but when I put them on I was not sure if I liked it.</li>
            <li>I love that I can get them here on amazon.com for a lot less than what you would pay at the store.</li>
            <li>These are easy to apply and they actually last for about 8 days before chipping I find they last a little longer if you add a clear top coat after the first day you apply them.</li>
            <li>and a couple other places I could easily peel off because it is curling up a bit.</li>
            <li>I tried this because I rarely have time to do my nails and when I do, I inevitable smudge or imprint them.</li>
            <li>When you apply nail polish you generally have very smooth or even beveled edges due to the mode of application, with these</li>
            <li>: many of my friends have a hard time taking the strips off with nail polish remover including me,but my sister in law told me to buy pure acetone</li>
            <li>The only drawback which I&#x27;m ok with is that they are super hard to take off...</li>
            <li>you have the polish in place, smooth it down well with your fingers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am pretty plain on my fingers and will likely use this on my toes next time, but overall nice product.  </li>
            <li>All the strips are pretty long</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a BIT cheaper and last so much longer.</li>
            <li>Last about 10 days without much peeling or chipping.  </li>
            <li>All pastel Butterflies.&lt;br /&gt;The look completely natural and stay on about 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;She</li>
            <li>If you do it right, you have enough enough strips to do 10 fingers and 10 toes!!</li>
            <li>I bought these based on the reviews and I had very low expectations, I think because what works for most people&#x27;s nails usually doesn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since toenails are smaller just cut your remaining strips to fit ur toes and cut the, in half.</li>
            <li>My only problem that I encountered with application is using the orange wood stick to smooth it down, I have one or two nails that did get very small divots in the edge due to this, but the kind of which only I know they are there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not very pretty in real life.</li>
            <li>They only complaint which is a mild one is that this particular pattern was extremely light and hard to see.</li>
            <li>I bet it would last longer if I used the clear gel as a bottom coat, too...</li>
            <li>The sparkle ones are kinda hard to remove later on but last longer than the other kind.</li>
            <li>I love these and they can easily last for 7-10 on short nails little less for longer nails.</li>
            <li>This is a real springy pattern, not exactly right for this time of year,</li>
            <li>I would put to much on one side and not enough to cover the nail on the other side.</li>

            <li> They didn&#x27;t last as long as my KISS nails last.</li>
            <li> but I guess that&#x27;s why they last so long.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the second set can dry out and not work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but after careful examination I realized this was only an optical illusion.</li>

            <li> Great price and they are SO super cute! I love this product and I love decorating my fingers and toes with these!</li>
            <li> The butterflies in these nail polish strips are very subtle. You almost don&#x27;t see them unless you are up close. It just look like you have silver fingernail polish on from a far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Putting on the strips is a bit getting use to. You have 8 strips for each hand and you pick which ones will work best for which finger. Then you peel off the top clear coat and then the back coat and apply it to your finger. With each strip you have the option of which side to place up against the cuticle, one side is bigger than the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply them was a bit difficult for me. I would put to much on one side and not enough to cover the nail on the other side. But I got the hang of it. You really have to press down hard around the cuticles. I am finding mine are raising up around the cuticles which ends up snagging on things and peeling. All the strips are pretty long so you fold it down the edge of your nail and file off the excess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The end product looks nice, but some places are curling in areas and I don&#x27;t like that. I did put a clear coat on top of it but I don&#x27;t think it helps much. All in all I don&#x27;t think these are worth the $9. If they were cheaper I would probably buy them more often. I have had these on for 2 days now and it has chipped in a couple places already and a couple other places I could easily peel off because it is curling up a bit.</li>
            <li> You have to put them on right for it to work...they are VERY easy to apply and go on quick! I love these and they can easily last for 7-10 on short nails little less for longer nails. The sparkle ones are kinda hard to remove later on but last longer than the other kind. If you do it right, you have enough enough strips to do 10 fingers and 10 toes!! Since toenails are smaller just cut your remaining strips to fit ur toes and cut the, in half.</li>
            <li> I tried the incoco nails polish strips before trying this one and I liked the ncoc better because they are not so flimsy. I liked the butterfly design but I will not be buying Sally Hansen nail polish strips anymore.&lt;br /&gt;Ps: many of my friends have a hard time taking the strips off with nail polish remover including me,but my sister in law told me to buy pure acetone and I&#x27;m glad I did because thanks to her advise I don&#x27;t have to dedicate 30 minutes to take the strips off.</li>
            <li> This look was okay  not really for me if you really love butterflies ..this is for u and Good luck.</li>
            <li> The Sally Hansen polish strips are great. They take a bit of time to apply (about an hour) but once they are on, I top them with a clear coat and they last for two weeks. I wore them on the beach, in and out of the ocean, for 10 days and they looked freshly applied.</li>
            <li> They are ultra cute but I do use the Sally Hansen Gel Polish top coat over it and cure it with the mini UV. It lasts really well that way giving a full 10 days before it starts to wear and I constantly rub my nails (nervous habit). I bet it would last longer if I used the clear gel as a bottom coat, too...</li>
            <li> These are really pretty and super easy to but on but once you open the package, they don&#x27;t stick anymore. I think it looked a little juvenile to have them on all my fingers so I wanted to put them on a couple and paint the rest. I figured with 16 strips, I could do this seveal times. Wrong. Once the seal is broken, they will not stick. I tried sealing them in a baggie but it did not work either. Bummed</li>
            <li> The Sally Hansen Salon Effects nail stickers are FANTASTIC!!!  They last well over a week, are easy to apply, easy to get off with nail polish remover, and come in so many cool designs!  I get complements on my nails all the time!!</li>
            <li> Not very pretty in real life. Kind of washed out in colours but it was something different to try out.</li>
            <li> I really liked these nails. The concept was great and the design is nice. I&#x27;m used to buying the KISS nails but I figured Sally Hansen is supposed to be one of the best brands out there. I got this and it smelled straight up like acetone nail polish (which I didn&#x27;t really have a problem with). They didn&#x27;t last as long as my KISS nails last. Actually, it didn&#x27;t even last a week.&lt;br /&gt;What I love about these nails, though, is that they&#x27;re so convenient. I put these nail stickers on the way to the event I was going to. It&#x27;s quick, easy and takes about 10 minutes. They do have lots of different designs, maybe this one wasn&#x27;t the best! I&#x27;m pretty much just sticking to KISS. They&#x27;re a BIT cheaper and last so much longer.</li>
            <li> This is a real springy pattern, not exactly right for this time of year, oh well. This particular pattern and coloration would look better with added rhinestones, I tried a bit of line painting on the bodies but that didn&#x27;t help. I&#x27;ve ordered the more colored pattern, Fly with Me along with it&#x27;s companion Girl Flower [[ASIN:B0076L9BHE Sally Hansen Salon Effects Value Twin Pack - Girl Flower / Fly With Me]] Wish I could afford some of the more popular patterns but I think I will like these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had mine on for over a week now, no chipping, peeling, and etc. A couple of times the edge came up a bit but when I went to deal with it later it was stuck down just as firmly as day 1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed all instructions. My only problem that I encountered with application is using the orange wood stick to smooth it down, I have one or two nails that did get very small divots in the edge due to this, but the kind of which only I know they are there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In one or two places where I used too small of a size the edge appears to be peeling up but after careful examination I realized this was only an optical illusion. When you apply nail polish you generally have very smooth or even beveled edges due to the mode of application, with these it&#x27;s a straight edge and that&#x27;s what makes it look like it is peeling up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did apply a good top coat (OPI) was worried it might make it bubble, but it didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with most that the pricing is rather high, so it is nice to be able to get some at a lower price. While looking I did notice OPI had some will probably try those next. [[ASIN:B007P0IS3O Opi Pure Lacquer Nail Apps Peacock]]</li>
            <li> I received an empty box!  No nail polish strips at all. Unbelievably unhappy!  Cuticle stick and file/buffer, but no strips.</li>
            <li> I have purchased these at Target and they are fantastic!  Last about 10 days without much peeling or chipping.  The ones I bought online lasted a couple days.  I think the adhesive was weak.  These are probably defective and that&#x27;s why the are so cheap.  But, who wants to waste their money on something that doesn&#x27;t work.  These are a rip-off.  Do not buy.</li>
            <li> I love using the Salon effects.  But their so expensive to buy at a store.  So it was awesome to be able to get them offline at a cheaper price.  Makes it sooo worth it!</li>
            <li> I recently started using nail strips. I love using them but, I hate spending so much on them when I go to the stores. The not only look great but, they were well priced. I would denelty recommend these to any one that like nail art.</li>
            <li> Just discovered these nail polish strips and I love them!!! Easy to apply, cute, and they last forever plus zero drying time. The only drawback which I&#x27;m ok with is that they are super hard to take off...but I guess that&#x27;s why they last so long. I love that I can get them here on amazon.com for a lot less than what you would pay at the store.</li>
            <li> Fast service and quality product! Would order again.</li>
            <li> Gave to my Son&#x27;s wife as a little gift and she loved them.&lt;br /&gt;The pattern is just beautiful.  All pastel Butterflies.&lt;br /&gt;The look completely natural and stay on about 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;She had no problem getting them on perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;I am going to get her more!&lt;br /&gt;SOOOOOOO PRETTY!!!!!</li>
            <li> I thought white nails would be cool but when I put them on I was not sure if I liked it. They lasted two weeks but started to peel off earlier than other versions of this product. Weird.</li>
            <li> These salon effects are perfect for a quick manicure and pedicure, very simple and easy to do and they work great for anyone who wants to do their nails for any event. They only complaint which is a mild one is that this particular pattern was extremely light and hard to see.</li>
            <li> these are my favorite strips!  I have never seen this design in stores!  perfect!  lasted me more than two weeks!</li>
            <li> the pattern is hard to read</li>
            <li> I use the Sally Hansen Effects nail polish strips all the time.  I love the patterns and I do not miss the smell of nail polish.  I would give them a higher rating if they had a few more sizes available. I do need to stretch the patterns to reach the sides of my larger nails and that is not easy task.  They last for days and come off easy with nail polish remover.  I follow the package directions and I have never had a strip come off before I took them off.  Great for travel.</li>
            <li> These are awesome I work late so I do not always have time to make it to the nail shop before it closes. These are easy to apply and they actually last for about 8 days before chipping I find they last a little longer if you add a clear top coat after the first day you apply them. All in all great way to spend a few bucks and save a lot of time!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Post Script these are way better than some of the after market/non-name brand knock offs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Linds</li>
            <li> I tried this because I rarely have time to do my nails and when I do, I inevitable smudge or imprint them. This product is a great solution.  I am pretty plain on my fingers and will likely use this on my toes next time, but overall nice product.  Oh and if you have nails wider then the strip you can overlap them and it is practically invisible.</li>
            <li> great product, as expected, high quality, last for days, will do business again!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about Sally Hansen nail strips (and Incoco nail strips)!  Finally, I can have painted nails!  My nails are thin and any nail polish I used chipped within two days - sometimes they chipped in less than one day. I bought these based on the reviews and I had very low expectations, I think because what works for most people&#x27;s nails usually doesn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, the first trial didn&#x27;t go well.  They chipped almost immediately around the edges, but it wasn&#x27;t terribly noticeable because of the pattern.  The rest of the polish stayed on nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second trial was much better- I learned how to smooth the edges better so no chips.  After 7 applications, I thought I&#x27;d write a review - it&#x27;s FOR REAL!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT I LIKE:&lt;br /&gt;*Nails last at least 7 days (they probably last longer, but I have to keep my nails very short for my sport, so I have to change nail polish once a week)&lt;br /&gt;*The patterns make my short nails look feminine&lt;br /&gt;*They are instantly dry - no waking up in the morning with smudges!!!&lt;br /&gt;*They are affordable - I get TWO applications from each box because my nails are short&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE DOWNSIDE:&lt;br /&gt;*Taking the nail polish off is a process - have plenty of nail polish remover on hand and patience, too.&lt;br /&gt;*Putting the nail strips on takes longer than painting nails. (If you count dry-time the strips are faster than regular polish, but the application time is longer.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SALLY HANSEN VS. INCOCO&lt;br /&gt;*Sally Hansen&#x27;s strips come in TWO separate pouches, so I can have two applications.  Incoco&#x27;s strips come in one pouch that can be resealed.  Sometimes the second set can dry out and not work.&lt;br /&gt;*Sally Hansen&#x27;s strips are often available on Prime so you can get them faster (and cheaper) than Incoco&#x27;s strips&lt;br /&gt;*Incoco&#x27;s big advantage is tasteful designs.  Some are just gorgeous. I&#x27;m a 40+ woman and am not interested in skulls and tattoo art on my fingers.  Most of Sally Hansen&#x27;s patterns are targeted at teens.  Incoco&#x27;s designs are beautiful and more appropriate for women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIPS FOR A SUCCESSFUL APPLICATION&lt;br /&gt;*Make sure the room is WARM.  I turn on a space heater.&lt;br /&gt;*Once you have the polish in place, smooth it down well with your fingers.&lt;br /&gt;*Make sure to smooth the tips well - any rough edges will \\&quot;catch\\&quot; on fabric and chip&lt;br /&gt;*Apply a clear top coat within 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;*Apply a second top coat after 3 or 4 days.</li>
            <li> These give such a GREAT look, they last for two or more weeks (longer but as your nails grow out you can see the line) They are super easy to use and cheaper even than at Walmart and MUCH cheaper than going to the salon.</li>
            <li> I loved this design. Its light and flashy! Def recommend brand and color! I will be buying this soon again!</li>
