            <li>I love it, color and all.</li>
            <li>Nice color light weight.</li>
            <li>She loves the color and the quality of the product was pretty good considering</li>
            <li>Great replacement for a very old pouch.</li>
            <li>I love having them all in one place, plus i clean them more often because you see them all when unrolling the pouch.  </li>

            <li>I snapped a photo, for anyone who might find it useful in making a decision for their purchase.</li>
            <li>Just the right size.</li>
            <li>Well made &amp; pretty.</li>
            <li>Most of the brushes I use are the Da Vinci ones, which are German.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as pictured and described from the number of pockets to the color of the leather.  </li>
            <li>Color is really pretty also...</li>
            <li>Pretty and just what I wanted to travel with my brushes.  </li>
            <li>Really convient.</li>
            <li>The description is misleading because this product is not made with real leather.</li>

            <li>Makes it much easier when I travel.</li>
            <li>Pretty color and soft leather material.</li>
            <li>My wife was previously keeping them in a ziploc bag which works, but this looks better and is organized.  </li>
            <li>my only complaint, is that it could use more wider slots, some of my makeup brushes don&#x27;t fit even in the largest opening.</li>
            <li>Quality was lacking - strings hanging out everywhere, the superglue holding it together was visible, and it was too small for most of my brushes.  </li>
            <li>Idea is good in theory, but the little pouches are too small to accommodate large handled kabuki brushes.</li>
            <li>the general construction and color is my fave</li>
            <li>The outside feels like soft leather.  </li>

            <li> It is just what I was looking for.  Several of the pockets are even wide enough for my big handled brushes.  I also like the flap folding over to protect the heads of the brushes.  Is great for home or travel.</li>
