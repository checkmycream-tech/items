    <ol>
            <li>Auric makes wonderful perfumes!  </li>
            <li>The scent is very nice!  </li>
            <li>Gorgeous and sensual!  </li>
            <li>beautiful package, beautiful fragrance, great service, would definetely purchase again.</li>
            <li>Smell great.</li>
            <li>Smells good and the container is beautiful</li>
            <li>If the scent were stronger and lasted, it would be great, as it has a pleasant sandalwood scent.</li>
            <li>I think it smells good</li>
            <li>While I still prefer liquid perfume, this Sandalwood balm smells too good to pass up.</li>
            <li>I always get compliments when I wear it and it smells better if you&#x27;re warm!  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s a nice fragrance nonetheless.  </li>
            <li>love it, great smell, thanks</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of Sandalwood.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite smell</li>
            <li>and I love the container it comes in.</li>
            <li>Sandalwood is my favorite scent, but this smells like the stuff we used to get as kids in our Easter baskets.  </li>
            <li>may just have to buy some for myself :)</li>
            <li>I have almost dropped the bottom part by picking up by the top.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of this.</li>
            <li>Container is cute too</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t a screw on top</li>
            <li>Does not smell like authentic sandalwood.  </li>
            <li>I love this perfume and always have it on hand.  </li>
            <li>The container is cute</li>
            <li>but i thought it would smell better.</li>
            <li>It was shipped promptly and in good condition, but I really don&#x27;t care for the smell.  </li>
            <li>I wanted Sandalwood to blend with my other Aric blends but this is a blend and best worn the way it comes.  </li>
            <li>If you like blended easy to wear fragrances you might like this one.</li>
            <li>Wish the scent lasted longer very mild not over powering.</li>
            <li>If your looking for a really strong sandalwood scent this is probably not what your looking for.  </li>
            <li>I ordered 2 one is a gift, the sandstone containers are beautiful and carved differently.</li>
            <li>Fantastic texture, really smooth and</li>
            <li>Also, it is so smooth almost as if there was a bit of oil in the scent.</li>
            <li>Solid perfume is great.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic perfume.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say if she liked it or not.  </li>
            <li>Surprisingly I really thought the eastern sandalwood was a nice soft warm blend.  </li>
            <li>Last a good 4 hours and after 8 hours you can still smell it if close.  </li>
            <li>I do feel the scent fades too quickly.</li>
            <li>the transformation was extraordinary.</li>
            <li>The amber arrived first, and it was heavenly upon opening, (cannot be giving a funky smelling gift!).</li>
            <li>No more soapy, floral - all warmth and a rich spiciness that lasted and lasted!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful carved container as well, that would be lovely on your dresser, or handy to keep in</li>
            <li>nice traditional sandalwood scent.</li>
            <li>The stone holder is really nice, I&#x27;ll probably keep it for decoration or other uses and the perfume solid was fresh, though I would describe the smell more like &amp;#34;clean powder&amp;#34; or baby powder than anything smokey or exotic.</li>
            <li>I love Auric Blends solid perfumes!</li>
            <li>It comes in a carved, stone container, which is pretty neat.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this for people who enjoy natural, earth scents.  </li>
            <li>It is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I expect a solid perfume to be more concentrated and have some staying power.</li>
            <li>As long as I keep this one off my fingers, I&#x27;m okay with it.</li>
            <li>This is a very mild scent to start with, and doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend to someone looking for a purely sandalwood scent.  </li>
            <li>I read a review that said there wasn&#x27;t much scent.  </li>
            <li>fragrance lasts the whole day</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t smell very close to Sandalwood.</li>
            <li>The case is pretty cool, but the whole thing is smaller than an egg.</li>
            <li>It was cheap and different</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>so you can&#x27;t really travel with it, but, for the money, I think its a decent buy.</li>
            <li>The scent itself is pleasant, though does not last very long, and can really only be applied to skin since it is a balm and not a spray.</li>
            <li>no one would know that when you open it up there is a  most enticing scent in solid perfume.</li>
            <li>I have been trying to find a decent Sandalwood perfume.</li>
            <li>I found this stuff in high school and have been hooked ever since.</li>
            <li>I just love their little carved stone cases.</li>
            <li>It is only good for a desk or some other flat surface.  </li>
            <li>A very decorative solid perfume container made of carved stone...</li>
            <li>The product was delivered in a few days from purchase and was boxed in original packaging with a safety seal around the container for security.</li>
            <li>It was my first purchase of an oil scent, and likely my last.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint is if you buy it straight thru Auric Blends you have to buy a certain amount&#x27;s worth of product to make an order</li>

            <li> It was my first purchase of an oil scent, and likely my last.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is if you buy it straight thru Auric Blends you have to buy a certain amount&#x27;s worth of product to make an order</li>
            <li> You think its not powerful enough but give it a few minutes to melt into your skin and its quite powerful.  </li>
            <li> A tiny bit goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;Soap</li>
            <li> My only disappointment is that the item isn&#x27;t threaded, so the top just sits on the bottom...</li>
            <li> Kind of ugly too.</li>
            <li> It really is tiny, but I think if you like the scent it would last a long time as a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Subtle, yet not so much that you don&#x27;t notice it.</li>
            <li> Obviously not real sandalwood but scented to feel like your wearing just a hint of sandalwood with a touch of vanilla.  </li>
            <li> If you stick it in your pocket it will open up and you will end up with a lot of wasted product.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Not worth $17</li>
            <li> The Eastern Sandlewood was a little soapy smelling, and I was worried.</li>
            <li> scoop a little out and rub it on your wrists and you are transported to a smokey room with turkish delight and silk robes.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a REALLY small container.</li>
            <li> Not sure how to take that.</li>
            <li> if you look at the photo I uploaded, the base is barely larger that a Quarter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortuanely, it arrived broken with no way to contact any one...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I&#x27;m still looking 😠</li>
            <li> I am really disappointing with is the size/amount provided.</li>
            <li> Almost smells like it&#x27;s something that went bad.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I read a review that said there wasn&#x27;t much scent.  That person needs their nose checked.  I actually put it on with a Q-tip because once I get it on my fingers I can&#x27;t wash the smell off.  I have allergies to a lot of scents.  As long as I keep this one off my fingers, I&#x27;m okay with it.</li>
            <li> love it, great smell, thanks</li>
            <li> beautiful package, beautiful fragrance, great service, would definetely purchase again. Fantastic texture, really smooth and fragrance lasts the whole day</li>
            <li> Gorgeous and sensual!  This balm-like perfume lasts for hours and smells divine.  I always get compliments when I wear it and it smells better if you&#x27;re warm!  :)  Auric makes wonderful perfumes!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s a nice fragrance nonetheless.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend to someone looking for a purely sandalwood scent.  This seems to have some amber and frankincense in the mix.</li>
            <li> I love Auric Blends solid perfumes!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t smell very close to Sandalwood. The case is pretty cool, but the whole thing is smaller than an egg.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of Sandalwood. I use a number of different Sandalwood products, so I know what I want and this meets my expectations in terms of the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I am really disappointing with is the size/amount provided. it&#x27;s a REALLY small container. if you look at the photo I uploaded, the base is barely larger that a Quarter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed. Not worth $17</li>
            <li> I found this stuff in high school and have been hooked ever since. It&#x27;s my favorite smell and I love the container it comes in. My only complaint is if you buy it straight thru Auric Blends you have to buy a certain amount&#x27;s worth of product to make an order, that is why I order it thru Amazon so if I want only one I can get it.</li>
            <li> It was shipped promptly and in good condition, but I really don&#x27;t care for the smell.  Sandalwood is my favorite scent, but this smells like the stuff we used to get as kids in our Easter baskets.  It was my first purchase of an oil scent, and likely my last.  Almost smells like it&#x27;s something that went bad.  It really is tiny, but I think if you like the scent it would last a long time as a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I think it smells good and so does my boyfriend. My sister told me it smells like lemon and babies.... Not sure how to take that. It smells differently to different people I guess. It was cheap and different I do feel the scent fades too quickly.</li>
            <li> I wanted Sandalwood to blend with my other Aric blends but this is a blend and best worn the way it comes.  I just love their little carved stone cases.

            <li> Smells nothing like sandalwood.</li>
            <li> While I still prefer liquid perfume, this Sandalwood balm smells too good to pass up. It comes in a carved, stone container, which is pretty neat. The scent itself is pleasant, though does not last very long, and can really only be applied to skin since it is a balm and not a spray. It is convenient to carry in your purse, and you do not have to worry about breakage or spills.</li>
            <li> Smells good and the container is beautiful</li>
            <li> Ordered two each, of this item, and of the amber scent as gifts for the daughter and my sister. The amber arrived first, and it was heavenly upon opening, (cannot be giving a funky smelling gift!). The Eastern Sandlewood was a little soapy smelling, and I was worried. I applied the lightest touch to my wrist, and waited....the transformation was extraordinary. No more soapy, floral - all warmth and a rich spiciness that lasted and lasted!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful carved container as well, that would be lovely on your dresser, or handy to keep in a purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may just have to buy some for myself :)</li>
            <li> A very decorative solid perfume container made of carved stone...no one would know that when you open it up there is a  most enticing scent in solid perfume. Also, it is so smooth almost as if there was a bit of oil in the scent.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find a decent Sandalwood perfume. Unfortunately I&#x27;m still looking 😠</li>
            <li> Solid perfume is great.  You think its not powerful enough but give it a few minutes to melt into your skin and its quite powerful.  Last a good 4 hours and after 8 hours you can still smell it if close.  A tiny bit goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;Soap stone holder should have had a screw lid on it.  I doesn&#x27;t.  If you stick it in your pocket it will open up and you will end up with a lot of wasted product.  It is only good for a desk or some other flat surface.  Kind of ugly too.</li>
            <li> The scent is very nice!  I would recommend this for people who enjoy natural, earth scents.  My only disappointment is that the item isn&#x27;t threaded, so the top just sits on the bottom...I have almost dropped the bottom part by picking up by the top.  Other than that I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Unfortuanely, it arrived broken with no way to contact any one...</li>
            <li> nice traditional sandalwood scent.</li>
            <li> Smell great. Wish the scent lasted longer very mild not over powering. Dont like the sliding containter.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this. Subtle, yet not so much that you don&#x27;t notice it. Container is cute too</li>
            <li> The product was delivered in a few days from purchase and was boxed in original packaging with a safety seal around the container for security.

            <li> Fantastic perfume. It is exactly what I wanted. The scent is devine, earthy, sensual. I ordered 2 one is a gift, the sandstone containers are beautiful and carved differently.</li>
            <li> This is a very mild scent to start with, and doesn&#x27;t last. I expect a solid perfume to be more concentrated and have some staying power. If the scent were stronger and lasted, it would be great, as it has a pleasant sandalwood scent.</li>
            <li> Does not smell like authentic sandalwood.  A bit too perfumey.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say if she liked it or not.  My mom didn&#x27;t comment when she received it for Christmas.</li>
            <li> scoop a little out and rub it on your wrists and you are transported to a smokey room with turkish delight and silk robes.  I love this perfume and always have it on hand.  Try it, you will like it.</li>
            <li> The container is cute but i thought it would smell better. Disappointed! I would not tell my friends about this.</li>
