            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>: this has a kind of peculiar smell that I dislike, but it is light and doesn&#x27;t leave the smell on your skin</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>This is an interesting product though.</li>

            <li>I love love love this.</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>Customer services was fantastic when I had a hole in mine and needed a replacement too!</li>
            <li>Love the sponge.  </li>
            <li>Great and simple way to cleanse your face.</li>
            <li>And nope, I&#x27;m not writing this for a coupon or free product, just &#x27;cuz</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling smooth and super clean, but with no tightness or dryness.  </li>
            <li>Overall it is a good purchase</li>
            <li>So far this brand has been my favorite out of the ones that I have tried.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product in this flavor and many other flavors available.  </li>
            <li>I love it its so simple to use.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using a konjac sponge</li>
            <li>started crumbling apart at first use.</li>
            <li>I have been using my konjac sponge for about 3 weeks and my skin is so much more radiant, thanks to the gentle exfoliation this sponge offers.</li>
            <li>It made my skin feel extremely clean and very soft.</li>
            <li>This sponge doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and makes it feel refreshed and super soft.</li>
            <li>Another brand disintegrated really quick and was no where near as dense.</li>
            <li>a cloth hanger: my main reason for buying this, easy to hang in the shower if you have a caddy&lt;br /&gt;-Exfoliation is gentle: hasn&#x27;t made me break out and has exfoliated mild dry skin&lt;br /&gt;-Large</li>
            <li>over scrub with this, it will annoy the skin no matter how gentle it is.</li>
            <li>: there is a light residue that is left on the skin after using, so I normally end up washing my face again anyway before any skin care routine</li>
            <li>Love these little sponges!  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive combination skin.</li>
            <li>Very soft sponge.  </li>
            <li>A positive addition to my daily pre and post makeup arsenal against aging.</li>
            <li>make my face so soft.</li>
            <li>I also have a charcoal konjac sponge (different brand), and while I really like that as well, it doesn&#x27;t soften my skin like this does.</li>
            <li>that it&#x27;s so natural, vegan, and biodegradable.</li>
            <li>Gentle enough that can be used over and around the eyes.  </li>
            <li>My face feels so soft after I use it.</li>
            <li>I purchased green tea and turmeric for myself (mature skin) and charcoal and green clay for my 20-something (age, not how many!)</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not too certain about whether the added benefits of &amp;#34;green tea&amp;#34; last after multiple uses.</li>
            <li>no longer use physical exfoliators since my sensitive skin just can&#x27;t take it anymore.</li>
            <li>I will continue to purchase these for myself and my teenage sister who also has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It works so well for my very dry and sensitive skin, a type that doesn&#x27;t often benefit from things like peels or frequent use of non-prescription retinol creams.</li>
            <li>The other brand was very scratchy and never fully softened.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from this little sponge, but I was pleasantly surprised by it.</li>
            <li>And this little sponge is gentle enough to allow that.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear very much makeup on a daily basis (usually just bb cream and cream blush), and I have found that this sponge is enough to remove those without a cleanser.</li>

            <li> : size is quite big, should last a long time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought two konjac sponges and somehow this one was a but smaller than the other one I bought...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin but removes all the dirt and makeup.  </li>
            <li> dry skin: exfoliation is too gentle to get rid of the really tough patches&lt;</li>
            <li> For those times you need a little extra exfoliation, this is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t hurt yourself when exfoliating the face even if you&#x27;re using rough exfoliating soap.  </li>
            <li> The previous Leonie sponge I purchased was the turmeric which I think I preferred over this green tree one, but it&#x27;s just a personal preference.</li>
            <li> So I typically stick to my chemical BHA 2% from Paula&#x27;s Choice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m attributing it to the green tea.</li>

            <li> I love it its so simple to use. My beauty rutine is shorter now.&lt;br /&gt;My sii bis radiant.</li>
            <li> I love it it&#x27;s work great make my face so soft.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive combination skin. This sponge doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and makes it feel refreshed and super soft. I also have a charcoal konjac sponge (different brand), and while I really like that as well, it doesn&#x27;t soften my skin like this does. I&#x27;m attributing it to the green tea.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using a konjac sponge and I&#x27;m happy I bought it.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin but removes all the dirt and makeup.  I still use eye-makeup remover but this takes care of the rest.  It&#x27;s perfect for traveling too since it&#x27;s just a sponge and no need to worry about liquids.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Great and simple way to cleanse your face. Love these sponges - they work great!</li>
            <li> For those times you need a little extra exfoliation, this is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I no longer use physical exfoliators since my sensitive skin just can&#x27;t take it anymore. So I typically stick to my chemical BHA 2% from Paula&#x27;s Choice. But after working in the yard, or an overnighter at a friends house, sometimes you just want to scrub. And this little sponge is gentle enough to allow that.</li>
            <li> I bought two konjac sponges and somehow this one was a but smaller than the other one I bought... manufacturing error? That&#x27;s why I am leaving only a 4 star but otherwise the product is awesome.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to use: just put under water for a minute or two until it is bloated and then squeeze extra water&lt;br /&gt;-Has a cloth hanger: my main reason for buying this, easy to hang in the shower if you have a caddy&lt;br /&gt;-Exfoliation is gentle: hasn&#x27;t made me break out and has exfoliated mild dry skin&lt;br /&gt;-Large: size is quite big, should last a long time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Residue: there is a light residue that is left on the skin after using, so I normally end up washing my face again anyway before any skin care routine&lt;br /&gt;-Smell: this has a kind of peculiar smell that I dislike, but it is light and doesn&#x27;t leave the smell on your skin&lt;br /&gt;-Very dry skin: exfoliation is too gentle to get rid of the really tough patches&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t over scrub with this, it will annoy the skin no matter how gentle it is. Overall it is a good purchase and I&#x27;m pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> started crumbling apart at first use. This is an interesting product though.</li>
            <li> Love these little sponges!  I purchased green tea and turmeric for myself (mature skin) and charcoal and green clay for my 20-something (age, not how many!) daughters.  Make my skin feel nice even after having menopausal sweats all day.  And nope, I&#x27;m not writing this for a coupon or free product, just &#x27;cuz I like it!</li>
            <li> I am so glad I purchased this. I have been using my konjac sponge for about 3 weeks and my skin is so much more radiant, thanks to the gentle exfoliation this sponge offers. It works so well for my very dry and sensitive skin, a type that doesn&#x27;t often benefit from things like peels or frequent use of non-prescription retinol creams. I don&#x27;t wear very much makeup on a daily basis (usually just bb cream and cream blush), and I have found that this sponge is enough to remove those without a cleanser. I do, however, tend to use it with Nuxe&#x27;s Reve de Miel facial cleanser at night. Honorable mention should go to the packaging and insert that came with the sponge. I will continue to purchase these for myself and my teenage sister who also has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I love love love this. I love it&#x27;s feel, its amazing effects, and most of all that it&#x27;s so natural, vegan, and biodegradable. It&#x27;s easy to use and my skin feels great after I use it.</li>
            <li> So far this brand has been my favorite out of the ones that I have tried. Another brand disintegrated really quick and was no where near as dense. The other brand was very scratchy and never fully softened. The previous Leonie sponge I purchased was the turmeric which I think I preferred over this green tree one, but it&#x27;s just a personal preference. This one has been working great too,</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from this little sponge, but I was pleasantly surprised by it. It made my skin feel extremely clean and very soft.</li>
            <li> Very soft sponge.  You can&#x27;t hurt yourself when exfoliating the face even if you&#x27;re using rough exfoliating soap.  Gentle enough that can be used over and around the eyes.  I recommend this product in this flavor and many other flavors available.  Ana</li>
            <li> After using it for a week, skin does feel a lot smoother but I&#x27;m not too certain about whether the added benefits of &amp;#34;green tea&amp;#34; last after multiple uses. Still quite good and would buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this sponge!  My face feels so soft after I use it. Customer services was fantastic when I had a hole in mine and needed a replacement too!</li>
            <li> Love the sponge.  It was given to me as a gift.  I plan on gifting this sponge to friends and family.</li>
            <li> Great sponge!  This is a great size and makes wonderful suds with just a small amount of soap. It leaves my face feeling smooth and super clean, but with no tightness or dryness.  Try this!</li>
            <li> A positive addition to my daily pre and post makeup arsenal against aging. It is shaped well for ones hand and also for all the nooks and crannies.&lt;br /&gt;Works well with or without face soap.</li>
