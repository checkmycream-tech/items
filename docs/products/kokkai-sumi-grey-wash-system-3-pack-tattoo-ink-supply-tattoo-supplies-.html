            <li> Kokkai Sumi Grey Wash System</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the Grey Wash System!!</li>
            <li> World Wide is on time every time.</li>
            <li> It takes all the measure and guess out, no going too dark or over working from over diluting.</li>

            <li> This Ink was way to runny to do anything with, couldn&#x27;t use it was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> the other two you have to work at it to get into the skin, not good at all</li>
            <li> i practice on pig skin not rubber fake skin</li>
            <li> the expirations of the bottles are saying they were up in august of this year :(&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The worst ink I have ever had its so watery</li>
