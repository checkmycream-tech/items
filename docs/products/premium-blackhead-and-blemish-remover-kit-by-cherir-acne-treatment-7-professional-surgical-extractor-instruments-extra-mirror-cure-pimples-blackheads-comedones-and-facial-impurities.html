            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I feel like these weren&#x27;t really efficient, and they seemed to do more harm to my skin than good.</li>
            <li>So when I was offered this Premium Blackhead &amp; Blemish Remover Kit from Merite for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I definitely ordered a kit for my nose.</li>

            <li>Not bad at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was able to use a couple different tools and was able to clean my face, especially my nose, really good.</li>

            <li>Made from quality material and fit right in my hand.</li>

            <li>The diamond grip ensures there will be no slipping while you are working on more precise tasks and areas.&lt;br /&gt;Square</li>
            <li>One tool broke on the first day, but overall good product</li>
            <li>They are clean and very durable!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Works great once you learn how to use them.&lt;br /&gt;There are a few  videos out there to learn the use of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, the round loop end is great for popping whiteheads and pimples.</li>
            <li>they all feel very well made, solid with good grips to them.  </li>

            <li>The tools themselves are pretty cool as well.</li>
            <li>There are plenty of different shapes and sizes and a nice mirror.</li>
            <li>The Merite Premium Blackhead and Blemish Remover Kit is exactly that...a nice upgrade from the basic kit.</li>
            <li>The zippered case also allows you to travel very easily with this must-have set of essential skin care tools.</li>
            <li>would take the &amp;#34;reviews&amp;#34; of this product with a very large grain of salt.  </li>
            <li>Not so sure yet I think soaking in warm water might be the key to getting these instruments to work properly</li>
            <li>Well-made, stainless steel, nice holder; I&#x27;ll be squeezing facial goo with these when I&#x27;m ninety.</li>
            <li>I have had a few of these kits and this kit in particular was by far the best.</li>
            <li>They seems to be a nice heavy metal and do not feel cheap.  </li>
            <li>Very gentle tools.  </li>
            <li>The difference in shape is due to the diamond grip tools being for more precise jobs.</li>
            <li>When I first got this kit, I was a bit intimidated by all of the tools, however once I got to reading about how to use them</li>
            <li>I was very pleased to open the package &amp; see anincredibly professional branded case that secures the tools.</li>
            <li>When I first opened the pouch and saw the mirror, my first thought was that they looked like dentist tools for pimples.  </li>
            <li>First of all.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I got to order and use this and will be ordering things from this seller in the future.</li>
            <li>have so many scars on my face from when I was younger and would pick at my skin without washing my hands first.</li>
            <li>Really works!</li>
            <li>There is something in this kit for various sizes and locations on the body that could use some black/whitehead removing, and even includes a mirror tool and a poker for those slightly more stubborn heads.  </li>
            <li>As a licensed cosmetologist for many years, I have tons of experience with different skin issues.</li>
            <li>Be sure to use your facial toner,astringent or alcohol after popping to keep the area infection-free.</li>
            <li>These tools, when used properly, can help keep your skin free of blemishes!</li>

            <li>These tools, when used properly, can help keep your skin free of blemishes!</li>
            <li>I first have to say that I am not a licensed anything.  </li>
            <li>That is probably because it involves piercing the skin first.  </li>
            <li>It includes a mirror for close work, and that is very useful when you&#x27;re using it for its intended purpose, as the more efficient the process is, the less damage to your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks so much again!</li>
            <li>We originally purchased a single tool from the local pharmacy, only to quickly determine that the two options available were not going to be able to get the job done.  </li>
            <li>Large double-ended loop  </li>
            <li>The angled end is for large blackheads that are in areas like earlobes or crevices, even around nostrils, in the nasal folds.</li>
            <li>This is for those large, pus-filled pimples.</li>
            <li>This is for those large, pus-filled pimples.</li>
            <li>blackhead remover works very well, and does not bruise your skin as other products may do, and again very easy to clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I cannot wait to order a few more for use in my salon!</li>
            <li>It came in a box with another product I ordered, from a different company, and that product was fine.</li>
            <li>Pieces are well made, I really like them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tools are all very shiny, and well-made.</li>
            <li>The tools are all very sturdy-</li>
            <li>But very durable and a variety of tools.</li>
            <li>I have suggested to my friends too regarding this product and found it really worth.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>The tools are stainless steel and they are rust resistant.</li>
            <li>Feels very well made.  </li>
            <li>the zipper on the case has already come apart and they don&#x27;t really work as well as I had hoped they would.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really unclear what the difference between the tools is.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind these tools are surgical grade stainless steel.</li>
            <li>Since I spent so many years working in the beauty industry, I know the importance of taking care of your skin.</li>
            <li>Since I spent so many years working in the beauty industry, I know the importance of taking care of your skin.</li>
            <li>It is really a bargain.  </li>
            <li>The tools are very well made.  </li>
            <li>never thought that at almost 35 years old I would be dealing with any type of acne, but with my hormones constantly changing I am grateful I can now safely deal with these issues without causing harm or scars to my body.</li>
            <li>so the tools not only stay clean, but it is discrete as well.</li>
            <li>I work in a salon mainly as a stylist,</li>
            <li>But seriously, do not let kids get a hold of these.</li>
            <li>get this and a decent nail/cleaning/trimming kit.</li>
            <li>I suppose my main issue with this is that it&#x27;s super hard to use on myself (which is likely my own failing)</li>
            <li>I noticed that other sellers provide 5 different kind tools</li>
            <li>It comes in a nice zippered hard shell fabric covered bag</li>
            <li>really like the case as it is a pretty royal blue and zips up</li>
            <li>Watch a few YouTube videos and make sure you&#x27;ve always got some hydrogen peroxide and cotton balls around.</li>
            <li>Certainly good, but not great.</li>
            <li>He is actually relieved that I got this amazing kit because he says it hurts less when I use these implements</li>
            <li>It is a nice  piece set with different size openings to extract your black heads and pimples.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a discreet blue leather zippered pouch that fits easily in my purse and is smaller than my case for my eyeglasses.  </li>
            <li>when i figured out which tool to use for my white heads they just, POP, poped right out with ease.</li>
            <li>The little melon-baller end with the hole in the middle is perfect for use on small pimples and whiteheads.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone who has problems keeping their skin clear.</li>
            <li>If you look closely, you will see all 5 star reviews from individuals with &amp;#34;interesting&amp;#34; first and last names.</li>
            <li>those stubborn blackheads &amp; my fiance’ receives thoseterrible solar comedones that you just cannot seem to remove completely!</li>
            <li>It does work well, but most of the tools are very similar to each other.</li>
            <li>A lot of them look exactly the same, so I wish it came with a guide or something.</li>
            <li>6 piece set arrived in a pretty, blue, zippered case with elastic bands that hold each piece in place.</li>
            <li>The carrying case is a little junky, but the quality of the tools themselves is fine.</li>
            <li>I have a big Portuguese nose with large pores on it.</li>
            <li>but cherir offers 6.</li>
            <li>They remind me a lot of the ones used in professional dermatologist offices.  </li>
            <li>works well so far, but still trying to figure it all out.</li>
            <li>Also, there wasn&#x27;t an instruction sheet describing any of the tools or how to really use them properly.</li>
            <li>.or far on my cheek and my under chin.  </li>
            <li>My esthetician is not allowed to go anywhere near them.  </li>
            <li>This is used on large blackheads, the flat part applies even pressure surrounding the area.</li>
            <li>The quality of the actual instruments are very high, however there are no instructions as to how to use them and most importantly THE CASE IS SO POORLY CONSTRUCTED, THAT MY TWO YEAR OLD WAS ALMOST INJURED WHEN THE SHARPEST TOOL SLIPPED OUT OF THE LOOSE ELASTIC BAND AND FELL OUT THE ZIPPER THAT DOES NOT CLOSE ENTIRELY AND ONTO THE FLOOR WHERE SHE COULD HAVE CUT HERSELF WITH IT</li>
            <li>With these tools I can easily removed the black heads, white heads and pimples.</li>
            <li>As far as the 1 star reviewer complaining of quality, this set is only 20 bucks, you can&#x27;t expect it to be the EXACT same ones the dermatologist uses.  </li>
            <li>If you have ever popped a pimple, you know it can not only get pretty gross, you also risk the chance of causing a scar.</li>
            <li>This tool serves the same purpose as the first, but it is used for smaller clogged pores.</li>
            <li>The blackhead will be pushed out easily, but don&#x27;t press too hard.</li>
            <li>wow this is a complete set to do it yourself facial extractions!</li>
            <li>The steam from a shower makes your pores open and it is much easier to extract and pop pimples when you take these simple steps.</li>
            <li>The steam from a shower makes your pores open and it is much easier to extract and pop pimples when you take these simple steps.</li>
            <li>My medical insurance has a high deductible otherwise it would not have even been a second thought to go to a doctor.  </li>
            <li>I do have sensitive skin, so maybe let that be a warning to anyone with similar skin types.</li>
            <li>I admit that I only use two of the instruments in this kit, but they have proven to be all that I need so far.</li>
            <li>The loop is round and applies a more gentle pressure to these delicate areas.</li>
            <li>That way you don&#x27;t introduce more bacteria and make your blemishes worse.  </li>
            <li>set is not limited to the face!</li>
            <li>Anyways, other than that, these are very well made.  </li>
            <li>While this still has the flat loop on one end, and the angled loop on the other, this tool is shorter and will apply a higher level of pressure on tougher skin.</li>
            <li>It was a little nerve wracking at first</li>
            <li>Milia are little hard white bumps that appear in the skin caused by a blockage of some kind to the pore.  </li>
            <li>I will never again attempt toremove ANY type of facial blemish with my bare hands.</li>
            <li>I had to really push the tool down on my skin to get any blackhead to come out.</li>
            <li>If you want to use them when you haven&#x27;t showered, take a hot wash cloth and place it over the area you want to extract for a few minutes prior to use.</li>
            <li>If you want to use them when you haven&#x27;t showered, take a hot wash cloth and place it over the area you want to extract for a few minutes prior to use.</li>
            <li>The ONLY reason I am NOT giving it a 5-star is the fact that these REALLY should have a little pamphlet inside describing HOW to USE each one.  </li>

            <li> It is also wonderful for larger blackheads since you can center the hole around them and just press.</li>
            <li> The tools themselves are pretty cool as well.</li>
            <li> There are plenty of different shapes and sizes and a nice mirror.</li>
            <li> The Merite Premium Blackhead and Blemish Remover Kit is exactly that...a nice upgrade from the basic kit.</li>
            <li> The zippered case also allows you to travel very easily with this must-have set of essential skin care tools.</li>
            <li> would take the &amp;#34;reviews&amp;#34; of this product with a very large grain of salt.  </li>
            <li> Not so sure yet I think soaking in warm water might be the key to getting these instruments to work properly</li>
            <li> Well-made, stainless steel, nice holder; I&#x27;ll be squeezing facial goo with these when I&#x27;m ninety.</li>
            <li> I have had a few of these kits and this kit in particular was by far the best.</li>
            <li> They seems to be a nice heavy metal and do not feel cheap.  </li>
            <li> Very gentle tools.  </li>
            <li> The difference in shape is due to the diamond grip tools being for more precise jobs.</li>
            <li> When I first got this kit, I was a bit intimidated by all of the tools, however once I got to reading about how to use them</li>
            <li> I was very pleased to open the package &amp; see anincredibly professional branded case that secures the tools.</li>
            <li> When I first opened the pouch and saw the mirror, my first thought was that they looked like dentist tools for pimples.  </li>
            <li> First of all.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I got to order and use this and will be ordering things from this seller in the future.</li>
            <li> have so many scars on my face from when I was younger and would pick at my skin without washing my hands first.</li>
            <li> Really works!</li>
            <li> There is something in this kit for various sizes and locations on the body that could use some black/whitehead removing, and even includes a mirror tool and a poker for those slightly more stubborn heads.  </li>
            <li> As a licensed cosmetologist for many years, I have tons of experience with different skin issues.</li>
            <li> Be sure to use your facial toner,astringent or alcohol after popping to keep the area infection-free.</li>
            <li> These tools, when used properly, can help keep your skin free of blemishes!</li>

            <li> These tools, when used properly, can help keep your skin free of blemishes!</li>
            <li> I first have to say that I am not a licensed anything.  </li>
            <li> That is probably because it involves piercing the skin first.  </li>
            <li> It includes a mirror for close work, and that is very useful when you&#x27;re using it for its intended purpose, as the more efficient the process is, the less damage to your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks so much again!</li>
            <li> We originally purchased a single tool from the local pharmacy, only to quickly determine that the two options available were not going to be able to get the job done.  </li>
            <li> Large double-ended loop  </li>
            <li> The angled end is for large blackheads that are in areas like earlobes or crevices, even around nostrils, in the nasal folds.</li>
            <li> This is for those large, pus-filled pimples.</li>
            <li> This is for those large, pus-filled pimples.</li>
            <li> blackhead remover works very well, and does not bruise your skin as other products may do, and again very easy to clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I cannot wait to order a few more for use in my salon!</li>
            <li> It came in a box with another product I ordered, from a different company, and that product was fine.</li>
            <li> Pieces are well made, I really like them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tools are all very shiny, and well-made.</li>
            <li> The tools are all very sturdy-</li>
            <li> But very durable and a variety of tools.</li>
            <li> I have suggested to my friends too regarding this product and found it really worth.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> The tools are stainless steel and they are rust resistant.</li>
            <li> Feels very well made.  </li>
            <li> the zipper on the case has already come apart and they don&#x27;t really work as well as I had hoped they would.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really unclear what the difference between the tools is.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind these tools are surgical grade stainless steel.</li>
            <li> Since I spent so many years working in the beauty industry, I know the importance of taking care of your skin.</li>
            <li> Since I spent so many years working in the beauty industry, I know the importance of taking care of your skin.</li>
            <li> It is really a bargain.  </li>
            <li> The tools are very well made.  </li>
            <li> never thought that at almost 35 years old I would be dealing with any type of acne, but with my hormones constantly changing I am grateful I can now safely deal with these issues without causing harm or scars to my body.</li>
            <li> so the tools not only stay clean, but it is discrete as well.</li>
            <li> I work in a salon mainly as a stylist,</li>
            <li> But seriously, do not let kids get a hold of these.</li>
            <li> get this and a decent nail/cleaning/trimming kit.</li>
            <li> I suppose my main issue with this is that it&#x27;s super hard to use on myself (which is likely my own failing)</li>
            <li> I noticed that other sellers provide 5 different kind tools</li>
            <li> It comes in a nice zippered hard shell fabric covered bag</li>
            <li> really like the case as it is a pretty royal blue and zips up</li>
            <li> Watch a few YouTube videos and make sure you&#x27;ve always got some hydrogen peroxide and cotton balls around.</li>
            <li> Certainly good, but not great.</li>
            <li> He is actually relieved that I got this amazing kit because he says it hurts less when I use these implements</li>
            <li> It is a nice  piece set with different size openings to extract your black heads and pimples.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a discreet blue leather zippered pouch that fits easily in my purse and is smaller than my case for my eyeglasses.  </li>
            <li> when i figured out which tool to use for my white heads they just, POP, poped right out with ease.</li>
            <li> The little melon-baller end with the hole in the middle is perfect for use on small pimples and whiteheads.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone who has problems keeping their skin clear.</li>
            <li> If you look closely, you will see all 5 star reviews from individuals with &amp;#34;interesting&amp;#34; first and last names.</li>
            <li> those stubborn blackheads &amp; my fiance’ receives thoseterrible solar comedones that you just cannot seem to remove completely!</li>
            <li> It does work well, but most of the tools are very similar to each other.</li>
            <li> A lot of them look exactly the same, so I wish it came with a guide or something.</li>
            <li> 6 piece set arrived in a pretty, blue, zippered case with elastic bands that hold each piece in place.</li>
            <li> The carrying case is a little junky, but the quality of the tools themselves is fine.</li>
            <li> I have a big Portuguese nose with large pores on it.</li>
            <li> but cherir offers 6.</li>
            <li> They remind me a lot of the ones used in professional dermatologist offices.  </li>
            <li> works well so far, but still trying to figure it all out.</li>
            <li> Also, there wasn&#x27;t an instruction sheet describing any of the tools or how to really use them properly.</li>
            <li> .or far on my cheek and my under chin.  </li>
            <li> My esthetician is not allowed to go anywhere near them.  </li>
            <li> This is used on large blackheads, the flat part applies even pressure surrounding the area.</li>
            <li> The quality of the actual instruments are very high, however there are no instructions as to how to use them and most importantly THE CASE IS SO POORLY CONSTRUCTED, THAT MY TWO YEAR OLD WAS ALMOST INJURED WHEN THE SHARPEST TOOL SLIPPED OUT OF THE LOOSE ELASTIC BAND AND FELL OUT THE ZIPPER THAT DOES NOT CLOSE ENTIRELY AND ONTO THE FLOOR WHERE SHE COULD HAVE CUT HERSELF WITH IT</li>
            <li> With these tools I can easily removed the black heads, white heads and pimples.</li>
            <li> As far as the 1 star reviewer complaining of quality, this set is only 20 bucks, you can&#x27;t expect it to be the EXACT same ones the dermatologist uses.  </li>
            <li> If you have ever popped a pimple, you know it can not only get pretty gross, you also risk the chance of causing a scar.</li>
            <li> This tool serves the same purpose as the first, but it is used for smaller clogged pores.</li>
            <li> The blackhead will be pushed out easily, but don&#x27;t press too hard.</li>
            <li> wow this is a complete set to do it yourself facial extractions!</li>
            <li> The steam from a shower makes your pores open and it is much easier to extract and pop pimples when you take these simple steps.</li>
            <li> The steam from a shower makes your pores open and it is much easier to extract and pop pimples when you take these simple steps.</li>
            <li> My medical insurance has a high deductible otherwise it would not have even been a second thought to go to a doctor.  </li>
            <li> I do have sensitive skin, so maybe let that be a warning to anyone with similar skin types.</li>
            <li> I admit that I only use two of the instruments in this kit, but they have proven to be all that I need so far.</li>
            <li> The loop is round and applies a more gentle pressure to these delicate areas.</li>
            <li> That way you don&#x27;t introduce more bacteria and make your blemishes worse.  </li>
            <li> set is not limited to the face!</li>
            <li> Anyways, other than that, these are very well made.  </li>
            <li> While this still has the flat loop on one end, and the angled loop on the other, this tool is shorter and will apply a higher level of pressure on tougher skin.</li>
            <li> It was a little nerve wracking at first</li>
            <li> Milia are little hard white bumps that appear in the skin caused by a blockage of some kind to the pore.  </li>
            <li> I will never again attempt toremove ANY type of facial blemish with my bare hands.</li>
            <li> I had to really push the tool down on my skin to get any blackhead to come out.</li>
            <li> If you want to use them when you haven&#x27;t showered, take a hot wash cloth and place it over the area you want to extract for a few minutes prior to use.</li>

            <li> The ONLY reason I am NOT giving it a 5-star is the fact that these REALLY should have a little pamphlet inside describing HOW to USE each one.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife, needless to say she was very excited.</li>
            <li> We were anxiously anticipating the arrival of this set, and it absolutely delivered.  </li>
            <li> Far more sanitary in prevention of bacteria spread and you don&#x27;t spend so much time bruising the crap out of surround tissue trying to pop those little bastards.</li>
            <li> but I got some deep set black heads from my nose that I was unable to get with anything but a pore strip, and those I usually ahve to wait until they have stretched out my pores a good bit before I can remove.</li>
            <li> Amazon is full of fake reviews and I&#x27;m not sure why this one is getting such high praise.</li>
            <li> The pouch the tools came in is cute but mine was dirty, had a crust on it...</li>
            <li> I choose this because out of other similar products sold for 1 reason.</li>
            <li> /significant other and go to town on his back!</li>
            <li> Dry the tools immediately after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dry the tools immediately after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Used them a few times so far on my husband&#x27;s back and he experiences a lot less pain than with the cheaper versions.</li>
            <li> This is one of those things that you didn&#x27;t know about, but now that you do, you could never live with out.</li>
            <li> Rough edges.  </li>
            <li> but I did manage, (after carefully disinfecting everything including my face) to get the milia out.  </li>
            <li> I hate touching my face to pop a pimple or removed white heads.</li>
            <li> Unless by work, you mean to put a big red circle around your Milian, blackhead or pimple.</li>
            <li> much more easier and less painful than using fingers that results in bacteria and</li>
            <li> It comes with a mirror tool and 6 other tools that have pieces on both ends.</li>
            <li> It has a lancet on one end and a loop on the other.</li>
            <li> It has a lancet on one end and a loop on the other.</li>
            <li> I pressed down and to the slide and the blackheads pop out with ease.</li>
            <li> The handles have a slight texture for grip, and feel well-supported, even when pressure is applied to them.</li>
            <li> I use them for black heads.  </li>
            <li> If you look up YouTube videos on using these, they are only for people with serious problems.</li>
            <li> I tested one that was hidden by my hair in case</li>
            <li> Does work well for getting the little micro blackheads out of outer nasal folds though.</li>
            <li> It arrived and this has some tools that make me a little nervous.</li>
            <li> This is a nifty little tool kit for you.</li>
            <li> It came in the little pouch as pictured.</li>
            <li> It is just a waste of money</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are 3 square shaped tools and 3 round, diamond grip tools to choose from.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use your hands please that only makes it worse.</li>
            <li> A few of the items work, but the comedone extractors just don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste the money.</li>
            <li> The lancet is very sharp!</li>
            <li> The lancet is very sharp!</li>
            <li> The hole makes no sense to me and the point isn&#x27;t the least bit sharp, not that I intent to use this thing on my face!</li>
            <li> No more trying to remove blackheads with your fingernails.</li>
            <li> Small double-ended loop.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small investment to prevent you from damaging your skin, You can also prevent scars and infection.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small investment to prevent you from damaging your skin, You can also prevent scars and infection.</li>
            <li> How did I not know about these for the past 20 years of popping pimples??</li>
            <li> I am not sure who fulfills the order for these, but buyer beware.</li>
            <li> , so I get to have fun, while I cause him less pain and don&#x27;t risk causing him infected pores by using my nasty fingernails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are sturdy and do not flex no matter how hard you try to bend them.</li>
            <li> This can be use on hard to see places like around my nose</li>
            <li> It even has a mirror for those hard to see places.</li>
            <li> Cheap metal, terrible quality, do not recommend.</li>
            <li> I can even take it in my purse because it&#x27;s so small and compact!</li>
            <li> as if having it wasn&#x27;t bad enough already.  </li>
            <li> Not good for every day zits.</li>
            <li> This means I have a lot of blackheads on my poor helpless nose.</li>
            <li> It is for use on our thin skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so confused and don&#x27;t know what to do with them.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have random tools that my toddler can grab.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this item at all!!</li>
            <li> Like I didn&#x27;t think my face was that dirty...</li>
            <li> and instead I recieved one dirty tool with two dirty stickers on it.</li>
            <li> Drives me crazy.  </li>
            <li> the tools themselves didn&#x27;t look bad</li>
            <li> unwanted bad experiences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am bad about picking, and this has helped me to stop that and save my skin from scabbing because my nails cut it.</li>
            <li> If you know HOW to use each tool, you WON&#x27;T be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Buyer beware, it seems everyone else recieved a kit but me. :(</li>
            <li> This is the bad boy!</li>
            <li> This is the bad boy!</li>
            <li> Using your fingernails, which harbor astronomical amounts of bacteria, is the worst thing you can use.</li>
            <li> It was disgusting but it worked.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Cheap metal, terrible quality, do not recommend.</li>
            <li> These are great... If only I had some blemishes to use them on! Used them a few times so far on my husband&#x27;s back and he experiences a lot less pain than with the cheaper versions. Made from quality material and fit right in my hand.</li>
            <li> I just ordered this, so I can&#x27;t say how well it works, perhaps I will update my review. What I don&#x27;t appreciate are all of the bogus reviews about this product. If you look closely, you will see all 5 star reviews from individuals with &amp;#34;interesting&amp;#34; first and last names. I have a strong suspicion that this company posted bogus reviews in order to bump up the ratings of this product. I, for one, buy items based on the reviews, and at this point I feel duped. I should have looked more closely at the reviews before I ordered it. Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> wow this is a complete set to do it yourself facial extractions! I did order my set through a promotion to try it and share my honest opinion. It is a nice  piece set with different size openings to extract your black heads and pimples. It comes in a nice zippered hard shell fabric covered bag so you won&#x27;t lose them, inside there is elastic slots holding them in place. I do like that they are great quality stainless steal so you can use alcohol to sterilize it easily before and after use. My teenage daughter is very excited since she has acne , combine with a nice cleansing regimen we are seeing great improvements to her skin. Buy with confidence.</li>
            <li> Pieces are well made, I really like them.</li>
            <li> The pouch the tools came in is cute but mine was dirty, had a crust on it...the tools themselves didn&#x27;t look bad but I sterilized before use to be sure. These tools made it easier to get rid of blackheads versus using my hands. Good buy</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I feel like these weren&#x27;t really efficient, and they seemed to do more harm to my skin than good. I do have sensitive skin, so maybe let that be a warning to anyone with similar skin types. Does work well for getting the little micro blackheads out of outer nasal folds though.</li>
            <li> Products are high quality and perfect for removing any imperfections.&lt;br /&gt;Customer service is excellent.  Had a problem with an order and was contacted within an hour and shipped a replacement.</li>
            <li> The Merite Premium Blackhead and Blemish Remover Kit is exactly that...a nice upgrade from the basic kit. It includes a mirror for close work, and that is very useful when you&#x27;re using it for its intended purpose, as the more efficient the process is, the less damage to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tools are all very shiny, and well-made. The handles have a slight texture for grip, and feel well-supported, even when pressure is applied to them. This is an excellent addition to a beauty regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount for review purposes. My opinions and mirroring are my own.</li>
            <li> Well-made, stainless steel, nice holder; I&#x27;ll be squeezing facial goo with these when I&#x27;m ninety.</li>
            <li> When I first got this kit, I was a bit intimidated by all of the tools, however once I got to reading about how to use them I became impressed. There are six dual ended blemish removers and a mirror. The tools are stainless steel and are safe to use when removing blackheads or pimples as they are designed specifically for this and approved by estheticians. If you have ever popped a pimple, you know it can not only get pretty gross, you also risk the chance of causing a scar. With this set you can safely remove those unwanted blackheads with no risk and are basically getting 13 tools for the price of one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the case as it is a pretty royal blue and zips up so the tools not only stay clean, but it is discrete as well. Each tool is securely held in place by elastic bands so you do not have to worry about them falling out when you open the zipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never thought that at almost 35 years old I would be dealing with any type of acne, but with my hormones constantly changing I am grateful I can now safely deal with these issues without causing harm or scars to my body. I am thankful I was given the opportunity to test and review this item for free.</li>
            <li> I work in a salon mainly as a stylist, however I haveclients who enjoy receiving monthly facials/waxing. I received this kit to usepersonally for those stubborn blackheads &amp; my fiance’ receives thoseterrible solar comedones that you just cannot seem to remove completely! Theshipping was insanely quick! I was very pleased to open the package &amp; see anincredibly professional branded case that secures the tools. I immediately triedit out &amp; was AMAZED at the ease of removal. I will never again attempt toremove ANY type of facial blemish with my bare hands. I am SO thankful for thiskit! I cannot wait to order a few more for use in my salon!</li>
            <li> I have a big Portuguese nose with large pores on it. This means I have a lot of blackheads on my poor helpless nose. So when I was offered this Premium Blackhead &amp; Blemish Remover Kit from Merite for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I definitely ordered a kit for my nose. It arrived and this has some tools that make me a little nervous. They look like they could be used by a surgeon...just kidding. But seriously, do not let kids get a hold of these. I was able to use a couple different tools and was able to clean my face, especially my nose, really good. I am definitely impressed with the results I got.  If you are looking for some great blackhead or blemish removers, I definitely recommend this kit from Merite.</li>
            <li> Disclaimer: I received a free or discounted item in exchange for my honest review. All opinions are my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sister has always been freaky around pimples.  When we were younger, she&#x27;d chase me around the house whenever I was unlucky enough to have one- trying to pop it- as if having it wasn&#x27;t bad enough already.  How I wish this was around then!!  It&#x27;s a discreet blue leather zippered pouch that fits easily in my purse and is smaller than my case for my eyeglasses.  Inside the pouch are 7 implements held by elastic on red velvet lining.  Five of the implements are dual sided, so there are actually 12 different tools included.  When I first opened the pouch and saw the mirror, my first thought was that they looked like dentist tools for pimples.  I&#x27;m attaching pictures to this review so that others can see what I&#x27;m talking about.  The tools are all very sturdy- they all feel very well made, solid with good grips to them.  I&#x27;m so pleased with the set, I&#x27;ve called my sister to recommend it to her.</li>
            <li> I bought this to clean my face and back up works great.. Like I didn&#x27;t think my face was that dirty... U can see blackheads&#x27; coming up out of your pores...</li>
            <li> Just got them and one of the tools already broke</li>
            <li> Need to learn how to use them. But very durable and a variety of tools.</li>
            <li> Really user friendly and affordable and easy to carry it anywhere and best product every found. I have suggested to my friends too regarding this product and found it really worth.&lt;br /&gt;Just need to say Wowww!!!</li>
            <li> The quality of the actual instruments are very high, however there are no instructions as to how to use them and most importantly THE CASE IS SO POORLY CONSTRUCTED, THAT MY TWO YEAR OLD WAS ALMOST INJURED WHEN THE SHARPEST TOOL SLIPPED OUT OF THE LOOSE ELASTIC BAND AND FELL OUT THE ZIPPER THAT DOES NOT CLOSE ENTIRELY AND ONTO THE FLOOR WHERE SHE COULD HAVE CUT HERSELF WITH IT</li>
            <li> I cleaned the item before using and it rusted. I sent back the next day.</li>
            <li> I received the product for free or a discounted amount for an unbiased and honest opinion.....  This Premium Blackhead and Blemish Remover Tool kit is great for a start to getting rid of acne problems.  It comes in a zippered case with a set of 5 different double-ended skin tools. The tools are stainless steel and they are rust resistant. I found each one to be helpful in different areas on my face. I pressed down and to the slide and the blackheads pop out with ease. No more trying to remove blackheads with your fingernails. This is a great item to have.</li>
            <li> Quality item. Durable.  Feels very well made.  Wash with soap and water.  Perfect for my pre-teens and teens.  Very gentle tools.  Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I love the idea of the product, but the quality isn&#x27;t amazing. It does work well, but most of the tools are very similar to each other. The metal seems like it will rust easily and even when the case is fully zipped, the tools can fall out. I don&#x27;t hate it, but the quality isn&#x27;t that great.</li>
            <li> First of all. I choose this because out of other similar products sold for 1 reason. I noticed that other sellers provide 5 different kind tools but cherir offers 6. This is the BEST because Cherir provides 6 different kind tools unlike other sellers providing 5 so I decided to choose this as this is the most reasonable good deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works great once you learn how to use them.&lt;br /&gt;There are a few  videos out there to learn the use of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works very good! when i figured out which tool to use for my white heads they just, POP, poped right out with ease. much more easier and less painful than using fingers that results in bacteria and unwanted bad experiences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;excellent product. need to get used to using it correctly  high quality and great packaging, prompt delivery .</li>
            <li> These tools were so easy and clean to use. I have had a few of these kits and this kit in particular was by far the best. They are clean and very durable! I am so glad I got to order and use this and will be ordering things from this seller in the future. Thanks so much again!</li>
            <li> I love the value of this set.  You get 13 tools (7 actual pieces and a zippered case).  The mirror is perfect for those hard to reach blackheads that you sometimes get in your ear (and of course, you could use it to check out your teeth, but be sure to wash it first!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have so many scars on my face from when I was younger and would pick at my skin without washing my hands first. I wish now that I had started using blackhead remover tools earlier. The metal makes it easy to sanitize with alcohol before use. Be sure to clean both the tool and your face before use. It works best when you first get out of the shower and your pores are more open.  They are sturdy and do not flex no matter how hard you try to bend them. They remind me a lot of the ones used in professional dermatologist offices.  As far as the 1 star reviewer complaining of quality, this set is only 20 bucks, you can&#x27;t expect it to be the EXACT same ones the dermatologist uses.  Those are at minimum $30 a PIECE, so with that logic, this set would cost at minimum $300.  It&#x27;s an excellent deal for at home use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received this product for a discount in exchange for my HONEST review. I was neither paid nor sponsored for my opinions and all thoughts reflected in this review are solely my own.</li>
            <li> the zipper on the case has already come apart and they don&#x27;t really work as well as I had hoped they would.</li>
            <li> I use them for black heads.  Works fine.</li>
            <li> This arrived damaged.  One of the heads were not connected.  It had to have come from the factory this way as the amazon packaging was fine. The case is low quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would take the &amp;#34;reviews&amp;#34; of this product with a very large grain of salt.  Amazon is full of fake reviews and I&#x27;m not sure why this one is getting such high praise.</li>
            <li> works well so far, but still trying to figure it all out. No instructions.</li>
            <li> Such a good kit. Really works!</li>
            <li> These are good quality and the case is nice.  I do wish they came with an instructional guide, but there are plenty of youtube videos out there that show you just what to do.</li>
            <li> Not good for every day zits. If you look up YouTube videos on using these, they are only for people with serious problems.</li>
            <li> Nice case, sturdy tools. I suppose my main issue with this is that it&#x27;s super hard to use on myself (which is likely my own failing) and it&#x27;s really unclear what the difference between the tools is. A lot of them look exactly the same, so I wish it came with a guide or something.</li>
            <li> We originally purchased a single tool from the local pharmacy, only to quickly determine that the two options available were not going to be able to get the job done.  We were anxiously anticipating the arrival of this set, and it absolutely delivered.  There is something in this kit for various sizes and locations on the body that could use some black/whitehead removing, and even includes a mirror tool and a poker for those slightly more stubborn heads.  We are very pleased with this product, and are going to get another set to keep in the car.  A good buy.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27; me but these tools don&#x27;t seem to work for me. I&#x27;ve tried them all and I have watched video tutorials but I can&#x27;t get them to work for me. Excellent quality set, and other reviewers will tell you how great they are..perhaps they work for them, but not for me.&lt;br /&gt;*product received at promotional discount for review*</li>
            <li> The tools themselves are varied and are fairly well made. The sleeve container that holds the instruments is well built, which was a pleasant surprise. My wife and I like them, but the fact that this kit doesn&#x27;t have the widest assortment of tools makes this an incomplete set of tools. Certainly good, but not great. If this was our very first set of dermatology tools, I wouldn&#x27;t regret it, but you can certainly do better.</li>
            <li> This is a nifty little tool kit for you. It comes with a mirror tool and 6 other tools that have pieces on both ends. It&#x27;s a great set to have in your bathroom for those pesky pimples and blackheads and anything else you can get on your skin! They are stainless steel and of great quality. Comes in a case so each piece has it&#x27;s own spot to be set. I highly recommend this product to anyone who has problems keeping their skin clear.</li>
            <li> It is just a waste of money</li>
            <li> I admit that I only use two of the instruments in this kit, but they have proven to be all that I need so far. I am bad about picking, and this has helped me to stop that and save my skin from scabbing because my nails cut it. I think if you pick, you need to get one of these sets and use it instead. Your skin will thank you.</li>
            <li> Not so sure yet I think soaking in warm water might be the key to getting these instruments to work properly</li>
            <li> Great blackhead removal tool set.  Comes in a nice zippered case for easy storage.</li>
            <li> This is not medical quality equipment, but good for a quick fix if you know what you&#x27;re doing. You can google video tutorials and get a good grasp on how to use this set pretty quickly. I like that it came in a pouch so I can store it easily. Not bad at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** received for review and inspection purposes **</li>
            <li> These are so cool! I love each and every utensil. I only had the chance to use a couple of them but I got some deep set black heads from my nose that I was unable to get with anything but a pore strip, and those I usually ahve to wait until they have stretched out my pores a good bit before I can remove. I did receive this product for an honest unbias review. Over all I am super happy with this set!</li>
            <li> As a licensed cosmetologist for many years, I have tons of experience with different skin issues. Everyone, to some degree, deals with Blackheads, Whiteheads, Comedones (clogged pores) and Pimples. More often than not, people use their fingers and fingernails to pop zits and squeeze blackheads. Using your fingernails, which harbor astronomical amounts of bacteria, is the worst thing you can use. You end up introducing this bacteria into the pores, especially when fluids are expelled, and this can cause infection. So, how can one safely and cleanly pop pimples and squeeze blackheads? The answer is this Premium Blackhead &amp; Blemish Remover Kit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 6 piece set arrived in a pretty, blue, zippered case with elastic bands that hold each piece in place. The inside lining has a nice, velvet textured material, so you know the tools are properly stored when you aren&#x27;t using them. The zippered case also allows you to travel very easily with this must-have set of essential skin care tools. Since each implement is double-ended, you truly get 12 tools in all! I will do my best to explain the purpose for each one. Keep in mind these tools are surgical grade stainless steel. You can clean them with mild soap and water, or, if you have access to Barbacide (you can get some at Wal-Mart or Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply) it would be the best option to keep these clean, since it kills all bacteria (it&#x27;s that blue liquid you see scissors and combs soaking in at every barber shop or salon)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set is not limited to the face! You can use these tools all over the body! Grab your boyfriend/husband/significant other and go to town on his back! I LOVE to pop pimples and perform extractions on my husband. It actually excites me to find blemishes on his shoulders or back, because I&#x27;m gross like that! LOL He is actually relieved that I got this amazing kit because he says it hurts less when I use these implements, so I get to have fun, while I cause him less pain and don&#x27;t risk causing him infected pores by using my nasty fingernails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are 3 square shaped tools and 3 round, diamond grip tools to choose from. The difference in shape is due to the diamond grip tools being for more precise jobs. The diamond grip ensures there will be no slipping while you are working on more precise tasks and areas.&lt;br /&gt;Square Tool 1) Large double-ended loop  This is used on large blackheads, the flat part applies even pressure surrounding the area. The blackhead will be pushed out easily, but don&#x27;t press too hard. The angled end is for large blackheads that are in areas like earlobes or crevices, even around nostrils, in the nasal folds. This tool works best for me on my nose, cheeks and chin because that is where my larger pores are.&lt;br /&gt;Square Tool 2) Small double-ended loop. This tool serves the same purpose as the first, but it is used for smaller clogged pores. It is important to choose the correct size when you are extracting pores. The pressure when you apply the tool and press, needs to be precise and even. It is best to use the right size. This works best on the forehead and cheekbones for me. My pores are smaller in these areas compared to the ones on my nose, cheeks and chin.&lt;br /&gt;Square Tool 3) This tool is for more sensitive areas, like the under-eye area and lip-line. It is for use on our thin skin. The loop is round and applies a more gentle pressure to these delicate areas. Also, the round loop end is great for popping whiteheads and pimples. It will surround the largest of pimples and provide the perfect amount of pressure to pop these without damaging skin further.&lt;br /&gt;Diamond Grip Tool 1) While this still has the flat loop on one end, and the angled loop on the other, this tool is shorter and will apply a higher level of pressure on tougher skin. This is a great choice for any blackheads on the body.&lt;br /&gt;Diamond Grip Tool 2) This is the &amp;#34;spoon&amp;#34; and loop ended tool. The little melon-baller end with the hole in the middle is perfect for use on small pimples and whiteheads. It is also wonderful for larger blackheads since you can center the hole around them and just press. The blackhead will come through the hole. The loop on the end is round and again, is perfect for pimples, whiteheads and great for use on sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;Diamond Grip Tool 3) This is the bad boy! It has a lancet on one end and a loop on the other. The lancet is very sharp! Be sure to clean it before popping a pimple! This is for those large, pus-filled pimples. The lancet will easily pop them. Be sure to use your facial toner,astringent or alcohol after popping to keep the area infection-free. The loop on the end will evenly distribute pressure around those pesky whiteheads and pimples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendations: Always clean your face AND your implements before using this set on your skin! I highly recommend extracting pores after you get out of the shower, while your pores are nice and steamed. The steam from a shower makes your pores open and it is much easier to extract and pop pimples when you take these simple steps. If you want to use them when you haven&#x27;t showered, take a hot wash cloth and place it over the area you want to extract for a few minutes prior to use. The results will be better and I promise, it is so much easier to perform extractions on clean steamed skin. Most Importantly, when you are finished with the tools, first, clean your skin by either washing or using toner or alcohol, please don&#x27;t forget to clean your new tools as well. This will keep bacteria off of your implements. Dry the tools immediately after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, this is a fabulous set to have for anyone! These tools, when used properly, can help keep your skin free of blemishes! It&#x27;s a small investment to prevent you from damaging your skin, You can also prevent scars and infection. It is so unsanitary to pop pimples and squeeze blackheads with your fingernails, even if you think they are clean, they aren&#x27;t! This set has everything you need to keep your skin blemish free! I am delighted to be able to review this for my honest, unbiased opinion and feedback. Since I spent so many years working in the beauty industry, I know the importance of taking care of your skin. I can honestly say, this Premium Blackhead and Blemish Remover Kit is something that absolutely any and everyone could use. This would also be a great gift for a teenager, to teach them to properly care for their skin. It would be a great gift for anyone, even yourself!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for reading my detailed review!ddle is perfect for use on small pimples and whiteheads.

            <li> Whoa you need one of these. How did I not know about these for the past 20 years of popping pimples??</li>
            <li> Very very good I love it</li>
            <li> Item is amazing and very sturdy.  The handles are amaxing and this product works wonderfully</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife, needless to say she was very excited. These tools are made out of quality surgical steel materials, they are very easy to clean with rubbing alcohol. My wife has really enjoyed each tool that is included in this set. Price is on point for this top notch product.&lt;br /&gt;*The blackhead remover works very well, and does not bruise your skin as other products may do, and again very easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;Great Product/Great Price</li>
            <li> I am not sure who fulfills the order for these, but buyer beware.</li>
            <li> Rough edges.  Returned</li>
            <li> I loved that this came with a carrying case! This helps to kee everything organized so I don&#x27;t have random tools that my toddler can grab. I can even take it in my purse because it&#x27;s so small and compact! The tools themselves are pretty cool as well. There are plenty of different shapes and sizes and a nice mirror. I just wish there were some tips or instructions on which to use for what, but I&#x27;m sure Anyone can try and figure it out.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because all of the positive reviews made it sound like the product was easy to use and extremely effective. When I tried using it (after removing makeup and washing my face with warm/hot water to open my pores), I was pressing the tool on an area where I had blackheads and nothing happened except for irritation. I had to really push the tool down on my skin to get any blackhead to come out. I think the reviews that say &amp;#34;blackheads just slide out&amp;#34; are inaccurate. Also, there wasn&#x27;t an instruction sheet describing any of the tools or how to really use them properly. I&#x27;m sticking to blackhead removal masks. This wasn&#x27;t an incredible purchase and I plan on returning it.</li>
            <li> Premium blackhead and blemish remover kit. The packaging was great. It came in the little pouch as pictured. the 7 piece set is of great stainless steel quality. This beauty tool set has saved me from frequenting facial salon. The tools themselves are easy to use and the best part is that I can now remove pimples and blackheads without tearing up my skin! I would definitely buy this set again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received this with a discount to provide my honest feedback.</li>
            <li> I bought these on Prime Day, so they were an excellent purchase for the money. Remember, these are personal tools- don&#x27;t share them with anyone because, unless you have an autoclave or boil them, there is no way to sterilize them. Excellent assortment of tools- now I just have to restrain myself from attacking every blackhead all at once. The carrying case is a little junky, but the quality of the tools themselves is fine.</li>
            <li> I really love tools that have to do with my face. I hate touching my face to pop a pimple or removed white heads. With these tools I can easily removed the black heads, white heads and pimples. Without touching and introducing bacteria onto my skin.  I have had others and this one is one of the best kits I have. These one has 7 double sided tools. It is really a bargain.  This pack is my favorite because it has a very useful mirror! This can be use on hard to see places like around my nose .or far on my cheek and my under chin.  If you don&#x27;t know how to use them please find out beaches these are the best things to use while cleaning your face from blemishes. Don&#x27;t use your hands please that only makes it worse. The kit comes I a very nice case. That I can carry around in my purse and keep safe. Very useful item. With many uses.  I clean them with antibacterial soap and hot water to warm water. Always clean and disinfect your tools for better results. That way you don&#x27;t introduce more bacteria and make your blemishes worse.  I recieved this product to sample review and give you my own honest opinion.</li>
            <li> One tool broke on the first day, but overall good product</li>
            <li> A few of the items work, but the comedone extractors just don&#x27;t work. Unless by work, you mean to put a big red circle around your Milian, blackhead or pimple. Don&#x27;t waste the money.</li>
            <li> I received a used product. The instruments seemed sterilized, but nevertheless the product was used. There was no indication that I was receiving a used product.</li>
            <li> We love it! Very useful</li>
            <li> The tools are very well made.  The ONLY reason I am NOT giving it a 5-star is the fact that these REALLY should have a little pamphlet inside describing HOW to USE each one.  Some of these I&#x27;m like...WTH??  What?  How??...I&#x27;m so confused and don&#x27;t know what to do with them.  Some look like the same tool only slightly different in size.  Anyways, other than that, these are very well made.  If you know HOW to use each tool, you WON&#x27;T be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Meh it doesn&#x27;t seem to deliver on my needs.  My skin issues did not warrant this degree of tooling</li>
            <li> I just recieved... I was going to say &amp;#34;this product&amp;#34; but that is not what I got. I added a picture of what I recieved on my doorstep this morning. It came in a box with another product I ordered, from a different company, and that product was fine. But this is ONE tool and not in any type of packaging. It was sitting in the bottom of my box under a flap, I almost missed it! I am furious! I was so excited to receive this blemish kit and instead I recieved one dirty tool with two dirty stickers on it. The hole makes no sense to me and the point isn&#x27;t the least bit sharp, not that I intent to use this thing on my face! Buyer beware, it seems everyone else recieved a kit but me. :(</li>
            <li> Cool kit! I&#x27;ve used it tons already.  We always have bumps and skin stuff to tend to. I like the zip pouch and tools seem good quality.</li>
            <li> I first have to say that I am not a licensed anything.  I am a regular person.  I got these because I have great skin EXCEPT for milia and in my state only dermatologists are allowed to remove them.  My esthetician is not allowed to go anywhere near them.  That is probably because it involves piercing the skin first.  My medical insurance has a high deductible otherwise it would not have even been a second thought to go to a doctor.  Milia are little hard white bumps that appear in the skin caused by a blockage of some kind to the pore.  Some say it is from not exfoliating enough but all I know is that I got them when I started using an oil based product on my skin.  Drives me crazy.  When I got the chance to get these at a discounted price to test and review them, I figured &amp;#34;what the heck&amp;#34; and ordered them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The set is impressive - every size you can want to help extract blemishes like whiteheads, blackheads, comedones and yes....milia.  It even has a mirror for those hard to see places. 7 pieces including the mirror - they even have an angled tool to help with the curves around your nose.  They seems to be a nice heavy metal and do not feel cheap.  They even have a non slip grip you can use.  Everything is held in a really nice zippered case with a place for each tool to be held snugly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not my intention to tell you how to use these.  That is a personal matter.  The best thing you can do for yourself is to look at videos on YouTube if you are into getting a set like this and doing your own extractions.  That is now I learned how to do milia.  I tested one that was hidden by my hair in case I screwed it up.  It was a little nerve wracking at first but I did manage, (after carefully disinfecting everything including my face) to get the milia out.  It was disgusting but it worked.  Good tools for those that like this kind of thing.  LOL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was given to me at a discount so I could test it and review it honestly.</li>
            <li> Awesome, squeezed blackheads right out! I just wish they had a manual or explanations about what each tool is for.</li>
            <li> Love these tools, just use them at the house, but are super easy to use and clean. Easily keep track of them since they are in a case. love that they are stainless</li>
            <li> Free: recieved the product yesterday, and used it for hours. Its amazing. my skin looks healthier and has cleared up sufficiently.!</li>
            <li> This is one of those things that you didn&#x27;t know about, but now that you do, you could never live with out. get this and a decent nail/cleaning/trimming kit. It&#x27;s life changing. Far more sanitary in prevention of bacteria spread and you don&#x27;t spend so much time bruising the crap out of surround tissue trying to pop those little bastards. Watch a few YouTube videos and make sure you&#x27;ve always got some hydrogen peroxide and cotton balls around.</li>
            <li> Save you money!!! Not happy with this item at all!!</li>
