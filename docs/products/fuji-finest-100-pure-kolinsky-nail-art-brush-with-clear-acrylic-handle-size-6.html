            <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t want to buy this product, because it didn&#x27;t have any reviews, but since the price is not bad I decided to go for it.</li>
            <li>Good nail brush, but just too large.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve spent more on my acrylic brushes but this one has been the best deal so far.</li>
            <li>Nails go on smooth and are soo pretty!  </li>
            <li>I also purchased a #8 brush, the same brand and model, and it is as good as this one.</li>

            <li>Came within a decent amount of time in sturdy packaging...when it came to using the actual product, it basically sheds with every stroke...</li>
            <li>The clear handle makes it look so sophisticated, agh, I don&#x27;t get tired of it.</li>
            <li>apparently you don&#x27;t know what u like</li>
            <li>I have bought many much more expensive brushes only to be disappointed in the lack of long term quality (many fell apart in under 2 weeks).</li>
            <li>Plus another nail company sells this exact same brush a few dollars higher without the shipping price and I looked on Amazon before purchasing from the other site and found this exact same brush for a few dollars cheaper with the shipping included.</li>

            <li> can you believe this same brush is $70 in my country? that&#x27;s equivalent to $26.21 USD! And all i paid was $6. works wonderfully and evenly; no streaking or shedding.</li>
            <li> If you want a realy good job this is for you. Do exactly what i need and how I like the good quality of the brush! Love iiiiittttt</li>
            <li> I do my own acrylic nails at home as well as my nieces,daughters and sister&lt;br /&gt;I luv this brush I get enough product on it and goes on easily I definitely would purchase more and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Came within a decent amount of time in sturdy packaging...when it came to using the actual product, it basically sheds with every stroke...worth about what i paid for it or a little less</li>
            <li> this brush does wonders! for the cheap price, i didn&#x27;t think it&#x27;d work so well but it&#x27;s actually a really good brush. i do my own nails &amp; this brush works so well with it. it picks up my acrylic powder with the bonding liquid without any drops  &amp; you can make it work where you want it to or how. i&#x27;d recommend this. i also bought the size 8 too but it was too big so i ordered this one after. still a little big but still works wonders on me. love it! also, i ordered this on a sunday night &amp; got it about thursday afternoon.</li>
            <li> I am a professional and very picky on my brushes. I ordered this to see how it compared. So far I really like it,it holds the bead wonderfully and I have not had a problem with it collecting and storing the extras from ending the application. It cleans up nicely.</li>
            <li> I bought this item thinking that what I read \\&quot;Pure Kolinsky brush\\&quot; is what I was going to receive, Well that wasn&#x27;t the case at all. The brush did come on time but it is falsely advertised, due to the fact the hair on the brush was SYNTHETIC. The quality is horrible. Never again. I have a nail business to run and I will not purchase anything from this company again. Unfortunate.</li>
            <li> Good nail brush, but just too large. l was trying to find a smaller one.</li>
            <li> My ebay brushes was not the business. I haven&#x27;t used my brushes yet. But from other ladies on YT who has this brush loves it. Plus another nail company sells this exact same brush a few dollars higher without the shipping price and I looked on Amazon before purchasing from the other site and found this exact same brush for a few dollars cheaper with the shipping included. So this was a much better deal. I&#x27;ll be getting the size 10 and 12 next.</li>
            <li> Would like actual brush to be a little longer. Is the size of my #8 I use professionaly for nails.</li>
            <li> I have now bought 2 of these brushes (different sizes). These brushes are perfectly shaped and hold tons of monomer. They are easy to clean and hold their shape well. I have bought many much more expensive brushes only to be disappointed in the lack of long term quality (many fell apart in under 2 weeks). This brush was less than half of what I normally spend. You can&#x27;t go wrong with these. Great value!</li>
