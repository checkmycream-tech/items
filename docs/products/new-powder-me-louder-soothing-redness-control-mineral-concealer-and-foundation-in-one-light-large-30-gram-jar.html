            <li>This powder is the best makeup I have ever used!</li>
            <li>I also ordered the blush and eye shadows which are equally amazing!!  </li>
            <li>Great product a great price!</li>
            <li>And this product is incredible.</li>
            <li>I am eternally grateful for their marvelous customer service and for making a great product.</li>
            <li>This product works BEAUTIFULLY.</li>
            <li>Feels great on and if you are at all hesitant, contact them.</li>
            <li>Hence, for brown spots...not so good; but for redness, this is indeed magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good.  </li>
            <li>From the purchase till it arrived at my door was a good experience. .</li>
            <li>I loved that too.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>It smells good too.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re unsure which color you need, this would be a good one to try.</li>
            <li>I especially liked the added touch of the darker and lighter colors for making the mineral the right shade for me!  </li>
            <li>This foundation covers my face really well, layers excellently and works great to conceal flaws.</li>
            <li>This is the most amazing foundation ever!  </li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>I really love this product!</li>
            <li>I will order this again for sure!</li>
            <li>I will never use any other makeup, perfect price, perfect product!</li>
            <li>Amazing value, product, and packaging.</li>
            <li>Pigment to fix color are nice but kind of a pain to mix.</li>
            <li>Since purple is my favorite color, I loved</li>
            <li>so its nice to have that option.</li>
            <li>Their customer service is the best I have experienced in a long time...especially from a company online!</li>
            <li>Plus, it&#x27;s very light and doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel</li>
            <li>I just hope it&#x27;s always available on here!  </li>
            <li>It did not cover my not terrible rosacea.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t say better things about this product.</li>
            <li>When trying to cover the spots on my nose, they would just end up looking caked on and would make the spots where my skin peeled even more noticeable.</li>
            <li>But, this concealer covers so well and does not looked caked on and does not make the spots on my peeling nose more noticeable.</li>
            <li>I love this makeup.</li>
            <li>I was blown away by her prompt response to my email and how sweet and courteous she was.</li>
            <li>My Face foundation much more easily, and it spreads around well with the brush.  </li>
            <li>, it doesn&#x27;t cake, it&#x27;s shear but covers well, feels really great, came with a great brush and two small tubs to customize the color</li>
            <li>but most pivotal, the woman who developed this product is AMAZING</li>
            <li>It works fine on my face</li>
            <li>I tried bare minerals when I couldn&#x27;t find my ELF minerals in the store any longer, and it was OK but not as good.</li>
            <li>This foundation is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve been using this stuff over the redder part of my cheeks, and then using the covergirl over it to smooth it out and blend in with the rest of my face.  </li>
            <li>It gives a smooth matte look.  </li>
            <li>ordered my own shade, so I haven&#x27;t used the the two small containers, but I am very happy with my first day using this product.</li>
            <li>As it heals, it kinda scabs over and isn&#x27;t smooth.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve used it and love how light it is</li>
            <li>first thing I noticed was the fact that the powder comes in a lovely purple pouch.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, the best makeup i&#x27;ve found for my really bad rosacea.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;She has since sent me a special formulation that she made up, just for me.  </li>
            <li>but often my cheeks turn bright red.  </li>
            <li>Even better than Bare Minerals because its cheaper and works better for acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.  </li>
            <li>I think I could deal with this problem though because I love the powder so much it doesn&#x27;t even matter.</li>
            <li>Such a nice and thoughtful detail!&lt;br /&gt;The product:&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have used MANY different mineral foundations and this one is just OK.</li>
            <li>Thanks for making such a great product.</li>
            <li>This is a nice powder for very fair skin, and it feels light, covers uneven pink tones.  </li>
            <li>will update this review when I have used this powders a little more, but for now, I am pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li>also noticed a useful gift.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t need it, but it would be useful for someone who likes to tan their body, but not their face during the summer.  </li>
            <li>like fresh linen&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>so every time I open the jar there&#x27;s powder filled to the top of the sifter</li>
            <li>This is such a great feature because even when you are buying your own shade, they are sending you two small gifts for you to personalize your concealer and foundation.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Bare Minerals for years and love it</li>
            <li>Also I looked cakey and made up if I put on a second layer trying to cover more.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice product but didn&#x27;t have the under eye circle coverage I had expected.</li>
            <li>First Impressions:&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>what I appreciate the most, was the personal handwriten message.</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li>This is better than the ELF minerals, and that was the only makeup that would work for me UNTIL NOW!</li>
            <li>The container is slightly tough to use, and it doesnt brush on as smooth and easy as I would like over my moisturizer, but it&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>and I cannot convey my thanks enough to her for all her support-:)</li>
            <li>When I had trouble with my shipment (not the company&#x27;s fault at all), Patti was kind enough to make sure I got a replacement powder without charging me.</li>
            <li>It may work better on a dry face, but I have to use moisturizer with sunblock in it before applying make up.  </li>
            <li>Very highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I am in my late forties with oily skin, large pores, and fair skin.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It really covers, really lasts, and does not settle into pores.  </li>
            <li>so it works really well.</li>
            <li>SHE REALLY CARES</li>
            <li>on-time (free standard shipping</li>
            <li>(pale w/ warm undertones)&lt;br /&gt;-Smaller size than I thought</li>
            <li>I also live in a hot (sweaty) climate and have to wear sunscreen under makeup.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better results from other brands.</li>
            <li>I am throwing them all away, because they either don&#x27;t cover redness, don&#x27;t last more than a couple hours, and/or clog my large pores so much that my nose had a constellation of white dots.  </li>
            <li>The makeup blends fine on oily or dry skin.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;It comes with two small side powders: one porcelain and one cocoa color for you to adjust the concealer and foundation to your own shade.</li>
            <li>It offers nice coverage without a heavy look or accentuating expression</li>
            <li>The powder is so fine and soft, and you get so much product--definiitely worth the money, especially since they gave me two small powders in dark brown &amp; light ivory (to alter the color to suit your skin tone), a free mineral eyeshadow, AND a free foundation brush, plus a sweet little note.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for problematic skin.</li>
            <li>Dior Airflash, Maybelline Super Stay, Maybelline Mineral Powder, Bobbi Brown Long Wearing, Covergirl Tone Rehab, and Shiseido Radiant Lifting.  </li>
            <li>I have fair skin and the color was slightly too dark.  </li>
            <li>Reasonably priced and solid NATURAL product!!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first I&#x27;ve tried so far that actually gives me the coverage I have been needing.</li>
            <li>They even include a light and dark powder so you can adjust it according to the season!</li>
            <li>but so far I don&#x27;t think I need to.</li>
            <li>It also comes with 2 tiny vials, one is much darker, medium brown in color, and the other is pretty white.  </li>
            <li>I just bought a second jar of this to keep in my desk at work, to touch up at the end of the day, but so far it doesn&#x27;t seem to need it very much, and nothing like other foundations which are basically gone at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>old daughters laugh and tease me one too many times, saying that I either looked like a ghost or that I looked like I had a bad &amp;#34;Snooki&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Product came faster than expected, and with the light and dark powders to match your tone.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell u the last time I ever met someone so gracious and aboveall professional.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and it covers red blotchiness all day without looking caked on.</li>
            <li>.arrived on time and in pretty little pouches.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the light shade which seemed a little dark for me, but I added the lighter of the two colors that come with it to customize your shade</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Thank you for your excellent customer service. You truly dedicate your work towards us customers. Amazing value, product, and packaging. Fast shipping. Don&#x27;t hesitate to try this. Will be doing service with Grace my face minerals here on out, as long as they are in business. Thank you.</li>
            <li> This foundation is fantastic.  It really covers, really lasts, and does not settle into pores.  I am in my late forties with oily skin, large pores, and fair skin.  I also live in a hot (sweaty) climate and have to wear sunscreen under makeup.  Just now I looked in my bathroom cupboard and in there were the following foundations I purchased in the past few months, trying to find something that worked:  Dior Airflash, Maybelline Super Stay, Maybelline Mineral Powder, Bobbi Brown Long Wearing, Covergirl Tone Rehab, and Shiseido Radiant Lifting.  I am throwing them all away, because they either don&#x27;t cover redness, don&#x27;t last more than a couple hours, and/or clog my large pores so much that my nose had a constellation of white dots.  Also I looked cakey and made up if I put on a second layer trying to cover more.  You can layer Grace My Face foundation much more easily, and it spreads around well with the brush.  In the past couple days, 2 people have told me my face \\&quot;looks thinner.\\&quot;  The only thing that is different is the makeup; my face is a uniform, natural-looking color instead of various shades of red in the T-zone.  I just bought a second jar of this to keep in my desk at work, to touch up at the end of the day, but so far it doesn&#x27;t seem to need it very much, and nothing like other foundations which are basically gone at the end of the day.  Very highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It works fine on my face but I wish the jarr was bigger. That&#x27;s why I give 4 stars. The color fits perfect for my skin tone. I would probably purchsate this product again, only wish the jarr comes a little bigger. The makeup blends fine on oily or dry skin. My skin is both oily and dry so it works really well. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product but didn&#x27;t have the under eye circle coverage I had expected. I still looked tired all day when I used it alone, which is what I was looking for 1 product that could cover redness and dark circles.</li>
            <li> My earlier review of this product stated this was lousy and that it didn&#x27;t cover brown spots. Well, this product talks specifically about covering redness -- NOT brown spots, which was my issue.  Hence, for brown spots...not so good; but for redness, this is indeed magic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading my earlier review, the owner of the company contacted me directly and conveyed that she was sorry this didn&#x27;t work ... AND that she would formulate something just for me...in her lab...to help cover up those brown spots.  Well, she went out of her way and did this.  I can&#x27;t tell u the last time I ever met someone so gracious and aboveall professional.  SHE REALLY CARES WHETHER HER PRODUCTS WORK FOR U!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She has since sent me a special formulation that she made up, just for me.  This woman KNOWS her stuff.  Soooo, long story short...this product DOES work and DOES do what it states: covers up the red spots...but most pivotal, the woman who developed this product is AMAZING and I cannot convey my thanks enough to her for all her support-:)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good.  I like that it came with the lighter powder because I needed it.  I have fair skin and the color was slightly too dark.  The container is slightly tough to use, and it doesnt brush on as smooth and easy as I would like over my moisturizer, but it&#x27;s ok.  I usually use a covergirl transluscent compact with no problem.  So I&#x27;ve been using this stuff over the redder part of my cheeks, and then using the covergirl over it to smooth it out and blend in with the rest of my face.  It may work better on a dry face, but I have to use moisturizer with sunblock in it before applying make up.  It hasn&#x27;t caused me irritation or anything.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Bare Minerals for years and love it but it gets so expensive. I contacted the seller to help with color match and they were so helpful! They even include a light and dark powder so you can adjust it according to the season! Feels great on and if you are at all hesitant, contact them. Their customer service is the best I have experienced in a long time...especially from a company online!</li>
            <li> Coverage is awesome. Alot of product for the money. Didnt quite match my skin tone. Pigment to fix color are nice but kind of a pain to mix. Mixed a lot a head of time and put in a separate container.</li>
            <li> Great product a great price!</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing foundation ever!  From the purchase till it arrived at my door was a good experience. . .arrived on time and in pretty little pouches.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.  I have rosacea, and a lot of pink in my skin naturally.  When I tried it, I put it on half of my face and it was like those before and after pictures.  I couldn&#x27;t believe the difference.  It gives a smooth matte look.  I ordered the light shade which seemed a little dark for me, but I added the lighter of the two colors that come with it to customize your shade and then it was perfect for me!  It stays on all day, and it doesn&#x27;t clog your pores.  I just hope it&#x27;s always available on here!  I love it!  I also ordered the blush and eye shadows which are equally amazing!!  I have gotten compliments too!!</li>
            <li> First Impressions:&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed was the fact that the powder comes in a lovely purple pouch. Since purple is my favorite color, I loved it.&lt;br /&gt;It comes with two small side powders: one porcelain and one cocoa color for you to adjust the concealer and foundation to your own shade. This is such a great feature because even when you are buying your own shade, they are sending you two small gifts for you to personalize your concealer and foundation.&lt;br /&gt;I also noticed a useful gift. I loved that too.&lt;br /&gt;But what I appreciate the most, was the personal handwriten message. Such a nice and thoughtful detail!&lt;br /&gt;The product:&lt;br /&gt;I ordered my own shade, so I haven&#x27;t used the the two small containers, but I am very happy with my first day using this product. It offers nice coverage without a heavy look or accentuating expression lines.&lt;br /&gt;I will update this review when I have used this powders a little more, but for now, I am pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> This product works BEAUTIFULLY. And a great bonus that even if you do accidentally purchase the wrong shade for your skin, you receive a small lighter container and a small darker one to match your shade. I have had SO much trouble with powder foundations, so I am overjoyed how well this worked. Definitely worth the price. Highly recommended for problematic skin.</li>
            <li> When I had trouble with my shipment (not the company&#x27;s fault at all), Patti was kind enough to make sure I got a replacement powder without charging me. I was blown away by her prompt response to my email and how sweet and courteous she was. She is the best seller I&#x27;ve ever come across! And this product is incredible. The powder is so fine and soft, and you get so much product--definiitely worth the money, especially since they gave me two small powders in dark brown &amp; light ivory (to alter the color to suit your skin tone), a free mineral eyeshadow, AND a free foundation brush, plus a sweet little note. They obviously put a lot of care into their product and its packaging. I am eternally grateful for their marvelous customer service and for making a great product. I will definitely be buying again! &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I have used MANY different mineral foundations and this one is just OK. It did not cover my not terrible rosacea. I&#x27;ve had better results from other brands.</li>
            <li> What a great product...and for someone with Rosacea!  My Rosacea is not that bad but often my cheeks turn bright red.  This mineral powder works like a charm.  It smells good too.  I especially liked the added touch of the darker and lighter colors for making the mineral the right shade for me!  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it says it does. I have sensitive skin and it covers red blotchiness all day without looking caked on. My skin feels soft and make-up less to the touch. I admit when I found this I was trying to find the ELF mineral makeup and I put this in my cart instead. I was about to delete it but then I read the product description and all the reviews. Product came faster than expected, and with the light and dark powders to match your tone. I haven&#x27;t needed them but I might after a few weeks out in the sun so its nice to have that option. I&#x27;ve tried all the standard mineral makeups at the pharmacy and they&#x27;re such a waste of money look terrible on. I tried bare minerals when I couldn&#x27;t find my ELF minerals in the store any longer, and it was OK but not as good. This is better than the ELF minerals, and that was the only makeup that would work for me UNTIL NOW! I couldn&#x27;t say better things about this product. Reasonably priced and solid NATURAL product!!  Ok still love the product, but the container it comes in is absolutely terrible!! It falls apart in peices and this time the whole lid has broken off! Please improve the packaging and maybe cut costs elsewhere! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I really love this product! It&#x27;s the first I&#x27;ve tried so far that actually gives me the coverage I have been needing. The skin on my nose tends to peel and when it does, I always try to exfoliate it or just pick it off, which never turns out well. When I get the loose peeling skin off, the skin underneath is always very red and raw. As it heals, it kinda scabs over and isn&#x27;t smooth. I have tried different brands of cream, liquid, and powdered (mineral and not mineral) concealers and foundations that I bought at local stores. They all gave me the same results. When trying to cover the spots on my nose, they would just end up looking caked on and would make the spots where my skin peeled even more noticeable. As if that weren&#x27;t bad enough, sometimes they would be either too light or too dark for my skin tone. I&#x27;ve had my 11 and 14 year old daughters laugh and tease me one too many times, saying that I either looked like a ghost or that I looked like I had a bad &amp;#34;Snooki&amp;#34; fake tan just on my face! But, this concealer covers so well and does not looked caked on and does not make the spots on my peeling nose more noticeable. Plus, it comes with 2 smaller containers of powder, one lighter and one darker, so you can adjust the shade to match your skin tone. I didn&#x27;t have to do this though because the shade I ordered matched my skin tone perfectly. Plus, it&#x27;s very light and doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel like it&#x27;s suffocating. I&#x27;ve finally found the makeup for me and I will be buying this from now on! I can&#x27;t wait to try some of their other makeup products.</li>
            <li> I love this makeup. This is the first time I&#x27;ve used it and love how light it is, it doesn&#x27;t cake, it&#x27;s shear but covers well, feels really great, came with a great brush and two small tubs to customize the color but so far I don&#x27;t think I need to. I will order this again for sure!</li>
            <li> This is a nice powder for very fair skin, and it feels light, covers uneven pink tones.  It also comes with 2 tiny vials, one is much darker, medium brown in color, and the other is pretty white.  I didn&#x27;t need it, but it would be useful for someone who likes to tan their body, but not their face during the summer.  If you&#x27;re unsure which color you need, this would be a good one to try.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Covers well&lt;br /&gt;-Refillable (explanation on accompanying paper)&lt;br /&gt;-Smells like fresh linen&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t plug pores (I have acne-prone skin)&lt;br /&gt;-Arrived on-time (free standard shipping about 5-8 business days)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Ordered the lightest shade and its too dark for my skin tone (pale w/ warm undertones)&lt;br /&gt;-Smaller size than I thought (tangerine size)&lt;br /&gt;-Messy (that might just be me)&lt;br /&gt;-Tad over-priced</li>
            <li> This is a great product, the best makeup i&#x27;ve found for my really bad rosacea.  This is the third time i&#x27;ve ordered it and I will keep ordering it.  Thanks for making such a great product.</li>
            <li> This powder is the best makeup I have ever used! Even better than Bare Minerals because its cheaper and works better for acne prone skin. This foundation covers my face really well, layers excellently and works great to conceal flaws. The only thing I wish was different is the jar, because I travel a lot and there&#x27;s no way to keep the powder in the bottom compartment of the jar so every time I open the jar there&#x27;s powder filled to the top of the sifter. I think I could deal with this problem though because I love the powder so much it doesn&#x27;t even matter. I will never use any other makeup, perfect price, perfect product!</li>
