            <li>This is a great shame.</li>
            <li>The color is great but wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li>The color is great.</li>
            <li>The top of my head was an awesome Crimson color, but the rest was darker.  </li>
            <li>bright.</li>
            <li>The bleach was good but the dye wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>The shade looks good with my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used your brand before and loved it</li>
            <li>had really good color but wasn&#x27;t what i was expecting .</li>
            <li>The results are very satisfying.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the immediate results.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s appropriate for work!   </li>
            <li>will continue to use this product and love the outcome!</li>
            <li>Rinse with really warm water.</li>
            <li>The label on the box should warn everyone that it will bleed with any kind of contact with water/sweat.</li>
            <li>For those of you with positive reviews, good for you!  </li>
            <li>IS A CHEAP ALTERNATIVE TO GOOD COLOR</li>
            <li>I would have been happy for crayola red lol.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m lucky I have good hair.</li>
            <li>but I am totally OK with that.</li>
            <li>Be sure to put petroleum jelly on any skin along the hair line.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with this</li>
            <li>resulting color was ok.  </li>
            <li>once you want to get rid of it, it stains your hair and you will not be able to get it out.&lt;br /&gt;THIS</li>
            <li>Every time I washed it, the dye bled everywhere (even after it had mostly faded).</li>
            <li>Applied conditioner, waited 5 minutes and rinsed some more.</li>
            <li>Love the color :)</li>
            <li>Just make sure you rinse with apple cider vinegar after if you use baking soda (to balance the pH).</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Quite surprising since I noticed color changes after every wash (not drastic, but the reds and pinks don&#x27;t stay consistent).</li>
            <li>this was so easy to use and loved the color,just remember baking soda and water right away will get color off face and hands</li>
            <li>The color, however, seems to want to stick (this would be awesome if I wasn&#x27;t set on pink).</li>
            <li>This was unexpectedly a great product (I have heard many mixed reviews about Splat).</li>
            <li>Just make sure you splash the shower walls with clean water as you rinse.</li>
            <li>but the color is still going strong.</li>
            <li>Not using the colors again but the bleach done right is actually one of the best I&#x27;ve found in a kit.</li>
            <li>Everything seemed fine.</li>
            <li>(that&#x27;s my hair, not the bleach), the product went on fine (no orange tones at all).</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use the gloves that come in the box, they are huge and too flimsy.</li>
            <li>After looking into available dyes, I determined that Splat Crimson Obsession appeared to be the correct shade.</li>
            <li>you get a light  pinkish fuchsia color.</li>
            <li>: The color is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Hand sanitizer is the best thing to have on hand, just touching my sisters hair now dyed anything, hand sanitizer at least cleans it off again.</li>
            <li>Be sure to use petroleum jelly to put a good layer around your ears, hairline, back of neck, forehead, etc.</li>
            <li>I have been doing my own hair for years and have always had decent to fantastic results.</li>
            <li>My hair is pretty healthy considering I just bleached it.</li>
            <li>When you use splat make sure to keep heating your hair with the blow dryer or set out in the sun, keep your hair as warm as possible to soak up the color.</li>
            <li>easy to fix just went out and bought some good bleaching powder and developer and fixed my hair to a nice shade of blonde.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t go super light on the bleaching either</li>
            <li>When you wash your hair, put it in a towel as soon as it&#x27;s clean and put it up in the ratty towel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bright red color.</li>
            <li>The only good part about the dye was the color</li>
            <li>, this was a full on magenta.</li>
            <li>Even so, my hair did come out a lovely vibrant red that I loved.  </li>
            <li>Other than this one drawback though, the product is great.</li>
            <li>but luckily my bangs cover it</li>
            <li>your hands will get stained but after the second wash it gets better, one thing I love is the highlight you get through out your hair..</li>
            <li>If your hair is highly damaged it will be more porous and the dye will fade a lot faster.</li>
            <li>This was my first time using Splat!</li>
            <li>It does look like a blood bath at first!</li>
            <li>I like this product better than Manic Panic, but only because it washes off of my skin easily.</li>
            <li>The color would have been more vibrant if I had bleached it, but I wasn&#x27;t willing to risk bleaching it myself.  </li>
            <li>weeks later I still have amazingly radiant hair with no damage.&lt;br /&gt;Yes</li>
            <li>This color covered the highlights nicely and the copper is now berry red.</li>
            <li>I will not be a buyer of this anytime soon after this traumatizing experience because now I have to spend $100 getting my hair fixed to a better color</li>
            <li>Even though I was coloring my hair red, it just ended up looking really old-fashioned, and not in a good way.</li>
            <li>however it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li>even more surprised when I pulled the foil to rinse after 35 min</li>
            <li>Nice red at first but fade really quickly after about 2 or 3 washes turns to a kind of orange or strawberry blonde</li>
            <li>The red came out a Cherry Coke red and it&#x27;s gorgeous!</li>
            <li>I found that using nailpolish remover right away can remove the stain.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I even see hints of purple in the right lighting.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t washed my hair yet but the dye does rub off onto your skin, my neck and hands especially, but it washes off very easily.</li>
            <li>This prevents stains on the good towels you own and you won&#x27;t find red drips on your back later.    </li>
            <li>~ it&#x27;s more like a raspberry/wine color (lots of blue undertones)</li>
            <li>In the sunlight, you could see a lot more red.</li>
            <li>Funny how some people want to make it seem like its the bomb</li>
            <li>I left the bleach on for about an hour, took most of the color out.</li>
            <li>I did exactly as the directions instructed.</li>
            <li>I red the instructions and made sure that you could use this for highlights.</li>
            <li>I washed it 3 times tonight in hot water</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my first time using it</li>
            <li>It did not bleach/color evenly (varied from no difference from my regular hair color to orange to bright red).</li>
            <li>Luckily I bought an ash dark blond that mostly colored.</li>
            <li>The positive:   </li>
            <li>I would cover with the dark red lol.</li>
            <li>but this is too much now.</li>
            <li>My hair takes color very well.</li>
            <li>so I covered my walls and used double gloves, not trusting the cheap ones provided.</li>
            <li>I sleep directly on a light blue pillow case and haven&#x27;t had any staining on that.</li>
            <li>but I decided that I really want more of a pink.</li>
            <li>but this works better for me than any other soap.</li>
            <li>I will NEVER buy splat again, if I see anyone looking at the product I will tell them if they used it they will end up more disappointed than happy</li>
            <li>The color is lovely but not worth the Hassel....</li>
            <li>I use to use manic panic but no matter how long I left the dye on it never lasted more than a month without way to much fading.</li>
            <li>The color is very pretty and looks like the box however, I started with a color that was semi similar and did not bleach my hair, so I can&#x27;t say how it would look</li>
            <li>up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the 2 boxes of color, but really would have been more comfortable with 3 since my hair is long and thick.</li>
            <li>Also make sure to use deep conditioners or lather on the coconut oil after because both processes are known to dry out your hair.</li>
            <li>After 2-3 times, all that was left was a very light pink.</li>
            <li>Deciding for a new change and to just go along with this shameful new package because I figured a replacement would never occur, on went the gloves</li>
            <li>I left the bleach in for 40 minutes with originally dark red hair and was impressed by the soft blonde hair I was left with.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>When I washed it out, my hair was super dry.</li>
            <li>so I was surprised they had decent bleach (however did not see developer volume) and</li>
            <li>The color was exactly as I imagined: a deep, sort of \\&quot;blood-red\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>The color is definitely not the same as the box, but I actually like it better.</li>
            <li>I plan on dyeing it with another brand in a week to a light pink if I can fade this out fast enough.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t rinse clean for a very long time and when you touch your hair while barely damp they turn</li>
            <li>/&gt;They have better colors and they actually do come out and bleed waaaaay less.</li>
            <li>The bleach was fantastic and while it did turn my hair a little yellowish</li>
            <li>Water still hasn&#x27;t run clear though</li>
            <li>The instructions said rinse until the water is clear.  </li>
            <li>We rinsed her hair until it came out clear</li>
            <li>It is not a deep crimson it is a light pink.</li>
            <li>I rinsed and rinsed and rinsed until the water was clear.</li>
            <li>And I have tried both beauty supply chain brands and professional cosmetologist store brands.  </li>
            <li>I have natural strawberry-blonde hair that I have been lightening to a bleach-blonde for about 9 years.</li>
            <li>I recommend that you put organic coconut oil in your hair at least an hour before bleaching, and applying the bleach directly on top.</li>
            <li>/&gt;By far the messiest time I&#x27;ve ever had dying my hair and I have dyed my hair quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As I wanted it more dark red than crayola red</li>
            <li>I have dark brown hair and recently had light copper highlights put in, which started getting brassy.</li>
            <li>I regret trying this dye, my once soft and beautiful curly hair is a total mess its stiff and fried, no matter how long u do a deep hair masque</li>
            <li>It will bleed onto your towels, bedding, clothes, and other sections of your light hair, even when it is dry.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I see more red tones, other times pink.</li>
            <li>I expected a slightly faded red, instead I got insanely bright pink.</li>
            <li>My hair takes dye very well, and even semi-permanent dyes typically last several months with gradual fading.</li>
            <li>I decided to try it anyway, since I have read similar negative comments about most direct-dyes I have used, and never had these experiences.</li>
            <li>Also, be very careful with bleaching of \\&quot;hot roots.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Buy a light blonde box dye, and some manic panic or raw if you do it at home.</li>
            <li>so you really have to be careful.</li>
            <li>I did not use the included bleach (I use a different product to lighten my roots), so I applied the dye directly to the section of hair I wanted to color.</li>
            <li>but I was too far to go back.</li>
            <li>Just be smart...use a mask after you dye for a good hour, wash in cold water, and take precautions with the dye, don&#x27;t put bleach on your scalp and Vaseline your face.</li>
            <li>It deeply stains skin for as much as a week, and it continues to bleed out of hair for a very long time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with the product and was shocked the bleach and dye actually replaced my extremely dark hair.</li>
            <li>I looked like a hot mess.</li>
            <li>I later noticed that the blonde hair around the red section had been tinted a very light pink, even though I had washed and dried the dyed hair separately.</li>
            <li>Only use cold water when washing, this will decrease the severity of the color bleeding, but all bright colors bleed regardless of the brand.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars only forthe initial color results, the ease of use, the availability in local drugstores, and all the compliments I received on my hair before the color faded completely.</li>
            <li>so when I finally decided to bleach my hair (started dreadlocks a year ago) and knowing my hair has been resistant to dyes/bleach from previous experiences, I really did not expect a lot from this product.</li>

            <li> Sometimes I even see hints of purple in the right lighting.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t washed my hair yet but the dye does rub off onto your skin, my neck and hands especially, but it washes off very easily.</li>
            <li> This prevents stains on the good towels you own and you won&#x27;t find red drips on your back later.    </li>
            <li> ~ it&#x27;s more like a raspberry/wine color (lots of blue undertones)</li>
            <li> In the sunlight, you could see a lot more red.</li>
            <li> Funny how some people want to make it seem like its the bomb</li>
            <li> I left the bleach on for about an hour, took most of the color out.</li>
            <li> I did exactly as the directions instructed.</li>
            <li> I red the instructions and made sure that you could use this for highlights.</li>
            <li> I washed it 3 times tonight in hot water</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is my first time using it</li>
            <li> It did not bleach/color evenly (varied from no difference from my regular hair color to orange to bright red).</li>
            <li> Luckily I bought an ash dark blond that mostly colored.</li>
            <li> The positive:   </li>
            <li> I would cover with the dark red lol.</li>
            <li> but this is too much now.</li>
            <li> My hair takes color very well.</li>
            <li> so I covered my walls and used double gloves, not trusting the cheap ones provided.</li>
            <li> I sleep directly on a light blue pillow case and haven&#x27;t had any staining on that.</li>
            <li> but I decided that I really want more of a pink.</li>
            <li> but this works better for me than any other soap.</li>
            <li> I will NEVER buy splat again, if I see anyone looking at the product I will tell them if they used it they will end up more disappointed than happy</li>
            <li> The color is lovely but not worth the Hassel....</li>
            <li> I use to use manic panic but no matter how long I left the dye on it never lasted more than a month without way to much fading.</li>
            <li> The color is very pretty and looks like the box however, I started with a color that was semi similar and did not bleach my hair, so I can&#x27;t say how it would look</li>
            <li> up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the 2 boxes of color, but really would have been more comfortable with 3 since my hair is long and thick.</li>
            <li> Also make sure to use deep conditioners or lather on the coconut oil after because both processes are known to dry out your hair.</li>
            <li> After 2-3 times, all that was left was a very light pink.</li>
            <li> Deciding for a new change and to just go along with this shameful new package because I figured a replacement would never occur, on went the gloves</li>
            <li> I left the bleach in for 40 minutes with originally dark red hair and was impressed by the soft blonde hair I was left with.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> When I washed it out, my hair was super dry.</li>
            <li> so I was surprised they had decent bleach (however did not see developer volume) and</li>
            <li> The color was exactly as I imagined: a deep, sort of \\&quot;blood-red\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> The color is definitely not the same as the box, but I actually like it better.</li>
            <li> I plan on dyeing it with another brand in a week to a light pink if I can fade this out fast enough.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t rinse clean for a very long time and when you touch your hair while barely damp they turn</li>
            <li> /&gt;They have better colors and they actually do come out and bleed waaaaay less.</li>
            <li> The bleach was fantastic and while it did turn my hair a little yellowish</li>
            <li> Water still hasn&#x27;t run clear though</li>
            <li> The instructions said rinse until the water is clear.  </li>
            <li> We rinsed her hair until it came out clear</li>
            <li> It is not a deep crimson it is a light pink.</li>
            <li> I rinsed and rinsed and rinsed until the water was clear.</li>
            <li> And I have tried both beauty supply chain brands and professional cosmetologist store brands.  </li>
            <li> I have natural strawberry-blonde hair that I have been lightening to a bleach-blonde for about 9 years.</li>
            <li> I recommend that you put organic coconut oil in your hair at least an hour before bleaching, and applying the bleach directly on top.</li>
            <li> /&gt;By far the messiest time I&#x27;ve ever had dying my hair and I have dyed my hair quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As I wanted it more dark red than crayola red</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair and recently had light copper highlights put in, which started getting brassy.</li>
            <li> I regret trying this dye, my once soft and beautiful curly hair is a total mess its stiff and fried, no matter how long u do a deep hair masque</li>
            <li> It will bleed onto your towels, bedding, clothes, and other sections of your light hair, even when it is dry.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I see more red tones, other times pink.</li>
            <li> I expected a slightly faded red, instead I got insanely bright pink.</li>
            <li> My hair takes dye very well, and even semi-permanent dyes typically last several months with gradual fading.</li>
            <li> I decided to try it anyway, since I have read similar negative comments about most direct-dyes I have used, and never had these experiences.</li>
            <li> Also, be very careful with bleaching of \\&quot;hot roots.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Buy a light blonde box dye, and some manic panic or raw if you do it at home.</li>
            <li> so you really have to be careful.</li>
            <li> I did not use the included bleach (I use a different product to lighten my roots), so I applied the dye directly to the section of hair I wanted to color.</li>
            <li> but I was too far to go back.</li>
            <li> Just be smart...use a mask after you dye for a good hour, wash in cold water, and take precautions with the dye, don&#x27;t put bleach on your scalp and Vaseline your face.</li>
            <li> It deeply stains skin for as much as a week, and it continues to bleed out of hair for a very long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with the product and was shocked the bleach and dye actually replaced my extremely dark hair.</li>
            <li> I looked like a hot mess.</li>
            <li> I later noticed that the blonde hair around the red section had been tinted a very light pink, even though I had washed and dried the dyed hair separately.</li>
            <li> Only use cold water when washing, this will decrease the severity of the color bleeding, but all bright colors bleed regardless of the brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars only forthe initial color results, the ease of use, the availability in local drugstores, and all the compliments I received on my hair before the color faded completely.</li>
            <li> so when I finally decided to bleach my hair (started dreadlocks a year ago) and knowing my hair has been resistant to dyes/bleach from previous experiences, I really did not expect a lot from this product.</li>
            <li> phase, a d does stain the skin if not protected, it holds far longer than any other product I have</li>
            <li> There is also no way one has enough bleach for an entire head of hair unless it&#x27;s like two inches long</li>
            <li> I got busy doing stuff and left it in for over an hour and a half.</li>
            <li> During that time I have used a number of different semi-permanent direct-dyes to color parts of my hair pink, blue, purple, red, etc.</li>
            <li> it will stain your clothes and your hands and even when you flat iron or add curls</li>
            <li> ( my shirt became slightly red even though my hair was dry) .</li>
            <li> Each subsequent time, it faded to an even lighter shade of pink.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t dyed my hair in a long while</li>
            <li> Complete waste of time and effort)</li>
            <li> It also took an unnecessarily long time to fully rinse it out.</li>
            <li> A long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had never used Splat products before, and read several negative reviews regarding quick fading and excessive bleeding/transferring.</li>
            <li> Dye transfer continued to occur even after the hair was completely dry.</li>
            <li> My hair became SO dry after washing my hair..</li>
            <li> (tip: don&#x27;t let your hair dry when bleaching.</li>
            <li> I have short, dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t going platinum since I was planning on dark red</li>
            <li> It is not the dark red I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve spent long amounts of time trying to was it out.  </li>
            <li> I looked in the mirror to find no red streak at all, but all of the blonde highlights on that side of my head were blotchy uneven pink.</li>
            <li> it stayed in until I dyed it again only fading slightly in April.  </li>
            <li> The first time I washed my hair, the dye faded considerably, from a blood-red to a pinkish-red, despite using cold water, and sulfate-free salon-brand shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I would recommend crushed garnet by feria for thr dark red.</li>
            <li> Every time you shower, bring a ratty towel (or black) that you don&#x27;t care about and a second towel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had my hair dyed for a week and a half</li>
            <li> It is super runny though (almost like water) and difficult to contain.</li>
            <li> The easiest way to get color off your skin is by using bath and body works lotion rub it on pretty thick and let it set a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I ended up shelling out a lot of money to fix the flaming red and orange mess it made of my hair.</li>
            <li> Take the rest of your shower and then use the other towel to dry off.</li>
            <li> Just used this product last night and BOY was it messy.</li>
            <li> I woke up to a blond and pink Afro.</li>
            <li> and I thought it had all washed out, (I had used Manic Panic), but the ends of my hair bleached to pink.</li>
            <li> I read and re-read the warnings of not letting it touch your clothes or skin because it would turn it pink.  </li>
            <li> but you have to put in the time if you want legit results and not hair that is pink in one week.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but this wasn&#x27;t even a few shades off the entire color itself is off.</li>
            <li> Just beware that it has a lot of pink tones in it.</li>
            <li> (She used the pink and literally had to cut all of the color out of her</li>
            <li> It was supposed to be a dark red, turned out a purple pinkish mess of a color.  </li>
            <li> The other reviewers are right that the bleach kit is very, very weak.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> U end up with a mess, like a strawberry shortcake&#x27;s doll hair with uneven colors of pink and red and scalp look as if u had psoriasis plus damaged hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;IF you decide to use this, I suggest, at least 3 dark towels, lots of extra gloves, multiple sets of dark clothes, a hose and 3 friends.  </li>
            <li> : Super messy and difficult all around to deal with and maintain.</li>
            <li> It is not exactly \\&quot;crimson\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Well, that was until I finished dying my hair and took the gloves off, only to realize MY HANDS WERE NOW GREEN!</li>
            <li> The color of this on my bleached hair was not pretty.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t experience the dryness a lot of other people have mentioned.</li>
            <li> I would recommend any other brand on the market before this one.</li>
            <li> She got an allergy reaction she had never had before using other hair coloring products.</li>
            <li> It still runs when I wash my hair but not alot the water turns a little pink.</li>
            <li> The color is a dull, lifeless, brownish red.</li>
            <li> I got the Crimson Obsession kit because I wanted a fairly dark color.</li>
            <li> I have dark hair but decided not to bleach because of the horror stories I&#x27;d read and I&#x27;ve never done it before.  </li>
            <li> But please tell me what the average rinsing time is, inquiring minds want to know.</li>
            <li> Every time I use splat it is at least two month before the fading starts to show and of coarse my roots.</li>
            <li> Not worth the hassle nor the money.  </li>
            <li> I have black hard to color hair and went the foil route since I was not doing my entire head.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m down with pink/blue/</li>
            <li> Please be careful and try under armpit  or any other small area and see if you get a reaction.</li>
            <li> This product is incredibly messy compared to other box hair color.</li>
            <li> My permanent black gone</li>
            <li> do I process an hour and a half, just an hour or what?  </li>
            <li> I used two splat bleached, hair color removal, and then a blind high lighting kit all over my head out of desperation.</li>
            <li> found.&lt;br /&gt;A few things that may help, if you have thick or long hair, use two boxes.  </li>
            <li> It will protect your hair from the harsh chemicals and cause less damage than it would otherwise.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;The dying part was a little messy.</li>
            <li> I had very dark hair with Mahoney highlights...</li>
            <li> It is extremely messy, stains everything it touches.  </li>
            <li> After I towel dried my hair</li>
            <li> Yes, the product is messy and it runs and it dyes your scalp, but you get that with every semi-permanent dye on the market.</li>
            <li> Now, I don&#x27;t expect much of this letter except for to say that there were a few problems I faced including the fact that Ii I received the wrong color!  </li>
            <li> but I immediately wash the crap out of my hair til the water runs clean</li>
            <li> When the color was coming out it started to burn her skin and that was with very little contact with it.</li>
            <li> read mixed reviews so I was wary before I even started.  </li>
            <li> So we bleached her hair (with the expensive bleaching powder and developer) then dyed her hair with the splat color, left it on the amount of time that it said to.</li>
            <li> While it is very messy dying the rinse out</li>
            <li> It is very messy.</li>
            <li> Not only did it stain my hands solely from just rinsing it out, it left my tub stained this awful pepto bismol color and my scalp looks like it&#x27;s crusted with dry blood...</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s hard to get the color out of your hair  </li>
            <li> but the red is crazy hard to remove.</li>
            <li> All the negative reviews must be people who don&#x27;t know how to use hair color.</li>
            <li> actually color is dangerous</li>
            <li> and I already had orangey dirty blonde hair.</li>
            <li> The negative:  </li>
            <li> If you have thick hair, add 30 min.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s thick, so</li>
            <li> I need to use 2 bottles for my hair and after the first one I knew it was going to be an awful mess</li>
            <li> It WILL stain your hands, face, neck etc and will not come off without serious scrubbing.</li>
            <li> I followed direction to the letter and ended up with a mess that will be expensive for my to fix.</li>
            <li> the colored part of the dye is thin and WILL seep into your scalp and this color in particular makes your scalp look like you have a bloody laceration.</li>
            <li> Sorry maybe you received emerald green from another vendor, because that color we have never sold, nor do we stock it.</li>
            <li> I had dyed my hair a VERY dark brown for a little over a year, so I was nervous to try the Splat hair color kit because bleaching dark hair could go very badly...</li>
            <li> And a tip : Rinse with COLD water not hot.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, other store bought dyes are not only cheaper but easier to use and don&#x27;t leave horrible stains everywhere.</li>
            <li> Bleeds badly even after it is dry.  </li>
            <li> have very thick hair, so I bought 2 boxes.</li>
            <li> It was ridiculously hard to remove and expensive.</li>
            <li> Now, the gloves felt a bit thin, but I felt nothing of it, so I just went along with it.</li>
            <li> I notice that after each wash the color tends to have different properties though, which can be slightly annoying.</li>
            <li> For those saying the bad reviews didn&#x27;t know what they were doing, I&#x27;m not sure what else I could have done with the problems</li>
            <li> I did not bleach my hair and maybe that&#x27;s what went wrong?  </li>
            <li> Sorry for the experience you had.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> The process time of the color is vague.  </li>
            <li> I hate how messy it is</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know how trying to redye another color is going to be but a friend of mine said it will stain your hair and be difficult to bleach out.</li>
            <li> Never before have I had a problem this bad.</li>
            <li> so hopefully no one will be as disappointed as my sister and I are.</li>
            <li> the damage seems to be irreversible :(</li>
            <li> The dye however totally disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product was awful!</li>
            <li> This product is the worst I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> This is the worst hair dye ever.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the it made my hair a horrible orange,</li>
            <li> It was horrible.</li>
            <li> This dye was AWFUL.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s disgusting.    </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> The bleach was good but the dye wasn&#x27;t. It stained everything including the sink and floor. The color does not seem to be permanent and will stain your clothes even after you dye it ( my shirt became slightly red even though my hair was dry) . And a tip : Rinse with COLD water not hot. The only good part about the dye was the color</li>
            <li> Just used this product last night and BOY was it messy. Stains everything within reach so you really have to be careful. Don&#x27;t use the gloves that come in the box, they are huge and too flimsy. I discovered one had a hole in it when I took them off and I now have two blood-red fingers. Use fitted latex gloves if you can. Other than this one drawback though, the product is great. It is not exactly \\&quot;crimson\\&quot; ~ it&#x27;s more like a raspberry/wine color (lots of blue undertones) but I am totally OK with that. The shade looks good with my skin. I have dark brown hair and recently had light copper highlights put in, which started getting brassy. This color covered the highlights nicely and the copper is now berry red. I did not use the bleach in the kit, so I can&#x27;t comment on that, but I did end up saving the color dye for future applications. A little goes a long way. Definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> This is a freaking awesome color!!!!</li>
            <li> I have short, dark brown hair. I got the Crimson Obsession kit because I wanted a fairly dark color. This product was awful! It did not bleach/color evenly (varied from no difference from my regular hair color to orange to bright red). I left the bleach and color in for the indicated amount of time based on my hair color/type. I ended up shelling out a lot of money to fix the flaming red and orange mess it made of my hair. The hairdresser was impressed with the disaster this product caused. Never again!</li>
            <li> Buyer be ware! It does bleach and die hair. And everything else! Then I tried to remove it from my hair. I&#x27;m lucky I have good hair. I used two splat bleached, hair color removal, and then a blind high lighting kit all over my head out of desperation. My permanent black gone but the red is crazy hard to remove. I had very dark hair with Mahoney highlights...bright. I woke up to a blond and pink Afro. Luckily I bought an ash dark blond that mostly colored. It was ridiculously hard to remove and expensive. Never again</li>
            <li> Splat has always worked well for my hair. Just a warning last time I did red it stayed in until I dyed it again only fading slightly in April.  (Dyed in December)</li>
            <li> Maybe it was just me....  I tried this hair dye because it was on sale and I figured why not.  I did not bleach my hair and maybe that&#x27;s what went wrong?  Even so, my hair did come out a lovely vibrant red that I loved.  BUT the dye got EVERYWHERE!!!  And it stains.  Two days and two through washings later I&#x27;ve got some on my ear still and its staining my shirts!!  Mind you I have been blow drying my hair after washing so it won&#x27;t happen.  Water still hasn&#x27;t run clear though but I&#x27;ve spent long amounts of time trying to was it out.  I don&#x27;t know if its my hair or what....  The color is lovely but not worth the Hassel....</li>
            <li> I have to say, this product works the best out of all that I have tried... And I have tried both beauty supply chain brands and professional cosmetologist store brands.  While it is very messy dying the rinse out phase, a d does stain the skin if not protected, it holds far longer than any other product I have found.&lt;br /&gt;A few things that may help, if you have thick or long hair, use two boxes.  Be sure to put petroleum jelly on any skin along the hair line.  Only use cold water when washing, this will decrease the severity of the color bleeding, but all bright colors bleed regardless of the brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dying my hair since I was 12. This was my first time using Splat! The other reviewers are right that the bleach kit is very, very weak. When I washed it out, my hair was super dry. A tip for you out there: get the Pantene Pro-V 2 Minute Moisture Mask and let it sit on your hair overnight. Worked wonders on my bleach damaged hair. My hair was purple before and I thought it had all washed out, (I had used Manic Panic), but the ends of my hair bleached to pink. I looked like an anime character. I left my hair bleached for a couple of days then used the Crimson Red hair dye. The results are very satisfying. The red came out a Cherry Coke red and it&#x27;s gorgeous! I haven&#x27;t washed my hair yet but the dye does rub off onto your skin, my neck and hands especially, but it washes off very easily. Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with this and I have some dye left over that I&#x27;ll probably mix with some conditioner when I wash my hair next. I like this product better than Manic Panic, but only because it washes off of my skin easily.</li>
            <li> Well, I wrote a letter to Splat to show how livid I was so rather than spend the next 20 minutes writing ANOTHER rage, I&#x27;ll just copy and paste the letter of issues!  Now, I don&#x27;t expect much of this letter except for to say that there were a few problems I faced including the fact that Ii I received the wrong color!  I got deep emerald, not crimson obsession. That wasn&#x27;t even the only problem! Deciding for a new change and to just go along with this shameful new package because I figured a replacement would never occur, on went the gloves and then I began to dye my hair! Now, the gloves felt a bit thin, but I felt nothing of it, so I just went along with it. Well, that was until I finished dying my hair and took the gloves off, only to realize MY HANDS WERE NOW GREEN! In a rushed effort, I scrubbed my hands as much as possible to no avail. If thats not the ONLY problems, when I rinsed my hair, the color wasn&#x27;t even emerald. I had bleached hair before I dyed it, so it couldn&#x27;t have been a hair color effect. I&#x27;d just like to tell you that you will NOT be getting 5 stars from me! This is a great shame. I&#x27;ve used your brand before and loved it but this is too much now. I will not be a buyer of this anytime soon after this traumatizing experience because now I have to spend $100 getting my hair fixed to a better color that&#x27;s appropriate for work!   EDIT: So, I received an email response. Disgraceful!  &amp;#34;Thank you for your email. Sorry maybe you received emerald green from another vendor, because that color we have never sold, nor do we stock it. Sorry for the experience you had.&amp;#34;  So its my fault that you sent me a product that you &#x27;don&#x27;t stock&#x27;? Obviously you had a box if you sent it to me!</li>
            <li> I decided to try this color.  I have colored my hair for years and had no problem.  None.  Nada.  For those saying the bad reviews didn&#x27;t know what they were doing, I&#x27;m not sure what else I could have done with the problems I had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF you decide to use this, I suggest, at least 3 dark towels, lots of extra gloves, multiple sets of dark clothes, a hose and 3 friends.  Is is best as an outdoor activity.  If you don&#x27;t want everything to turn pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d read mixed reviews so I was wary before I even started.  I have dark hair but decided not to bleach because of the horror stories I&#x27;d read and I&#x27;ve never done it before.  With my luck I&#x27;d end up bald.  Before I started, I read, re-read and consulted with a friend whose daughter uses this brand and color.  I read and re-read the warnings of not letting it touch your clothes or skin because it would turn it pink.  Yes, it does.  Everything. YET, they only provide one pair of gloves.  I layered everything in the bathroom with newspaper.  The process time of the color is vague.  &amp;#34;Process 30 min to an hour.  If you have thick hair, add 30 min.&amp;#34;  I have short hair but it&#x27;s thick, so do I process an hour and a half, just an hour or what?  I ended up letting it process for about an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the rinsing.  The instructions said rinse until the water is clear.  After 2 hours, let me repeat, T.W.O.  H.O.U.R.S., the water N.E.V.E.R. ran clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The resulting color was ok.  The top of my head was an awesome Crimson color, but the rest was darker.  In the sunlight, you could see a lot more red. The color would have been more vibrant if I had bleached it, but I wasn&#x27;t willing to risk bleaching it myself.  For those of you with positive reviews, good for you!  But please tell me what the average rinsing time is, inquiring minds want to know.</li>
            <li> The color of this on my bleached hair was not pretty. The color is a dull, lifeless, brownish red. Even though I was coloring my hair red, it just ended up looking really old-fashioned, and not in a good way.</li>
            <li> My hair takes color very well. Even though my hair was already blonde I used the bleach. My hair looked almost transparent. I didn&#x27;t experience the dryness a lot of other people have mentioned. I kept my color on for over six hours. I have learned with splat the longer you leave in the color the deeper it gets and it lasts a lot longer. I have had it in for over a month now and my hair is still a deep blood red. It still runs when I wash my hair but not alot the water turns a little pink. When you use splat make sure to keep heating your hair with the blow dryer or set out in the sun, keep your hair as warm as possible to soak up the color. When you wash your hair use luke warm or cold water and the color lasts longer. I use to use manic panic but no matter how long I left the dye on it never lasted more than a month without way to much fading. Every time I use splat it is at least two month before the fading starts to show and of coarse my roots. The color may run when washing your hair but it takes forever to fade. The easiest way to get color off your skin is by using bath and body works lotion rub it on pretty thick and let it set a few minutes. Rinse with really warm water. You can also use their hand soap. I don&#x27;t know why but this works better for me than any other soap.</li>
            <li> This product is incredibly messy compared to other box hair color. It deeply stains skin for as much as a week, and it continues to bleed out of hair for a very long time. Just beware and protect. Also, be very careful with bleaching of \\&quot;hot roots.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This product is the worst I have ever used.  It is extremely messy, stains everything it touches.  It was supposed to be a dark red, turned out a purple pinkish mess of a color.  Bleeds badly even after it is dry.  Not worth the hassle nor the money.  I will never ever buy this product again.</li>
            <li> This is the worst hair dye ever.&lt;br /&gt;It bleeds non stop on everything&lt;br /&gt;And once you want to get rid of it, it stains your hair and you will not be able to get it out.&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS A CHEAP ALTERNATIVE TO GOOD COLOR DYE!&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY OR USE!&lt;br /&gt;Just use Manic Panic&lt;br /&gt;They have better colors and they actually do come out and bleed waaaaay less.</li>
            <li> All the negative reviews must be people who don&#x27;t know how to use hair color. I left the bleach in for 40 minutes with originally dark red hair and was impressed by the soft blonde hair I was left with.&lt;br /&gt;The actually color is dangerous so I covered my walls and used double gloves, not trusting the cheap ones provided. I left the dye in for two hours and had bleach on stand by to douse my shower in, no stains left.&lt;br /&gt;Four weeks later I still have amazingly radiant hair with no damage.&lt;br /&gt;Yes the process is a pain in the butt however it&#x27;s totally worth it. Just be smart...use a mask after you dye for a good hour, wash in cold water, and take precautions with the dye, don&#x27;t put bleach on your scalp and Vaseline your face. Be prepared it took me 5 hours...but you have to put in the time if you want legit results and not hair that is pink in one week.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this product and love the outcome!</li>
            <li> I have natural strawberry-blonde hair that I have been lightening to a bleach-blonde for about 9 years. During that time I have used a number of different semi-permanent direct-dyes to color parts of my hair pink, blue, purple, red, etc. My hair takes dye very well, and even semi-permanent dyes typically last several months with gradual fading. Recently, I decided that I wanted to dye the underside of my bangs a deep red color. After looking into available dyes, I determined that Splat Crimson Obsession appeared to be the correct shade. I had never used Splat products before, and read several negative reviews regarding quick fading and excessive bleeding/transferring. I decided to try it anyway, since I have read similar negative comments about most direct-dyes I have used, and never had these experiences. I did not use the included bleach (I use a different product to lighten my roots), so I applied the dye directly to the section of hair I wanted to color. I was very pleased with the immediate results. The color was exactly as I imagined: a deep, sort of \\&quot;blood-red\\&quot;. I later noticed that the blonde hair around the red section had been tinted a very light pink, even though I had washed and dried the dyed hair separately. Dye transfer continued to occur even after the hair was completely dry. The first time I washed my hair, the dye faded considerably, from a blood-red to a pinkish-red, despite using cold water, and sulfate-free salon-brand shampoo and conditioner. Each subsequent time, it faded to an even lighter shade of pink. After 2-3 times, all that was left was a very light pink. Every time I washed it, the dye bled everywhere (even after it had mostly faded). I would not recommend this product unless you want it to only last a week or two. It is very messy. It will bleed onto your towels, bedding, clothes, and other sections of your light hair, even when it is dry. I would recommend any other brand on the market before this one. I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars only forthe initial color results, the ease of use, the availability in local drugstores, and all the compliments I received on my hair before the color faded completely.</li>
            <li> My wife was in ER and was swollen like a balloon. She got an allergy reaction she had never had before using other hair coloring products. Please be careful and try under armpit  or any other small area and see if you get a reaction.</li>
            <li> This should have a zero star  rating. Even when your hair is lightened to almost white you get a light  pinkish fuchsia color. the colored part of the dye is thin and WILL seep into your scalp and this color in particular makes your scalp look like you have a bloody laceration. It WILL stain your hands, face, neck etc and will not come off without serious scrubbing. It doesn&#x27;t rinse clean for a very long time and when you touch your hair while barely damp they turn pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Save your hair, time, and money. Buy a light blonde box dye, and some manic panic or raw if you do it at home.</li>
            <li> Wouldnt recomand bleaching hair . had really good color but wasn&#x27;t what i was expecting . i did bleach my hair though</li>
            <li> I bought this color hoping it was going to be the one that I had been looking for. When I used the bleach kit that came with the it made my hair a horrible orange, easy to fix just went out and bought some good bleaching powder and developer and fixed my hair to a nice shade of blonde. I decided to keep my hair the blonde so my sister said she wanted it. So we bleached her hair (with the expensive bleaching powder and developer) then dyed her hair with the splat color, left it on the amount of time that it said to. We rinsed her hair until it came out clear, however the color died EVERYTHING, our bathtub now looks like a murder happened in it. When the color was coming out it started to burn her skin and that was with very little contact with it. It is not a deep crimson it is a light pink. Never before have I had a problem this bad. I will NEVER buy splat again, if I see anyone looking at the product I will tell them if they used it they will end up more disappointed than happy so hopefully no one will be as disappointed as my sister and I are. The label on the box should warn everyone that it will bleed with any kind of contact with water/sweat. Hand sanitizer is the best thing to have on hand, just touching my sisters hair now dyed anything, hand sanitizer at least cleans it off again.</li>
            <li> A star bc there&#x27;s no option to choose Cero...this product is yunk. Funny how some people want to make it seem like its the bomb when its not. You can follow the instructions and still won&#x27;t get the results it shows on the sample picture in the cover. U end up with a mess, like a strawberry shortcake&#x27;s doll hair with uneven colors of pink and red and scalp look as if u had psoriasis plus damaged hair. I regret trying this dye, my once soft and beautiful curly hair is a total mess its stiff and fried, no matter how long u do a deep hair masque the damage seems to be irreversible :(</li>
            <li> I had dyed my hair a VERY dark brown for a little over a year, so I was nervous to try the Splat hair color kit because bleaching dark hair could go very badly...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick hair, so I bought 2 boxes. I left the bleach on for about an hour, took most of the color out. My hair became SO dry after washing my hair.. to the point that I was even scared to brush it and have it break off. But I worked through it, used some morrocan oil spray and dried and ready to dye with color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dying part was a little messy. ANYTHING the dye touches it will stain. I got a drop on my foot and it is still there (5 days later). Watch countertops, flooring, skin, etc. I found that using nailpolish remover right away can remove the stain. Also try that \\&quot;orange goop\\&quot; soap for skin. Be sure to use petroleum jelly to put a good layer around your ears, hairline, back of neck, forehead, etc. I did get some dye on my scalp, hasnt come off yet but luckily my bangs cover it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the 2 boxes of color, but really would have been more comfortable with 3 since my hair is long and thick. I left the color in for an hour and washed it out. The color is definitely not the same as the box, but I actually like it better. It&#x27;s a bright red color. Hoping it will last a while because the dying process was a bit of a pain!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with the product and was shocked the bleach and dye actually replaced my extremely dark hair.</li>
            <li> Its the same color that you see on the box but it&#x27;s hard to get the color out of your hair  it will stain your clothes and your hands and even when you flat iron or add curls your hands will get stained but after the second wash it gets better, one thing I love is the highlight you get through out your hair.. I hate how messy it is but it does the job</li>
            <li> this was so easy to use and loved the color,just remember baking soda and water right away will get color off face and hands</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t dyed my hair in a long while so when I finally decided to bleach my hair (started dreadlocks a year ago) and knowing my hair has been resistant to dyes/bleach from previous experiences, I really did not expect a lot from this product. I figured once the bleaching came out messed up I would cover with the dark red lol. I have black hard to color hair and went the foil route since I was not doing my entire head. I used to work with stylists and beauticians so I was surprised they had decent bleach (however did not see developer volume) and even more surprised when I pulled the foil to rinse after 35 min and I already had orangey dirty blonde hair. I wasn&#x27;t going platinum since I was planning on dark red so didn&#x27;t worry. The bleach was great! There is also no way one has enough bleach for an entire head of hair unless it&#x27;s like two inches long I ran out and I was just doing maybe 1/4 of my hair (tip: don&#x27;t let your hair dry when bleaching. Complete waste of time and effort) The dye however totally disappointed. I got busy doing stuff and left it in for over an hour and a half. When I got done flushing my hair (I don&#x27;t think the instructions say to do this but I immediately wash the crap out of my hair til the water runs clean so I don&#x27;t end up with stained clothing or bedding) I expected a slightly faded red, instead I got insanely bright pink. Not even close to the supposed red, this was a full on magenta. I&#x27;m down with pink/blue/whatever hair but this wasn&#x27;t even a few shades off the entire color itself is off. I didn&#x27;t go super light on the bleaching either so it should have been darker. Nope. I would have been happy for crayola red lol. Not using the colors again but the bleach done right is actually one of the best I&#x27;ve found in a kit.</li>
            <li> I looked like Magenta off of Blues Clues. It was horrible. I did exactly as the directions instructed. I looked like a hot mess. Will not be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I bought this with intentions of adding a red streak to my brown with blond highlighted hair. I have been doing my own hair for years and have always had decent to fantastic results. I red the instructions and made sure that you could use this for highlights. As I wanted it more dark red than crayola red I didn&#x27;t bleach my streak before applying the dye. I sectioned out my hair, applied the dye (yes, with only 1 streak the dye got everywhere and stained my arms, cheek, and shirt) and foiled it so that it would stay contained to that piece. Everything seemed fine. I waited an hour and then rinsed. I rinsed and rinsed and rinsed until the water was clear. Applied conditioner, waited 5 minutes and rinsed some more. After I towel dried my hair I looked in the mirror to find no red streak at all, but all of the blonde highlights on that side of my head were blotchy uneven pink. I am so livid. I don&#x27;t understand how they can say that you can do highlights, sections, or anything controlled at all with this product. I followed direction to the letter and ended up with a mess that will be expensive for my to fix.</li>
            <li> The positive:   The color is very pretty and looks like the box however, I started with a color that was semi similar and did not bleach my hair, so I can&#x27;t say how it would look had I done that.    The negative:  This dye was AWFUL. The instructions do warn you that it will stain but HOLY S***. Not only did it stain my hands solely from just rinsing it out, it left my tub stained this awful pepto bismol color and my scalp looks like it&#x27;s crusted with dry blood...it&#x27;s disgusting.    In my opinion, other store bought dyes are not only cheaper but easier to use and don&#x27;t leave horrible stains everywhere.</li>
            <li> Great price! Love the color :)</li>
            <li> It is not the dark red I was hoping for. I would recommend crushed garnet by feria for thr dark red.</li>
            <li> This was unexpectedly a great product (I have heard many mixed reviews about Splat). I don&#x27;t have any experience with bleaching or dying my hair at home, and had a friend do it for me in my dorm room. The bleach was fantastic and while it did turn my hair a little yellowish (that&#x27;s my hair, not the bleach), the product went on fine (no orange tones at all). I recommend that you put organic coconut oil in your hair at least an hour before bleaching, and applying the bleach directly on top. It will protect your hair from the harsh chemicals and cause less damage than it would otherwise.    As for the dye, it is a beautiful color. Just beware that it has a lot of pink tones in it. I left the color on for about 2 hours and then rinsed it. Yes, the product is messy and it runs and it dyes your scalp, but you get that with every semi-permanent dye on the market. The severity of this will vary by brand and color (according to the hours of research I&#x27;ve done). I rinsed my hair with lukewarm water. The shower I used was white and it didn&#x27;t stain at all. Just make sure you splash the shower walls with clean water as you rinse. It does look like a blood bath at first! I sleep directly on a light blue pillow case and haven&#x27;t had any staining on that. My clothes aren&#x27;t an issue because I have a pixie cut. It does get stuck under your fingernails every time you scratch your head. Every time you shower, bring a ratty towel (or black) that you don&#x27;t care about and a second towel. When you wash your hair, put it in a towel as soon as it&#x27;s clean and put it up in the ratty towel. Take the rest of your shower and then use the other towel to dry off. This prevents stains on the good towels you own and you won&#x27;t find red drips on your back later.    I&#x27;ve only had my hair dyed for a week and a half but the color is still going strong. I notice that after each wash the color tends to have different properties though, which can be slightly annoying. Sometimes I see more red tones, other times pink. Sometimes I even see hints of purple in the right lighting. I&#x27;ve been taking a lot of precautions to keep the color vibrant (colder water, shampooing less often). Tonight I decided to start purposely fading it, not because I don&#x27;t like it but I decided that I really want more of a pink. I plan on dyeing it with another brand in a week to a light pink if I can fade this out fast enough. The color, however, seems to want to stick (this would be awesome if I wasn&#x27;t set on pink). Quite surprising since I noticed color changes after every wash (not drastic, but the reds and pinks don&#x27;t stay consistent). I washed it 3 times tonight in hot water and I can&#x27;t see a noticeable difference.    If you do not like the color and want to remove it, please don&#x27;t bleach it unless it&#x27;s your last resort. Splat is a vegetable dye and Vitamin C or baking soda soaks can take the color out. This is what I plan on doing tomorrow. These are way healthier for your hair than bleach and don&#x27;t cause any lasting damage if done correctly. Just make sure you rinse with apple cider vinegar after if you use baking soda (to balance the pH). Also make sure to use deep conditioners or lather on the coconut oil after because both processes are known to dry out your hair. You can google both processes for the step by step methods.    P.S. If your hair is highly damaged it will be more porous and the dye will fade a lot faster. My hair is pretty healthy considering I just bleached it.</li>
            <li> The color is great but wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> Nice red at first but fade really quickly after about 2 or 3 washes turns to a kind of orange or strawberry blonde</li>
            <li> The color is great. I love it. It is super runny though (almost like water) and difficult to contain. It bleeds so I don&#x27;t see how you could do multiple colors. Stained just about everything no matter what I did to prevent it. I need to use 2 bottles for my hair and after the first one I knew it was going to be an awful mess but I was too far to go back. It also took an unnecessarily long time to fully rinse it out. Like... A long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By far the messiest time I&#x27;ve ever had dying my hair and I have dyed my hair quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first time using it so I don&#x27;t know how trying to redye another color is going to be but a friend of mine said it will stain your hair and be difficult to bleach out. (She used the pink and literally had to cut all of the color out of her hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soooo...&lt;br /&gt;Pro: The color is fantastic. Actually looks like the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Super messy and difficult all around to deal with and maintain.</li>
