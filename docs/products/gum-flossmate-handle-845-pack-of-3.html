            <li>Against my better judgement, I ordered this item and figured I&#x27;d deal with the problems.  </li>
            <li>Is it about a million times better than using your fingers to floss your molars?  </li>

            <li>These last long and are excellent</li>
            <li>When I looked into buying more here at Amazon, I was surprised to see all the people complaining about how the quality had changed and the plastic was softer now and the floss slipped.  </li>

            <li>The perfect solution for anyone who has a hard time using either the little plastic flossers OR using floss wrapped around your fingers.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you pull the floss tightly when winding around button.</li>
            <li>The plastic is a little flexible, but has a mostly rigid feel about it.  </li>
            <li>Easy way to floss the teeth, especially to reach the back ones</li>
            <li>Pretty simple to use.  </li>
            <li>is pretty far down the stick.</li>
            <li>It takes a few seconds to load on some floss, are totally reusable, and are easy enough for my two kids to use.  </li>
            <li>use a really long piece of floss and after a couple uses re-tie it so a new part is used.</li>

            <li> Floss slips off, teeth with little separation impossible to floss.</li>
            <li> I am sorry that some reviewers found the Flossmate unacceptable.  </li>
            <li> I hate cutting off finger circulation with dental floss and preloaded flossers use inferior floss.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t hate doing it.</li>

            <li> Great product for anybody who doesn&#x27;t like putting more of those disposable floss picks and floss into landfills and wants to save money. Makes flossing easier so I don&#x27;t hate doing it. Also alot faster and more convenient. use a really long piece of floss and after a couple uses re-tie it so a new part is used.</li>
            <li> I hate cutting off finger circulation with dental floss and preloaded flossers use inferior floss. I didn&#x27;t think these would work.  But they&#x27;re perfect.  Wind your favorite floss around the button and prongs and the handle has the right weight and length to reach all teeth.  Very satisfied and my dentist will be pleased that I&#x27;ll floss more often.</li>
            <li> These were for my husband, he loves them!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Shipped fast.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I purchased 3 of these and after a few weeks of use they all break at the &amp;#34;Y&amp;#34; opening. The older non see through version was much better and made with flexible plastic material which lasts forever.</li>
            <li> I love this thing.  I wouldn&#x27;t floss nearly as much without it.</li>
            <li> I think these are wonderful. My wife thinks it is a little to big. Our daughter loves to use them herself.</li>
            <li> My husband uses these to wrap the floss and then floss his teeth.&lt;br /&gt;We purchases this three pack and it is perfect for what he needs.</li>
            <li> Replace one lost in hotel stay.</li>
            <li> Pretty useless. Floss doesn&#x27;t stay taught in the holder. I&#x27;m better off using my hands.</li>
            <li> Easy way to floss the teeth, especially to reach the back ones and if the teeth are close to each other.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot since it&#x27;s easy to use and I can use whatever floss I want on it. Saves us a lot of money and a lot of trash (in comparison to the single use floss heads which you throw away). My only small complaint is that you cant use as much of the floss that you break off for it since where you loop it around is pretty far down the stick.</li>
            <li> Ten years ago I moved to Asia and brought 4 of these with me.  The last one died (wheel popped off) a couple weeks ago.  When I looked into buying more here at Amazon, I was surprised to see all the people complaining about how the quality had changed and the plastic was softer now and the floss slipped.  Against my better judgement, I ordered this item and figured I&#x27;d deal with the problems.  Well guess what?  The flossmates I received were exactly the same as the ones I had been using for the past ten years!  Boy, was I happy.&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s how to use these properly.  Wrap the floss around the wheel 4 times, then PINCH the forks together as you place the floss in the grooves, then wrap it around the button 4 times.  Is this perfect? No.  Is it about a million times better than using your fingers to floss your molars?  Yes!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using these things for years and I am very happy.  They literally stopped my gingivitis, and my dentist was very impressed.  Good luck!</li>
            <li> Pretty simple to use.  Beats cramming your fingers into your mouth to floss.</li>
            <li> A little hard for my daughter to use. The catch for the floss is hard to load at first</li>
            <li> The floss keeps on getting loose no mater how tightly I have winded it.</li>
            <li> These last long and are excellent</li>
            <li> I am sorry that some reviewers found the Flossmate unacceptable.  I have been using these for over 30 years and I hope they never stop making them.  Just in case, I am ordering multiple items.</li>
            <li> Floss slips off, teeth with little separation impossible to floss. I was trying not to create so much waste with my single use flossers, but I&#x27;ll be going back to those. Will be returning this.</li>
            <li> This handle is great for people with dexterity issues.  It makes flossing so much easier.  Make sure you pull the floss tightly when winding around button.</li>
            <li> Everything worked out fine.</li>

            <li> I purchased these Floss Holders for my kids because the small disposable flossers they were using were getting pricey, and I was getting frustrated with the amount of waste generated by the little one time use flossers.  The Gum Flossers work great at holding the floss for my kids.  It takes a few seconds to load on some floss, are totally reusable, and are easy enough for my two kids to use.  The plastic is a little flexible, but has a mostly rigid feel about it.  I can imagine if someone was too rough with the prongs that they could potentially snap - although that has not happened with us.  At this price for a pack of three, it was totally worth it for us.  Floss is usually very cheap, and in comparison with buying a bag of flossers, even if these broke, it would be cheaper than having to purchase flossers for two kids all the time.  Overall, a very good purchase for us.</li>
            <li> Used this for years, broke the last one I had.  Makes flossing a breeze.</li>
