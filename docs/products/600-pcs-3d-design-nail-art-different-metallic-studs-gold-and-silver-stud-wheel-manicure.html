            <li>Love this Product and the price is great!!!</li>
            <li>Seriously a great selection in this wheel and a good amount of each.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not as bright as the picture suggests.  </li>
            <li>Good thing</li>
            <li>But the size is good for nail art.</li>
            <li>They are good quality though.</li>
            <li>Good variety of shapes.</li>
            <li>Good designs.</li>
            <li>But it was still a good amount.</li>
            <li>and sometimes you get something that&#x27;s... just not as good.</li>
            <li>it looked like good quality until I put them on my nails for design</li>
            <li>but hopefully they are of some good quality.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS STUFF :) seller was awesome</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with the product</li>
            <li>Very cute looks nais on my nails</li>

            <li>The price i guess is ok!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Super cute metal nail art!</li>
            <li>My daughter and her friends love them!</li>
            <li>I love these!</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Very good product and well worth the price.</li>
            <li>These are nice.</li>
            <li>They are a nice quality too.</li>
            <li>buy at your own risk.</li>
            <li>Nice staff.</li>
            <li>The gold toned ones will lose its color and turn silver after a while though, but this is still a nice set.</li>
            <li>But i still liked it.</li>
            <li>There are so many pieces in it, it honestly looks more than 600!</li>
            <li>All beautiful worth the wait</li>
            <li>it comes exactly as pictured and the studs are a good size!</li>
            <li>There is a great variety for the price though so its well worth it to purchase these.</li>
            <li>but it is huge!</li>
            <li>This wheel is HUGE!</li>
            <li>No way there are 600 pieces more like 100.</li>
            <li>These are so cute.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I need a mag light to even see them!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll use them.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re more of a gunmetal shade.  </li>
            <li>The gold studs looked stunning on my nails.  </li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d be able to soak them off with acetone and reuse but that didn&#x27;t turn out so well.  </li>
            <li>I think I got these, and I think I love them...</li>
            <li>it wasnt 600 more like 30</li>
            <li>the stones are ok.</li>
            <li>its ok for the price..</li>
            <li>But I guess it was ok for the price.</li>
            <li>They are so cute.</li>
            <li>From seeing the picture I just didn&#x27;t expect that many.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to count how many I received, although just looking at it you can tell there are fewer than what&#x27;s shown here.</li>
            <li>not the sizes i was expecting but its ok.</li>
            <li>However, what I did receive have worked ok.</li>
            <li>There was not as many of the studs as I thought there would be, def not 600</li>
            <li>The vendor I used was good2deal, so if you want what&#x27;s in the picture they&#x27;re a safe bet.</li>
            <li>Also the shapes I received where not what I wanted more like stars and hearts which I won&#x27;t be using...</li>
            <li>Otherwise they are cute.</li>
            <li>much better quality this time around.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m sure if i counted, there wouldn&#x27;t be 600 pieces, either.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>but theyre cute</li>
            <li>Item is as described, most of the design will work well and stay for a couple days until it gets snagged by fabric or hair but its a given since it is sitting on top of your nail.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t come with as many gems as you see in the photo</li>
            <li>It has 600 assorted metallic gold and metallic silver pieces for my nails, which I love doing all the time.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>Shopping took longer than I would like, but it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m excited to use them!</li>
            <li>Nothing like the picture!!!!&lt;br /&gt;It came quickly and studs are nice</li>
            <li>toes looks so good very one love it.</li>
            <li>Can confirm it has far from 600 pcs, but the pieces look great and it arrived ahead of schedule.</li>
            <li>Loved them I didn&#x27;t get the triangle got some dif ones but other than that it&#x27;s a good deal</li>
            <li>These are also very, very large studs--you&#x27;ll be able to fit maybe two per nail, at most.</li>
            <li>but you get what you pay for...its great for a day design but no long term wear</li>
            <li>There aren&#x27;t nearly 600 pieces, but for the price I sure love them!</li>
            <li>and my nails look fabulous.</li>
            <li>I know the piece is cheap</li>
            <li>They are amazing  , thanks.</li>
            <li>(they were so cheap</li>
            <li>I love these really fun</li>
            <li>received prior to the date listed great product</li>
            <li>Came with a lot for cheap</li>
            <li>I thought the ratings were true, but I guess they are not as accurate as one might hope.</li>
            <li>so, I&#x27;m not disappointed I purchased them.  </li>
            <li>They are cute and the one that I got isnt just silver and good, it has pink in it!</li>
            <li>you love it much rock on</li>
            <li>I was expecting the container to be full like the picture.  </li>
            <li>Shipped fast and the studs are cute.  </li>
            <li>Good low cost set of design nail art</li>
            <li>Other than those 3 sections, I&#x27;m happy with the product; quality and quantity included.</li>
            <li>its beautiful but small amount and small wheel great price!</li>
            <li>Packaged well and quick delivery.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not even worth it to me)</li>
            <li>Definitely get a bang for your buck, nice product.</li>
            <li>Useful for nails and a custom phone case</li>
            <li>my daughter had loads of fun playing with this stuff</li>
            <li>but i use them alot, worth the wait for a couple bucks</li>
            <li>Was worth the wait.</li>
            <li>pretty  cool for the price.</li>
            <li>Still I&#x27;ve managed to use them right</li>
            <li>but I can tell right away that there&#x27;s not 600 pieces.</li>
            <li>These are your average run-of-the-mill nail studs quality wise.</li>
            <li>The only good thing is that I got them early!</li>
            <li>Much better than expected, highly recommend!!!!</li>
            <li>Makes it easy to do cool lasting designs for my daughter and</li>
            <li>These shipped very fast, I received them in a week.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping and the product just as it is described</li>
            <li>it was cheap because there was no where near 600 pieces</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>So much bigger than most 3D nail art wheels.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>Exactly what was shown is what I got.</li>
            <li>Plus on top of that there were only 200 pieces and not 600.</li>
            <li>i didn&#x27;t have a lot of expectation at the first place.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It shipped fast!</li>
            <li>I really recommend ti!</li>
            <li>Exactly what it showed I would recieve all designs were exact amount was exact</li>
            <li>thanks for wasting my time and money!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t provide the exact shapes that were shown in the picture.</li>
            <li>The wheel I received was exactly like the picture, and I probably did get ~600 pieces.</li>
            <li>As with a lot of inexpensive items purchased from overseas, sometimes a vendor will send you the exact item</li>
            <li>In one day your gold/silver tones will rub off and reveal white underneath; even with top coat.</li>
            <li>last time most of the gold pieces looked rusted or discolored.</li>
            <li>Most of the shapes would yield one manicure, though some of the smaller ones had 20ish pieces.</li>
            <li>Well worth the wait when you calculate how much it costs to add these types of things to your nails at the salon.</li>
            <li>thanks for wasting my time and money!</li>
            <li>/&gt;For $2, I can handle the 200pcs, but they could at least be more honest or accurate about what you&#x27;ll actually get when you order the wheel.</li>
            <li>Just received my item in the mail and even though it came prior to the expected delivery date (which I was really happy about)</li>
            <li>and they are super super tiny!</li>
            <li>Well, I certainly didn&#x27;t receive 600 pieces, or the studs as shown.</li>
            <li>Everything went smoothly, but these are much larger than I wanted, much too large for nail art in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I really wanted some of the ones shown</li>
            <li>I got mostly silver and gold and also some pink which I will never use, but for the price I won&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li>but they still work very well for my nail designs.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too cheap to send back</li>
            <li>so there&#x27;s no point to ask for a refund, but this item was very misleading and unsatisfying.</li>
            <li>fast shipping product as described</li>
            <li>much happier this time around.</li>
            <li>not as much variety in the shapes, either.</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward into having gold studs too.</li>
            <li>Came very well put together.</li>
            <li>not as much as in picture though.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to use them on my nails today and see if they look good on the nails at least.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this to anyone and after seeing the other options available to me, I would pay the extra for some better quality.</li>
            <li>Be aware that this is no where near 600 pieces though.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d reccomend using superglue to hold them down and a top coat around the edges!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>What I received was not anything like the picture mostly circles and stars &amp; definitely less than 600 pieces. . .</li>
            <li>I just received my wheel and it was less than 600 more like 100....</li>
            <li>For starters- as many reviews had previously stated: you do NOT get the 600 pieces as advertised.  </li>
            <li>I was looking forward to adding these particular ones to my collection, now I have to find another vendor and order them again.</li>
            <li>The studs were the main reason I ordered this.</li>
            <li>Wish squares were a little smaller but overall great quality</li>
            <li>I ordered these nail art thinking it would be normal size</li>
            <li>Good came a lot earlier than expected however a lot smaller than pictured</li>
            <li>My favorite are the square and round studs.  </li>
            <li>I think its worth it to get such a variety.</li>
            <li>long story short, they&#x27;re just okay.</li>
            <li>; shapes were missing and many duplicates; shipping took well over a month.</li>
            <li>Many of them colored red, pink and brown.</li>
            <li>They came exactly as described and I would definitely buy them again.</li>
            <li>PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOU TIME OR MONEY!</li>
            <li>The other shapes I&#x27;d like better if they were smaller.  </li>
            <li>I expected a case full of gold and silver jewels as written in the description and picture.</li>
            <li>They also require a lot of glue to secure them down.</li>
            <li>, just use nail glue instead of clear nail polish if you want this on longer than one day.</li>
            <li>there are 600 studs when clearly just looking at it</li>
            <li>the product description clearly states that I would be getting &amp;#34;Color and size as picture.&amp;#34; Hmmm....&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>price was reasonable for the the amount of studs it actually had</li>
            <li>Please do not waste your time purchasing this item.</li>
            <li>There is no where near 600 pieces.</li>
            <li>The metallic silver looks old and rustic.</li>
            <li>No where near 600.   </li>
            <li>NOWHERE NEAR 600</li>
            <li>I will not waste my money you losing customers before you get them .This</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get anywhere near 600 pieces either.</li>
            <li>, I had a lot of plans for clients as I&#x27;d hoped to use them professionally.</li>
            <li>There is no where near 600 pieces.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied with the product due to the low price paid.  </li>
            <li>They were okay, very small compared to the picture.</li>
            <li>No way was there 600 pcs, I probably recieved 100 if not less.....</li>
            <li>Some of the shapes, particularly the diamonds, are way too big for nail art.</li>
            <li>However, when it came in the mail, I received a case half filled with variety of different colors instead.</li>
            <li>The small, rectangular studs, which were the ones I was most interested in, are few and all silver, no gold.</li>
            <li>The quality wasn&#x27;t very good, some of the pieces were a little bent which makes it difficult to lay on your nail.</li>
            <li>The container was not sealed and I did not have enough studs to complete my nail art design.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised with the different shapes that came in the package.</li>
            <li>I got exactly what was pictured just slightly less than was advertised 4 out of 5.</li>
            <li>I really like the size of the other shapes though.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a girl that wants a little of everything in my nail art collection,</li>

            <li> Good designs.</li>
            <li> But it was still a good amount.</li>
            <li> and sometimes you get something that&#x27;s... just not as good.</li>
            <li> it looked like good quality until I put them on my nails for design</li>
            <li> but hopefully they are of some good quality.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF :) seller was awesome</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the product</li>
            <li> Very cute looks nais on my nails</li>
            <li> Nice variety, good price, but</li>
            <li> The price i guess is ok!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Super cute metal nail art!</li>
            <li> My daughter and her friends love them!</li>
            <li> I love these!</li>
            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Very good product and well worth the price.</li>
            <li> These are nice.</li>
            <li> They are a nice quality too.</li>
            <li> buy at your own risk.</li>
            <li> Nice staff.</li>
            <li> The gold toned ones will lose its color and turn silver after a while though, but this is still a nice set.</li>
            <li> But i still liked it.</li>
            <li> There are so many pieces in it, it honestly looks more than 600!</li>
            <li> All beautiful worth the wait</li>
            <li> it comes exactly as pictured and the studs are a good size!</li>
            <li> There is a great variety for the price though so its well worth it to purchase these.</li>
            <li> but it is huge!</li>
            <li> This wheel is HUGE!</li>
            <li> No way there are 600 pieces more like 100.</li>
            <li> These are so cute.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I need a mag light to even see them!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll use them.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re more of a gunmetal shade.  </li>
            <li> The gold studs looked stunning on my nails.  </li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d be able to soak them off with acetone and reuse but that didn&#x27;t turn out so well.  </li>
            <li> I think I got these, and I think I love them...</li>
            <li> it wasnt 600 more like 30</li>
            <li> the stones are ok.</li>
            <li> its ok for the price..</li>
            <li> But I guess it was ok for the price.</li>
            <li> They are so cute.</li>
            <li> From seeing the picture I just didn&#x27;t expect that many.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to count how many I received, although just looking at it you can tell there are fewer than what&#x27;s shown here.</li>
            <li> not the sizes i was expecting but its ok.</li>
            <li> However, what I did receive have worked ok.</li>
            <li> There was not as many of the studs as I thought there would be, def not 600</li>
            <li> The vendor I used was good2deal, so if you want what&#x27;s in the picture they&#x27;re a safe bet.</li>
            <li> Also the shapes I received where not what I wanted more like stars and hearts which I won&#x27;t be using...</li>
            <li> Otherwise they are cute.</li>
            <li> much better quality this time around.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m sure if i counted, there wouldn&#x27;t be 600 pieces, either.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> but theyre cute</li>
            <li> Item is as described, most of the design will work well and stay for a couple days until it gets snagged by fabric or hair but its a given since it is sitting on top of your nail.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t come with as many gems as you see in the photo</li>
            <li> It has 600 assorted metallic gold and metallic silver pieces for my nails, which I love doing all the time.</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> Shopping took longer than I would like, but it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m excited to use them!</li>
            <li> Nothing like the picture!!!!&lt;br /&gt;It came quickly and studs are nice</li>
            <li> toes looks so good very one love it.</li>
            <li> Can confirm it has far from 600 pcs, but the pieces look great and it arrived ahead of schedule.</li>
            <li> Loved them I didn&#x27;t get the triangle got some dif ones but other than that it&#x27;s a good deal</li>
            <li> These are also very, very large studs--you&#x27;ll be able to fit maybe two per nail, at most.</li>
            <li> but you get what you pay for...its great for a day design but no long term wear</li>
            <li> There aren&#x27;t nearly 600 pieces, but for the price I sure love them!</li>
            <li> and my nails look fabulous.</li>
            <li> I know the piece is cheap</li>
            <li> They are amazing  , thanks.</li>
            <li> (they were so cheap</li>
            <li> I love these really fun</li>
            <li> received prior to the date listed great product</li>
            <li> Came with a lot for cheap</li>
            <li> I thought the ratings were true, but I guess they are not as accurate as one might hope.</li>
            <li> so, I&#x27;m not disappointed I purchased them.  </li>
            <li> They are cute and the one that I got isnt just silver and good, it has pink in it!</li>
            <li> you love it much rock on</li>
            <li> I was expecting the container to be full like the picture.  </li>
            <li> Shipped fast and the studs are cute.  </li>
            <li> Good low cost set of design nail art</li>
            <li> Other than those 3 sections, I&#x27;m happy with the product; quality and quantity included.</li>
            <li> its beautiful but small amount and small wheel great price!</li>
            <li> Packaged well and quick delivery.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not even worth it to me)</li>
            <li> Definitely get a bang for your buck, nice product.</li>
            <li> Useful for nails and a custom phone case</li>
            <li> my daughter had loads of fun playing with this stuff</li>
            <li> but i use them alot, worth the wait for a couple bucks</li>
            <li> Was worth the wait.</li>
            <li> pretty  cool for the price.</li>
            <li> Still I&#x27;ve managed to use them right</li>
            <li> but I can tell right away that there&#x27;s not 600 pieces.</li>
            <li> These are your average run-of-the-mill nail studs quality wise.</li>
            <li> The only good thing is that I got them early!</li>
            <li> Much better than expected, highly recommend!!!!</li>
            <li> Makes it easy to do cool lasting designs for my daughter and</li>
            <li> These shipped very fast, I received them in a week.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping and the product just as it is described</li>
            <li> it was cheap because there was no where near 600 pieces</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> So much bigger than most 3D nail art wheels.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> Exactly what was shown is what I got.</li>
            <li> Plus on top of that there were only 200 pieces and not 600.</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t have a lot of expectation at the first place.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It shipped fast!</li>
            <li> I really recommend ti!</li>
            <li> Exactly what it showed I would recieve all designs were exact amount was exact</li>
            <li> thanks for wasting my time and money!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t provide the exact shapes that were shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> The wheel I received was exactly like the picture, and I probably did get ~600 pieces.</li>
            <li> As with a lot of inexpensive items purchased from overseas, sometimes a vendor will send you the exact item</li>
            <li> In one day your gold/silver tones will rub off and reveal white underneath; even with top coat.</li>
            <li> last time most of the gold pieces looked rusted or discolored.</li>
            <li> Most of the shapes would yield one manicure, though some of the smaller ones had 20ish pieces.</li>
            <li> Well worth the wait when you calculate how much it costs to add these types of things to your nails at the salon.</li>
            <li> thanks for wasting my time and money!</li>
            <li> /&gt;For $2, I can handle the 200pcs, but they could at least be more honest or accurate about what you&#x27;ll actually get when you order the wheel.</li>
            <li> Just received my item in the mail and even though it came prior to the expected delivery date (which I was really happy about)</li>
            <li> and they are super super tiny!</li>
            <li> Well, I certainly didn&#x27;t receive 600 pieces, or the studs as shown.</li>
            <li> Everything went smoothly, but these are much larger than I wanted, much too large for nail art in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I really wanted some of the ones shown</li>
            <li> I got mostly silver and gold and also some pink which I will never use, but for the price I won&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> but they still work very well for my nail designs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too cheap to send back</li>
            <li> so there&#x27;s no point to ask for a refund, but this item was very misleading and unsatisfying.</li>
            <li> fast shipping product as described</li>
            <li> much happier this time around.</li>
            <li> not as much variety in the shapes, either.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward into having gold studs too.</li>
            <li> Came very well put together.</li>
            <li> not as much as in picture though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to use them on my nails today and see if they look good on the nails at least.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this to anyone and after seeing the other options available to me, I would pay the extra for some better quality.</li>
            <li> Be aware that this is no where near 600 pieces though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d reccomend using superglue to hold them down and a top coat around the edges!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What I received was not anything like the picture mostly circles and stars &amp; definitely less than 600 pieces. . .</li>
            <li> I just received my wheel and it was less than 600 more like 100....</li>
            <li> For starters- as many reviews had previously stated: you do NOT get the 600 pieces as advertised.  </li>
            <li> I was looking forward to adding these particular ones to my collection, now I have to find another vendor and order them again.</li>
            <li> The studs were the main reason I ordered this.</li>
            <li> Wish squares were a little smaller but overall great quality</li>
            <li> I ordered these nail art thinking it would be normal size</li>
            <li> Good came a lot earlier than expected however a lot smaller than pictured</li>
            <li> My favorite are the square and round studs.  </li>
            <li> I think its worth it to get such a variety.</li>
            <li> long story short, they&#x27;re just okay.</li>
            <li> ; shapes were missing and many duplicates; shipping took well over a month.</li>
            <li> Many of them colored red, pink and brown.</li>
            <li> They came exactly as described and I would definitely buy them again.</li>
            <li> PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOU TIME OR MONEY!</li>
            <li> The other shapes I&#x27;d like better if they were smaller.  </li>
            <li> I expected a case full of gold and silver jewels as written in the description and picture.</li>
            <li> They also require a lot of glue to secure them down.</li>
            <li> , just use nail glue instead of clear nail polish if you want this on longer than one day.</li>
            <li> there are 600 studs when clearly just looking at it</li>
            <li> the product description clearly states that I would be getting &amp;#34;Color and size as picture.&amp;#34; Hmmm....&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> price was reasonable for the the amount of studs it actually had</li>
            <li> Please do not waste your time purchasing this item.</li>
            <li> There is no where near 600 pieces.</li>
            <li> The metallic silver looks old and rustic.</li>
            <li> No where near 600.   </li>
            <li> NOWHERE NEAR 600</li>
            <li> I will not waste my money you losing customers before you get them .This</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get anywhere near 600 pieces either.</li>
            <li> , I had a lot of plans for clients as I&#x27;d hoped to use them professionally.</li>
            <li> There is no where near 600 pieces.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied with the product due to the low price paid.  </li>
            <li> They were okay, very small compared to the picture.</li>
            <li> No way was there 600 pcs, I probably recieved 100 if not less.....</li>
            <li> Some of the shapes, particularly the diamonds, are way too big for nail art.</li>
            <li> However, when it came in the mail, I received a case half filled with variety of different colors instead.</li>
            <li> The small, rectangular studs, which were the ones I was most interested in, are few and all silver, no gold.</li>
            <li> The quality wasn&#x27;t very good, some of the pieces were a little bent which makes it difficult to lay on your nail.</li>
            <li> The container was not sealed and I did not have enough studs to complete my nail art design.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with the different shapes that came in the package.</li>
            <li> I got exactly what was pictured just slightly less than was advertised 4 out of 5.</li>
            <li> I really like the size of the other shapes though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a girl that wants a little of everything in my nail art collection,</li>
            <li> I got my package today and some of the other customers said, that there was no where near 600 jewels.</li>
            <li> All I wanted were gold and silver studs in various sizes, instead I got really, really tiny metal pieces in yellow, brown, black, white and red.</li>
            <li> Gave me the wrong order other than that they are okay</li>
            <li> It sucks because I really wanted the wheel in the picture.</li>
            <li> But they did take a long time to ship (perhaps I&#x27;m used to Amazon Prime?).</li>
            <li> Also like people have been saying, there is not nearly 600 pieces.</li>
            <li> Way smaller then I expected.</li>
            <li> They were a bit larger than I expected.</li>
            <li> TOOOOOOOO LONG</li>
            <li> Pieces are bigger than I expected.</li>
            <li> Says it&#x27;s suppose to have be gold and silver but there is pink and white.</li>
            <li> but there IS NOT nearly 600 pieces.</li>
            <li> A month is too long to wait.</li>
            <li> Arrived earlier then expected</li>
            <li> My only issue is that they do not have a flat back so there is little surface area to put glue on</li>
            <li> However, I got red, white and black and bronze colored studs.</li>
            <li> They came in different colors like black whit and red</li>
            <li> product will only be getting one star because the other 4 are in the package they sent me.</li>
            <li> I got no where near 600 pieces and the studs are way small.</li>
            <li> Kind of disappointed in this purchase</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a little big, straight and hollow on the inside, so it makes them hard to place on a curved nail.</li>
            <li> The majority of the studs are round and are red and white with few actually gold or silver.</li>
            <li> and they were black, red, and bronze, no silver.</li>
            <li> I see that in the reviews for these studs too, some folks got a set with less than 200 pieces or had slightly different studs.</li>
            <li> less pieces and the shapes are not all the same one as shown</li>
            <li> some of the squares are way to big, in the pic there are no stars in my tray there are stars some tear drop looking ones &amp; black circles.</li>
            <li> and they are little larger than I thought they would be</li>
            <li> so that is to be expected.</li>
            <li> Mine arrived sooner than I expected so that is always a plus.</li>
            <li> it came before expected shipping day</li>
            <li> Package arrived before the expected delivery date.</li>
            <li> Only used them a few times.</li>
            <li> not what I expected</li>
            <li> Ahhhh, not really.</li>
            <li> The biggest drawback for me is you don&#x27;t receive the same studs as pictured--for example, here they show round gold ones; none came with my wheel, and it had hearts and stars instead.</li>
            <li> but I expected it to be like the picture, all gold and silver and was looking forward to using the shapes shown.</li>
            <li> If you remove with acetone be careful because it will remove the gold color on studs.</li>
            <li> They were not what I expected and what they were described as.</li>
            <li> this is nothing like what I got, shapes and quantity were different but for 1 buck what can you expect I guess,but shipping was really fast other than that not happy with this purchase!!</li>
            <li> And certainly not 600 pcs.</li>
            <li> Delivery took to long and there were less than 600 pcs.</li>
            <li> i got about 200pc and got dark pink and bronze 3D designs..</li>
            <li> I received studs other than what was pictured.</li>
            <li> I try to be careful when removing to reuse!</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m most disappointed that I didn&#x27;t get the variety of colors in the shapes shown</li>
            <li> then other wheels I have purchased</li>
            <li> It was not great for me since I had some stones of that in a different set I bought before (different place too).</li>
            <li> i wanted silver and gold, i got black, pink, and brown/ purple.</li>
            <li> 2 slots of black rounds, 2 slots of pink rounds, 2 slots pink stars, 2 slots black squares, 2 slots brown/ purple stars, 1 slot brown/ purple squares, 1 slots brown/ purple stars.</li>
            <li> I got these for Christmas and there were way less than promised, and they came with other colors as well as the gold and silver.</li>
            <li> Its not worth even looking at.</li>
            <li> Sooooo, yes it was under $2, but it could at least have been the same product types.</li>
            <li> The wheel is small and maybe holds 200pcs, not nearly 600pcs.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get any of the other shapes!</li>
            <li> Other than that I&#x27;m not sure what I expected for $2.00 from China.</li>
            <li> All I got was stars and pink little cirles with a few squares and black cirles.</li>
            <li> I had less than 200 pieces, and some of the shapes advertised weren&#x27;t included.</li>
            <li> There were less than 150 pieces in this wheel, not 600.</li>
            <li> , I counted and found less then 150 studs</li>
            <li> You will get a lot less.</li>
            <li> the gold turned to silver tone in less than 4 days...</li>
            <li> They arrived from the company slightly tarnished and not as shiny as the picture shows.</li>
            <li> you can tell it&#x27;s way less then that.</li>
            <li> There was less than half of the quantity listed</li>
            <li> I received less than 250 pieces.</li>
            <li> That being said, about half the shapes are usable and I would buy this product again for less than $2 shipped.</li>
            <li> I got less than half the amount pictured.</li>
            <li> Got what was advertised but a little less (prob not 600)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m unhappy but it&#x27;s not worth returning when it doesn&#x27;t cost much to begin with.</li>
            <li> Cutest little things.</li>
            <li> All the little pieces it showed would have, is there.</li>
            <li> I have an abundance of round studs and wanted the other shapes shown, so I&#x27;m not pleased.</li>
            <li> A little less than 200!  </li>
            <li> I received a random bit of red circles and some pink stars.</li>
            <li> but a few did fall off.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Waste your money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy, waste your money.</li>
            <li> Waste of time dividing them.</li>
            <li> Some pieces were missing.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> The ones I got seem to be ok quality, but I&#x27;m disappointed at the amount of false advertising.</li>
            <li> Sadly, it was multi colored (red-purple-white etc....) and only stars and circles.</li>
            <li> update: upon further inspection, i&#x27;ve noticed i got 2 slots gold stars, and 2 slots squares in this weird brown color.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t count the number in the disc I got, but it is not nearly as many as in the picture.</li>
            <li> After soaking them off, the gold faded off into a dull silver shade.  </li>
            <li> so at least i got gold stars.</li>
            <li> I am not very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Just disappointed with what little I received and how tiny the studs are.</li>

            <li> Didn&#x27;t come with everything shown &amp; comes with some things that aren&#x27;t shown so was a little disappointed that I didn&#x27;t get what you see.</li>
            <li> Nothing like it says in the description and the picture is wrong as well.</li>
            <li> wrong colors.</li>
            <li> I got pearls instead of the silver and gold studs that I wanted... lame.</li>

            <li> I was disappointment with this purchase.  It definitely did not look like the picture that was advertised.  The container was not sealed and I did not have enough studs to complete my nail art design. Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> No way there are 600 pieces more like 100. Good thing it was cheap because there was no where near 600 pieces</li>
            <li> These are so cute. They come in various shapes in gold and silver. They go well with any look you are trying to create too!!</li>
            <li> Cutest little things. My nails will be looking fierc!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a little big, straight and hollow on the inside, so it makes them hard to place on a curved nail. Still I&#x27;ve managed to use them right and my nails look fabulous. But they did take a long time to ship (perhaps I&#x27;m used to Amazon Prime?).</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised. Awesome</li>
            <li> The price i guess is ok!</li>
            <li> There are NOT 600 pieces. Kind of disappointed in this purchase but I cant complain for the price I guess....</li>
            <li> I go to the nail shop with this my nails and toes looks so good very one love it.</li>
            <li> Recommend to deal with it</li>
            <li> Love it. So much bigger than most 3D nail art wheels.</li>
            <li> Just recieved it today and they are 84 pieces, not 600. Also the items shown in the picture are not what I recieved. They are different shapes than what picture shows and different colors. I thought the ratings were true, but I guess they are not as accurate as one might hope.</li>
            <li> Definitely not 600 pieces. But the size is good for nail art. Although not all gold and silver. I received a random bit of red circles and some pink stars.</li>
            <li> This is a great deal. Be aware that this is no where near 600 pieces though. Mine came mixed together and will take time to organize but they come internationally so that is to be expected. They are good quality though. Mine arrived sooner than I expected so that is always a plus.</li>
            <li> What I received was not anything like the picture mostly circles and stars &amp; definitely less than 600 pieces. . .</li>
            <li> This nothing like what the picture says. I was expecting to recieve gold and silver studs of different shapes. However, I got red, white and black and bronze colored studs. This is not what I wanted but there&#x27;s no point in returning it or trying to get my money back though. Also like people have been saying, there is not nearly 600 pieces.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much! Exactly what was shown is what I got. Great deal on these! Can&#x27;t wait to use them!!</li>
            <li> Smfh it&#x27;s not what it seem to be no stars</li>
            <li> It was not 600 pieces,  I&#x27;m so disappointed.</li>
            <li> I ordered these nail art thinking it would be normal size and they are super super tiny! I need a mag light to even see them! You will be disappointed by these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to count but I can tell right away that there&#x27;s not 600 pieces. I too received different shapes than in the picture. I really wanted some of the ones shown but I didn&#x27;t get. Other than that I&#x27;m not sure what I expected for $2.00 from China. The studs work and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll use them.</li>
            <li> These are supposed to be gold and silver. But I have a section of maroon stars, a section of maroon circles, and a section of white circles. Those were not advertised and they aren&#x27;t what I paid for. I&#x27;m unhappy but it&#x27;s not worth returning when it doesn&#x27;t cost much to begin with. Other than those 3 sections, I&#x27;m happy with the product; quality and quantity included. I probably won&#x27;t purchase from this seller again,  though.</li>
            <li> Way smaller then I expected.</li>
            <li> These are awful! It was not what was described in the description. They were supposed to be gold and silver studs and they were black, red, and bronze, no silver. They are nothing like what was pictured. Plus on top of that there were only 200 pieces and not 600. I know the piece is cheap but I wouldn&#x27;t have bought these because I won&#x27;t use them!</li>
            <li> Not what i ordered. It&#x27;s Not 600 pc. I got red and brown instead of silver and gold. And it didn&#x27;t have all the shapes it shows in the picture.</li>
            <li> Everything went smoothly, but these are much larger than I wanted, much too large for nail art in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Gave me the wrong order other than that they are okay</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with my purchase, however I didn&#x27;t get what is shown in the picture. I got mostly silver and gold and also some pink which I will never use, but for the price I won&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> The photo is misleading because I definitely didn&#x27;t receive 600 pieces, and the &amp;#34;silver&amp;#34; toned studs are tarnished.  They&#x27;re not as bright as the picture suggests.  They&#x27;re more of a gunmetal shade.  Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied with the product due to the low price paid.  The gold studs looked stunning on my nails.  I thought I&#x27;d be able to soak them off with acetone and reuse but that didn&#x27;t turn out so well.  After soaking them off, the gold faded off into a dull silver shade.  Oh well...you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I think I got these, and I think I love them...I&#x27;ll have to check..</li>
            <li> since I read the comment .... i know the count will be off, so i didn&#x27;t have a lot of expectation at the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it two stars&lt;br /&gt;1) price was reasonable for the the amount of studs it actually had&lt;br /&gt;2) it came before expected shipping day</li>
            <li> It shipped fast! I got exactly what was pictured just slightly less than was advertised 4 out of 5. Would order again</li>
            <li> Came wayyyy earlier than supposed to. Suppose to come on 6/2-6/16 but came on 5/25... Got what was advertised but a little less (prob not 600) but Yea...</li>
            <li> These were packaged well and came on time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Super cute metal nail art! I&#x27;d reccomend using superglue to hold them down and a top coat around the edges!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cute stuff! I really recommend ti!</li>
            <li> They are amazing  , thanks.</li>
            <li> They came exactly as described and I would definitely buy them again. I haven&#x27;t gotten a chance to use any yet so I can&#x27;t judge the quality of the product but there were plenty in the wheel and they look great, I&#x27;m excited to use them! I didn&#x27;t take the time to count them all out (they were so cheap it&#x27;s not even worth it to me) but there is definitely close to 500-600 pieces.</li>
            <li> I love these really fun</li>
            <li> received prior to the date listed great product</li>
            <li> some were mixed up when i got them but it doesnt bother me. theres different sizes and theyre perfect for nails :)</li>
            <li> I had less than 200 pieces, and some of the shapes advertised weren&#x27;t included. The ones I got seem to be ok quality, but I&#x27;m disappointed at the amount of false advertising.</li>
            <li> Not as described. There were less than 150 pieces in this wheel, not 600.</li>
            <li> Package arrived before the expected delivery date. Only giving 4 stars because instead of being all silver and gold/brass as advertised, there was a section of fushia colored studs.</li>
            <li> Much better than expected, highly recommend!!!!</li>
            <li> Definitely get a bang for your buck, nice product. Maybe its because I didn&#x27;t apply them correctly but a few did fall off. Only used them a few times.</li>
            <li> it wasnt 600 more like 30</li>
            <li> They were okay, very small compared to the picture.</li>
            <li> Not 600 pieces and not what the picture says</li>
            <li> This was a lie about 600 pcs. It about 20</li>
            <li> Please do not waste your time purchasing this item. Its not worth even looking at. The pieces do not look like on the advertisment. And it definitely does not have 600 pieces. PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOU TIME OR MONEY!</li>
            <li> Got my friends jealous!</li>
            <li> the stones are ok. not what I expected</li>
            <li> They were a bit larger than I expected. Good variety of shapes. 👍🏻</li>
            <li> its ok for the price..</li>
            <li> was a Gift for My Niece, she say they are great to use.</li>
            <li> 600 pcs? Ahhhh, not really. Maybe 100, but for the price, I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> Makes it easy to do cool lasting designs for my daughter and I nails at home!</li>
            <li> I give this product 4 stars because all the pieces where not gold and silver, I had some fucsia too. It was not great for me since I had some stones of that in a different set I bought before (different place too). But I guess it was ok for the price.</li>
            <li> never buying it again!! i got about 200pc and got dark pink and bronze 3D designs.. It&#x27;s nothing like in the picture...</li>
            <li> Good came a lot earlier than expected however a lot smaller than pictured</li>
            <li> The quality wasn&#x27;t very good, some of the pieces were a little bent which makes it difficult to lay on your nail. Also there was only 257 pieces (counted twice). Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Not even a 3rd part arrived that in the picture looks like</li>
            <li> These are your average run-of-the-mill nail studs quality wise. There is a great variety for the price though so its well worth it to purchase these. My only issue is that they do not have a flat back so there is little surface area to put glue on and when you put glue on the edges and put them on the nail, you can see the glue.</li>
            <li> Delivery took to long and there were less than 600 pcs. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> this is nothing like what I got, shapes and quantity were different but for 1 buck what can you expect I guess,but shipping was really fast other than that not happy with this purchase!!</li>
            <li> Ummm no where did I order red studs annnnd i got red mixed with gold and silver. There&#x27;s probably 50 peices in this. It also took almost a month for this to arrive.</li>
            <li> its PERFECT BUT THE DELIVERY TIME WAS JUAT TOOOOOOOO LONG</li>
            <li> It is terrible. Dont buy it. Waste your money.</li>
            <li> They are so cute. And received them faster than estimated</li>
            <li> Pieces were all mixed together. Container did not hold them in their individual places.</li>
            <li> It was delivered in a timely manner.  Very satisfied with the product and it serves it&#x27;s purpose, just use nail glue instead of clear nail polish if you want this on longer than one day.</li>
            <li> excellent product meets its specification and arrived at the stipulated time</li>
            <li> NOT AS ADVERTISED!! I am not very happy with this purchase. I only got about 200 of the 600 I purchase. Also the description says gold &amp; silver, and I only got silver ones. I definitely don&#x27;t recommend it and won&#x27;t be buying from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Product arrived as described</li>
            <li> I just got basically about 10 per compartment I didnt get anything done with these, terrible.</li>
            <li> 156 pieces !!!!! Not 600. Don&#x27;t buy, waste your money. I am really disappointed and it took almost 1month shipping.</li>
            <li> There aren&#x27;t nearly 600 pieces, but for the price I sure love them! They work great and look awesome.</li>
            <li> These are awesome! Nice and shiny! Arrived on time!</li>
            <li> These are very nice for the price. Very happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> It was not 600 pcs -_-</li>
            <li> Got my order today and it didn&#x27;t contain the 600 pcs that it said it had. Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> Came with a lot for cheap</li>
            <li> These shipped very fast, I received them in a week. They are everything they were described to be. I was pleasantly surprised with the different shapes that came in the package. From seeing the picture I just didn&#x27;t expect that many. Very good product and well worth the price.</li>
            <li> After waiting weeks for this wheel of nail studs to arrive I was extremely disappointed in what I received. I bought this because there was a variety of shapes and there were a lot of them. Upon getting the wheel in the mail I noticed there was only about 200 and there squares, hearts, and stars. I would not recommend this to anyone and after seeing the other options available to me, I would pay the extra for some better quality. D:</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to count how many I received, although just looking at it you can tell there are fewer than what&#x27;s shown here. The biggest drawback for me is you don&#x27;t receive the same studs as pictured--for example, here they show round gold ones; none came with my wheel, and it had hearts and stars instead. Some of the studs are the same, it comes in silver and gold for all styles, it does have at least 200 pieces, but I wouldn&#x27;t say this is worth the money. These are also very, very large studs--you&#x27;ll be able to fit maybe two per nail, at most.</li>
            <li> These are nice. My daughter and her friends love them!</li>
            <li> Totally not 600 but it&#x27;s Gucci.</li>
            <li> Was NOT 600 pieces. A little less than 200!  Sucks! I want a refund. 👌🏽😴</li>
            <li> My favorite are the square and round studs.  The other shapes I&#x27;d like better if they were smaller.  And I was hoping for some heart shapes. I&#x27;m a girl that wants a little of everything in my nail art collection, so, I&#x27;m not disappointed I purchased them.  The shipping and packaging were great.</li>
            <li> Good designs. Useful for nails and a custom phone case</li>
            <li> Not what was advertised not 600 pieces. Not gonna purchase again</li>
            <li> For the price is good!!</li>
            <li> So I doubt it was 600 pieces. But it was still a good amount. Got them before the time they said I would get it so that was awesome. Haven&#x27;t used them yet but can&#x27;t wait. They have a great shine</li>
            <li> I swear if I could rate something 0 stars I would. I know two dollars isn&#x27;t a lot but when you buy something you expect to get what you intend to buy. NOPE NOT IN THIS CASE. 600 studs my butt, I counted and found less then 150 studs I was so pissed and not only that it took over 2 months to get here.😡</li>
            <li> This was a great buy and at a great price. I use these for my nail designs. This was just what I needed.</li>
            <li> not the sizes i was expecting but its ok.</li>
            <li> excellent and beautiful product</li>
            <li> Exactly what it showed I would recieve all designs were exact amount was exact thank you love it much rock on</li>
            <li> When I received my package in the mail I have to say I&#x27;m extremely disappointed. There is no where near 600 pieces. And the items look NOTHING like how they are pictured. thanks for wasting my time and money!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t provide the exact shapes that were shown in the picture. However, what I did receive have worked ok.</li>
            <li> great items.  look beautiful when applied</li>
            <li> Pieces are bigger than I expected.</li>
            <li> Nothing like it says in the description and the picture is wrong as well. Says it&#x27;s suppose to have be gold and silver but there is pink and white. The metallic silver looks old and rustic. Not even close to 600 pieces in the wheel. Will not be ordering from these people again.</li>
            <li> There was not as many of the studs as I thought there would be, def not 600 and they are little larger than I thought they would be but they still work very well for my nail designs. I think its worth it to get such a variety.</li>
            <li> I ordered 600 pcs as advertised and when I opened the package there was maybe 200 pcs. The advertisement also indicated that the nail art would be gold or silver, the objects are multicolored. This is not at all what I ordered! I am not happy with this transaction.</li>
            <li> The wheel I received was exactly like the picture, and I probably did get ~600 pieces. As with a lot of inexpensive items purchased from overseas, sometimes a vendor will send you the exact item and sometimes you get something that&#x27;s... just not as good. I see that in the reviews for these studs too, some folks got a set with less than 200 pieces or had slightly different studs. The vendor I used was good2deal, so if you want what&#x27;s in the picture they&#x27;re a safe bet.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be deceived by the photo or the promised amount. You will get a lot less.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a lot smaller but it is huge! They are a nice quality too.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t happy with the product. It was different than what I saw in the description.</li>
            <li> I just received my product in the mail and it is nothing like the picture.  I&#x27;m very disappointed !</li>
            <li> I expected a case full of gold and silver jewels as written in the description and picture. However, when it came in the mail, I received a case half filled with variety of different colors instead. It&#x27;s too cheap to send back so there&#x27;s no point to ask for a refund, but this item was very misleading and unsatisfying.</li>
            <li> Got the items n it looked like good quality until I put them on my nails for design the gold turned to silver tone in less than 4 days...it didn&#x27;t keep the gold tone appearance...if I wanted all silver tone it would be a great buy but you get what you pay for...its great for a day design but no long term wear</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping and the product just as it is described</li>
            <li> its beautiful but small amount and small wheel great price!</li>
            <li> Im extremly disappointed!  What I recieved was what not what I chose nor was it what the picture showed! No way was there 600 pcs, I probably recieved 100 if not less..... All I got was stars and pink little cirles with a few squares and black cirles. WILL NOT PURCHASE AGAIN!!!!</li>
            <li> I got my package today and some of the other customers said, that there was no where near 600 jewels. I have to agree. I was expecting the container to be full like the picture.  But not the case.  I&#x27;m petty and I actually counted the jewels and I counted 236. No where near 600.   I&#x27;m going to use them on my nails today and see if they look good on the nails at least.</li>
            <li> They work but NOWHERE NEAR 600</li>
            <li> ...nice variety but tiny......good for nails and crafts. Packaged well and quick delivery.</li>
            <li> fast shipping product as described</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF :) seller was awesome</li>
            <li> In one day your gold/silver tones will rub off and reveal white underneath; even with top coat. Nice variety, good price, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I just received my wheel and it was less than 600 more like 100.... Also the shapes I received where not what I wanted more like stars and hearts which I won&#x27;t be using... I&#x27;m disappointed</li>
            <li> I received studs other than what was pictured.</li>
            <li> Loved them I didn&#x27;t get the triangle got some dif ones but other than that it&#x27;s a good deal</li>
            <li> They arrived from the company slightly tarnished and not as shiny as the picture shows. They also require a lot of glue to secure them down. Otherwise they are cute.</li>
            <li> Just received my item in the mail and even though it came prior to the expected delivery date (which I was really happy about) I have to say I was slightly disappointed with the size of the the wheel because it&#x27;s being advertised there are 600 studs when clearly just looking at it you can tell it&#x27;s way less then that. I haven&#x27;t tried it out yet but hopefully they are of some good quality.</li>
            <li> Wish squares were a little smaller but overall great quality</li>
            <li> Sooooo, yes it was under $2, but it could at least have been the same product types. The items i got were not even pictured in the advertisement. i got red stones. there are NO red stones advertised. i got stars, gold AND silver. stars are NOT advertised. i mite use some of the lil gadgets, but im not happy with this purchase. UPDATE TO THIS POST ::: even tho it wasnt wat i wanted on the 1st order, i reordered 2 of these and got closer to the actual pictured product this time. much happier this time around. but there IS NOT nearly 600 pieces. last time most of the gold pieces looked rusted or discolored. much better quality this time around. i guess its just the luck of the draw when ordering these.</li>
            <li> less pieces and the shapes are not all the same one as shown</li>
            <li> I was going to buy this 3D nail art but from the reviews no thank you.I will not waste my money you losing customers before you get them .This false advertising 600 you suppose to get and you only get about 96.</li>
            <li> They were all mixed up. Waste of time dividing them. Some pieces were missing. When I ordered them, It said it was going to arrive by June 2-3. False. Then it told me July once I had already paid.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally disappointed. All I wanted were gold and silver studs in various sizes, instead I got really, really tiny metal pieces in yellow, brown, black, white and red. Stars, circles and squares. I didn&#x27;t get anywhere near 600 pieces either. I think it&#x27;s closer to 150 pieces. It sucks because I really wanted the wheel in the picture.</li>
            <li> Nothing like the picture!!!!&lt;br /&gt;It came quickly and studs are nice but I expected it to be like the picture, all gold and silver and was looking forward to using the shapes shown. Sadly, it was multi colored (red-purple-white etc....) and only stars and circles. No tear drops, rectangles, or diamonds. I was looking forward to adding these particular ones to my collection, now I have to find another vendor and order them again.</li>
            <li> I got these for Christmas and there were way less than promised, and they came with other colors as well as the gold and silver. I haven&#x27;t used them yet, but definitely not what it advertised.</li>
            <li> wrong colors. i wanted silver and gold, i got black, pink, and brown/ purple. not as much variety in the shapes, either. 2 slots of black rounds, 2 slots of pink rounds, 2 slots pink stars, 2 slots black squares, 2 slots brown/ purple stars, 1 slot brown/ purple squares, 1 slots brown/ purple stars. i&#x27;m sure if i counted, there wouldn&#x27;t be 600 pieces, either. long story short, they&#x27;re just okay. buy at your own risk. update: upon further inspection, i&#x27;ve noticed i got 2 slots gold stars, and 2 slots squares in this weird brown color. so at least i got gold stars.</li>
            <li> I got pearls instead of the silver and gold studs that I wanted... lame.</li>
            <li> These studs are great! it comes exactly as pictured and the studs are a good size! i would definitely repurchase these.</li>
            <li> Very cute looks nais on my nails i love it.!!!!</li>
            <li> this were justbas described and loves them! I try to be careful when removing to reuse! If you remove with acetone be careful because it will remove the gold color on studs.</li>
            <li> For starters- as many reviews had previously stated: you do NOT get the 600 pieces as advertised.  Add to that:  the package I received had star shaped studs?!?!  Nowhere in the picture do I see the stars and the red circles that I had gotten.  Yet- the product description clearly states that I would be getting &amp;#34;Color and size as picture.&amp;#34; Hmmm....&lt;br /&gt;This product will only be getting one star because the other 4 are in the package they sent me.</li>
            <li> There was less than half of the quantity listed and that&#x27;s being generous; shapes were missing and many duplicates; shipping took well over a month. Giving 2 stars because the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> my daughter had loads of fun playing with this stuff</li>
            <li> Nice staff. I love it.</li>
            <li> I love these! There is some of the bead things in gold and silver and they stay on. Love this!</li>
            <li> Very nice. All beautiful worth the wait</li>
            <li> Loved the variety wheel!</li>
            <li> wish you could choose the shapes but theyre cute took a month but i use them alot, worth the wait for a couple bucks</li>
            <li> Love this Product and the price is great!!! It works great!!!! My wife Loved It!! Will be purchasing More of them!!!!!</li>
            <li> I received less than 250 pieces. Some of the shapes, particularly the diamonds, are way too big for nail art. Most of the shapes would yield one manicure, though some of the smaller ones had 20ish pieces. That being said, about half the shapes are usable and I would buy this product again for less than $2 shipped.</li>
            <li> Nothing like the picture or description. Contains only squares circles and stars. Many of them colored red, pink and brown. Waste of money. Do not use this seller (Ever goods), nothing I purchased from them was as described.</li>
            <li> Definitely didn&#x27;t receive 600pcs!  And also received some different shapes.  I like the product but you definitely don&#x27;t get 600pcs.</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed in this. I got no where near 600 pieces and the studs are way small. I didn&#x27;t even receive gold studs only silver. The studs were the main reason I ordered this. I really like the size of the other shapes though. Just disappointed with what little I received and how tiny the studs are. I was really looking forward into having gold studs too.</li>
            <li> The description says metallic colored. That is not what I received. I won&#x27;t count the number in the disc I got, but it is not nearly as many as in the picture. I got less than half the amount pictured. It also took forever to get here. A month is too long to wait.</li>
            <li> Definitely not 600 pieces and the studs aren&#x27;t what is pictured. I ordered specifically for the triangles and didn&#x27;t get any on the palate</li>
            <li> Was disappointed. Not 600 pieces.</li>
            <li> Can confirm it has far from 600 pcs, but the pieces look great and it arrived ahead of schedule.</li>
            <li> The only good thing is that I got them early! The packaging is so much smaller then I thought it would be! THERE IS NOT 600 PIECES!!! I honesty dont think there is even 250. They are cute and the one that I got isnt just silver and good, it has pink in it! Here is store bought jews compared to the ones I just got. The smaller one is the one I got from them!</li>
            <li> Item is as described, most of the design will work well and stay for a couple days until it gets snagged by fabric or hair but its a given since it is sitting on top of your nail. The gold toned ones will lose its color and turn silver after a while though, but this is still a nice set.</li>
            <li> Well, I certainly didn&#x27;t receive 600 pieces, or the studs as shown. The wheel is small and maybe holds 200pcs, not nearly 600pcs. The majority of the studs are round and are red and white with few actually gold or silver. I have an abundance of round studs and wanted the other shapes shown, so I&#x27;m not pleased. I also have star shaped studs, which are not shown in the photo either. The small, rectangular studs, which were the ones I was most interested in, are few and all silver, no gold. I also didn&#x27;t receive any diamond or oval studs. But I&#x27;m most disappointed that I didn&#x27;t get the variety of colors in the shapes shown, I had a lot of plans for clients as I&#x27;d hoped to use them professionally. I maybe have enough for two or three manicures and then I&#x27;m left with these red and white circles and these stars that I didn&#x27;t want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For $2, I can handle the 200pcs, but they could at least be more honest or accurate about what you&#x27;ll actually get when you order the wheel.</li>
            <li> All I got were squares, hearts, and stars! I didn&#x27;t get any of the other shapes! So disappointed! 😢 I hope you can see; container is a bit ruined.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t come with as many gems as you see in the photo</li>
            <li> They were not what I expected and what they were described as. And certainly not 600 pcs. But i still liked it.</li>
            <li> Works awesome for nail art great price. Came very well put together. Arrived earlier then expected</li>
            <li> Love it! It has 600 assorted metallic gold and metallic silver pieces for my nails, which I love doing all the time. The product met my expectations.</li>
            <li> I got different studs than whats in the photo. I still like some of them but I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> actually it is not what its in the picture it just came a bunch of heats and stars.....its not was it was discribed</li>
            <li> Shipped fast and the studs are cute.  The biggest downfall is that some of the studs are too big for my nails and won&#x27;t stay on.</li>
            <li> I love this. Well worth the wait when you calculate how much it costs to add these types of things to your nails at the salon.</li>
            <li> This wheel is HUGE! I love it! All the little pieces it showed would have, is there. There are so many pieces in it, it honestly looks more than 600! Shopping took longer than I would like, but it&#x27;s okay. Was worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Seriously a great selection in this wheel and a good amount of each. Will defiantly find a use or nail design for each one.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t come with everything shown &amp; comes with some things that aren&#x27;t shown so was a little disappointed that I didn&#x27;t get what you see.</li>
            <li> I just received my package in the mail. And I have to say I&#x27;m extremely disappointed. There is no where near 600 pieces. And the items look NOTHING like how they are pictured. thanks for wasting my time and money!</li>
            <li> The wheel is larger then other wheels I have purchased but there are a lot of pieces to choose from and design with.</li>
            <li> They came in different colors like black whit and red</li>
            <li> Good low cost set of design nail art</li>
            <li> I just received my order &amp; these are not the studs I received. I wish I would have read the reviews before I ordered them. They also don&#x27;t look like 600 pieces some of the squares are way to big, in the pic there are no stars in my tray there are stars some tear drop looking ones &amp; black circles. No triangles by the way. So disappointed.</li>
            <li> pretty  cool for the price. not as much as in picture though.</li>
