            <li>Loved it...</li>
            <li>I loved it.</li>
            <li>The girls there all recommended to use this and that it was good to use with tattoos.</li>
            <li>I was drawn to it because it was 50% off, and was hesitant because I had used another ed hardy lotion that I didn&#x27;t care for but this one is awesome!!&lt;br /&gt;First off, the smell is good.</li>
            <li>The application was good.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells so good</li>
            <li>and it stays smelling good even after you tan.</li>
            <li>I got a good tan in too which I was scared about because I&#x27;ve always used a tingle lotion, so I didn&#x27;t know how it would compare.</li>
            <li>I am fairly pail</li>
            <li>Leave skin feeling smooth, great smell!</li>
            <li>This lotion smells good and continues to smell good, even after tanning.</li>
            <li>and it smells so good</li>
            <li>Still Like it tho and gives good color.</li>
            <li>Love this lotion, makes my skin feel great..</li>
            <li>I am very glad that I got this bottle.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with the results and very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>Having said that, this lotion is pretty great!</li>
            <li>so customer service is spectacular no matter what I&#x27;d order from this company many times over!</li>
            <li>I was jealous when he came out of the stand up looking about 2 shades darker and smelling AMAZING.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been in a tanning bed before and this lotion is AMAZING for my skin.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, smells great, and it moisturizes my skin.  </li>
            <li>the smell is amazing</li>
            <li>This bronzing product worked well for me there was no streaking and the fragrance is nice.</li>
            <li>The lotion does not have that brown-bronzing look to it, but does have a nice fragrance.  </li>
            <li>nice product, smells alright</li>
            <li>I really liked this bronzer.</li>
            <li>It also has a nice smell.</li>
            <li>and then they buy their own.  </li>
            <li>I tried this lotion and was totally satisfied, I have a really fair complexion and this lotion got me tan</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the kind of bottle it comes in.  </li>
            <li>I always end up with a nice brown color, not orangy at all.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t bronze but it does make your skin very soft and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>I tan seasonally and am not usually an Ed Hardy fan, but this lotion works great!</li>
            <li>From the first use I loved this product!  </li>
            <li>I really liked the feel of the lotion and the silicone makes it very smooth to apply.</li>
            <li>Nice product, but not my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I would probably get an amazing tan with it if I went more often.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to note this because when I read the reviews on tanning lotions I want to know if it smells good or not</li>
            <li>Spreads well, very smooth on skin.</li>
            <li>: Smells amazing (perfume, musky, sweet)!</li>
            <li>Great bronzing and the silk extract makes your skin super smooth.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion</li>
            <li>Love the lotion the color it gives the feel</li>
            <li>I do love that part or it.</li>
            <li>Affordable product comparable to premium bronzers costing much more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always trying different tanning lotions and this one is awesome.</li>
            <li>I want to try more ed hardy lotions after this one.</li>
            <li>More than supposed to.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoyed the smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>I like my Hollwood bronze better</li>
            <li>It worked ok.</li>
            <li>I have let so many people use mine</li>
            <li>Even though this lotion is white in the bottle it still has a great bronzer in it!</li>
            <li>More like a lotion, than  a tanning lotion, would not reccomend.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>For the best savings buy your tanning lotion on Amazon instead of from your local salon which sometimes charges two-three times the price.  </li>
            <li>I am really enjoying this tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>and I love the tan I have gotten using this</li>
            <li>love the smell and love the color i get from the product.  </li>
            <li>It smells great &amp; makes my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and the quick results!</li>
            <li>Easy application.</li>
            <li>It smells pretty good when you put it on, but after tanning you do smell a bit like burnt flesh, so that&#x27;s a bummer, but the benefit is worth it.</li>
            <li>Super conditioning!</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t too strong but is light</li>
            <li>As far as the lotion goes I think it&#x27;s one of the best I&#x27;ve used so far.  </li>
            <li>Great for skincare overall.</li>
            <li>It smells FANTASTIC</li>
            <li>With that being said I Love the fragrance, lotion goes on nice and smooth leaving your skin feeling soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>The value of this product is very economically priced.</li>
            <li>Smell is amazing and the tan you get is very natural!</li>
            <li>It also has a fresh and clean fruity scent!  </li>
            <li>😊 many thanks!</li>
            <li>This smells good and does not leave and after tan burnt smell like many other lotions.  </li>
            <li>It made my skin blotch up into red dots all over and would not smear in good at all</li>
            <li>I was a gorgeous shade of office white!</li>
            <li>so I cant fairly say how good or not good it is.</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant too, it doesnt take much as it spreads easily, this will last me all year.</li>
            <li>My tan is building quickly in under 2 weeks</li>
            <li>quick.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite things about this particular lotion is the smell.  </li>
            <li>This lotion really makes a great color and doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent like some of the other lotions.</li>
            <li>But overall, I am very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>Charged easy too much to account.  </li>
            <li>The smell is soft and not overpowering like many tanning lotions can be.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>The smell of this product is nice, however, it doesn&#x27;t last</li>
            <li>This product is well worth the money</li>
            <li>I am very upset the first two days I was bragging about how good it was and now my white bath towel is stained and my fiance thinks its funny he told me to stick with bombshell its 20 bucks and works!</li>
            <li>Not as good as other Ed Hardy products I have used.</li>
            <li>Overall this is a great product and I will definitely be buying again.</li>
            <li>Does not take very much to cover the body.</li>
            <li>I could already see a difference after the first tanning session.</li>
            <li>it makes your skin so soft and smooth..</li>
            <li>and I will most likely order it again, especially since it was so cheap!  </li>
            <li>It also makes you a pretty brown color.</li>
            <li>I told them that I was getting married and</li>
            <li>First use was 10 minutes in a bronzing bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>I recently purchased a bottle of Show Girl from Glamour Tanning Inc. &amp; I&#x27;m now convinced it wasn&#x27;t authentic.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tanned off and on for years and used many different lotions.</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s easy enough to just put any lotion in a designer bottle &amp; deceive the customer.  </li>
            <li>certain Glamour Tanning ripped me off.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend for beginning tanned or seasoned tan-a-holics.</li>
            <li>, it doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling sticky and it works real well.  </li>
            <li>Does not work very well .</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Fast absorbing (didn&#x27;t just sit on the surface of my skin).</li>
            <li>I had VERY noticeable results after just one use.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my daughter and I have yet to use it, but she absolutely loves this lotion.  </li>
            <li>I found that I&#x27;ve had to spend more time tanning with this lotion than wtih  other bronzers.</li>
            <li>Intro: I have sensitive skin and often lotions are not nourishing enough to prevent my skin from becoming irritated while tanning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Though I noticed my legs had a SLIGHT orange tint it may have been because I didn&#x27;t rub it in good enough.</li>
            <li>and I will definitely purchase it again in the near future for a nice color.</li>
            <li>and actually I darkened up quite quickly and looks pretty natural as well.</li>
            <li>I stopped using it and went back to my expensive salon lotion which works perfectly.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty pale and burn easily</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little thicker lotion, which I love.</li>
            <li>Not so much a bronzer mire of a clear.</li>
            <li>Coming from a veteran tanner, this lotion was well worth the price</li>
            <li>and I was pretty surprised that my skin was as soft as it was.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that if you don&#x27;t wash your hands right away they turn an orange color</li>
            <li>Some people said the lotion was smooth, but mine, like other silicone lotions, wanted to come out gloppy.</li>
            <li>I bought my first bottle at the tanning salon, bought my second on Amazon.com!</li>
            <li>And it makes my skin SOOO soft!</li>
            <li>This is the first one that I&#x27;ve truly seen instant results with that wasn&#x27;t a tingling lotion.</li>
            <li>but right after my first tan I already had a slight gold tan on my arms.</li>
            <li>It has these little beads in it that really make my skin super soft.  </li>
            <li>I bought all kinds of lotions this year &amp; most lotions with bronzers seem to dry my skin out or wash off in the shower but not with this one, it seems to hold your tan longer than any other one i have tried.</li>
            <li>It does make my skin feel really soft and isn&#x27;t greasy or anything.</li>
            <li>Considering that I completely used the bottle.</li>
            <li>It is thick, which I love.</li>
            <li>It works exactly as described, plus bonus points for saving me so much money compared to what I would have spent to purchase it at the tanning store!!</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin soft all day long and really boosts my tanning experience.  </li>
            <li>They have the same exact product at my tanning salon for double the price!</li>
            <li>I gave it 5 stars because I would get pink or red but not burn to badly even from working up from 5 minute sessions to the maximum time that they allowed, felt nice and smelled nice.</li>
            <li>It has an excellent bronzer and The scent reminds me a little of the Victoria&#x27;s Secret fragrance Pink.</li>
            <li>The lotion is easy to apply and isn&#x27;t too thick.</li>
            <li>I may even try some other Ed Hardy lotions, since I like this one so much!</li>
            <li>At first after tanning my skin looked dark and glowed!</li>

            <li> I am very glad that I got this bottle.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the results and very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> Having said that, this lotion is pretty great!</li>
            <li> so customer service is spectacular no matter what I&#x27;d order from this company many times over!</li>
            <li> I was jealous when he came out of the stand up looking about 2 shades darker and smelling AMAZING.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been in a tanning bed before and this lotion is AMAZING for my skin.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, smells great, and it moisturizes my skin.  </li>
            <li> the smell is amazing</li>
            <li> This bronzing product worked well for me there was no streaking and the fragrance is nice.</li>
            <li> The lotion does not have that brown-bronzing look to it, but does have a nice fragrance.  </li>
            <li> nice product, smells alright</li>
            <li> I really liked this bronzer.</li>
            <li> It also has a nice smell.</li>
            <li> and then they buy their own.  </li>
            <li> I tried this lotion and was totally satisfied, I have a really fair complexion and this lotion got me tan</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the kind of bottle it comes in.  </li>
            <li> I always end up with a nice brown color, not orangy at all.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t bronze but it does make your skin very soft and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> I tan seasonally and am not usually an Ed Hardy fan, but this lotion works great!</li>
            <li> From the first use I loved this product!  </li>
            <li> I really liked the feel of the lotion and the silicone makes it very smooth to apply.</li>
            <li> Nice product, but not my favorite.  </li>
            <li> I would probably get an amazing tan with it if I went more often.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to note this because when I read the reviews on tanning lotions I want to know if it smells good or not</li>
            <li> Spreads well, very smooth on skin.</li>
            <li> : Smells amazing (perfume, musky, sweet)!</li>
            <li> Great bronzing and the silk extract makes your skin super smooth.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion</li>
            <li> Love the lotion the color it gives the feel</li>
            <li> I do love that part or it.</li>
            <li> Affordable product comparable to premium bronzers costing much more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always trying different tanning lotions and this one is awesome.</li>
            <li> I want to try more ed hardy lotions after this one.</li>
            <li> More than supposed to.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoyed the smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> I like my Hollwood bronze better</li>
            <li> It worked ok.</li>
            <li> I have let so many people use mine</li>
            <li> Even though this lotion is white in the bottle it still has a great bronzer in it!</li>
            <li> More like a lotion, than  a tanning lotion, would not reccomend.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> For the best savings buy your tanning lotion on Amazon instead of from your local salon which sometimes charges two-three times the price.  </li>
            <li> I am really enjoying this tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> and I love the tan I have gotten using this</li>
            <li> love the smell and love the color i get from the product.  </li>
            <li> It smells great &amp; makes my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the quick results!</li>
            <li> Easy application.</li>
            <li> It smells pretty good when you put it on, but after tanning you do smell a bit like burnt flesh, so that&#x27;s a bummer, but the benefit is worth it.</li>
            <li> Super conditioning!</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t too strong but is light</li>
            <li> As far as the lotion goes I think it&#x27;s one of the best I&#x27;ve used so far.  </li>
            <li> Great for skincare overall.</li>
            <li> It smells FANTASTIC</li>
            <li> With that being said I Love the fragrance, lotion goes on nice and smooth leaving your skin feeling soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> The value of this product is very economically priced.</li>
            <li> Smell is amazing and the tan you get is very natural!</li>
            <li> It also has a fresh and clean fruity scent!  </li>
            <li> 😊 many thanks!</li>
            <li> This smells good and does not leave and after tan burnt smell like many other lotions.  </li>
            <li> It made my skin blotch up into red dots all over and would not smear in good at all</li>
            <li> I was a gorgeous shade of office white!</li>
            <li> so I cant fairly say how good or not good it is.</li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant too, it doesnt take much as it spreads easily, this will last me all year.</li>
            <li> My tan is building quickly in under 2 weeks</li>
            <li> quick.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite things about this particular lotion is the smell.  </li>
            <li> This lotion really makes a great color and doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent like some of the other lotions.</li>
            <li> But overall, I am very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> Charged easy too much to account.  </li>
            <li> The smell is soft and not overpowering like many tanning lotions can be.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> The smell of this product is nice, however, it doesn&#x27;t last</li>
            <li> This product is well worth the money</li>
            <li> I am very upset the first two days I was bragging about how good it was and now my white bath towel is stained and my fiance thinks its funny he told me to stick with bombshell its 20 bucks and works!</li>
            <li> Not as good as other Ed Hardy products I have used.</li>
            <li> Overall this is a great product and I will definitely be buying again.</li>
            <li> Does not take very much to cover the body.</li>
            <li> I could already see a difference after the first tanning session.</li>
            <li> it makes your skin so soft and smooth..</li>
            <li> and I will most likely order it again, especially since it was so cheap!  </li>
            <li> It also makes you a pretty brown color.</li>
            <li> I told them that I was getting married and</li>
            <li> First use was 10 minutes in a bronzing bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> I recently purchased a bottle of Show Girl from Glamour Tanning Inc. &amp; I&#x27;m now convinced it wasn&#x27;t authentic.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tanned off and on for years and used many different lotions.</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s easy enough to just put any lotion in a designer bottle &amp; deceive the customer.  </li>
            <li> certain Glamour Tanning ripped me off.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend for beginning tanned or seasoned tan-a-holics.</li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling sticky and it works real well.  </li>
            <li> Does not work very well .</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> Fast absorbing (didn&#x27;t just sit on the surface of my skin).</li>
            <li> I had VERY noticeable results after just one use.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter and I have yet to use it, but she absolutely loves this lotion.  </li>
            <li> I found that I&#x27;ve had to spend more time tanning with this lotion than wtih  other bronzers.</li>
            <li> Intro: I have sensitive skin and often lotions are not nourishing enough to prevent my skin from becoming irritated while tanning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Though I noticed my legs had a SLIGHT orange tint it may have been because I didn&#x27;t rub it in good enough.</li>
            <li> and I will definitely purchase it again in the near future for a nice color.</li>
            <li> and actually I darkened up quite quickly and looks pretty natural as well.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it and went back to my expensive salon lotion which works perfectly.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty pale and burn easily</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little thicker lotion, which I love.</li>
            <li> Not so much a bronzer mire of a clear.</li>
            <li> Coming from a veteran tanner, this lotion was well worth the price</li>
            <li> and I was pretty surprised that my skin was as soft as it was.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that if you don&#x27;t wash your hands right away they turn an orange color</li>
            <li> Some people said the lotion was smooth, but mine, like other silicone lotions, wanted to come out gloppy.</li>
            <li> I bought my first bottle at the tanning salon, bought my second on Amazon.com!</li>
            <li> And it makes my skin SOOO soft!</li>
            <li> This is the first one that I&#x27;ve truly seen instant results with that wasn&#x27;t a tingling lotion.</li>
            <li> but right after my first tan I already had a slight gold tan on my arms.</li>
            <li> It has these little beads in it that really make my skin super soft.  </li>
            <li> I bought all kinds of lotions this year &amp; most lotions with bronzers seem to dry my skin out or wash off in the shower but not with this one, it seems to hold your tan longer than any other one i have tried.</li>
            <li> It does make my skin feel really soft and isn&#x27;t greasy or anything.</li>
            <li> Considering that I completely used the bottle.</li>
            <li> It is thick, which I love.</li>
            <li> It works exactly as described, plus bonus points for saving me so much money compared to what I would have spent to purchase it at the tanning store!!</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin soft all day long and really boosts my tanning experience.  </li>
            <li> They have the same exact product at my tanning salon for double the price!</li>
            <li> I gave it 5 stars because I would get pink or red but not burn to badly even from working up from 5 minute sessions to the maximum time that they allowed, felt nice and smelled nice.</li>
            <li> It has an excellent bronzer and The scent reminds me a little of the Victoria&#x27;s Secret fragrance Pink.</li>
            <li> The lotion is easy to apply and isn&#x27;t too thick.</li>
            <li> I may even try some other Ed Hardy lotions, since I like this one so much!</li>
            <li> At first after tanning my skin looked dark and glowed!</li>
            <li> This bottle lasted so long</li>
            <li> Also accidentally got 3 and they sent ups to me next day to pick up other two and refund</li>
            <li> (at the time) the day was a month and a half away; what would they recommend that i use to get my tan going and give me a good base.</li>
            <li> Now let me say, guys pink isn&#x27;t just for girls.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> (if you can get over the very pink bottle)</li>
            <li> IMHO, beads in lotion perform no useful purpose.  </li>
            <li> Not extraordinary but for the price.......</li>
            <li> I went to a tanning salon that I had previously been to</li>
            <li> No extraordinary tan results.</li>
            <li> The silk beads are a neat little touch as well.</li>
            <li> It has little beads in the lotion that moisturize also.</li>
            <li> When I go to use the product I always have to bring a napkin or something to wipe my hands because of the residue left behind from the lotion.</li>
            <li> The product goes on silky BUT after a few hours it smells just like self tanning lotion.....</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d save a few bucks by buying a bottle on Amazon</li>
            <li> Use very little as it tends to leave skin slightly orange.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t bad, but it&#x27;s not fantastic; it just seems like your basic tanning bed bronzer to me.</li>
            <li> I tan during the summer at least 3 times a week</li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t smell bad either, which is a big plus.  </li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t as bad as some other lotions.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;beads\\&quot; are weird.  </li>
            <li> I wasnt crazy about this one..</li>
            <li> It stinks.</li>
            <li> but I was really disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> This has fake tan smell all over it!!</li>
            <li> but the ATO is horrible ..</li>
            <li> makes you smell like burnt skin horribly</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Love this! Excellent to start your tanning. I though I would have to step up to get to my bronze I get every year. This bottle lasted so long I was there before I could start the next. I love this!</li>

            <li> Does not work very well .</li>

            <li> Love the lotion the color it gives the feel the smell it&#x27;s great! Also accidentally got 3 and they sent ups to me next day to pick up other two and refund so customer service is spectacular no matter what I&#x27;d order from this company many times over! Be blessed hope this helps lotions great but customer service is even better! 😊 many thanks!</li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m not giving this 5 is because the bottle is on the smaller side. Having said that, this lotion is pretty great! I tan seasonally and am not usually an Ed Hardy fan, but this lotion works great! My tan is building quickly in under 2 weeks and I&#x27;m not burning anywhere. Will probably buy from this brand again.</li>
            <li> Great tanning lotion.  Leaves my skin soft all day long and really boosts my tanning experience.  The smell is soft and not overpowering like many tanning lotions can be.  Thank you</li>
            <li> The item came way before said date. I just started to use item so I cant fairly say how good or not good it is. but the feel is great and so is the smell. I do love that part or it.</li>
            <li> This product smells good and seemed to not be too sticky when you put it on. Don&#x27;t know that I would buy it again though.</li>
            <li> Easy application. Great scent. Long-lasting bronze. Highly recommend for beginning tanned or seasoned tan-a-holics. Affordable product comparable to premium bronzers costing much more.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Great tan. Does not take very much to cover the body. Smells great. Does not streak ehen applying</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always trying different tanning lotions and this one is awesome. It is thick, which I love. The smell is awesome and light, and it doesn&#x27;t leave me stinky after tanning in the tanning bed! I want to try more ed hardy lotions after this one. Great price too!</li>
            <li> I really liked the feel of the lotion and the silicone makes it very smooth to apply. Makes your skin feel great after using. It also has a very pleasant smell. I do like the color achieved with this product. Will buy this again!</li>
            <li> Charged easy too much to account.  More than supposed to.  Was only suppose to be $16 but charged $99. I will be getting a lawyer and suing.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion, makes my skin feel great.. would highly recommend to everyone. Does not streak. I  would defiantly buy again.</li>
            <li> does not smell good to me</li>
            <li> This smells good and does not leave and after tan burnt smell like many other lotions.  However it does smell like a tanning lotion and still smells like that once you finish tanning.  Coming from a veteran tanner, this lotion was well worth the price and I will most likely order it again, especially since it was so cheap!  I may even try some other Ed Hardy lotions, since I like this one so much!</li>
            <li> Nice product, but not my favorite.  The lotion does not have that brown-bronzing look to it, but does have a nice fragrance.  I found that I&#x27;ve had to spend more time tanning with this lotion than wtih  other bronzers.</li>
            <li> nice product, smells alright but the ATO is horrible .. there is no denying that you have been in the tanning bed after you use this product . makes you smell like burnt skin horribly</li>
            <li> From the first use I loved this product!  It smells great before and after use!  It works exactly as described, plus bonus points for saving me so much money compared to what I would have spent to purchase it at the tanning store!!</li>
            <li> I really liked this bronzer. It has a silky feel and goes on your skin without feeling greasy. It also has a nice smell.</li>
            <li> WILL CAUSE ORANGINESS AFTER MULTIPLE USES. OTHERWISE, GREAT ED HARDY PRODUCT</li>
            <li> Loved it... great smell and bronzer</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed the smell. When I go to use the product I always have to bring a napkin or something to wipe my hands because of the residue left behind from the lotion.</li>
            <li> The lotion had NO &#x27;Silk Extract Beads&#x27;, I never got tan with this product. I stopped using it and went back to my expensive salon lotion which works perfectly. I was trying to save some money. I guess you &#x27;get what you pay for.&#x27;</li>
            <li> This was a great buy for the price.  It&#x27;s a little thicker lotion, which I love. And it doesn&#x27;t smell bad either, which is a big plus.  I would probably get an amazing tan with it if I went more often.  But overall, I am very pleased with the results.  Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Smells great &amp; gives skin a nice color!!  Great purchase!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok I like my Hollwood bronze better</li>
            <li> Turned orange around elbows and ankles</li>
            <li> I will keep this simple. It stinks. It&#x27;s important to note this because when I read the reviews on tanning lotions I want to know if it smells good or not and this one is a NOT. It worked ok.</li>
            <li> This has fake tan smell all over it!! I used it a couple times and you could smell a burning smell afterwards... yuk!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this same product for a year now. I have all mt friends and daughter in law using it now.  I should buy it in bulk. Maaybe get a bird dog fee for all the people that I have turned on to this product.  I have let so many people use mine and then they buy their own.  thanks</li>
            <li> Smells great and feels silky when you put it on. It also makes you a pretty brown color. I loved it.</li>
            <li> I tried this lotion and was totally satisfied, I have a really fair complexion and this lotion got me tan quick. I bought my first bottle at the tanning salon, bought my second on Amazon.com!</li>
            <li> smells amazing don&#x27;t leave you smelling like a tanning bed after you get out, great for the price that I paid compared to the tanning salons prices</li>
            <li> I bought this from a tanning salon and I love/loved it! Considering that I completely used the bottle. I went to a tanning salon that I had previously been to and I hadn&#x27;t tanned in over a year. I was a gorgeous shade of office white! I told them that I was getting married and (at the time) the day was a month and a half away; what would they recommend that i use to get my tan going and give me a good base. The girls there all recommended to use this and that it was good to use with tattoos. I am very glad that I got this bottle. It doesn&#x27;t have a lot of that brown bronzy stuff that washes away after your shower and actually I darkened up quite quickly and looks pretty natural as well. I gave it 5 stars because I would get pink or red but not burn to badly even from working up from 5 minute sessions to the maximum time that they allowed, felt nice and smelled nice.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this for my husband after he tried a packet at our tanning salon. Now let me say, guys pink isn&#x27;t just for girls. I was jealous when he came out of the stand up looking about 2 shades darker and smelling AMAZING. Great buy for any sex (if you can get over the very pink bottle)</li>
            <li> I like this lotion a lot. It doesn&#x27;t bronze but it does make your skin very soft and smells wonderful. Great for skincare overall.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been in a tanning bed before and this lotion is AMAZING for my skin. I&#x27;m pretty pale and burn easily but right after my first tan I already had a slight gold tan on my arms. It smells FANTASTIC and I don&#x27;t come out smelling burnt or like a tanning bed, which is perfect.</li>
            <li> Intro: I have sensitive skin and often lotions are not nourishing enough to prevent my skin from becoming irritated while tanning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Smells amazing (perfume, musky, sweet)! Super conditioning! Fast absorbing (didn&#x27;t just sit on the surface of my skin). Spreads well, very smooth on skin. First use was 10 minutes in a bronzing bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The opening of the bottle gets in the way when I try to put it on my legs.  I don&#x27;t like the kind of bottle it comes in.  The \\&quot;beads\\&quot; are weird.  IMHO, beads in lotion perform no useful purpose.  Why would you need an exfoliant in lotion?  Some people said the lotion was smooth, but mine, like other silicone lotions, wanted to come out gloppy. No extraordinary tan results.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that if you don&#x27;t wash your hands right away they turn an orange color</li>
            <li> Awesome lotion with a wonderful smell that doesn&#x27;t have that \\&quot;burnt\\&quot; smell after you tan. You can feel the beads moisturizing your skin. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I purchased this lotion from my local salon. I was drawn to it because it was 50% off, and was hesitant because I had used another ed hardy lotion that I didn&#x27;t care for but this one is awesome!!&lt;br /&gt;First off, the smell is good. It isn&#x27;t too strong but is light and I didn&#x27;t smell like I had tanned after. The application was good. The lotion is easy to apply and isn&#x27;t too thick. I had VERY noticeable results after just one use. Though I noticed my legs had a SLIGHT orange tint it may have been because I didn&#x27;t rub it in good enough.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells so good and it stays smelling good even after you tan. I used it as soon as I got it and I was pretty surprised that my skin was as soft as it was. Very impressed! I got a good tan in too which I was scared about because I&#x27;ve always used a tingle lotion, so I didn&#x27;t know how it would compare. Best of all, there are NO traces of orange blotchy spots. Overall this is a great product and I will definitely be buying again. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> The product goes on silky BUT after a few hours it smells just like self tanning lotion.....YUCK.  Will not use again!!!!!!</li>
            <li> The silicone lotion is wonderful, I get color but not orange or streaky bronzers. The smell is pleasant too, it doesnt take much as it spreads easily, this will last me all year.</li>
            <li> I am a regular indoor tanner.  The smell of this product is nice, however, it doesn&#x27;t last and I still have that tanning bed smell.  Also, this turned all my fingers orange and gave the rest of my body a orange glow.  For this reason, I will not recommend or purchase again.</li>
            <li> UPDATE:  I recently purchased a bottle of Show Girl from Glamour Tanning Inc. &amp; I&#x27;m now convinced it wasn&#x27;t authentic.  I had used Show Girl lotion that I purchased at the salon &amp; always had wonderful results.  I thought I&#x27;d save a few bucks by buying a bottle on Amazon but I was really disappointed.  I didn&#x27;t get the same color as before &amp; the consistency was also different.  Last week I bought another bottle at the salon &amp; I am now certain Glamour Tanning ripped me off.  I guess it&#x27;s easy enough to just put any lotion in a designer bottle &amp; deceive the customer.  Shame on you!  Bottom line...the lotion purchased at the salon works great so pay the few extra dollars &amp; get yourself the real deal.  Stay away from GLAMOUR TANNING INC!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased my bottle of Show Girl at the salon so I cannot comment on the seller.  As far as the lotion goes I think it&#x27;s one of the best I&#x27;ve used so far.  It has these little beads in it that really make my skin super soft.  One of my favorite things about this particular lotion is the smell.  It starts off smelling great &amp; still smells great after tanning!  I don&#x27;t feel gross &amp; stinky after I leave the salon!  I always end up with a nice brown color, not orangy at all.  Even though this lotion is white in the bottle it still has a great bronzer in it!</li>
            <li> Turns your Skin orange and makes blotches every where!!  Never buy online</li>
            <li> This stuff turned my hands orange. I am fairly pail and it just left me looking a bit on the orange side.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter and I have yet to use it, but she absolutely loves this lotion.  Her tan looks great!!</li>
            <li> Great bronzing and the silk extract makes your skin super smooth. It also has a fresh and clean fruity scent!  The beautiful immediate glow alone has me very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Great product, works perfect!</li>
            <li> Not as good as other Ed Hardy products I have used. I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I tan during the summer at least 3 times a week &amp; i got this lotion because it was only 15 bucks! Well now its the only lotion i will ever buy again! It smells great &amp; makes my skin very soft. I bought all kinds of lotions this year &amp; most lotions with bronzers seem to dry my skin out or wash off in the shower but not with this one, it seems to hold your tan longer than any other one i have tried.</li>
            <li> This product is well worth the money and I will definitely purchase it again in the near future for a nice color.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff!!! They have the same exact product at my tanning salon for double the price! And it makes my skin SOOO soft!</li>
            <li> Leave skin feeling smooth, great smell! I would recommend! Will order again for next summer.. Use very little as it tends to leave skin slightly orange.</li>
            <li> More like a lotion, than  a tanning lotion, would not reccomend.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of this lotion.  Goes on smooth, smells great, and it moisturizes my skin.  Great Product!</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Made my skin feel awesome and i ordered the packs to use between lotions. Would recommend to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an experienced tanner...and this lotion is one that I will buy again. I bought it based on the reviews and I&#x27;m glad I did. I only tan about 3 times a week now and I can tell a difference each and every time I tan. This lotion smells good and continues to smell good, even after tanning. It has little beads in the lotion that moisturize also. A little bit goes a long way. It&#x27;s a really good value for the money!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t too impressed. Didn&#x27;t help with getting me darker. The smell isn&#x27;t as bad as some other lotions.</li>
            <li> For the best savings buy your tanning lotion on Amazon instead of from your local salon which sometimes charges two-three times the price.  With that being said I Love the fragrance, lotion goes on nice and smooth leaving your skin feeling soft and moisturized.  It has an excellent bronzer and The scent reminds me a little of the Victoria&#x27;s Secret fragrance Pink.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tanned off and on for years and used many different lotions. This is the first one that I&#x27;ve truly seen instant results with that wasn&#x27;t a tingling lotion. It smells pretty good when you put it on, but after tanning you do smell a bit like burnt flesh, so that&#x27;s a bummer, but the benefit is worth it. I got out of the tanning bed and immediately looked darker, and kept getting darker for the next day.</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying this tanning lotion. the smell is amazing and I love the tan I have gotten using this</li>
            <li> This lotion works well, but wash your hands afterwards.  I discovered that my hands turned orange and I had streaks of orange on my feet as well.</li>
            <li> love the smell and love the color i get from the product.  i just wish it came in a bigger bottle.  this bottle lasted me about 6 weeks going 2-3 times a week.</li>
            <li> At first after tanning my skin looked dark and glowed! The lotion has beads in it that makes your skin feel great and it smells so good but... after taking a shower it washes it off! I am very upset the first two days I was bragging about how good it was and now my white bath towel is stained and my fiance thinks its funny he told me to stick with bombshell its 20 bucks and works!</li>
            <li> Great smell. Not so much a bronzer mire of a clear. Still Like it tho and gives good color.</li>
            <li> Smell is amazing and the tan you get is very natural!</li>
            <li> This lotion really makes a great color and doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent like some of the other lotions. Great price too!</li>
