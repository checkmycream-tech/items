            <li>Great scent, lathers nicely.</li>
            <li>However,  many people like it so if you are in that number, this is a nice soap at a great price.</li>
            <li>The aroma is outstanding works as a air freshener in the bath area, good lather, great shave, love it and recommend if you like Bay Rum.</li>
            <li>Love the Bay Rum!  </li>
            <li>I like this soap scent but not my favorite,the pucks are a nice size and lathers ok,really no problem with this brand,</li>
            <li>It smells really nice</li>
            <li>My husband loves this stuff, to be honest</li>
            <li>Later that day i whipped up a great lather and had a great shave.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this shaving soap, by far the best smelling one I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Great product and fast delivery!</li>
            <li>A sweeter scent than many bay rums with notes of vanilla...</li>
            <li>I really like the bay rum scents and this fit the ideal mold for me.  </li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>Stroke the razor evenly and make sure you work the jawline</li>
            <li>I love this soap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Ogallala&#x27;s shaving soap for a couple of weeks now, and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Love the lather and the scent.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t shave as often as most people</li>
            <li>It was a mistake that I am glad</li>
            <li>It provides a nice smooth and close shave although admittedly</li>
            <li>My favorite shaving soap of all time.</li>
            <li>Iam glad I did .</li>
            <li>The pleasant bay rum scent will gently stay with you through the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My technique has gotten better as well so this lathers just fine.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not as easy to make a lather with it as it is with the VDH soap for example.</li>
            <li>Loads on the brush fine.</li>
            <li>Leathers fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to lather, and the lather is rich, lubricates well, and smells fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy the smell of Bay Rum.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy a brush on shaving soap.  </li>
            <li>The bottom line is, since you already have to shave, take some time to enjoy it.  </li>
            <li>but it produced a great smooth lather on my first tr with a 6 month old Escali brush..</li>
            <li>Builds a really great lather, I see some reviewers mentioning that it dries quick, and I noticed that a few times, but you just gotta add more water or work the lather a bit more.</li>
            <li>I prefer to spin the brush with my fingers to build up soap in the bristles at first, then I add more water to the cup and work up the soap lather by whipping my brush in the cup.  </li>
            <li>Lather not quite as rich as I like.</li>
            <li>This was my first use of this shave soap and it is very rich in smell and lather.</li>
            <li>This selection offers both; great fragrance, quality soap, reasonable price.</li>
            <li>The puck is a full 4oz</li>
            <li>I soon have a nice soft lather at this point.  </li>
            <li>The soap is good, not great, but good quality.</li>
            <li>This insures I have a quick foam start up the nextmorning.  </li>
            <li>If there was one drawback to this, it&#x27;s how quickly it goes.</li>
            <li>, I brush the first layer on my face making sure to cover it well and then go back to the cup to continue whipping up more lather.  </li>
            <li>The large pucks make it worth while to purchase and they will fit into any size shave cup because this product is glycerin based and</li>
            <li>John&#x27;s soap foams very well and stays smooth and creamy throughout my shave even with family interruptions, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great smell and a thick lather that gives a smooth shave .</li>
            <li>It lathers as well or better than Taylor of Old Bond Street&#x27;s shaving creams, and I think that&#x27;s saying a lot.  </li>
            <li>but it would be better if it fit in a standard covered soap dish.  </li>
            <li>Once you get the water mixture right and the technique down, this stuff smells great when you&#x27;re waking up in the morning and makes your face really slick for a great shave.</li>
            <li>My son became a proponent of the straight razor all of a sudden, but was using some overpriced fancy schmancy cream stuff from the shaving store, so I got him the &amp;#34;Kingsley Shave Soap Bowl with Lid Dark Wood&amp;#34; and a two pack of this lovely soap, and he&#x27;s extremely happy with it.  </li>
            <li>Frankly at first I couldn&#x27;t get the lather right.</li>
            <li>Classic barbershop clean shaved bay rum scent.</li>
            <li>It has a nice spicy scent that fills the bathroom(nice guy smell), and I&#x27;m using an early 50&#x27;s Old Spice mug with it.</li>
            <li>, i am a hot shot driver so that will be often.</li>
            <li>and  the quality is evident.</li>
            <li>If you are like most guys, your beard hair will run multiple directions.  </li>
            <li>I am still on the first puck out of the two XD</li>
            <li>This is my first choice when it comes to shave soap.</li>
            <li>It seems to run out quicker than most soaps, I think because of how soft it is, but it&#x27;s still gonna last you a good long time.</li>
            <li>It is always a pleasant surprise to find some small token, an air freshener, cologne, bathing soap or anything from his product line.  </li>
            <li>The key here for a close shave is to make sure you stretch or pull the neck skin by tilting your chin upward and use your non-shaving hand to pull gently downward on the neck skin.  </li>
            <li>When I received it in the mail, I could pretty much smell what it was XD</li>
            <li>I love Ogallala’s products and will be using them for a long time to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It lathers fast and extra foamy rather than watery -- especially with a good brush</li>
            <li>I noticed this soap takes a little more time to build a good lather than other soaps I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s been using it for a good while now, and has hardly put a dent in the first cake.  </li>
            <li>Good smell how ever my wife can not stand the smell of cloves , so it will be used only on long trips that she will not be going on with</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s actually not THAT strong.</li>
            <li>I have been trying Ogallala’s other products and honestly, I thought I was buying the hand soap as I already had an almost new shave soap I was using.</li>
            <li>you have to REALLY whip it up.</li>
            <li>What I noticed after rinsing it off was how much it had softened my beard.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t really smell it.</li>
            <li>I shave with a straight razor</li>
            <li>don’t yet know if I like this better than the Taylor of Old Bond Street but for now, I am switching these two out daily.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other soaps but this one beats them all.</li>
            <li>generally rinse off my brush handle but not all of the bristles leaving some lather in the bristles and store my brush by resting it on the flat top or hang it from a stand.  </li>
            <li>Lather wears out me gets dry pretty quick.</li>
            <li>, I was using Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood shave cream which I happen to enjoy immensely.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend</li>
            <li>I also think it lubricates the face a little better also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>back to the shaving mug for the final lathering and now shave up the neck and work on the cheeks, making sure to rinse my razor frequently.  </li>
            <li>you are going to shower after your shave, don&#x27;t worry about wiping you face, just shower normally.  </li>
            <li>like bay rum scents but a lot of them run too heavy or too light with certain scents.</li>
            <li>My first shaving soap when I switched to traditional wet shaving was the Col. Conk Bay Rum, and the scent of this Ogallala is much more intense and far outlasts the former.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost done with the first but still have about 1/4 of it left or so.</li>
            <li>Ogallala’s scents are pretty equal all across the board.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really compare it to many other soaps since I&#x27;m relatively new to wet shaving.</li>
            <li>It originally sat a little high in the mug, but has since worn down through use to a snug fit.</li>
            <li>Soak the center of the brush but don&#x27;t have too much water at first.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Another nice thing about dealing with John is he is open to scent suggestions or combinations and will communicate with you concerning ideas you may have or what he&#x27;s tried in the past.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m overly sensitive to synthetic fragrances, and this seems very natural to me.  </li>
            <li>It works very well with a double edge razor, or even a cut-throat blade.</li>
            <li>It makes his skin soft too.</li>
            <li>and I like it still so far.</li>
            <li>Lathers well and the scent is the old timey smell of Bay Rum.</li>
            <li>Really builds a rich, thick lather too.  </li>
            <li>I shave downward the first time on the cheeks, making a second pass following the jawline</li>
            <li>If you shave after your shower, wipe your face with a hot, wet washcloth to remove the remaining soap.  </li>
            <li>The last item is he ships very fast and he&#x27;s never failed to slip a little something extra into my order as a thank-you item.  </li>
            <li>I would suggest it very highly for wet shavers.</li>
            <li>It would be very light and fluffy and dissipate in a few seconds.</li>
            <li>use a badger brush which helps me to whip this soap into an incredibly thick and rich lather.</li>
            <li>It was a little large for my soap cup, so I just melted it and poured it in and let it settle.</li>

            <li> I love Ogallala’s products and will be using them for a long time to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It lathers fast and extra foamy rather than watery -- especially with a good brush</li>
            <li> I noticed this soap takes a little more time to build a good lather than other soaps I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s been using it for a good while now, and has hardly put a dent in the first cake.  </li>
            <li> Good smell how ever my wife can not stand the smell of cloves , so it will be used only on long trips that she will not be going on with</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s actually not THAT strong.</li>
            <li> I have been trying Ogallala’s other products and honestly, I thought I was buying the hand soap as I already had an almost new shave soap I was using.</li>
            <li> you have to REALLY whip it up.</li>
            <li> What I noticed after rinsing it off was how much it had softened my beard.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t really smell it.</li>
            <li> I shave with a straight razor</li>
            <li> don’t yet know if I like this better than the Taylor of Old Bond Street but for now, I am switching these two out daily.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other soaps but this one beats them all.</li>
            <li> generally rinse off my brush handle but not all of the bristles leaving some lather in the bristles and store my brush by resting it on the flat top or hang it from a stand.  </li>
            <li> Lather wears out me gets dry pretty quick.</li>
            <li> , I was using Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood shave cream which I happen to enjoy immensely.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend</li>
            <li> I also think it lubricates the face a little better also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> back to the shaving mug for the final lathering and now shave up the neck and work on the cheeks, making sure to rinse my razor frequently.  </li>
            <li> you are going to shower after your shave, don&#x27;t worry about wiping you face, just shower normally.  </li>
            <li> like bay rum scents but a lot of them run too heavy or too light with certain scents.</li>
            <li> My first shaving soap when I switched to traditional wet shaving was the Col. Conk Bay Rum, and the scent of this Ogallala is much more intense and far outlasts the former.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost done with the first but still have about 1/4 of it left or so.</li>
            <li> Ogallala’s scents are pretty equal all across the board.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really compare it to many other soaps since I&#x27;m relatively new to wet shaving.</li>
            <li> It originally sat a little high in the mug, but has since worn down through use to a snug fit.</li>
            <li> Soak the center of the brush but don&#x27;t have too much water at first.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Another nice thing about dealing with John is he is open to scent suggestions or combinations and will communicate with you concerning ideas you may have or what he&#x27;s tried in the past.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m overly sensitive to synthetic fragrances, and this seems very natural to me.  </li>
            <li> It works very well with a double edge razor, or even a cut-throat blade.</li>
            <li> It makes his skin soft too.</li>
            <li> and I like it still so far.</li>
            <li> Lathers well and the scent is the old timey smell of Bay Rum.</li>
            <li> Really builds a rich, thick lather too.  </li>
            <li> I shave downward the first time on the cheeks, making a second pass following the jawline</li>
            <li> If you shave after your shower, wipe your face with a hot, wet washcloth to remove the remaining soap.  </li>
            <li> The last item is he ships very fast and he&#x27;s never failed to slip a little something extra into my order as a thank-you item.  </li>
            <li> I would suggest it very highly for wet shavers.</li>
            <li> It would be very light and fluffy and dissipate in a few seconds.</li>
            <li> use a badger brush which helps me to whip this soap into an incredibly thick and rich lather.</li>
            <li> It was a little large for my soap cup, so I just melted it and poured it in and let it settle.</li>
            <li> Only knock is it loses the face other before I make a full lap on my face.</li>
            <li> Remember, you&#x27;ve paid for a quality brush and you want it to last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I intend to buy this soap as long as they will make it.</li>
            <li> Check for any rough areas and touch up if necessary.  </li>
            <li> so this has lasted me a long time.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I will probably pass the second puck to my son and order one of the other scents.&lt;br /&gt;Gib</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only shave soap I use since I haven&#x27;t needed to purchase any other &#x27;cause</li>
            <li> this has lasted me so long!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t store your wet brush in your shaving cup as you don&#x27;t want your bristles to become malformed from being wet and drying in a curved shape.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who wet shaves.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t shave very often since my beard growth isn&#x27;t crazy nor is it thick like some others, so I haven&#x27;t made much of a dent in one of the pucks</li>
            <li> When shaving, it&#x27;s pretty faint</li>
            <li> No one scent overpowers the other and they all seem to work together equally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> other products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> as far as the soap,We have very hard water</li>
            <li> I would guess that the two pucks  will last at least 4 months.</li>
            <li> Like the slight aroma but its the thinner layer that lets me navigate the cracks and cranny of my face.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t need a half inch of foam to shave.</li>
            <li> Very thick protective lather; it works equally well face lathering or in a bowl.</li>
            <li> I do not wear after shave or colognes so the residual scent left behind from this soap</li>
            <li> a few seconds in a microwave will make it pourable or plyable into your cup.</li>
            <li> And for the lather, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s my technique, brush, or the soap</li>
            <li> But the scent, at least to me, is awful.</li>

            <li> I enjoy the smell of Bay Rum.  I enjoy a brush on shaving soap.  This selection offers both; great fragrance, quality soap, reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot. Good lather, good smell. What else can I say? Its soap.</li>
            <li> I like this soap scent but not my favorite,the pucks are a nice size and lathers ok,really no problem with this brand,</li>
            <li> Like the slight aroma but its the thinner layer that lets me navigate the cracks and cranny of my face.&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t need a half inch of foam to shave.</li>
            <li> Classic barbershop clean shaved bay rum scent. A sweeter scent than many bay rums with notes of vanilla...I don&#x27;t detect any cloves or cinnamon. Very thick protective lather; it works equally well face lathering or in a bowl. Doesn&#x27;t matter if you use a boar or badger brush...the result is a great lather. The scent makes the morning shave a very pleasant, relaxing experience. You could use a bay rum, a vanilla, or a lime aftershave following your shave.</li>
            <li> My son became a proponent of the straight razor all of a sudden, but was using some overpriced fancy schmancy cream stuff from the shaving store, so I got him the &amp;#34;Kingsley Shave Soap Bowl with Lid Dark Wood&amp;#34; and a two pack of this lovely soap, and he&#x27;s extremely happy with it.  He takes it with him whenever he goes anywhere overnight.  It smells really nice, I&#x27;m overly sensitive to synthetic fragrances, and this seems very natural to me.  He&#x27;s been using it for a good while now, and has hardly put a dent in the first cake.  We&#x27;d definately recommend!</li>
            <li> Great lather, amazing scent! I would recommend this soap to anyone looking for a great shave soap to try. It is only the second bay rum soap I have tried, but it beats the pants off of the Col. Conk&#x27;s bay rum in the scent department.</li>
            <li> The price is great. The soap is good, not great, but good quality. Loads on the brush fine. Leathers fine. Provides good protection when shaving. But the scent, at least to me, is awful. I had to throw it away. However,  many people like it so if you are in that number, this is a nice soap at a great price.</li>
            <li> Good smell how ever my wife can not stand the smell of cloves , so it will be used only on long trips that she will not be going on with , i am a hot shot driver so that will be often.</li>
            <li> This soap is awesome!  I really like the bay rum scents and this fit the ideal mold for me.  I do not wear after shave or colognes so the residual scent left behind from this soap is plenty for me. Really builds a rich, thick lather too.  I intend to buy this soap as long as they will make it. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> Great product and fast delivery!</li>
            <li> This soap is one of the best I&#x27;ve tried. It goes on a bit like a paste, and has a couple of moisturizers, as well as glycerin. I would suggest it very highly for wet shavers. It has a nice spicy scent that fills the bathroom(nice guy smell), and I&#x27;m using an early 50&#x27;s Old Spice mug with it. It originally sat a little high in the mug, but has since worn down through use to a snug fit. It works very well with a double edge razor, or even a cut-throat blade.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great! Frankly at first I couldn&#x27;t get the lather right. It would be very light and fluffy and dissipate in a few seconds. Then I read up a little on it and other soaps like it and realized I needed a little more water and the big thing…. you have to REALLY whip it up. Once you get the water mixture right and the technique down, this stuff smells great when you&#x27;re waking up in the morning and makes your face really slick for a great shave. I&#x27;ll often just pick it up to smell it when I&#x27;m walking by it smells so good. It&#x27;s a sweeter and longer lasting smell than Col. Conk (which I like as well). I also think it lubricates the face a little better also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product. Two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> It was shipped the morning after I ordered. as far as the soap,We have very hard water but it produced a great smooth lather on my first tr with a 6 month old Escali brush..I had two days of growth so I decided to try it before I actually shaved. What I noticed after rinsing it off was how much it had softened my beard.Later that day i whipped up a great lather and had a great shave.  The puck is a full 4oz and  the quality is evident. I would guess that the two pucks  will last at least 4 months. This  is a good value. Oh yeah.. almost forgot.. The scent just adds to the shave experience. I will probably pass the second puck to my son and order one of the other scents.&lt;br /&gt;Gib</li>
            <li> My husband loves this stuff, to be honest I do too! It smells wonderful for sure! It makes his skin soft too. Great value great price.</li>
            <li> The aroma is outstanding works as a air freshener in the bath area, good lather, great shave, love it and recommend if you like Bay Rum.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long-time, repeat customer of this product.  I&#x27;ve tried others that worked okay but they didn&#x27;t always whip up into a lasting foam or the scent was off-putting.  I tried John&#x27;s product over five years ago and haven&#x27;t looked back at any others even those given as gifts from family and friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To start, you need a good quality badger boar bristle brush.  This is to insure you don&#x27;t lose bristles in your soap cup or have them on your face while trying to shave.  Soak the center of the brush but don&#x27;t have too much water at first.  I prefer to spin the brush with my fingers to build up soap in the bristles at first, then I add more water to the cup and work up the soap lather by whipping my brush in the cup.  I soon have a nice soft lather at this point.  John&#x27;s soap foams very well and stays smooth and creamy throughout my shave even with family interruptions, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I brush the first layer on my face making sure to cover it well and then go back to the cup to continue whipping up more lather.  I apply the second layer which has now had a chance to soften the beard somewhat and the second layer stays richer and smoother.  If you are like most guys, your beard hair will run multiple directions.  I shave downward the first time on the cheeks, making a second pass following the jawline and then do my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go back to the shaving mug for the final lathering and now shave up the neck and work on the cheeks, making sure to rinse my razor frequently.  The key here for a close shave is to make sure you stretch or pull the neck skin by tilting your chin upward and use your non-shaving hand to pull gently downward on the neck skin.  Stroke the razor evenly and make sure you work the jawline carefully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I generally rinse off my brush handle but not all of the bristles leaving some lather in the bristles and store my brush by resting it on the flat top or hang it from a stand.  This insures I have a quick foam start up the nextmorning.  Don&#x27;t store your wet brush in your shaving cup as you don&#x27;t want your bristles to become malformed from being wet and drying in a curved shape.  Remember, you&#x27;ve paid for a quality brush and you want it to last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are going to shower after your shave, don&#x27;t worry about wiping you face, just shower normally.  If you shave after your shower, wipe your face with a hot, wet washcloth to remove the remaining soap.  Check for any rough areas and touch up if necessary.  The pleasant bay rum scent will gently stay with you through the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another nice thing about dealing with John is he is open to scent suggestions or combinations and will communicate with you concerning ideas you may have or what he&#x27;s tried in the past.  The last item is he ships very fast and he&#x27;s never failed to slip a little something extra into my order as a thank-you item.  It is always a pleasant surprise to find some small token, an air freshener, cologne, bathing soap or anything from his product line.  The bottom line is, since you already have to shave, take some time to enjoy it.  One way I do it is with these quality products from John.</li>
            <li> Great smell and a thick lather that gives a smooth shave . I love this soap. This was my first use of this shave soap and it is very rich in smell and lather. I would recommend this to anyone who wet shaves. Thank&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Great scent, great lather!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  I&#x27;ve been using Ogallala&#x27;s shaving soap for a couple of weeks now, and I love it.  It&#x27;s easy to lather, and the lather is rich, lubricates well, and smells fantastic.  It lathers as well or better than Taylor of Old Bond Street&#x27;s shaving creams, and I think that&#x27;s saying a lot.  My first shaving soap when I switched to traditional wet shaving was the Col. Conk Bay Rum, and the scent of this Ogallala is much more intense and far outlasts the former.  If you like bay rum and close shaves with no razor burn, then this is the stuff for you.  I will definitely be buying it again, whenever the hell it finally runs out.    Oh, and I ordered it on a Wednesday with standard get-you-a-dollar-credit-with-Prime shipping, and it was at my house Monday when I came home from work.</li>
            <li> Love the lather and the scent. I would highly recommend</li>
            <li> So I bought this back in July 2012 and I like it still so far. I don&#x27;t shave very often since my beard growth isn&#x27;t crazy nor is it thick like some others, so I haven&#x27;t made much of a dent in one of the pucks lol&lt;br /&gt;So I can&#x27;t really compare it to many other soaps since I&#x27;m relatively new to wet shaving. But the scent for this is awesome out of the box! Hell, even through the box. When I received it in the mail, I could pretty much smell what it was XD But mind you, it&#x27;s actually not THAT strong. When shaving, it&#x27;s pretty faint so you don&#x27;t really smell it. And for the lather, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s my technique, brush, or the soap but it&#x27;s not as easy to make a lather with it as it is with the VDH soap for example. But, I make it work anyway and I prefer this over the VDH &#x3D;P So I like it and recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--UPDATE--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I thought I might as well update this review. (12/26/13) I am still on the first puck out of the two XD It&#x27;s the only shave soap I use since I haven&#x27;t needed to purchase any other &#x27;cause this has lasted me so long! I&#x27;m almost done with the first but still have about 1/4 of it left or so. My technique has gotten better as well so this lathers just fine. I don&#x27;t shave as often as most people still-- once every 5-7 days-- so this has lasted me a long time. Definitely recommended!</li>
            <li> I have been trying Ogallala’s other products and honestly, I thought I was buying the hand soap as I already had an almost new shave soap I was using. It was a mistake that I am glad I made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like bay rum scents but a lot of them run too heavy or too light with certain scents. Ogallala’s scents are pretty equal all across the board. No one scent overpowers the other and they all seem to work together equally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received this, I was using Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood shave cream which I happen to enjoy immensely. Since I was experimenting with bay rum in aftershaves and hand soaps, I thought I would try this instead of sending it back. This shave soap has proven of equal quality to Ogallala’s other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a badger brush which helps me to whip this soap into an incredibly thick and rich lather. The scent is very pleasant and not overpowering. It provides a nice smooth and close shave although admittedly, I use pre-shave oil under all my shave soaps.&lt;br /&gt;I don’t yet know if I like this better than the Taylor of Old Bond Street but for now, I am switching these two out daily. I love Ogallala’s products and will be using them for a long time to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and yes, I reccomend this for anyone.</li>
            <li> This soap smells so good! I got this as part of a surprise gift for my husband and he loved it!</li>
            <li> Great smelling, great glide.  My favorite shaving soap of all time.</li>
            <li> Lathers well and the scent is the old timey smell of Bay Rum. The large pucks make it worth while to purchase and they will fit into any size shave cup because this product is glycerin based and a few seconds in a microwave will make it pourable or plyable into your cup. This is my first choice when it comes to shave soap.</li>
            <li> Great soap but it would be better if it fit in a standard covered soap dish.  The soap bar needs to be a bit longer and a bit narrower.</li>
            <li> I got these to give as gifts but I ended up trying one of them. Iam glad I did . This product lathers well and gives a close shave. It has a plesent Bay Rum aroma. I shave with a straight razor and I found this soap to work well for me.</li>
            <li> Great scent. Lather not quite as rich as I like.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shaving soap, by far the best smelling one I&#x27;ve ever used. It was a little large for my soap cup, so I just melted it and poured it in and let it settle. Builds a really great lather, I see some reviewers mentioning that it dries quick, and I noticed that a few times, but you just gotta add more water or work the lather a bit more. I noticed this soap takes a little more time to build a good lather than other soaps I&#x27;ve used. If there was one drawback to this, it&#x27;s how quickly it goes. It seems to run out quicker than most soaps, I think because of how soft it is, but it&#x27;s still gonna last you a good long time.</li>
            <li> this is the best shaving soap you can buy. excellent foaming, ultra-fast shipping. great scent .this is the only one i&#x27;ll ever buy. I waited over 4 weeks for &amp;#34;lt. conks&amp;#34;. I would give Ogallala 8 stares if I could.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other soaps but this one beats them all. It lathers fast and extra foamy rather than watery -- especially with a good brush&lt;br /&gt;All of the Ogallala  products demonstrate consistent fragrance and quality --- they remind me of my Grandfather when I small them, so now that I am in my 70&#x27;s I hope my Grand-kids like and remember the way I smell too.  Great products!</li>
            <li> Love the Bay Rum!  Lots of compliments!</li>
            <li> Great scent, lathers nicely. Lasts a long time. Only knock is it loses the face other before I make a full lap on my face.</li>
            <li> Smells great. Lather wears out me gets dry pretty quick.</li>
            <li> Great lather and scent. Everything is as advertised,  will purchase again.</li>
