            <li>Excellent Transaction--Great Product--Fast Shipping--</li>
            <li>and my hands look beautiful!</li>
            <li>Cuticles look great, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It might work great</li>
            <li>I am proud of, but it helps.</li>
            <li>Amazing my nails never looked better!!!</li>
            <li>I was so impressed, but I didn&#x27;t think that there was going to be much more improvement.</li>
            <li>This product is probably good</li>
            <li>but I did not have a good result.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>I honestly cannot see that this serum has repaired or enhanced the state of my nails.</li>
            <li>I cannot return it because it is hazardous material.</li>
            <li>a better packaging/dispensing method would be an improvement.  </li>
            <li>I ordered twice to make sure.</li>
            <li>I really love this product.  </li>
            <li>and then I decided to order 3 more.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, the serum really does seem to help.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply as a massage over your nails at any time because it&#x27;s not oily, and it works even if they are already painted.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about two months and my nails are incredibly strong even while I&#x27;m still getting chemo out of my system...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally review beauty products but this one is so good I had to give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li>Which makes me feel it is unsafe to use because I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s really in there!!!</li>
            <li>I like to apply the serum, then apply a cuticle oil and a rich hand lotion.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re growing much better now because the ends don&#x27;t break and fold as much as they used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just wish overseas inspectors were as good as the American inspectors about the product before it is released for sale.</li>
            <li>and I will have a bottle full of serum that I cant reach/use.</li>
            <li>I gave into impulse and purchased this product, not really expecting it to be any more effective than intensive hand moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Also, it comes with a normal top on it, and then you put the dropper in it when you buy it.</li>
            <li>However I used a old clean nail polish brush and it worked OK..  </li>
            <li>It is a pricey solution, but well worth the cost if one is seeking quick results.</li>
            <li>and I thought this was a liquid that the nail absorbed.  </li>
            <li>the price is worth it</li>
            <li>I put in on at night right before bed.</li>
            <li>but as of right now none had broke considering that I have a office job, do laundry and dishes.</li>
            <li>This product is not greasy, penetrates quickly and really helps with nail growth.</li>
            <li>and I loved it although it can be a little pricey.</li>
            <li>It really helps to strengthen your nails!</li>
            <li>FURTHER MORE, the packaging looked as though everything had already been opened and there was about 1/3  product in the bottle with no signs anything had leaked in delivery.</li>
            <li>The first time you put it on you feel like your nails are growing</li>
            <li>My nails have been able to grow a bit without breaking and my cuticles aren&#x27;t in constant pain like they were before.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a nail biter and this is exactly what I needed to kick that habit and grow them.</li>
            <li>By January, I had a full set of long, strong nails.</li>
            <li>But the bottle is so filled with product, that you can&#x27;t just keep the dropper in the bottle, you have to put the regular top back on it at first.</li>
            <li>My cuticles are smooth and healthy looking and my nails don&#x27;t look a bit dry when bare.  </li>
            <li>I rubbed the serum in for several seconds on each nail and it absorbed pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>They are very flexible and don&#x27;t chip or peel at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At night, I apply serum, cuticle cream and Aquaphor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: Doesn&#x27;t do much of anything for nails.</li>
            <li>As others have noted, the dropper that comes with the bottle doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li>I was not expecting much</li>
            <li>but it really worked.</li>
            <li>Made my nails much stronger, seemed to help them grow faster too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyways, as a &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; serum, this product did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li>I am very dissappointed and would never purchase this type of item from them if this is what I can expect when I place an order.</li>
            <li>I believe that along with doing weekly manicures helped my nails grow out long and strong but flexible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am excited to grow my nails back out and not worry about a salon manicure with acrylics.</li>
            <li>I like this serum growth product so much better than the other Sally Hansen Nailgrowth products.</li>
            <li>better than any other .</li>
            <li>After four weeks, the free edge had reached the end of my fingers and now at around six weeks, the free edge is about 1/4 inch past my fingertips and I have filed them a couple of times.  </li>
            <li>Mainly I&#x27;ve used it when I&#x27;m being diligent about taking care of my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This is such a FABULOUS product and it really does work for the long term.</li>
            <li>This is very oily, and does not dry.</li>
            <li>I had started using the nail serum while my mother in law was down on a visit because she has such lovely nails</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to be sure.</li>
            <li>It also keeps your cuticles soft.</li>
            <li>My nails are growing again and my cuticles are so soft.</li>
            <li>Once the layers separate, they don&#x27;t grow back together and the separation wants to spread, just like a crack in the windshield of a car.</li>
            <li>The only con is that you have to shake it upside down until the serum comes out  - not that easy - as it doesn&#x27;t come with any type of brush/applier.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m still using it on a more or less daily basis along with Burt&#x27;s Bees Lemon Butter cuticle cream, some extra virgin olive oil and Curel hand lotion.  </li>
            <li>My cuticles are in pretty rough shape because I have to wash my hands a lot with antibacterial soap for where I work (which dries my skin out a lot).</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t feel it did much stopped not long after starting, could try again</li>
            <li>My nails have been growing back after chemo and a stem cell transplant, and just after the first few days, they were so much stronger.</li>
            <li>The only recommendation I would give is to use it only on bare nails.</li>
            <li>It is a thick gel, not greasy, dries fairly quickly.  </li>

            <li> It is a thick gel, not greasy, dries fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li> I think it does help my very thin nails from bending and tearing, so I&#x27;m generally pleased.</li>
            <li> One can use very little and really see nail improvement in a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> I have soft nails and saw an improvement in strength after less than a week using this product.  </li>
            <li> After that I used Sally Hansen Miracle Cure Polish (in the blue bottle) because my nails are very brittle and weak.</li>
            <li> My cuticles get dry in the winter, and (embarrassingly) I tend to pick at them when that happens.</li>
            <li> This was not new as it said.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried getting frequent manicures and using lots of moisturizers and creams, but I saw very little change.</li>
            <li> It was opened and less than half left.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> There is less smell and less hassle as there is no need to wait SO long for a polish to dry.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This Item arrived very quickly after being ordered however, the bottle was broken open (before it was even shipped)-as there was no residue in the outer packing material-it was so badly damaged that it could not have been overlooked.  </li>
            <li> I was taking some vitamins and for some odd reason I just assumed it was the vitamins and not the serum.</li>
            <li> I started using this in Nov 2011 and saw growth in a few days.</li>
            <li> WOW was I wrong.</li>
            <li> it makes your nails stonger in just a few uses.  </li>
            <li> Talk about creating customer disatisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big waste of money because of the dispenser.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through 2 bottles of this serum  over the past 5 years.</li>
            <li> how if ever I will get my money back --WHAT A RIP-OFF!.  </li>
            <li> usually use this product alone, but when I want an even faster amount of nail growth, I&#x27;ll put on this serum and then follow up with a coat of Sally Hansen&#x27;s &#x27;Nail Nutrition, Green Tea + Olive growth treatment&#x27;!</li>
            <li> The one small downfall though is that I wish it made my nails thicker</li>
            <li> Also, it doesnt have a brush to apply with just a dropper and you have to rub it in with your fingers, which got very messy</li>
            <li> I mean it literally would not pick up any product in it, so</li>
            <li> I have weak, brittle nails from the meds I take</li>
            <li> The serum is very thick.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The eyedropper dispenser works really poorly:  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m so annoyed it doesn&#x27;t come with an application brush.</li>
            <li> My nails are thin and using polish or remover dries them out.</li>
            <li> I stopped using the serum and needless to say my nails started breaking and stopped growing.</li>
            <li> and I was skeptical about it, but I tried it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s useless if you cant get the product out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> So then you&#x27;ve got this dirty dropper</li>
            <li> This sellers pictures for their product are WRONG and led me to believe I was getting a base coat polish, not</li>
            <li> Awhile ago I bought Sally Hansen&#x27;s nail growth miracle as a base coat polish from Walmart,  </li>
            <li> I received this yesterday and was very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> They looked terrible.</li>
            <li> My fingernails are terrible.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made the decision to stop biting my nails around mid-March and got this to use to get my nails back into shape.  In two weeks, I had enough nail growth to file and polish.  After four weeks, the free edge had reached the end of my fingers and now at around six weeks, the free edge is about 1/4 inch past my fingertips and I have filed them a couple of times.  I&#x27;d say I got at least two months worth of growth in about four to six weeks.  I used it twice a day as much as possible along with another of Sally Hansen&#x27;s strengthening products.  I believe that along with doing weekly manicures helped my nails grow out long and strong but flexible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still using it on a more or less daily basis along with Burt&#x27;s Bees Lemon Butter cuticle cream, some extra virgin olive oil and Curel hand lotion.  My cuticles are smooth and healthy looking and my nails don&#x27;t look a bit dry when bare.  They are very flexible and don&#x27;t chip or peel at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have short nails and would like them to be longer, definitely get this.</li>
            <li> I have soft nails and saw an improvement in strength after less than a week using this product.  They&#x27;re growing much better now because the ends don&#x27;t break and fold as much as they used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eyedropper dispenser works really poorly:  a better packaging/dispensing method would be an improvement.  But once you get it out of the bottle it works well.</li>
            <li> This product is probably good but I&#x27;m so annoyed it doesn&#x27;t come with an application brush. I ordered twice to make sure.</li>
            <li> My nails had stopped growing for over a year. I started using this in Nov 2011 and saw growth in a few days. By January, I had a full set of long, strong nails. It also keeps your cuticles soft. I highly recommend this product. It&#x27;s amazing!&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: June 2012  This is such a FABULOUS product and it really does work for the long term. The only recommendation I would give is to use it only on bare nails. The minute I tried using it over nail polish, my nails began to break and split. The directions say you can use it over nail polish but I did not have a good result.</li>
            <li> My nails have been growing back after chemo and a stem cell transplant, and just after the first few days, they were so much stronger. I&#x27;ve been using it for about two months and my nails are incredibly strong even while I&#x27;m still getting chemo out of my system...definitely recommend!!</li>
            <li> It really helps to strengthen your nails! Easy to apply as a massage over your nails at any time because it&#x27;s not oily, and it works even if they are already painted. The only con is that you have to shake it upside down until the serum comes out  - not that easy - as it doesn&#x27;t come with any type of brush/applier.</li>
            <li> This is very oily, and does not dry. Also, it doesnt have a brush to apply with just a dropper and you have to rub it in with your fingers, which got very messy</li>
            <li> I had started using the nail serum while my mother in law was down on a visit because she has such lovely nails and I never have. Instantly I saw growth and my nails stopped breaking. I did not accredit it to this product however. I was taking some vitamins and for some odd reason I just assumed it was the vitamins and not the serum. I stopped using the serum and needless to say my nails started breaking and stopped growing. They looked terrible. It has been about 4 months since then and I just saw the serum in my medicine chest last week and remembered I even had it and began using it again.........WOW was I wrong. It was not the vitamins. Definantly the serum! My nails are growing again and my cuticles are so soft. I will never doubt this product again. I am excited to grow my nails back out and not worry about a salon manicure with acrylics.</li>
            <li> My cuticles get dry in the winter, and (embarrassingly) I tend to pick at them when that happens. I gave into impulse and purchased this product, not really expecting it to be any more effective than intensive hand moisturizer. Surprisingly, the serum really does seem to help. It is a pricey solution, but well worth the cost if one is seeking quick results.</li>
            <li> Excellent Transaction--Great Product--Fast Shipping--A+A+A+</li>
            <li> I really love this product.  One can use very little and really see nail improvement in a couple of weeks. I would give it five stars except the second batch that arrived came without the eye dropper which one uses to put on the drop of serum on the nail.  The serum is very thick.  However I used a old clean nail polish brush and it worked OK..  I just wish overseas inspectors were as good as the American inspectors about the product before it is released for sale.</li>
            <li> I think it does help my very thin nails from bending and tearing, so I&#x27;m generally pleased. It has definitely helped cuticle health and that &amp;#34;ragged, dry&amp;#34; look.</li>
            <li> Amazing my nails never looked better!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through 2 bottles of this serum  over the past 5 years. Mainly I&#x27;ve used it when I&#x27;m being diligent about taking care of my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I use this stuff, it does work -- I think. It&#x27;s hard to be sure. I can see the effects on cuticles immediately. For nails, I can&#x27;t see that it does anything. My nails did not grow faster or stronger. Just normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently my nails had a full-scale disaster after I worked a day with my hands in rubber gloves. Every one of my nails began to separate and peel. Once the layers separate, they don&#x27;t grow back together and the separation wants to spread, just like a crack in the windshield of a car. I began using this serum morning and night. I honestly cannot see that this serum has repaired or enhanced the state of my nails. Cuticles look great, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to use this serum when I go into hyperdrive about taking care of my hands and nails. This means I&#x27;m also using cuticle cream, applying lotion (or heavier greases) after every hand wash, and wearing garden gloves. With all of this intensive care, of course my hangnails have healed and cuticles and skin are moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro:  I like the way this serum is non-greasy  and smooths my cuticles. I like to apply the serum, then apply a cuticle oil and a rich hand lotion. At night, I apply serum, cuticle cream and Aquaphor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: Doesn&#x27;t do much of anything for nails.As others have noted, the dropper that comes with the bottle doesn&#x27;t work very well. I now dip a manicure stick into the bottle and use it to apply the serum.</li>
            <li> I received this yesterday and was very disappointed.  It might work great but it&#x27;s not the product I thought I was getting. It came with a dropper and it&#x27;s supposed to soak into the nail. Awhile ago I bought Sally Hansen&#x27;s nail growth miracle as a base coat polish from Walmart,  it works fantastically and I loved it although it can be a little pricey. This sellers pictures for their product are WRONG and led me to believe I was getting a base coat polish, not some soak in stuff. FURTHER MORE, the packaging looked as though everything had already been opened and there was about 1/3  product in the bottle with no signs anything had leaked in delivery. Which makes me feel it is unsafe to use because I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s really in there!!! I will never order anything from this seller again I believe it&#x27;s a scam!!!!</li>
            <li> I was not expecting much but it really worked. Cured a split in my nail I&#x27;d been painting over for years.</li>
            <li> I have used this once and I already see a difference. I use to bite my nails and I had no nails. It works 100%. The first time you put it on you feel like your nails are growing it is like miracle growth for plants..</li>
            <li> CVS has this serum for $9.99 and this week you get second Sally Hansen 50% off.  To think I almost bought this here.  Plus, I had a $3 off coupon from CVS.</li>
            <li> I have weak, brittle nails from the meds I take and I thought this was a liquid that the nail absorbed.  I&#x27;ll keep looking for it.</li>
            <li> My cuticles are in pretty rough shape because I have to wash my hands a lot with antibacterial soap for where I work (which dries my skin out a lot). I&#x27;ve tried getting frequent manicures and using lots of moisturizers and creams, but I saw very little change. I bought this last week and I was skeptical about it, but I tried it. I put in on at night right before bed. I rubbed the serum in for several seconds on each nail and it absorbed pretty quickly. After that I used Sally Hansen Miracle Cure Polish (in the blue bottle) because my nails are very brittle and weak. The next morning my cuticles were obviously improved. I was so impressed, but I didn&#x27;t think that there was going to be much more improvement. It&#x27;s now been a week and I&#x27;ve being doing the same procedure every night before bed and my hands look beautiful! My nails have been able to grow a bit without breaking and my cuticles aren&#x27;t in constant pain like they were before. I definitely recommend this product, also try the Sally Hansen Miracle Cure polish!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t feel it did much stopped not long after starting, could try again but i can&#x27;t be bothered</li>
            <li> Pros:  the serum works.  it makes your nails stonger in just a few uses.  It is a thick gel, not greasy, dries fairly quickly.  A little goes a long way. You can use it over nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  You cant get the stuff out of the bottle.  It comes with a mini dropper and it doesnt work. It&#x27;s useless if you cant get the product out of the bottle.  I am currently using the dropper as a dip stick but I can see that eventually, that will not work and I will have a bottle full of serum that I cant reach/use. Talk about creating customer disatisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big waste of money because of the dispenser.  Buy something else.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally review beauty products but this one is so good I had to give it 5 stars. Made my nails much stronger, seemed to help them grow faster too. I&#x27;m a nail biter and this is exactly what I needed to kick that habit and grow them.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s start with the packaging. The dropper it came with did not work at all. I mean it literally would not pick up any product in it, so to use this product I just had to dunk the dropper into the bottle and rub it on my nails. Also, it comes with a normal top on it, and then you put the dropper in it when you buy it. But the bottle is so filled with product, that you can&#x27;t just keep the dropper in the bottle, you have to put the regular top back on it at first. So then you&#x27;ve got this dirty dropper you don&#x27;t know what to do with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, as a &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; serum, this product did absolutely nothing for me. My nails are no stronger, they are still chipped  and brittle, and I followed the instructions to a T. Would never repurchase this product.</li>
            <li> This Item arrived very quickly after being ordered however, the bottle was broken open (before it was even shipped)-as there was no residue in the outer packing material-it was so badly damaged that it could not have been overlooked.  I found out that all though they can ship it to me.  I cannot return it because it is hazardous material. I have no idea how if ever I will get my money back --WHAT A RIP-OFF!.  I am very dissappointed and would never purchase this type of item from them if this is what I can expect when I place an order.</li>
            <li> This product is not greasy, penetrates quickly and really helps with nail growth. I recomment this to all of my friends.</li>
            <li> My nails are stronger, longer and healthier than before! I like this serum growth product so much better than the other Sally Hansen Nailgrowth products. There is less smell and less hassle as there is no need to wait SO long for a polish to dry.&lt;br /&gt;I usually use this product alone, but when I want an even faster amount of nail growth, I&#x27;ll put on this serum and then follow up with a coat of Sally Hansen&#x27;s &#x27;Nail Nutrition, Green Tea + Olive growth treatment&#x27;!</li>
            <li> This was not new as it said. It was opened and less than half left. I was refunded.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I had really short nails before I used this product. I felt like I have tried everything when it comes to nail growth and this is the only product that worked. I recommend just trying it out you never know if it will work for you. The one small downfall though is that I wish it made my nails thicker but as of right now none had broke considering that I have a office job, do laundry and dishes. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> this product WORKS!!!! better than any other . My nails are thin and using polish or remover dries them out. they crack ,split etc.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered 3 bottles and then I decided to order 3 more. the price is worth it</li>
            <li> My fingernails are terrible.  This product helps - I cannot say that it gives me nails I am proud of, but it helps.</li>
