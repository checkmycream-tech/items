            <li>lol...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyways, these bars are a great buy for the price (you get four (4) bars of about 8+ ounces each), and they were received</li>

            <li>useful for all kinds of things and perfect for travel size.</li>
            <li>The price increased by $7 the day after I purchased it LOL:)</li>

            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I warm them with my electric heater and use them for their therapeutic value.</li>
            <li>They are nice quality Himalayan Salt bars, I did somehow think they would be smoother but working around that.  </li>

            <li>This is a great value and the salt bars are very high quality!</li>
            <li>i love these soap bars.</li>
            <li>I have ordered the bars many times.  </li>
            <li>I purchased it more for an energetic cleansing; it also has a deodorant effect.  </li>
            <li>Will buy more when she runs out.</li>
            <li>I love Himalayan products</li>
            <li>i will buy more when run out.</li>
            <li>overall I&#x27;m happy with these as they are what i wanted and a good price.</li>
            <li>I bought these for use as a deodorant alternative to the Crystal Salt deodorants that I&#x27;d used for many, many years and been happy with the results, but had recently heard some not so good info about (about the type of salt</li>
            <li>This really does work!!!!</li>
            <li>i love himalaya salt use it every time i shower it natural with no chemical that good.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re wanting a beautiful bar of solid Himalayan salt, this is it.  </li>
            <li>These work fine to eliminate odor for light sweat.</li>
            <li>Such a great product....</li>
            <li>It is important to not rub the bar on your skin though.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re nice big, solid bars and they look beautiful &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>These salt blocks actually work surprisingly well for a deodorant bar.</li>
            <li>This salt does a better job of killing bacteria and leaving your body deodorized than your body wash does now, most likely.</li>
            <li>Ok, when this first arrived I was ready to see what all the fuss was about.</li>
            <li>these products have lasted me longer, satisfied me more and cost me less than the original list of body care products I used to purchase.</li>
            <li>The price is right.  </li>
            <li>Unique for a gift although not provable as to particular usefulness</li>
            <li>I find it works better than my regular deodorant, although it does not help with wetness.</li>
            <li>kind of rough on the skin and dont get a real salty smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used crystal deodorant for many years, and I was hoping these could be used in the bath as a full body deodorant, so typical me</li>
            <li>It is most likely just a matter of preference, but I will pay little more next time and order one with more distinct mineral coloring, as these were all in uniformly clear color.</li>
            <li>I also dampen (with emphasis) the SMOOTHEST side of the bar and gently apply the salt to my underarms to use as deodorant.</li>
            <li>Better than any deodorant but, be careful not to leave it elsewhere even indise the shower.</li>
            <li>in fact, I don&#x27;t think the word &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; should really be in the description, but</li>
            <li>Girlfriend really like the salt soap.</li>
            <li>Guess you could say I really like the stuff.</li>
            <li>These are more on the clear side than pink.</li>
            <li>Just rub a little more on and voilà</li>
            <li>You must do this immediately after your skin is clean and dry or it will not work, as this type of deodorizing works on the idea that you kill the bacteria on the skin that causes odor before it has the chance while leaving a layer of salty minerally goodness on your skin that will continue to kill bacteria.</li>
            <li>Normally buy it at the farmers market for 20$ for 2 bars.</li>
            <li>In addition, I was reading someone&#x27;s review regarding one of the other Himalayan salt bars available on Amazon</li>
            <li>I couple the salt with a natural mineral deodorant to avoid the parabens and aluminum found in normal deodorant.</li>
            <li>If you are interested in similar products to naturalize your body care, purchase this, mineral deodorant, Dr. Bronner&#x27;s and coconut oil for your mouth (google oil pulling) and you will have your hippie hygiene regime.</li>
            <li>This soap, while pretty, does not lather at all and is so abrasive I can only use it on the bottoms of my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it was nice until it got really sharp and rough at the end.</li>
            <li>the plus side, the bars are huge, so I&#x27;m going to have callous scrub for a long, long time.</li>
            <li>I believe the suggestion is to use a washcloth though I do use it directly on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Salt is a natural bacterial inhibitor so you can use it on your body to kill odor causing bacteria.</li>
            <li>But, unfortunately, the edges are too sharp on the soap to use it directly on my skin.. when buying this soap, order the kind with smooth edges.. as these will irritate your skin and make it burn for a while.</li>
            <li>Put a little moisturizing lotion under your arm and then rub this salt bar to make sure that enough salt is left to kill the bacteria in your sweat.</li>
            <li>I use these for dry rashy skin and they really help a lot.  </li>
            <li>Individually wrapped in clear plastic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got sensitive skin, so this is like making tiny cuts all over my body (yes, it hurts) and then rubbing salt into the wound.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re kind of weird.</li>

            <li> If you rub it directly on your skin, it can be a little abrasive -</li>
            <li> There is absolutely no residue left on the skin after washing with this.</li>
            <li> This natural Deodorant bar I use everyday and no swetting smell.</li>
            <li> length because hair provides more real estate for bad bacteria to grow!</li>
            <li> Let air dry</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll find you stink far less with less hair on your body to harbor bacteria in the pits and crevices of your body...</li>
            <li> If you have the common sense to use this salt soap properly (do not rub directly on skin, use a towel or exfoliating cloth) and are not interested in froo froo smelly body washes that leave residue on the skin, then this is what you are looking for.</li>
            <li> even if you are being careful.</li>
            <li> Just get the bar wet and rub on your hands then rub your hands on the skin.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t rub it on the skin because it is too rough.</li>
            <li> I use pink Himalayan salt for cooking and I have 3 salt lamps....</li>
            <li> These bars are not really soap, they are just blocks of Himalayan pink salt, with the shape of a soap bar.</li>
            <li> It really works, I have no odor at all, and once I do sweat, I have a very faint natural body odor.</li>
            <li> they are sharp</li>
            <li> I use it under my arms, on my feet and any other places that get sweaty.</li>
            <li> As someone else mentioned, the surface becomes very rough as soon as you use it.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is the chunks of salt are sharp in some places</li>
            <li> A little rough at times.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes they get a little rough as they wear down from use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bonus thought: If you have armpit hair then keep it slightly shorter than it&#x27;s typical 2&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t get sudsy and they are harsh on the skin.</li>
            <li> You sometimes have to re-apply them a couple times a day, but I would rather do that instead of using deodorants with harsh chemicals in them.</li>
            <li> Use this soap everyday...</li>
            <li> Not sure it works as well as I&#x27;d like it to for deodorant.</li>
            <li> having a hard time transferring the product from bar to hands.</li>
            <li> Due to ability to slice the skin I would consider dangerous.</li>
            <li> Mine came at 8.9oz with approximate size of 3.5&amp;#34;x2&amp;#34;x1.25&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a waste not, want not kinda gal, so I&#x27;ll think of something to do with them, but I&#x27;m afraid it won&#x27;t be in my shower.</li>
            <li> might b using them wrong</li>
            <li> Sorry guys!</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;soaps&amp;#34; were horrible if u want to call them soap.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> NEVER RECEIVED PRODUCT. RECEIVED COFFEE INSTEAD. BUT THIS STUFF IS STILL AWESOME.</li>
            <li> If you have the common sense to use this salt soap properly (do not rub directly on skin, use a towel or exfoliating cloth) and are not interested in froo froo smelly body washes that leave residue on the skin, then this is what you are looking for. There is absolutely no residue left on the skin after washing with this. This salt does a better job of killing bacteria and leaving your body deodorized than your body wash does now, most likely. I tend to break out on my shoulders and nothing has improved it except washing regularly with salt. I also dampen (with emphasis) the SMOOTHEST side of the bar and gently apply the salt to my underarms to use as deodorant. Be careful as your underarms are sensitive and the salt is abrasive. I couple the salt with a natural mineral deodorant to avoid the parabens and aluminum found in normal deodorant. You must do this immediately after your skin is clean and dry or it will not work, as this type of deodorizing works on the idea that you kill the bacteria on the skin that causes odor before it has the chance while leaving a layer of salty minerally goodness on your skin that will continue to kill bacteria. I find it works better than my regular deodorant, although it does not help with wetness. This bar is also excellent for exfoliating your feet. If you are interested in similar products to naturalize your body care, purchase this, mineral deodorant, Dr. Bronner&#x27;s and coconut oil for your mouth (google oil pulling) and you will have your hippie hygiene regime. PS: these products have lasted me longer, satisfied me more and cost me less than the original list of body care products I used to purchase.</li>
            <li> These Himalayan Salts are amazing! I warm them with my electric heater and use them for their therapeutic value.</li>
            <li> These are more on the clear side than pink. Individually wrapped in clear plastic. Mine came at 8.9oz with approximate size of 3.5&amp;#34;x2&amp;#34;x1.25&amp;#34;. It is most likely just a matter of preference, but I will pay little more next time and order one with more distinct mineral coloring, as these were all in uniformly clear color.</li>
            <li> Looks good not used yet</li>
            <li> useful for all kinds of things and perfect for travel size.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t rub this on your body in the shower you will look like you got in a cat fight with scratches all over. even if you are being careful. they are sharp</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a block of salt NOT SOAP!</li>
            <li> I like these a lot.  Only complaint is the chunks of salt are sharp in some places so I use my hands or a washcloth. Have given some as gifts.</li>
            <li> This is a great value and the salt bars are very high quality!</li>
            <li> These work amazing!  Such a great product....double as a foot pumice.  I also quit buying face wash and now substitute this!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re kind of weird. They don&#x27;t get sudsy and they are harsh on the skin.</li>
            <li> This really does work!!!! It helps my feet and it makes a GREAT deodorant</li>
            <li> i love these soap bars.</li>
            <li> Product received not as pictured.  I have ordered the bars many times.  Last order was 4 much smaller bars than pictured.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an alternative to the Swedish Dream Sea Salt Soap.... this is not it.  This soap, while pretty, does not lather at all and is so abrasive I can only use it on the bottoms of my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, the bars are huge, so I&#x27;m going to have callous scrub for a long, long time.</li>
            <li> Better than any deodorant but, be careful not to leave it elsewhere even indise the shower. It melts like ice and you&#x27;ll be surprise.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re wanting a beautiful bar of solid Himalayan salt, this is it.  It is NOT a lathery soap - in fact, I don&#x27;t think the word &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; should really be in the description, but if you read the one and only ingredient in it, you know it isn&#x27;t going to lather.  If you rub it directly on your skin, it can be a little abrasive - I believe the suggestion is to use a washcloth though I do use it directly on my skin.  Don&#x27;t leave it sitting where it will be soaked ... it&#x27;s salt - it&#x27;ll melt.  I purchased it more for an energetic cleansing; it also has a deodorant effect.  In addition, I was reading someone&#x27;s review regarding one of the other Himalayan salt bars available on Amazon and they said that when they used this, it healed their eczema.  I have had eczema on my hands for a couple of years now.  It is kept under control by a medicated cream.  However, I have used this salt bar for a week or two and my eczema is gone!!  I&#x27;ll always be keeping it around!!  They&#x27;re nice big, solid bars and they look beautiful &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> This natural Deodorant bar I use everyday and no swetting smell. I am really happy with it so I am not going to use chemical Deodorant anymore.</li>
            <li> They are nice quality Himalayan Salt bars, I did somehow think they would be smoother but working around that.  I bought sanding pads for in between use.</li>
            <li> I use these for dry rashy skin and they really help a lot.  It is important to not rub the bar on your skin though.  Just get the bar wet and rub on your hands then rub your hands on the skin.  Let air dry and you are done.  😃</li>
            <li> Girlfriend really like the salt soap. Normally buy it at the farmers market for 20$ for 2 bars. Will buy more when she runs out.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;soaps&amp;#34; were horrible if u want to call them soap. Felt like rubbing fiberglass on my body w pieces of glass. No suds at all.&lt;br /&gt;I might b using them wrong but I don&#x27;t think so.</li>
            <li> Unique for a gift although not provable as to particular usefulness</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant bar! It really works, I have no odor at all, and once I do sweat, I have a very faint natural body odor. Just rub a little more on and voilà the stink is gone! Will be getting more once I am out!</li>
            <li> A little rough at times.  Not sure it works as well as I&#x27;d like it to for deodorant.</li>
            <li> They came in great condition. Came earlier then the estimated delivery date.&lt;br /&gt;I have used a Himalayan Salt bar before and loved it. They last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Will be buying them again.</li>
            <li> If you want to stop feeding aluminum to your body, this is one option. Put a little moisturizing lotion under your arm and then rub this salt bar to make sure that enough salt is left to kill the bacteria in your sweat. You can expect good results and reduced risk from aluminum consumption.</li>
            <li> I love Himalayan products BUT this actually cut my skin in several locations. The product has jagged crystals that protrude as you use the soap. had to stop using it as it cut under my arm, nose, back and groin area. There should be a warning label on it and it should not be sold until this problem is resolved. Due to ability to slice the skin I would consider dangerous. Sorry guys!</li>
            <li> i love himalaya salt use it every time i shower it natural with no chemical that good.  i will buy more when run out.</li>
            <li> These salt blocks actually work surprisingly well for a deodorant bar. You sometimes have to re-apply them a couple times a day, but I would rather do that instead of using deodorants with harsh chemicals in them. Your body is made to perspire... let it do it&#x27;s thing. Salt is a natural bacterial inhibitor so you can use it on your body to kill odor causing bacteria. Your skin will also absorb the salts and minerals from the application so that will benefit you, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus thought: If you have armpit hair then keep it slightly shorter than it&#x27;s typical 2&amp;#34; length because hair provides more real estate for bad bacteria to grow! Use scissors or an electric shaver set to a 1/4 or 1/2 in. and you&#x27;ll find you stink far less with less hair on your body to harbor bacteria in the pits and crevices of your body...</li>
            <li> it was nice until it got really sharp and rough at the end. But I guess that&#x27;s what happens to salt in water.</li>
            <li> Ok, when this first arrived I was ready to see what all the fuss was about. But, unfortunately, the edges are too sharp on the soap to use it directly on my skin.. when buying this soap, order the kind with smooth edges.. as these will irritate your skin and make it burn for a while.</li>
            <li> there is no way you douse this as a bar of soap !BUT… what makes it so wonderful, is I throw it in the tub as it is filling, leave it in the tub for a wonder soothing Himalaian  Bath soak!… rand then, use what left as a foot exfoliator !</li>
            <li> kind of rough on the skin and dont get a real salty smell. having a hard time transferring the product from bar to hands. i know it is not supposed to lather but it doesn&#x27;t feel like it is getting on my hands. overall I&#x27;m happy with these as they are what i wanted and a good price.</li>
            <li> Use this soap everyday...it is awesome</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t soaps. They are just Himalayan salt bars. The marketing is misleading. I actually thought I was purchasing a salt soap bar which I can use in the shower/bath. But instead I got a bar/brick of actual salt, which you cannot rub on your body as a soup bar, unless you want to rip open your skin.</li>
            <li> Amazing!...lol... Thank you..</li>
            <li> The price increased by $7 the day after I purchased it LOL:) Good thing each bar lasts about a year!</li>
            <li> It is a foamy soap at all.  You can&#x27;t rub it on the skin because it is too rough. I just rub it on my palm or sole of my feet.  I will not buy again.  The price is right.  But the product should not even be described as soap.  It is just a salt bar.  I use it every day but I have not seen a difference on my skin.  I am not buy again. I will invest in a more expensive salt scrub.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having to rethink this purchase....I use pink Himalayan salt for cooking and I have 3 salt lamps....Guess you could say I really like the stuff. I&#x27;ve used crystal deodorant for many years, and I was hoping these could be used in the bath as a full body deodorant, so typical me, I ordered 4 instead of 1....As someone else mentioned, the surface becomes very rough as soon as you use it. I&#x27;ve got sensitive skin, so this is like making tiny cuts all over my body (yes, it hurts) and then rubbing salt into the wound. I had to shower it all off, and then I itched and burned for what seemed like forever. I&#x27;m a waste not, want not kinda gal, so I&#x27;ll think of something to do with them, but I&#x27;m afraid it won&#x27;t be in my shower.</li>
            <li> These work fine to eliminate odor for light sweat. Sometimes they get a little rough as they wear down from use.</li>
            <li> I bought these for use as a deodorant alternative to the Crystal Salt deodorants that I&#x27;d used for many, many years and been happy with the results, but had recently heard some not so good info about (about the type of salt the deodorants may consist of).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, these bars are a great buy for the price (you get four (4) bars of about 8+ ounces each), and they were received very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with the purchase, and may buy them again...though I can&#x27;t imagine running out anytime soon, since salt deodorants last a really, really, really long time, LOL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.  These bars are not really soap, they are just blocks of Himalayan pink salt, with the shape of a soap bar.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I use it under my arms, on my feet and any other places that get sweaty. Leaves no fragrance and lessens body odor.</li>
