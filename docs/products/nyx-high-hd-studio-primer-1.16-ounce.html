            <li>Nix is my favorite make, and I am very happy whit all the my items.  </li>
            <li>I love it keeps my makeup flawless</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to keep using it though because I do have fair skin</li>
            <li>, I loved my makeup on the pictures though, but</li>
            <li>I think its a good buy.</li>
            <li>but over all good product.</li>

            <li>This product is a MUST if I have a photoshoot or special event where I want my makeup to stay flawless.</li>
            <li>Excellent to balance out between normal/oily areas, I would say this primer is more for combination skin and your NYX Cosmetics High Definition Photogenic Foundation goes on flawlessly after this.</li>
            <li>But after using it more, i think it&#x27;s a great primer.</li>
            <li>I wanted to make sure that I looked great in any photos that were taken.</li>
            <li>This is a good product but nothing spectacular.</li>
            <li>I love mine, and love to use it on others!!</li>
            <li>I love this produc I will def get more!!</li>
            <li>Its MUCH better!</li>
            <li>I love this primer!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>It still leaves my face silky and smooth and my liquid foundation looks great over it.</li>
            <li>Nothing amazing</li>
            <li>but it feels amazing.</li>
            <li>and I tell it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>NYX is an AMAZING brand for the price, and this primer did not disappoint.</li>
            <li>They really did make my skin look flawless.</li>
            <li>and I liked it.</li>
            <li>I personally liked [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>It seemed to kind of wash my face out and it was a bit drying.</li>
            <li>the lip gloss is nice to also the eye shadows</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel nice, makes it look nice too.  </li>
            <li>I have tried this product, i liked it</li>
            <li>This primer has a nice glide on the skin and has no feeling of a mask or clogging your skin.</li>
            <li>Today I was watching videos on how to make your own cream eye shadows and decided to use this primer to mix with my micas.</li>
            <li>And I like NYX products alot they wear really nice...</li>
            <li>All blend nicely.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to the makeup department, but this is the best primer I have yet to come across.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best cheaper one I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li>and I was pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li>I have been an avid user of Smashbox&#x27;s primer for years now, and while i still do love everything Smashbox I have to say that this primer worked great for me.  </li>
            <li>I can see a huge difference in the way my skin looks!</li>
            <li>All in all, I love it</li>
            <li>better.</li>
            <li>what so ever, but if your looking for an ok cheap primer to make you look nice for pictures, you have found it.</li>
            <li>those wretched bumps still there, so if you&#x27;re acne free go for it, and if you&#x27;re prone,.. STAY AWAY!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make your skin look smooth as primer should!</li>
            <li>It was an okay product.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite primer</li>
            <li>The vendor was also fantastic and would use again!</li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor and purchase a better quality primer....</li>
            <li>My face be more illuminate .</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>still not quite sure how that happens.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;d be more noticeable, more often, if you had a darker skin</li>
            <li>once I rubbed it in, and placed my makeup on top....</li>
            <li>/&gt;SO glad I made the purchase.</li>
            <li>BUT I GUESS ITS AN OKAY PRODUCT</li>
            <li>YOU CAN FIND BETTER</li>
            <li>I love NYX make up</li>
            <li>I suggest investing in a better primer.</li>
            <li>The quality of the brand &amp;#34;Make Up Forever&amp;#34; is better than NYX.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t disagree more.</li>
            <li>Hopefully I will find something better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give it some more time and tweek my process</li>
            <li>Love how it feels on my skin, it leaves a soft-fresh feeling.</li>
            <li>, It&#x27;s a most if you are looking for that porcelain face</li>
            <li>, I like the one with ones with silicone in it better</li>
            <li>when I bought this I wasn&#x27;t sure of how to use this</li>
            <li>I kept looking in the mirror to make sure my face didn&#x27;t look lighter.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>love using this primer for many many reasons.</li>
            <li>I love this product it definitely helps keep your makeup picture perfect all day!</li>
            <li>I love this primer, but mostly to lighten up my foundation.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it wasn&#x27;t something that amazed me,but it&#x27;s an okay primer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Goes on so smoothly and prepares a nice cover for applying their makeup.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a primer make sure to try it.</li>
            <li>Overall, great product!</li>
            <li>SO GLAD</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>makes skin appear smooth!</li>
            <li>My foundation is also lasting all day, love this stuff!!!</li>
            <li>Beautiful primer, really great for photos though I won&#x27;t be using it for everyday, I prefer something a bit lighter for that.</li>
            <li>On first applying it, it felt pretty smooth but nothing to be impressed about, and then I applied my foundation</li>
            <li>On first applying it, it felt pretty smooth but nothing to be impressed about, and then I applied my foundation</li>
            <li>As well as evening my skin tone, it undeniably fills my pores and fine lines (I have too many for a 24 year</li>
            <li>This has more of the consistency of a light creamy lotion.</li>
            <li>I love this primer as it gives me a nice glow and also when you have your picture taken, it really makes your skin look even better than it does.</li>
            <li>and my wife emailed me and told me that she loved it and it was very helpful being that she is a makeup artist</li>
            <li>its okay, does help makeup stay more, not the best primer, and you can end up looking white if too much is applied.</li>
            <li>Also priced the best out of other sites.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!</li>
            <li>I bought this with the hopes of it being a very good product because a few people that I know said its amazing.</li>
            <li>Great foundation for any cream or powder foundation, just make sure it&#x27;s fully dry before you put powder on top or the powder won&#x27;t spread evenly.</li>
            <li>is a really good primer , easy to apply and it makes your makeup look better  and natural.  </li>
            <li>So I personally would not recommend it as a primer but think it works great in a mixture :)</li>
            <li>That being said - I&#x27;m getting married in May and am doing my own makeup.</li>
            <li>: Make sure the primer is completely rubbed in - that offers the best look.</li>
            <li>Goes on just like a moisturizer, feels really light.</li>
            <li>Light and just what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>This product is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Puts on face smooth but after it sets looks cakey</li>
            <li>I really enjoy NYX HD Studio Primer..</li>
            <li>My makeup stays longer and it is light weight...</li>
            <li>I didnt have the need to use primers until now, I am 42 and my skin is everything but smooth.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>:) I also really like how cheap it is!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fairly good priced product that I can see myself buying more of in the future.</li>
            <li>To be fair, I ALWAYS set my make up with the NYX Make Up setting spray, so I&#x27;m sure that has something to do with the lasting power.</li>
            <li>will give you a very matte look!!!</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, feels light, it&#x27;s pleasantly scented and makes me look years younger.</li>
            <li>It works very very well and my makeup stays on longer(all day &amp;night till I wash my face) than it would with any other primer I have used and makes your face look flawless!!</li>
            <li>And on top of it...it smells funny.</li>
            <li>we all love in the higher end malls...</li>
            <li>Excited to use it for nights out and for my rehearsal dinner &amp; wedding.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this on</li>
            <li>I have used several Primers and must say I really love this one the most !</li>
            <li>It goes on super smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>have very oily/problematic skin and this primer helps foundation go on smoothly for a more &amp;#34;perfection&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>My skin is fair (sometimes more medium with tan) and not very oily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going back to the good stuff.</li>
            <li>This primer look chalky by itself but if you put foundation or concealer on top, it stays on and stays matte the whole day.</li>
            <li>I have always loved NYX products, especially their lipstick.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually really impressed with how smooth it left my face, especially without that greasy/oily feeling after letting it set.</li>
            <li>Read my full review here - [...]</li>
            <li>Very dissappointed before even being able to use it.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>I have mild acne scars and there are days that I can get by with just this product.</li>
            <li>My face looks vibrant, healthy, what else can I say...</li>
            <li>I love this product and use it daily :)</li>
            <li>I use less foundation and my face looks great.</li>
            <li>My favorite primer yet,  goes on smooth,  dries quick, allows makeup to last even longer.</li>
            <li>It works very well and goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>So to sum it up, this primer is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>The primers I am used to are more of a clear gel.</li>
            <li>I use this with the nyx hd foundation and my makeup still looked fresh after a 9hour bartending shift.</li>
            <li>It makes me look really white and kind of cakey.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about this primer.</li>
            <li>Keeps makeup fresh all day.</li>
            <li>It goes on kind of white and shows through to your foundation.</li>
            <li>So to sum it up, this primer is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I have found that they do look much more floorless and natural.</li>
            <li>a nice product for low price!!</li>
            <li>Put it on right after cleansing your skin, or over a sunblock.</li>
            <li>It helps to give concealer a staying power that is just right, and somewhat corrects the tone of my skin which I found a beneficial plus.</li>
            <li>I ran out and decided to try something new as I have used many NYX products that worked very well.  </li>
            <li>my review----This primer goes on easy, but has a smooth creamy white tint.</li>
            <li>This makes my foundation last for a whole work shift without touchups, I love it!</li>
            <li>Another great thing is that one drop is enough for my entire face, i rube one drop into my palms and then pass them all over my face.</li>
            <li>In regards to the lightness... as long as I don&#x27;t put WAY too much primer on, once I put my foundation on top, you would never know it&#x27;s so light.</li>
            <li>, if you are looking for a new easy to use primer, that does what it says on the tin, I would certainly recommend this one.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have to apply very lightly because of the white color of the primer.</li>
            <li>add on, I was at a Christmas party and the people I was with had their heaters on very high, so I was sweating, and yet my eye shadow stayed on!</li>
            <li>I found that it works just as well as Mac and for a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>I was able to achieve a color quite similar to my skin tone.</li>
            <li>But on the bright side it left my skin feeling somewhat soft and gentle</li>
            <li>This was the first primer I have ever purchased so I can&#x27;t compare it to any others</li>
            <li>When I first put it on, I looked like a ghost.  </li>
            <li>; look that I would achieve with higher end</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve used something like this</li>
            <li>For anyone who wants their makeup to stay and not smear this is the product!</li>
            <li>this was my first.</li>
            <li>This primer does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
            <li>i love nyx products but this was too white for my skin</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, every review had something really positive to say (give or take a few negatives here and there).</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this stuff, but I just can&#x27;t find it in myself to be a big fan.</li>
            <li>It was just not a good buy but a great price.</li>
            <li>My makeup stays pretty much all day, and you don&#x27;t see any oil for 6+ hours (used to be about 2 hours without the primer).</li>
            <li>It seemed to have helped keep my make up on pretty well and it blended in with my skin tone really well.</li>
            <li>I got this product because I didn&#x27;t want to use up my high end primers for my everyday makeup, it works just as good.</li>
            <li>I did not expect it to be so good and long lasting.</li>
            <li>It goes on white and your skin does look whiter after putting it on but once you cover with foundation it looks fine</li>
            <li>Best primer even better than your typical $100 expensive one.</li>
            <li>NYX high hd studio primer,i buy it for gift to my wife.she like it.you fast shipped, thank you very much.</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t use too much, the white tint blends in fine with my skin tone.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t need to put on as much to get decent coverage of blemishes, and it doesn&#x27;t rub off the first time I use a tissue in the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It smooths on lightly, and has a white tint to it which does a little concealing on its own.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t care to much for this primer, it was too chalky</li>
            <li>but you need to work fast with it and blend it evenly</li>
            <li>and I really couldnt tell that it primed or concealed anything.</li>
            <li>I would much rather spend $30 on makeup forever.</li>
            <li>Having said that, I really dislike the consistency of this product.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t use much of this product.</li>
            <li>This product works really well...</li>
            <li>i choose this rating because the primer doesn&#x27;t really do its job and does not go on evenly.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.</li>
            <li>Haha.</li>
            <li>REALLY LIKE THIS PRIMER ..</li>
            <li>It really puts everything together</li>
            <li>I am medium complexion and this whitens my skin too much before I apply my makeup.</li>
            <li>I really like they way it ends up looking at the end.</li>
            <li>Very soon...</li>
            <li>/&gt;It makes my skin look fresh and feel soft, without feeling and looking oily</li>
            <li>I will say however, that this is providing you don&#x27;t use too much of the primer.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t blend in your skin, which makes it very detectable, it feels like an added layer on your face.</li>
            <li>I received it on time and didn&#x27;t have any kind of trouble with my shopping.</li>
            <li>I am of Mexican and Filipino decent and my skin is tan with warm undertones (gold, peach, yellow).</li>
            <li>Seems to blend in well, better than other primers I have tried, except it doesn&#x27;t feel as silky as others.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t settle in my pores like so many other primers do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AMAZING PRODUCT...</li>
            <li>Just as many others have said it is very white and doesn&#x27;t really pay off in helping the makeup last longer.</li>
            <li>I have found myself a new primer!</li>
            <li>love that it&#x27;s cruelty free, and very affordable compared to the brands I&#x27;d usually go for (Urban Decay, Tarte, Korres)</li>
            <li>I ordered it 2 years ago got its and barely used it because it just didn&#x27;t look right.</li>
            <li>Smells ok, slight and sooth.</li>
            <li>read up on the reviews from various different sites, trying to get an idea on how this product did for most.</li>
            <li>Just recieves my order and when i opened it all the product had leaked into the top cap, therefore causing more then half the bottle to have gone to waste because of it.</li>
            <li>I had read reviews on this before I got it, so I was expecting a little more from this.</li>
            <li>The real wow factor for me was when I applied my foundation and how it gave me that &amp;#34;flawless pore-free&amp;#34</li>
            <li>For the price of this I am able to use it everyday.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue using, because I don&#x27;t want to waste it, but it isn&#x27;t a makeup favorite.</li>
            <li>have only had it a few days, but so far everything is really good.</li>
            <li>I normally use a primer by Mac.  </li>
            <li>It works okay for me because I have pale skin, but don&#x27;t think it will work for darker skin tones.</li>
            <li>I bought this item because usually nyx products are pretty good and reasonably priced however this particular primer was a waste of money.</li>
            <li>Decided to try this primer because I wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li>M gona order new ones.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was very surprised with this primer.</li>
            <li>However, I think you could find other primers that are more trustworthy for the same price.</li>
            <li>I usually do not use foundation</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a light complexioned black women</li>
            <li>It is not smooth or easy to apply foundation over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>THE GOOD NEWS is that I had accidentally gotten a liquid foundation a few shades too dark and decided to mix it with the primer to see if I could salvage it... and it WORKED.</li>
            <li>it is clear all day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth splurging on a more expensive one.</li>
            <li>and I had been use to using clear colored</li>
            <li>it helps the makeup to stay on longer and it give it a smooth look its a good base and smoother</li>
            <li>I wish it was a clear gel.</li>
            <li>Is very caky and white and does not blend well.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need a lot of this, just one big pump to cover your whole face.</li>
            <li>I have several brands of primer but really like this one.</li>
            <li>It actually reminds me of a very runny glue.</li>
            <li>Will stick to using NYX Photo ready primer in the future</li>
            <li>Very greasy and when i rubbed it in it started rubbing up into white chunks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 16 years old</li>
            <li>BUT the reason I gave it 4 stars is if you apply to much it does leave a white tint on your face which will cause your foundation to look lighter.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this does NOT make me break out.</li>
            <li>Very pasty and white, doesn&#x27;t keep make up on, and makes you look paler because it doesn&#x27;t blend into skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a wow product.</li>
            <li>The instructions said not to apply near eye area but I aplly it also on my eyelids, as a shadow primer.</li>
            <li>he said this makes her skin so soft and sets her face up for foundation and concealer nicley.</li>
            <li>One pump of this product should be enough... and all that means is it will last longer and you will get your money&#x27;s worth from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It does fill up my pores and give me a slightly flawless base for my foundation.</li>
            <li>I have used blue and green-tinted foundation primers in the past with good results for my reddish facial tone, and purchased NYX&#x27;s blue Studio Primer as a cheaper alternative to Smashbox.</li>
            <li>so i guess i am naturally tanned but not dark.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint is that it dries very quickly so I  have to work fast.</li>
            <li>When you apply the primer, use a small amount of the primer and you should be fine.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t particularly like the white film it leaves on your face.</li>
            <li>a little goes a long way! :-)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to at least use it up and get my money&#x27;s worth, but I&#x27;m finding it quite hard to want to use, to be honest.</li>
            <li>if you use too much it will be white but you only need one pump and dab it on then rub it in with your fingers.</li>
            <li>It left white patches on my face which were very noticeable.</li>
            <li>I usually get the GloMinerals kind, but figured I&#x27;d try a cheaper brand, but totally not worth it.</li>
            <li>It feels like I&#x27;m applying real paint filler to my face, and makes my face feel very dry.</li>
            <li>would bet this is a better product for quite pale complexioned people, due to the issues I find with streaking.  </li>
            <li>product description should say not primer for anyone.. it should say for people who need blue to counteract their natural skin tone..</li>
            <li>I barely notice a difference with and without it besides the fact that it leaves a noticeable shine.  </li>
            <li>I expected SO much from NYX with this primer, but I was disappointed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I normall wear makeup that I can barely tell is on my face</li>
            <li>The only reason why I did not give it a full on 5 stars is sometimes here where I live in the humidity and heat, it can feel a little greasy, but even that soaks in if you give it a bit of time to dry.</li>
            <li>Definitely will repurchase again in the near future.</li>
            <li>This primer felt a little oily at first but after 15 minutes that went away.</li>
            <li>I first applied it, I was a little nervous because I tend to break out when I apply things with this consistency...</li>
            <li>At first I was a little scared because it had a white tint</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had so many compliments on my complexion, when in reality, my complexion is pretty bad.</li>
            <li>Let it dry completely before applying me up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a moisturizer primer, and you only need to use a little more than a dime sized (a little goes a long way).</li>
            <li>If you use too much your face will reflect any flash used, and you can become a little washed out.</li>
            <li>I want to say its because the change I did from one primer to the other, but I constantly change products to try new ones and when I did this change,..</li>
            <li>I have a tendency to dot dot dot in places on my face and try to blend the whole face at the same time, and I find a tendency to streak a little with this product because it&#x27;s drying before I blend well enough.  </li>

            <li> This primer is amazing!</li>
            <li> It is an okay primer for the price but not the best.</li>
            <li> Great primer and a good price.</li>
            <li> Nix is my favorite make, and I am very happy whit all the my items.  </li>
            <li> I love it keeps my makeup flawless</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to keep using it though because I do have fair skin</li>
            <li> , I loved my makeup on the pictures though, but</li>
            <li> I think its a good buy.</li>
            <li> but over all good product.</li>
            <li> product is a MUST if I have a photoshoot or special event where I want my makeup to stay flawless.</li>
            <li> This product is a MUST if I have a photoshoot or special event where I want my makeup to stay flawless.</li>
            <li> Excellent to balance out between normal/oily areas, I would say this primer is more for combination skin and your NYX Cosmetics High Definition Photogenic Foundation goes on flawlessly after this.</li>
            <li> But after using it more, i think it&#x27;s a great primer.</li>
            <li> I wanted to make sure that I looked great in any photos that were taken.</li>
            <li> This is a good product but nothing spectacular.</li>
            <li> I love mine, and love to use it on others!!</li>
            <li> I love this produc I will def get more!!</li>
            <li> Its MUCH better!</li>
            <li> I love this primer!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> It still leaves my face silky and smooth and my liquid foundation looks great over it.</li>
            <li> Nothing amazing</li>
            <li> but it feels amazing.</li>
            <li> and I tell it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> NYX is an AMAZING brand for the price, and this primer did not disappoint.</li>
            <li> They really did make my skin look flawless.</li>
            <li> and I liked it.</li>
            <li> I personally liked [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> It seemed to kind of wash my face out and it was a bit drying.</li>
            <li> the lip gloss is nice to also the eye shadows</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel nice, makes it look nice too.  </li>
            <li> I have tried this product, i liked it</li>
            <li> This primer has a nice glide on the skin and has no feeling of a mask or clogging your skin.</li>
            <li> Today I was watching videos on how to make your own cream eye shadows and decided to use this primer to mix with my micas.</li>
            <li> And I like NYX products alot they wear really nice...</li>
            <li> All blend nicely.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the makeup department, but this is the best primer I have yet to come across.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best cheaper one I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li> and I was pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li> I have been an avid user of Smashbox&#x27;s primer for years now, and while i still do love everything Smashbox I have to say that this primer worked great for me.  </li>
            <li> I can see a huge difference in the way my skin looks!</li>
            <li> All in all, I love it</li>
            <li> better.</li>
            <li> what so ever, but if your looking for an ok cheap primer to make you look nice for pictures, you have found it.</li>
            <li> those wretched bumps still there, so if you&#x27;re acne free go for it, and if you&#x27;re prone,.. STAY AWAY!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make your skin look smooth as primer should!</li>
            <li> It was an okay product.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite primer</li>
            <li> The vendor was also fantastic and would use again!</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and purchase a better quality primer....</li>
            <li> My face be more illuminate .</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> still not quite sure how that happens.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;d be more noticeable, more often, if you had a darker skin</li>
            <li> once I rubbed it in, and placed my makeup on top....</li>
            <li> /&gt;SO glad I made the purchase.</li>
            <li> BUT I GUESS ITS AN OKAY PRODUCT</li>
            <li> YOU CAN FIND BETTER</li>
            <li> I love NYX make up</li>
            <li> I suggest investing in a better primer.</li>
            <li> The quality of the brand &amp;#34;Make Up Forever&amp;#34; is better than NYX.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t disagree more.</li>
            <li> Hopefully I will find something better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give it some more time and tweek my process</li>
            <li> Love how it feels on my skin, it leaves a soft-fresh feeling.</li>
            <li> , It&#x27;s a most if you are looking for that porcelain face</li>
            <li> , I like the one with ones with silicone in it better</li>
            <li> when I bought this I wasn&#x27;t sure of how to use this</li>
            <li> I kept looking in the mirror to make sure my face didn&#x27;t look lighter.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> love using this primer for many many reasons.</li>
            <li> I love this product it definitely helps keep your makeup picture perfect all day!</li>
            <li> I love this primer, but mostly to lighten up my foundation.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it wasn&#x27;t something that amazed me,but it&#x27;s an okay primer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Goes on so smoothly and prepares a nice cover for applying their makeup.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a primer make sure to try it.</li>
            <li> Overall, great product!</li>
            <li> SO GLAD</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> makes skin appear smooth!</li>
            <li> My foundation is also lasting all day, love this stuff!!!</li>
            <li> Beautiful primer, really great for photos though I won&#x27;t be using it for everyday, I prefer something a bit lighter for that.</li>
            <li> On first applying it, it felt pretty smooth but nothing to be impressed about, and then I applied my foundation</li>
            <li> On first applying it, it felt pretty smooth but nothing to be impressed about, and then I applied my foundation</li>
            <li> As well as evening my skin tone, it undeniably fills my pores and fine lines (I have too many for a 24 year</li>
            <li> This has more of the consistency of a light creamy lotion.</li>
            <li> I love this primer as it gives me a nice glow and also when you have your picture taken, it really makes your skin look even better than it does.</li>
            <li> and my wife emailed me and told me that she loved it and it was very helpful being that she is a makeup artist</li>
            <li> its okay, does help makeup stay more, not the best primer, and you can end up looking white if too much is applied.</li>
            <li> Also priced the best out of other sites.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!</li>
            <li> I bought this with the hopes of it being a very good product because a few people that I know said its amazing.</li>
            <li> Great foundation for any cream or powder foundation, just make sure it&#x27;s fully dry before you put powder on top or the powder won&#x27;t spread evenly.</li>
            <li> is a really good primer , easy to apply and it makes your makeup look better  and natural.  </li>
            <li> So I personally would not recommend it as a primer but think it works great in a mixture :)</li>
            <li> That being said - I&#x27;m getting married in May and am doing my own makeup.</li>
            <li> : Make sure the primer is completely rubbed in - that offers the best look.</li>
            <li> Goes on just like a moisturizer, feels really light.</li>
            <li> Light and just what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> This product is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Puts on face smooth but after it sets looks cakey</li>
            <li> I really enjoy NYX HD Studio Primer..</li>
            <li> My makeup stays longer and it is light weight...</li>
            <li> I didnt have the need to use primers until now, I am 42 and my skin is everything but smooth.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> :) I also really like how cheap it is!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fairly good priced product that I can see myself buying more of in the future.</li>
            <li> To be fair, I ALWAYS set my make up with the NYX Make Up setting spray, so I&#x27;m sure that has something to do with the lasting power.</li>
            <li> will give you a very matte look!!!</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, feels light, it&#x27;s pleasantly scented and makes me look years younger.</li>
            <li> It works very very well and my makeup stays on longer(all day &amp;night till I wash my face) than it would with any other primer I have used and makes your face look flawless!!</li>
            <li> And on top of it...it smells funny.</li>
            <li> we all love in the higher end malls...</li>
            <li> Excited to use it for nights out and for my rehearsal dinner &amp; wedding.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this on</li>
            <li> I have used several Primers and must say I really love this one the most !</li>
            <li> It goes on super smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> have very oily/problematic skin and this primer helps foundation go on smoothly for a more &amp;#34;perfection&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> My skin is fair (sometimes more medium with tan) and not very oily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going back to the good stuff.</li>
            <li> This primer look chalky by itself but if you put foundation or concealer on top, it stays on and stays matte the whole day.</li>
            <li> I have always loved NYX products, especially their lipstick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually really impressed with how smooth it left my face, especially without that greasy/oily feeling after letting it set.</li>
            <li> Read my full review here - [...]</li>
            <li> Very dissappointed before even being able to use it.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> I have mild acne scars and there are days that I can get by with just this product.</li>
            <li> My face looks vibrant, healthy, what else can I say...</li>
            <li> I love this product and use it daily :)</li>
            <li> I use less foundation and my face looks great.</li>
            <li> My favorite primer yet,  goes on smooth,  dries quick, allows makeup to last even longer.</li>
            <li> It works very well and goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> So to sum it up, this primer is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> The primers I am used to are more of a clear gel.</li>
            <li> I use this with the nyx hd foundation and my makeup still looked fresh after a 9hour bartending shift.</li>
            <li> It makes me look really white and kind of cakey.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about this primer.</li>
            <li> Keeps makeup fresh all day.</li>
            <li> It goes on kind of white and shows through to your foundation.</li>
            <li> So to sum it up, this primer is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have found that they do look much more floorless and natural.</li>
            <li> a nice product for low price!!</li>
            <li> Put it on right after cleansing your skin, or over a sunblock.</li>
            <li> It helps to give concealer a staying power that is just right, and somewhat corrects the tone of my skin which I found a beneficial plus.</li>
            <li> I ran out and decided to try something new as I have used many NYX products that worked very well.  </li>
            <li> my review----This primer goes on easy, but has a smooth creamy white tint.</li>
            <li> This makes my foundation last for a whole work shift without touchups, I love it!</li>
            <li> Another great thing is that one drop is enough for my entire face, i rube one drop into my palms and then pass them all over my face.</li>
            <li> In regards to the lightness... as long as I don&#x27;t put WAY too much primer on, once I put my foundation on top, you would never know it&#x27;s so light.</li>
            <li> , if you are looking for a new easy to use primer, that does what it says on the tin, I would certainly recommend this one.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have to apply very lightly because of the white color of the primer.</li>
            <li> add on, I was at a Christmas party and the people I was with had their heaters on very high, so I was sweating, and yet my eye shadow stayed on!</li>
            <li> I found that it works just as well as Mac and for a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> I was able to achieve a color quite similar to my skin tone.</li>
            <li> But on the bright side it left my skin feeling somewhat soft and gentle</li>
            <li> This was the first primer I have ever purchased so I can&#x27;t compare it to any others</li>
            <li> When I first put it on, I looked like a ghost.  </li>
            <li> ; look that I would achieve with higher end</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used something like this</li>
            <li> For anyone who wants their makeup to stay and not smear this is the product!</li>
            <li> this was my first.</li>
            <li> This primer does exactly what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> i love nyx products but this was too white for my skin</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, every review had something really positive to say (give or take a few negatives here and there).</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this stuff, but I just can&#x27;t find it in myself to be a big fan.</li>
            <li> It was just not a good buy but a great price.</li>
            <li> My makeup stays pretty much all day, and you don&#x27;t see any oil for 6+ hours (used to be about 2 hours without the primer).</li>
            <li> It seemed to have helped keep my make up on pretty well and it blended in with my skin tone really well.</li>
            <li> I got this product because I didn&#x27;t want to use up my high end primers for my everyday makeup, it works just as good.</li>
            <li> I did not expect it to be so good and long lasting.</li>
            <li> It goes on white and your skin does look whiter after putting it on but once you cover with foundation it looks fine</li>
            <li> Best primer even better than your typical $100 expensive one.</li>
            <li> NYX high hd studio primer,i buy it for gift to my wife.she like it.you fast shipped, thank you very much.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t use too much, the white tint blends in fine with my skin tone.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t need to put on as much to get decent coverage of blemishes, and it doesn&#x27;t rub off the first time I use a tissue in the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It smooths on lightly, and has a white tint to it which does a little concealing on its own.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care to much for this primer, it was too chalky</li>
            <li> but you need to work fast with it and blend it evenly</li>
            <li> and I really couldnt tell that it primed or concealed anything.</li>
            <li> I would much rather spend $30 on makeup forever.</li>
            <li> Having said that, I really dislike the consistency of this product.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t use much of this product.</li>
            <li> This product works really well...</li>
            <li> i choose this rating because the primer doesn&#x27;t really do its job and does not go on evenly.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.</li>
            <li> Haha.</li>
            <li> REALLY LIKE THIS PRIMER ..</li>
            <li> It really puts everything together</li>
            <li> I am medium complexion and this whitens my skin too much before I apply my makeup.</li>
            <li> I really like they way it ends up looking at the end.</li>
            <li> Very soon...</li>
            <li> /&gt;It makes my skin look fresh and feel soft, without feeling and looking oily</li>
            <li> I will say however, that this is providing you don&#x27;t use too much of the primer.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t blend in your skin, which makes it very detectable, it feels like an added layer on your face.</li>
            <li> I received it on time and didn&#x27;t have any kind of trouble with my shopping.</li>
            <li> I am of Mexican and Filipino decent and my skin is tan with warm undertones (gold, peach, yellow).</li>
            <li> Seems to blend in well, better than other primers I have tried, except it doesn&#x27;t feel as silky as others.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t settle in my pores like so many other primers do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AMAZING PRODUCT...</li>
            <li> Just as many others have said it is very white and doesn&#x27;t really pay off in helping the makeup last longer.</li>
            <li> I have found myself a new primer!</li>
            <li> love that it&#x27;s cruelty free, and very affordable compared to the brands I&#x27;d usually go for (Urban Decay, Tarte, Korres)</li>
            <li> I ordered it 2 years ago got its and barely used it because it just didn&#x27;t look right.</li>
            <li> Smells ok, slight and sooth.</li>
            <li> read up on the reviews from various different sites, trying to get an idea on how this product did for most.</li>
            <li> Just recieves my order and when i opened it all the product had leaked into the top cap, therefore causing more then half the bottle to have gone to waste because of it.</li>
            <li> I had read reviews on this before I got it, so I was expecting a little more from this.</li>
            <li> The real wow factor for me was when I applied my foundation and how it gave me that &amp;#34;flawless pore-free&amp;#34</li>
            <li> For the price of this I am able to use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue using, because I don&#x27;t want to waste it, but it isn&#x27;t a makeup favorite.</li>
            <li> have only had it a few days, but so far everything is really good.</li>
            <li> I normally use a primer by Mac.  </li>
            <li> It works okay for me because I have pale skin, but don&#x27;t think it will work for darker skin tones.</li>
            <li> I bought this item because usually nyx products are pretty good and reasonably priced however this particular primer was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Decided to try this primer because I wanted to try something new.</li>
            <li> M gona order new ones.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was very surprised with this primer.</li>
            <li> However, I think you could find other primers that are more trustworthy for the same price.</li>
            <li> I usually do not use foundation</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a light complexioned black women</li>
            <li> It is not smooth or easy to apply foundation over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> THE GOOD NEWS is that I had accidentally gotten a liquid foundation a few shades too dark and decided to mix it with the primer to see if I could salvage it... and it WORKED.</li>
            <li> it is clear all day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth splurging on a more expensive one.</li>
            <li> and I had been use to using clear colored</li>
            <li> it helps the makeup to stay on longer and it give it a smooth look its a good base and smoother</li>
            <li> I wish it was a clear gel.</li>
            <li> Is very caky and white and does not blend well.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need a lot of this, just one big pump to cover your whole face.</li>
            <li> I have several brands of primer but really like this one.</li>
            <li> It actually reminds me of a very runny glue.</li>
            <li> Will stick to using NYX Photo ready primer in the future</li>
            <li> Very greasy and when i rubbed it in it started rubbing up into white chunks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 16 years old</li>
            <li> BUT the reason I gave it 4 stars is if you apply to much it does leave a white tint on your face which will cause your foundation to look lighter.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this does NOT make me break out.</li>
            <li> Very pasty and white, doesn&#x27;t keep make up on, and makes you look paler because it doesn&#x27;t blend into skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a wow product.</li>
            <li> The instructions said not to apply near eye area but I aplly it also on my eyelids, as a shadow primer.</li>
            <li> he said this makes her skin so soft and sets her face up for foundation and concealer nicley.</li>
            <li> One pump of this product should be enough... and all that means is it will last longer and you will get your money&#x27;s worth from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It does fill up my pores and give me a slightly flawless base for my foundation.</li>
            <li> I have used blue and green-tinted foundation primers in the past with good results for my reddish facial tone, and purchased NYX&#x27;s blue Studio Primer as a cheaper alternative to Smashbox.</li>
            <li> so i guess i am naturally tanned but not dark.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it dries very quickly so I  have to work fast.</li>
            <li> When you apply the primer, use a small amount of the primer and you should be fine.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t particularly like the white film it leaves on your face.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way! :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to at least use it up and get my money&#x27;s worth, but I&#x27;m finding it quite hard to want to use, to be honest.</li>
            <li> if you use too much it will be white but you only need one pump and dab it on then rub it in with your fingers.</li>
            <li> It left white patches on my face which were very noticeable.</li>
            <li> I usually get the GloMinerals kind, but figured I&#x27;d try a cheaper brand, but totally not worth it.</li>
            <li> It feels like I&#x27;m applying real paint filler to my face, and makes my face feel very dry.</li>
            <li> would bet this is a better product for quite pale complexioned people, due to the issues I find with streaking.  </li>
            <li> product description should say not primer for anyone.. it should say for people who need blue to counteract their natural skin tone..</li>
            <li> I barely notice a difference with and without it besides the fact that it leaves a noticeable shine.  </li>
            <li> I expected SO much from NYX with this primer, but I was disappointed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I normall wear makeup that I can barely tell is on my face</li>
            <li> The only reason why I did not give it a full on 5 stars is sometimes here where I live in the humidity and heat, it can feel a little greasy, but even that soaks in if you give it a bit of time to dry.</li>
            <li> Definitely will repurchase again in the near future.</li>
            <li> This primer felt a little oily at first but after 15 minutes that went away.</li>
            <li> I first applied it, I was a little nervous because I tend to break out when I apply things with this consistency...</li>
            <li> At first I was a little scared because it had a white tint</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had so many compliments on my complexion, when in reality, my complexion is pretty bad.</li>
            <li> Let it dry completely before applying me up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a moisturizer primer, and you only need to use a little more than a dime sized (a little goes a long way).</li>
            <li> If you use too much your face will reflect any flash used, and you can become a little washed out.</li>
            <li> I want to say its because the change I did from one primer to the other, but I constantly change products to try new ones and when I did this change,..</li>
            <li> I have a tendency to dot dot dot in places on my face and try to blend the whole face at the same time, and I find a tendency to streak a little with this product because it&#x27;s drying before I blend well enough.  </li>
            <li> I ended up looking pale and hadn&#x27;t even applied that much..</li>
            <li> /&gt;Feedback: I got this primer mainly for it&#x27;s price and a little bit for it&#x27;s reviews...</li>
            <li> my only complaint would be that it makes my face much whiter because of the tint; but it goes under my foundation anyway, so no biggie!</li>
            <li> I knew this primer would be white based and not clear from the reviews but bought it because others wrote that it provides some coverage.</li>
            <li> not I know it&#x27;s kinda cheap, but I mean, you can get something you feel difference for bucks less than this one.</li>
            <li> I had been spending major bucks on a &amp;#34;department store&amp;#34; primer before I found this little gem, but I decided I couldn&#x27;t justify spending so much money on one little</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally give products bad reviews, especially nyx, but I can&#x27;t really find too much to like about this primer.</li>
            <li> This primer makes my make up last twice as long as it would otherwise, as well as minimizes my pores and helps fight shine!</li>
            <li> not I have used other primers and this one left my face pasty white</li>
            <li> /&gt;It can dry a little quick for my tastes, so you need to work in small areas and blend well.  </li>
            <li> I also found it fast drying and hard to move around.</li>
            <li> the cap had a long noticeable scratch.</li>
            <li> , I probably will buy it again, but there are a couple minor downsides.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Upon application it is a bit rough to rub in (I believe i might add a moisturizer next time) and it leaves a bluish ashy tint</li>
            <li> Just be careful, it leaves you looking quite white.</li>
            <li> When I first used this primer, I made note of its color and thinly applied it hoping that my liquid and powder foundation would hide the white pigmentation.</li>
            <li> I am going to be sticking to my less expensive and better consistency products from now on.</li>
            <li> Other reviews true in the fact does leave your face white, couldn&#x27;t use it and too lazy to return, but if you don&#x27;t mind a pale face this is for you!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small, But you use such a little amount that it doesn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
            <li> Unlike other primers I&#x27;ve used, this one is colored white and I compare</li>
            <li> I just went out and bought the expensive primer because, honestly, it is so worth it over this stuff!</li>
            <li> The other thing was the white color.</li>
            <li> I put a little in the palm of my hand &amp; there was a white area left even after it was rubbed in.</li>
            <li> Alittle goes a long waY!</li>
            <li> It also makes my under-eye skin look dry and does not lessen the appearance of wrinkles or pores.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this for people with dry or combination skin since it tends to make oily complexions shiny after an hour or two.</li>
            <li> Leaves a very white pale look on your face even with extensive blending</li>
            <li> I could and should have sent it back but considering the time and effort required, it is not worth returning.  </li>
            <li> when i first used it it came off as a white weird substance</li>
            <li> I now believe I am loyal to this product, as I find it difficult to leave the house without wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wish I paid just a little extra and got a better-quality product.</li>
            <li> It went on a little white.</li>
            <li> but this one was a little different.</li>
            <li> the only complaint she had was that she wishes it came in a bigger size</li>
            <li> I never really used a Primer before I tried this expect maybe once</li>
            <li> I found this primer to not really do much at all.</li>
            <li> This is really not a quality primer.  </li>
            <li> My makeup was actually harder to put on after applying this primer, and it left my face looking really white before makeup, but my makeup was at least two shades darker..</li>
            <li> I barely wear foundation - usually just powder.</li>
            <li> But since I spent the money on it, I wasn&#x27;t gonna throw it away and didn&#x27;t feeling like dealing with the hassle of a return.</li>
            <li> but I did not really see a difference??</li>
            <li> It is stark white.</li>
            <li> Even a tiny bit of primer makes my skin too pale.</li>
            <li> I want to try other primers.</li>
            <li> I usually wear only powder, blush, mascara and lip gloss.</li>
            <li> I would suggest this to other girls!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wish I would have listened to other reviews.</li>
            <li> Other than that I would recommend this product if you haven&#x27;t tried it.</li>
            <li> tried other primer brands</li>
            <li> I just apply it and tap the skin with your finger so the product sinks down in the skin.</li>
            <li> It comes out white and creamy, has a bad smell and does not get absorbed well through the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m normally satisfied by the quality of their products given the price, but this is by far the worst primer I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why, but this primer makes me look so white, and very pale.</li>
            <li> But what sold it for me was that I had spent the rest of the day in 100 degree heat at a BBQ, and even after being in the sun for about 4 hours I checked myself in the mirror expecting to see a mess and to my surprise</li>
            <li> But what sold it for me was that I had spent the rest of the day in 100 degree heat at a BBQ, and even after being in the sun for about 4 hours I checked myself in the mirror expecting to see a mess and to my surprise</li>
            <li> hd primer is the Hard Candy Sheer Envy Primer.</li>
            <li> Basically, I feel that this primer should be used by women with fairer skin tones rather than women with tan to dark skin.</li>
            <li> I gave it an average rate</li>
            <li> Not worth the savings</li>
            <li> There should be a disclaimer on this product for those that are dark skinned that this could give your skin an ashy look.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S JUST NOT WORTH IT.</li>
            <li> Not for dark skin or even semi dark skin ppl.</li>
            <li> I have tried several primers and, honestly, do not see a difference between them.</li>
            <li> and it kinda went down</li>
            <li> I am using less power foundation because this primer grabs the power and holds on.  </li>
            <li> Even if you put makeup over it, the makeup ends up kinda blotchy and odd.  </li>
            <li> Reduces the look of pores, and helps slightly with redness.</li>
            <li> Since money has been tight, I have been looking for an alternative to MAC&#x27;s Prep + Prime for the time being.</li>
            <li> Usually products will have an additional cover underneath the big cover or at least a plastic seal to prevent this</li>
            <li> a little  smashed up and</li>
            <li> This leaves my face chalky no matter how little I use.  </li>
            <li> It helps hide pores if you, like me, tend to be a little greasy in the nose area and have foundations settle into pores.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little upset that I wasted my money on this.</li>
            <li> It was a little heavy feeling on the face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s NOT smooth or silky...</li>
            <li> I use this everyday</li>
            <li> Use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> The box was already opened and sloppily scotch-taped back together.  </li>
            <li> IM PALE</li>
            <li> Even after applying foundation, I looked way too pale and washed out.</li>
            <li> I say don&#x27;t waste your money on this and go for hard candy.</li>
            <li> but I think I still looked whiter than usual.  </li>
            <li> I usually purchase ELF primers.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t actually receive this in my package from Amazon, unfortunately, but I think that was UPS&#x27;s fault.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i usually by mac primea</li>
            <li> Im not really sure how i feel about this product yet.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s $30 also, whereas the hard candy one is $8.</li>
            <li> It is thick like a sunscreen</li>
            <li> ITS KINDA THICK ,</li>
            <li> This stuff is so thick and pasty.</li>
            <li> All of them are too thick for me</li>
            <li> Not a good qulaity</li>
            <li> This is the first time I bought a cosmetic product from Amazon and was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> but I invariably come out looking a little pale and sickly.</li>
            <li> or else it will be very hard to blend in.</li>
            <li> my poor face, I kept using it anyways just because I know in times it takes a while for my face to adapt</li>
            <li> do like the packaging and pump, but hate the actual primer.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t make my foundation stay any longer; it seems to be rubbed-off of my t-zone midday, and in the wrinkly spots (like between my eyes), it seems to make it cake up and look worse.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t too bad, but it did feel a bit heavy.</li>
            <li> I had previously ordered e.l.f.&#x27;s Mineral Infused Primer and was highly disappointed, so I figured I would give this one a shot.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very dry on my skin looks very ugly and chalky looking.</li>
            <li> I was wrong and the color ended up coming through the foundation over a period of time.</li>
            <li> However, I am not impressed with this Primer.</li>
            <li> the expensive primer from that store</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this one didn&#x27;t work out for me; it didn&#x27;t blend well at all, and gave my face a ghostly whitish sheen.</li>
            <li> NYX have proved me wrong.</li>
            <li> Sorry!</li>
            <li> Sadly, I was highly disappointed with this primer.</li>
            <li> Also very weird smell.</li>
            <li> Might be a bad bottle.</li>
            <li> It was horrible and it made my makeup look worse than it would without primer.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the product.  </li>
            <li> always use to believe that primers were useless, greasy horrible products.</li>
            <li> It gives a base for your HD makeup.</li>
            <li> This primer is awful!</li>
            <li> TERRIBLE!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> bought it while i was out at work and my wife emailed me and told me that she loved it and it was very helpful being that she is a makeup artist the only complaint she had was that she wishes it came in a bigger size</li>
            <li> On first applying it, it felt pretty smooth but nothing to be impressed about, and then I applied my foundation and i was very impressed with the results. My skin looked flawless and porless. But what sold it for me was that I had spent the rest of the day in 100 degree heat at a BBQ, and even after being in the sun for about 4 hours I checked myself in the mirror expecting to see a mess and to my surprise my makeup hadn&#x27;t moved a bit!! So to sum it up, this primer is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for make up application. Thank you great price. Would buy again great product again studio primer 1.16 ounce</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care to much for this primer, it was too chalky</li>
            <li> This product is the beginning of your awesome HD make over. It gives a base for your HD makeup. It helps to keep you from sweating your makeup off during those stressful times. It also helps your makeup to go on smother, and stay on. With all three products, primer, makeup, And finishing spray, you will have the most beautiful, flawless completion in the room.! You will be the bell of the ball!! I love mine, and love to use it on others!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like this product.  Color went on White and didn&#x27;t do the job I had hoped for!  Sorry!</li>
            <li> Is very caky and white and does not blend well. Also very weird smell. It is thick like a sunscreen</li>
            <li> My favorite primer yet,  goes on smooth,  dries quick, allows makeup to last even longer.</li>
            <li> I have to apply very lightly because of the white color of the primer.</li>
            <li> Pros: Helps foundation stay for hours and help with an even application&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Primer is white and tints foundation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feedback: I got this primer mainly for it&#x27;s price and a little bit for it&#x27;s reviews... however, it&#x27;s a choice that I regret. I am of Mexican and Filipino decent and my skin is tan with warm undertones (gold, peach, yellow). Unlike other primers I&#x27;ve used, this one is colored white and I compare it&#x27;s smell, consistency and look to sunblock. When I first used this primer, I made note of its color and thinly applied it hoping that my liquid and powder foundation would hide the white pigmentation. I was wrong and the color ended up coming through the foundation over a period of time. THE GOOD NEWS is that I had accidentally gotten a liquid foundation a few shades too dark and decided to mix it with the primer to see if I could salvage it... and it WORKED. I was able to achieve a color quite similar to my skin tone. Basically, I feel that this primer should be used by women with fairer skin tones rather than women with tan to dark skin.</li>
            <li> So i got mine today and it when I opened it it was a box a little  smashed up and the cap had a long noticeable scratch. But on the bright side it left my skin feeling somewhat soft and gentle ☺</li>
            <li> So far so good. The primers I am used to are more of a clear gel. This has more of the consistency of a light creamy lotion. It still leaves my face silky and smooth and my liquid foundation looks great over it. If I don&#x27;t use too much, the white tint blends in fine with my skin tone.</li>
            <li> Best primer I have used to date.  I am using less power foundation because this primer grabs the power and holds on.  My foundation is also lasting all day, love this stuff!!!</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need a lot of this, just one big pump to cover your whole face. Put it on right after cleansing your skin, or over a sunblock. Goes on just like a moisturizer, feels really light. No caking or clogging pores! The tint is slightly blue which helps balance out the yellow in my skin. Great foundation for any cream or powder foundation, just make sure it&#x27;s fully dry before you put powder on top or the powder won&#x27;t spread evenly. My makeup stays pretty much all day, and you don&#x27;t see any oil for 6+ hours (used to be about 2 hours without the primer). All in all, I love it and I&#x27;ll be keeping it in my kit.</li>
            <li> Nothing amazing but it keeps my foundation on all day and works best with the Nyx HD Foundation :) I also really like how cheap it is!</li>
            <li> Best primer even better than your typical $100 expensive one. Also priced the best out of other sites.</li>
            <li> Works well but you need to work fast with it and blend it evenly otherwise it streaks. Let it dry completely before applying me up.</li>
            <li> I have several brands of primer but really like this one. It goes on white and your skin does look whiter after putting it on but once you cover with foundation it looks fine and I do have medium skin. I use this with the nyx hd foundation and my makeup still looked fresh after a 9hour bartending shift. They really did make my skin look flawless.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the product.  It seemed like a used one.  The box was already opened and sloppily scotch-taped back together.  The smears around the nozzle further suggest that it was already used.  I could and should have sent it back but considering the time and effort required, it is not worth returning.  This is the first time I bought a cosmetic product from Amazon and was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This was the first primer I have ever purchased so I can&#x27;t compare it to any others but I did notice a difference between not using a primer and using this product. I was very happy with the results. Definitely will repurchase again in the near future.</li>
            <li> I never really used a Primer before I tried this expect maybe once and I liked it. However, I am not impressed with this Primer. It makes me look really white and kind of cakey. I personally liked [[ASIN:B00480GXTK Prime Time Foundation Primer]] better. I wish I had ordered that one instead.</li>
            <li> Greasy.Not a good qulaity and I really couldnt tell that it primed or concealed anything.It was just not a good buy but a great price.</li>
            <li> I got this product because I didn&#x27;t want to use up my high end primers for my everyday makeup, it works just as good. It&#x27;s a moisturizer primer, and you only need to use a little more than a dime sized (a little goes a long way).</li>
            <li> [...]- my YouTube review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a MUST if I have a photoshoot or special event where I want my makeup to stay flawless. Always works wonders.</li>
            <li> This primer is white.  When I first put it on, I looked like a ghost.  After a couple minutes, it started to fade but after I put my foundation on I still looked white.  But it seemed to blend in with my make-up after a while but I think I still looked whiter than usual.  I&#x27;m going to keep using it though because I do have fair skin and it&#x27;s winter.  But I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d purchase it again and I probably won&#x27;t be using it in the summer.  I would not recommend this for someone with darker skin.</li>
            <li> Seems to blend in well, better than other primers I have tried, except it doesn&#x27;t feel as silky as others.</li>
            <li> I had read reviews on this before I got it, so I was expecting a little more from this. Having tried the Makeup Forever HD primer, and seeing comparisons between the two, I was looking forward to trying this as a cheaper alternative. I found this primer to not really do much at all. It seemed to kind of wash my face out and it was a bit drying. It doesn&#x27;t seem to hold foundation well on my face either. The only way I can use this is if I mix it with another primer. I&#x27;d like to at least use it up and get my money&#x27;s worth, but I&#x27;m finding it quite hard to want to use, to be honest. I don&#x27;t normally give products bad reviews, especially nyx, but I can&#x27;t really find too much to like about this primer. I would much rather spend $30 on makeup forever. The closest thing I&#x27;ve found to makeup forever hd primer is the Hard Candy Sheer Envy Primer. It goes on super smooth and silky. It&#x27;s not quite as moisturizing feeling as makeup forever but it feels amazing. Another one is the Pür corrective primer. It&#x27;s $30 also, whereas the hard candy one is $8. I say don&#x27;t waste your money on this and go for hard candy. It&#x27;s the best cheaper one I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li> Beautiful primer, really great for photos though I won&#x27;t be using it for everyday, I prefer something a bit lighter for that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using primer for 7 years now and decided I would try to save myself $20 or $30 over Smashbox and Napoleon by trying NYX. I&#x27;m normally satisfied by the quality of their products given the price, but this is by far the worst primer I&#x27;ve ever tried. I&#x27;m an olive skinned girl and this white primer made me look like a ghost. I&#x27;ve tried everything to make this work but I invariably come out looking a little pale and sickly. I&#x27;m going back to the good stuff.</li>
            <li> Look, truth is this product isn&#x27;t the best out there what so ever, but if your looking for an ok cheap primer to make you look nice for pictures, you have found it. Beware though, it will make you break out! I want to say its because the change I did from one primer to the other, but I constantly change products to try new ones and when I did this change,.. ughh my poor face, I kept using it anyways just because I know in times it takes a while for my face to adapt and it kinda went down, I loved my makeup on the pictures though, but those wretched bumps still there, so if you&#x27;re acne free go for it, and if you&#x27;re prone,.. STAY AWAY!</li>
            <li> Decided to try this primer because I wanted to try something new. I usually purchase ELF primers. I like their consistency and price. Having said that, I really dislike the consistency of this product. It looks, feels, and smells like a sunscreen. It will leave white streaks on your skin despite the fact that it is a primer and is supposed to create a canvas. I am going to be sticking to my less expensive and better consistency products from now on. I am just not a fan of lotion based primers and prefer a gel like consistency.</li>
            <li> This primer is not primer at all.  It just makes your face look extremely white and pasty and when you apply foundation it just becomes chalky.  It doesn&#x27;t make your skin look smooth as primer should! I just went out and bought the expensive primer because, honestly, it is so worth it over this stuff!</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t use much of this product. I ordered it 2 years ago got its and barely used it because it just didn&#x27;t look right. Since i am african american it leaves a white mask that shows even when you apply foundation.</li>
            <li> product description should say not primer for anyone.. it should say for people who need blue to counteract their natural skin tone.. it is blue. .I gave it away</li>
            <li> This foundation primer works great! It smooths on lightly, and has a white tint to it which does a little concealing on its own. This makes my foundation last for a whole work shift without touchups, I love it!</li>
            <li> It was an okay product. I would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite primer</li>
            <li> This product works really well... my only complaint would be that it makes my face much whiter because of the tint; but it goes under my foundation anyway, so no biggie!</li>
            <li> Light and just what I was looking for.  The vendor was also fantastic and would use again!</li>
            <li> This is really not a quality primer.  I barely notice a difference with and without it besides the fact that it leaves a noticeable shine.  Do yourself a favor and purchase a better quality primer....you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> It works quite well. if you use too much it will be white but you only need one pump and dab it on then rub it in with your fingers. with this product i do not have to continue to go to the bathroom and check my makeup it is clear all day.</li>
            <li> I bought this product just because I saw an review that it makes your skin look matte. I have oily skin; it did not work for me</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic. I can see a huge difference in the way my skin looks! My make up looks great all day.</li>
            <li> The only thing I like about this product is that it keeps your make up on longer but it doesn&#x27;t fill in pores or lines and it leaves a white tint. I want to try other primers. I gave it an average rate</li>
            <li> This product is a MUST if I have a photoshoot or special event where I want my makeup to stay flawless. Always works wonders.</li>
            <li> NYX high hd studio primer,i buy it for gift to my wife.she like it.you fast shipped, thank you very much.</li>
            <li> i choose this rating because the primer doesn&#x27;t really do its job and does not go on evenly. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for anyone.</li>
            <li> This primer is awful! I expected SO much from NYX with this primer, but I was disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The formula is chalky white and streaky when applied. It is not smooth or easy to apply foundation over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the packaging and pump, but hate the actual primer. I do not use this at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try the photo perfecting primer from NYX instead. Its MUCH better!</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading the reviews, hoping it would brighten &amp; lighten my skin.  Um, no.  It&#x27;s like smearing white school glue all over your face.  It&#x27;s NOT smooth or silky...it&#x27;s gooey &amp; sticky.  The white doesn&#x27;t soak in or blend.  Even if you put makeup over it, the makeup ends up kinda blotchy and odd.  And on top of it...it smells funny.</li>
            <li> This product does what it says it will. It softens my face quite a bit, I like the way it feels. Reduces the look of pores, and helps slightly with redness.</li>
            <li> So at the moment I ordered some eye primer, but it hasn&#x27;t come in the mail yet, and I haven&#x27;t been using foundation, so I primed my eyes with this instead, my eyelids tend to get oily through-out the day, but with this my eye shadow stayed on all day, plus my eyelids were not oily.&lt;br /&gt;To add on, I was at a Christmas party and the people I was with had their heaters on very high, so I was sweating, and yet my eye shadow stayed on!</li>
            <li> When applying this product I see a difference. It helps to give concealer a staying power that is just right, and somewhat corrects the tone of my skin which I found a beneficial plus. The only reason why I did not give it a full on 5 stars is sometimes here where I live in the humidity and heat, it can feel a little greasy, but even that soaks in if you give it a bit of time to dry.</li>
            <li> Garbage just like their foundation. It is tacky and it flakes off your skin. It actually reminds me of a very runny glue.</li>
            <li> This leaves my face chalky no matter how little I use.  Will stick to using NYX Photo ready primer in the future</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about this primer. It doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything. it doesn&#x27;t make my foundation stay any longer; it seems to be rubbed-off of my t-zone midday, and in the wrinkly spots (like between my eyes), it seems to make it cake up and look worse. It also makes my under-eye skin look dry and does not lessen the appearance of wrinkles or pores. Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> My face be more illuminate . I received it on time and didn&#x27;t have any kind of trouble with my shopping.</li>
            <li> This primer look chalky by itself but if you put foundation or concealer on top, it stays on and stays matte the whole day.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday and I love it. For the price of this I am able to use it everyday. Its really a great value.</li>
            <li> Other reviews true in the fact does leave your face white, couldn&#x27;t use it and too lazy to return, but if you don&#x27;t mind a pale face this is for you!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this stuff, but I just can&#x27;t find it in myself to be a big fan. My makeup was actually harder to put on after applying this primer, and it left my face looking really white before makeup, but my makeup was at least two shades darker..still not quite sure how that happens. I&#x27;ll continue using, because I don&#x27;t want to waste it, but it isn&#x27;t a makeup favorite.</li>
            <li> Did not blend into the skin properly. Looked and felt chalky.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works. Keeps makeup fresh all day.</li>
            <li> This product leaves a translucent film on your skin.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay. It goes on kind of white and shows through to your foundation. It&#x27;s worth splurging on a more expensive one.</li>
            <li> I have always loved NYX products, especially their lipstick. I had never tried their primers or foundations, though. Since money has been tight, I have been looking for an alternative to MAC&#x27;s Prep + Prime for the time being. I had previously ordered e.l.f.&#x27;s Mineral Infused Primer and was highly disappointed, so I figured I would give this one a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read up on the reviews from various different sites, trying to get an idea on how this product did for most. Surprisingly, every review had something really positive to say (give or take a few negatives here and there). I went ahead and ordered it, couldn&#x27;t do any harm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only had it a few days, but so far everything is really good. I&#x27;m actually really impressed with how smooth it left my face, especially without that greasy/oily feeling after letting it set. The real wow factor for me was when I applied my foundation and how it gave me that &amp;#34;flawless pore-free&amp;#34; look that I would achieve with higher end products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would make a great addition to my make-up collection. It&#x27;s a fairly good priced product that I can see myself buying more of in the future.</li>
            <li> I have found myself a new primer! This stuff is great! Well be my only primer from now on!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t actually receive this in my package from Amazon, unfortunately, but I think that was UPS&#x27;s fault.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I always buy/use this primer and it is the best (in my opinion). I pair it with Maybelline baby skin pore eraser, Forever HD foundation, and Revlon Photo-Ready powder. It works very well and goes on smooth. It also doesn&#x27;t cause my face to breakout which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very oily/problematic skin and this primer helps foundation go on smoothly for a more &amp;#34;perfection&amp;#34; finish.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had so many compliments on my complexion, when in reality, my complexion is pretty bad. Haha.</li>
            <li> Great for the price, works great almost as well as the expensive primer from that store we all love in the higher end malls...great buy!</li>
            <li> I like this, I probably will buy it again, but there are a couple minor downsides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can dry a little quick for my tastes, so you need to work in small areas and blend well.  I have a tendency to dot dot dot in places on my face and try to blend the whole face at the same time, and I find a tendency to streak a little with this product because it&#x27;s drying before I blend well enough.  It&#x27;s a habit that just doesn&#x27;t work with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, when it&#x27;s all on and well blended, it works well.  It helps hide pores if you, like me, tend to be a little greasy in the nose area and have foundations settle into pores.  It seems to make the foundation go further too, I don&#x27;t need to put on as much to get decent coverage of blemishes, and it doesn&#x27;t rub off the first time I use a tissue in the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would bet this is a better product for quite pale complexioned people, due to the issues I find with streaking.  I think it&#x27;d be more noticeable, more often, if you had a darker skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that it&#x27;s cruelty free, and very affordable compared to the brands I&#x27;d usually go for (Urban Decay, Tarte, Korres)</li>
            <li> This primer is great. It&#x27;s small, But you use such a little amount that it doesn&#x27;t really matter. One squirt (Dimesized) covers my entire face.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. I have mild acne scars and there are days that I can get by with just this product. I use less foundation and my face looks great.</li>
            <li> At first I was a little scared because it had a white tint and I had been use to using clear colored primer.&lt;br /&gt;And I was using MAC liquid foundation and was unsure if it would work well with it.&lt;br /&gt;But once I rubbed it in, and placed my makeup on top....IT LOOKED AMAZING.&lt;br /&gt;SO glad I made the purchase.</li>
            <li> very good product...it gave my face a totally flawless,natural finish...i would be continuing to use this product from now on.</li>
            <li> Has grayish tint makes my face too white</li>
            <li> JUST LIKE THE FOUNDATION I DONT REALLY LIKE THIS PRIMER .. IM PALE AND IT LEAVES MY FACE EVEN WHITER .. ITS KINDA THICK , BUT I GUESS ITS AN OKAY PRODUCT.. YOU CAN FIND BETTER</li>
            <li> I bought this on the 25th of February and I received the item Saturday March 1st. I tried the primer today Sunday March 2nd. My foundation looks flawless. I haven&#x27;t had to blot my t-zone. ( oily skin) I recommend this product</li>
            <li> I was very surprised with this primer. I did not expect it to be so good and long lasting. However, I think you could find other primers that are more trustworthy for the same price.</li>
            <li> is a really good primer , easy to apply and it makes your makeup look better  and natural.  It really puts everything together</li>
            <li> I love this primer as it gives me a nice glow and also when you have your picture taken, it really makes your skin look even better than it does.</li>
            <li> Very dry on my skin looks very ugly and chalky looking. Puts on face smooth but after it sets looks cakey I didnt know primers would do that?</li>
            <li> could be thinner, I mix mine with a moisterizer.</li>
            <li> i usually by mac primea but I didnt like mac prima so I decided to try nyx prima it works great my make up last all day I love NYX make up I buy  it all the time and the prices are great the lip gloss is nice to also the eye shadows</li>
            <li> I have used blue and green-tinted foundation primers in the past with good results for my reddish facial tone, and purchased NYX&#x27;s blue Studio Primer as a cheaper alternative to Smashbox. Unfortunately, this one didn&#x27;t work out for me; it didn&#x27;t blend well at all, and gave my face a ghostly whitish sheen. Even after applying foundation, I looked way too pale and washed out. Not worth the savings; I&#x27;ll spend the extra money and spring for Smashbox.</li>
            <li> This made me breakout.  Very greasy and when i rubbed it in it started rubbing up into white chunks. Might be a bad bottle. I tried it twice then put it in my &amp;#34;big mistake makeup bag&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This will make your makeup last longer but it goes on too white. I am medium complexion and this whitens my skin too much before I apply my makeup.</li>
            <li> This primer does not blend into your skin. Instead it sits on and it makes your skin look really white. I suggest investing in a better primer.</li>
            <li> The quality of the brand &amp;#34;Make Up Forever&amp;#34; is better than NYX.</li>
            <li> I used it once and it worked, but I haven&#x27;t had the need to use it since then</li>
            <li> This primer is amazing! It goes on smoothly, feels light, it&#x27;s pleasantly scented and makes me look years younger.</li>
            <li> I bought this item because usually nyx products are pretty good and reasonably priced however this particular primer was a waste of money. Just as many others have said it is very white and doesn&#x27;t really pay off in helping the makeup last longer. I also found it fast drying and hard to move around. It left white patches on my face which were very noticeable. There should be a disclaimer on this product for those that are dark skinned that this could give your skin an ashy look.</li>
            <li> I feel like there is no coverage. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend to friends. But this is just my opinion, you might feel differs about it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t particularly like the white film it leaves on your face. It works okay for me because I have pale skin, but don&#x27;t think it will work for darker skin tones. It is an okay primer for the price but not the best.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel nice, makes it look nice too.  I really like they way it ends up looking at the end.</li>
            <li> I did not like this product at all. I usually get the GloMinerals kind, but figured I&#x27;d try a cheaper brand, but totally not worth it. I returned it immediately. It comes out white and creamy, has a bad smell and does not get absorbed well through the skin.</li>
            <li> I have never worn primer before. I barely wear foundation - usually just powder. That being said - I&#x27;m getting married in May and am doing my own makeup. I read that primer is key for your wedding since you will have an extended time of pictures and your make-up needs to stay put. I usually wear only powder, blush, mascara and lip gloss. Sometimes the occassional eyeshadow and liner. My skin is fair (sometimes more medium with tan) and not very oily. So I bought this primer after the reviews and tested it out on my birthday when I went all night with friends (5 hours). The primer was AWESOME and all my makeup stayed in place. I felt wonderful in it and was impressed with the uphold. Excited to use it for nights out and for my rehearsal dinner &amp; wedding. I would suggest this to other girls!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Make sure the primer is completely rubbed in - that offers the best look. Then add foundation and powder. I usually do not use foundation but I did in needed spots when using the primer.</li>
            <li> I bought this with the hopes of it being a very good product because a few people that I know said its amazing. I couldn&#x27;t disagree more. This made my face break out and it looked like I had sunburn all over my face. It was horrible and it made my makeup look worse than it would without primer. I&#x27;m 16 years old and I don&#x27;t have a lot of money. I&#x27;m a little upset that I wasted my money on this. Hopefully I will find something better. SAVE YOUR MONEY IT&#x27;S JUST NOT WORTH IT.</li>
            <li> Im not really sure how i feel about this product yet.  Upon application it is a bit rough to rub in (I believe i might add a moisturizer next time) and it leaves a bluish ashy tint, I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s to neutralize the skin of redness.  I&#x27;m a light complexioned black women so i guess i am naturally tanned but not dark.  I like teh primer, it helped my foundation spread easier also.  I&#x27;ll give it some more time and tweek my process (until then it gets a three).</li>
            <li> I recently bought this primer and I tell it&#x27;s amazing. Love how it feels on my skin, it leaves a soft-fresh feeling. Doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy texture and even smells nice!&lt;br /&gt;Love the product!, It&#x27;s a most if you are looking for that porcelain face look</li>
            <li> I have tried this product, i liked it and i recommend it. M gona order new ones.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent glow effect, very good price.</li>
            <li> Nyx Products are awesome. This primer has a nice glide on the skin and has no feeling of a mask or clogging your skin. Excellent to balance out between normal/oily areas, I would say this primer is more for combination skin and your NYX Cosmetics High Definition Photogenic Foundation goes on flawlessly after this.</li>
            <li> Not for dark skin or even semi dark skin ppl. Only makes my face look white not to mention it does nothing. I say leave it alone ppl</li>
            <li> This stuff is so thick and pasty. This definitely is not for women of color. I wish I would have listened to other reviews.</li>
            <li> I love this primer! For the price you cannot beat it! Makes my skin look flawless. I will definitely get this again!</li>
            <li> I order this thinking it would do all it says and it oes not I have used other primers and this one left my face pasty white I m a woman of color but this has no place on the face of any tan woman</li>
            <li> it helps the makeup to stay on longer and it give it a smooth look its a good base and smoother</li>
            <li> Did not like this primer, I like the one with ones with silicone in it better</li>
            <li> I am all about priming. Sadly, I was highly disappointed with this primer. I ended up looking pale and hadn&#x27;t even applied that much.. But since I spent the money on it, I wasn&#x27;t gonna throw it away and didn&#x27;t feeling like dealing with the hassle of a return. Today I was watching videos on how to make your own cream eye shadows and decided to use this primer to mix with my micas. LOVED the results!!! So I personally would not recommend it as a primer but think it works great in a mixture :)</li>
            <li> when I bought this I wasn&#x27;t sure of how to use this and then I learned what it was for. Now I use it every time I wear makeup it is fab.</li>
            <li> i was expecting it hold also my even my eyeliner but didnt coz i have an oily to combi skin</li>
            <li> I really enjoy NYX HD Studio Primer..it lasts all day and into the night. I use mineral make up and have been searching for a primer that both stands up to the work day &amp; doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin....this product solved both problems. My only complaint is that it dries very quickly so I  have to work fast. I would buy this primer again.</li>
            <li> I tried this product and I don&#x27;t know if it was me but I did not really see a difference?? I heard alot about it but I guess this is not for me...And I like NYX products alot they wear really nice...</li>
            <li> i bought this primer for its pore claim. when i first used it it came off as a white weird substance and i didn&#x27;t like it. But after using it more, i think it&#x27;s a great primer. It does fill up my pores and give me a slightly flawless base for my foundation. I just apply it and tap the skin with your finger so the product sinks down in the skin.</li>
            <li> I have been an avid user of Smashbox&#x27;s primer for years now, and while i still do love everything Smashbox I have to say that this primer worked great for me.  On first applying it, it felt pretty smooth but nothing to be impressed about, and then I applied my foundation and i was very impressed with the results. My skin looked flawless and porless. But what sold it for me was that I had spent the rest of the day in 100 degree heat at a BBQ, and even after being in the sun for about 4 hours I checked myself in the mirror expecting to see a mess and to my surprise my makeup hadn&#x27;t moved a bit!! So to sum it up, this primer is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I knew this primer would be white based and not clear from the reviews but bought it because others wrote that it provides some coverage. Even a tiny bit of primer makes my skin too pale. I wish I paid just a little extra and got a better-quality product.</li>
            <li> This is a good product but nothing spectacular. I have tried several primers and, honestly, do not see a difference between them. All of them are too thick for me and I mix with my facial lotion.</li>
            <li> Great primer and a good price. Bought this for my daughter.  She says it does help to make her makeup last longer.</li>
            <li> I love this produc I will def get more!! Very soon... It makes my make up look great n feel great</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this on but that changed when I put it on. I used Laura Mercier primer before &amp; it was lighter &amp; smoother when applied. This primer felt a little oily at first but after 15 minutes that went away. The other thing was the white color. It went on a little white. I kept looking in the mirror to make sure my face didn&#x27;t look lighter. I put a little in the palm of my hand &amp; there was a white area left even after it was rubbed in.</li>
            <li> I have used several Primers and must say I really love this one the most ! BUT the reason I gave it 4 stars is if you apply to much it does leave a white tint on your face which will cause your foundation to look lighter. Other than that I would recommend this product if you haven&#x27;t tried it. It works very very well and my makeup stays on longer(all day &amp;night till I wash my face) than it would with any other primer I have used and makes your face look flawless!! Try it try it for the price alone !</li>
            <li> I looked like a porcelain doll after applying the rest of my makeup.  It&#x27;s so not my style...do not like it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so so. I didn&#x27;t feel difference between use it and not I know it&#x27;s kinda cheap, but I mean, you can get something you feel difference for bucks less than this one. Smells ok, slight and sooth. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used something like this and I was pretty happy with it. It seemed to have helped keep my make up on pretty well and it blended in with my skin tone really well. It was a little heavy feeling on the face. I normall wear makeup that I can barely tell is on my face but this one was a little different. It wasn&#x27;t too bad, but it did feel a bit heavy. I think its a good buy. I haven&#x27;t used it a lot yet so I can&#x27;t say if I would recommend it. But it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> Nix is my favorite make, and I am very happy whit all the my items.  Tks for all!  I love it</li>
            <li> Read my full review here - [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love using this primer for many many reasons. As well as evening my skin tone, it undeniably fills my pores and fine lines (I have too many for a 24 year old.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes my skin look fresh and feel soft, without feeling and looking oily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It DOES make my make up last all day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I feel it helps the overall quality of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it is a &#x60;Photogenic&#x27; product, I am always taking an extra close look at pictures of myself. I have found that they do look much more floorless and natural. I will say however, that this is providing you don&#x27;t use too much of the primer. If you use too much your face will reflect any flash used, and you can become a little washed out. One pump of this product should be enough... and all that means is it will last longer and you will get your money&#x27;s worth from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always use to believe that primers were useless, greasy horrible products. NYX have proved me wrong. I now believe I am loyal to this product, as I find it difficult to leave the house without wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is simple to apply. I just use my finger over my T-Zone and the buff it in using a kabuki brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you are looking for a new easy to use primer, that does what it says on the tin, I would certainly recommend this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helped.</li>
            <li> will give you a very matte look!!! holds make up very beautiful.. the only thing is thjat u must work with it fast!!!!!! or else it will be very hard to blend in. but over all good product.</li>
            <li> Great product! I normally use a primer by Mac.  I ran out and decided to try something new as I have used many NYX products that worked very well.  I found that it works just as well as Mac and for a very reasonable price.  I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This primer makes my make up last twice as long as it would otherwise, as well as minimizes my pores and helps fight shine! I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! thank you</li>
            <li> It´s a nice product for low price!!</li>
            <li> I love this product it definitely helps keep your makeup picture perfect all day!</li>
            <li> I am an African American Womam--Here&#x27;s my review----This primer goes on easy, but has a smooth creamy white tint. I wish it was a clear gel. When you apply the primer, use a small amount of the primer and you should be fine.  I apply the primer, next my concealer then my liquid foundation and lastly my face powder--All blend nicely.  Try it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the makeup department, but this is the best primer I have yet to come across. I would definitely get this again! I have sensitive skin and this does NOT make me break out.</li>
            <li> I love it keeps my makeup flawless</li>
            <li> TERRIBLE! Very pasty and white, doesn&#x27;t keep make up on, and makes you look paler because it doesn&#x27;t blend into skin</li>
            <li> For anyone who wants their makeup to stay and not smear this is the product! Just one pump, and put on like lotion on face then put make up on.  My face looks vibrant, healthy, what else can I say...It&#x27;s a wow product.</li>
            <li> Like this product. My makeup stays longer and it is light weight... a little goes a long way! :-)</li>
            <li> its okay, does help makeup stay more, not the best primer, and you can end up looking white if too much is applied.</li>
            <li> Just recieves my order and when i opened it all the product had leaked into the top cap, therefore causing more then half the bottle to have gone to waste because of it. Usually products will have an additional cover underneath the big cover or at least a plastic seal to prevent this but this product did not. Very dissappointed before even being able to use it.</li>
            <li> I didnt have the need to use primers until now, I am 42 and my skin is everything but smooth. When I applied foundation to even my skin tone it would leave a mask type finish because it would never look even. This primer is fabulous,even if you are not going to apply foundation. Once or twice a week I only apply powder, and it stays on longer over the primer. The instructions said not to apply near eye area but I aplly it also on my eyelids, as a shadow primer. Another great thing is that one drop is enough for my entire face, i rube one drop into my palms and then pass them all over my face. I will rebuy as soon as I run out of it.</li>
            <li> I love this primer, but mostly to lighten up my foundation. I don&#x27;t necessarily think that it works amazingly as an actual primer. I prefer Philosophy The Preset. I don&#x27;t see how this primer would work on anyone that had any color to their skin. It is stark white.</li>
            <li> I love this product and use it daily :) It arrived on time and in great condition. I will definitely order it again when I run out.</li>
            <li> not good,not bad.&lt;br /&gt;shipping was ok.&lt;br /&gt;price is okay.&lt;br /&gt;it wasn&#x27;t something that amazed me,but it&#x27;s an okay primer.&lt;br /&gt;haven&#x27;t tried other primer brands this was my first.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was looking into HD make up to wear to an upcoming wedding. I wanted to make sure that I looked great in any photos that were taken. I&#x27;ve been using this with a NYX foundation and it helps lighten the shade but that&#x27;s all I see. I don&#x27;t have any lines to soften so I might only use this in winter when my skin lightens up.</li>
            <li> It feels like I&#x27;m applying real paint filler to my face, and makes my face feel very dry.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel greasy</li>
            <li> Use it everyday.  Goes on so smoothly and prepares a nice cover for applying their makeup.  NYX is the greatest!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a primer make sure to try it. Just be careful, it leaves you looking quite white.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why, but this primer makes me look so white, and very pale. it doesn&#x27;t blend in your skin, which makes it very detectable, it feels like an added layer on your face.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my sister. Recieved in a timley manner. he said this makes her skin so soft and sets her face up for foundation and concealer nicley.</li>
            <li> Leaves a very white pale look on your face even with extensive blending</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s white and I don&#x27;t think it minimized my pores</li>
            <li> This primer does exactly what it says it will do. Evens tone, creates a brightening effect, and makes make up look flawless on the camera. I would recommend this for people with dry or combination skin since it tends to make oily complexions shiny after an hour or two. Overall, great product!</li>
            <li> Really great product! Makes my makeup stay way longer! Just use tiny pumps, you dont need a lot. Alittle goes a long waY!</li>
            <li> I have been using this primer for several years now. NYX is an AMAZING brand for the price, and this primer did not disappoint. I had been spending major bucks on a &amp;#34;department store&amp;#34; primer before I found this little gem, but I decided I couldn&#x27;t justify spending so much money on one little cosmetic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first applied it, I was a little nervous because I tend to break out when I apply things with this consistency... it&#x27;s almost feels like you&#x27;re applying a sunscreen. It was also a lot lighter than I was expecting. I AM SO GLAD I GAVE IT A CHANCE!! I have never had a problem with this making my skin break out. In regards to the lightness... as long as I don&#x27;t put WAY too much primer on, once I put my foundation on top, you would never know it&#x27;s so light. It smooths on beautifully and lasts all day. To be fair, I ALWAYS set my make up with the NYX Make Up setting spray, so I&#x27;m sure that has something to do with the lasting power. It also doesn&#x27;t settle in my pores like so many other primers do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AMAZING PRODUCT... I would (and do!!) recommend this to my friends.  :)</li>
            <li> best primer ive tried yet. makes makeup stay on all day, great oil control. makes skin appear smooth!</li>
            <li> i love nyx products but this was too white for my skin im african american i will never by this primer from them everything else will work</li>
