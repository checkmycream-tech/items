            <li> no black skulls, or black bows.</li>
            <li> My only issue was that they are a little larger</li>
            <li> but I only got one pink bow and one pink skull.</li>
            <li> and I only got 1 black one.</li>
            <li> If I had any idea that everything would be pink, I would not have ordered these at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> then I expected but</li>
            <li> Based on the pictures, I expected a mix of colors, but with the exception of 5 black skulls (all with pink bows) everything I received is pink!  </li>
            <li> I received the order 3 days later, so it wasn&#x27;t lost just late.</li>
            <li> Not very satisfied but not worth returning and waiting another 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Only problem was that 4 of the pieces were broken.</li>
            <li> Putting a skull and a bow on one finger looks ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t always wear fake nails</li>
            <li> /&gt;Super disappointed.</li>

            <li> These are ok. I have yet to use them. They look more cartoonish than I thought and I only got 1 black one. I don&#x27;t regret it but I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> My only issue was that they are a little larger then I thought they would be. I don&#x27;t always wear fake nails and I like to have cute nails all the time. The skulls are just a tad too big for my regular nails but I still really like the product.</li>
            <li> little bigger than expected but love it</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t got wear them yet but love them . They are just as the picture shows then to be .</li>
            <li> Based on the pictures, I expected a mix of colors, but with the exception of 5 black skulls (all with pink bows) everything I received is pink!  The skulls are pink, the bows are light pink and hot pink.  If I had any idea that everything would be pink, I would not have ordered these at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Super disappointed.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re all really cute but I only got one pink bow and one pink skull. Everything else was white and yellow. Not very satisfied but not worth returning and waiting another 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> These rhinestones are so freaking cute, my daughter and I are going to use them for scrap booking. We have some paper and stickers they would go great with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could give this seller 20 stars, because they deserve it. It was over a month before I received them, but in no way was it there fault. It was estimated to arrive April 25, but it didn&#x27;t. I contact the seller and they went over and beyond to correct the issue. I received the order 3 days later, so it wasn&#x27;t lost just late. I would recommend this seller to everyone. I would totally purchase more from them anytime!</li>
            <li> I was super happy when I got these.</li>
            <li> Having fun with these on my nails and cell phone cases!&lt;br /&gt;Came on time, and was just as described.&lt;br /&gt;Happy with my purchase!&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>

            <li> These are cute but not practical. Putting a skull and a bow on one finger looks ridiculous. I bought these months ago. I have paying customers and I&#x27;ve never used them! Kind of a bummer. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
