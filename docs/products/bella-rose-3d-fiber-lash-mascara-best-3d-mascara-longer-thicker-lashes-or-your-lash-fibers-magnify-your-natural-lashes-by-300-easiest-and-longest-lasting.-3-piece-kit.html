            <li>the bottom picture is the Bella Rose 3D Fiber Lash</li>
            <li>mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li>All opinions stated are that of my own and have in no way been swayed.</li>
            <li>The Bella Rose 3D Fiber Lash Extension Mascara comes in a nice case and comes with the mascara, Gel, and the instructions on how to use it.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re my own lashes wink&amp;#34</li>
            <li>It works really nicely.</li>
            <li>My husband came home and even noticed a difference and said he really liked my eyes.</li>
            <li>Made your lashes longer and it&#x27;s finish up your makeup nicely.</li>
            <li>opinions expressed in the review are 100% my own.</li>
            <li>I will say this product is really nice</li>
            <li>Bella Rose:</li>
            <li>but I prefer Bella Rose.</li>
            <li>then I recommend you try Bella Rose.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product during a promotion and the views I have expressed are my own.</li>
            <li>I also loved the package nice case and arrived very quick.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to apply, it&#x27;s lightweight on your eyes</li>
            <li>Very easy to do</li>
            <li>It is great, it takes some practice to get it right but works amazingly.</li>
            <li>The result was far from impressive.</li>
            <li>:) Very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s better than that?</li>
            <li>Love, love this product</li>
            <li>Love this mascara.</li>
            <li>There are better instructions of application on their website than what came in the box.</li>
            <li>Overall very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I ordered this products.</li>
            <li>, the top picture is no mascara and</li>
            <li>The length it gives my lashes is fabulous!</li>
            <li>Then again I applied to gel and then repeated these steps one more time.</li>
            <li>I have tried that one and was ok with it.</li>
            <li>She love it.</li>
            <li>I think this one gives a more thick/clumpy result..</li>
            <li>I have tried several of the fiber mascaras and this one is the best!</li>
            <li>What a gret product,  Love the packaging to keep it in also.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this 3D Fiber Lash mascara, after I figured out how to use it.</li>
            <li>Make sure you have an eyelash comb.</li>
            <li>I need to practice more.</li>
            <li>and you can add more layers if you want so</li>
            <li>This did make my lashes more noticeable</li>
            <li>The 3d lashes falls out and it goes to the eye, it may irritate your eye most of the time, skip it.</li>
            <li>and this product looks much BETTER then when I had extensions.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.</li>
            <li>I use two coats on my top lashes and one coat on the bottom.</li>
            <li>In love with this mascara...</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s basically putting lint on top of sticky mascara....</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>I wanted to see what all the fuss was about, but didn&#x27;t want to spend $40 or more for something I wasn&#x27;t sure</li>
            <li>I love the size of my lashes they look thicker and fuller</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this fiber mascara.</li>
            <li>then I put more gel on.</li>
            <li>and this brand worked so much better than I thought it could do.</li>
            <li>and she is in love.</li>
            <li>Love the product, it is easy to use and lasted all day :)</li>
            <li>If I was to buy these for a gift, they aren&#x27;t very eye catching or &amp;#34;pretty&amp;#34; Otherwise, I will continue to use this product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase, 100% worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy love</li>
            <li>I also love that it stays on ALL day yet comes off easily with soap and water.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Bella Rose 3D Eyelash Extension Mascara for any gal who is eyelash impaired!</li>
            <li>Was looking at getting these through direct sales when I got a great deal here.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes looked great, and felt natural.  </li>
            <li>After reading the handy guide that came with the 3D lashes, I used the gel and fiber lashes right away.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and stays on until you wash it off.</li>
            <li>And, as the instructions state, it was easy to remove.  </li>
            <li>Easy to,apply and not clumpy.</li>
            <li>It was really easy to apply to my lashes.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m back to Bella Rose for good.</li>
            <li>Overall I am very impressed with this and did not expect to have such good results.</li>
            <li>I could tell a huge difference in my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>When I saw that this one was available, I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it.</li>
            <li>This was a great purchase for any female!  </li>
            <li>made it sound.</li>
            <li>(I forgot I had it on sometimes) and you get beautiful, long eyelashes.</li>
            <li>She said she loved how the bristles were so soft and how it made her lashes thicker and darker.</li>
            <li>I now have the long, beautiful eyelashes that I have always wanted.</li>
            <li>My lashes still look good far into the evening.</li>
            <li>She sent me a picture and her eyelashes look long, thicker, and beautiful.</li>
            <li>Its not like the original product.</li>
            <li>I significant difference.</li>
            <li>and I only seem to successfully get fibers in my eyes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure this mascara is the type that if you have to shed a tear it won&#x27;t ruin your makeup.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price!</li>
            <li>but once it&#x27;s dry, I&#x27;ve experienced no flaking at all.</li>
            <li>Great product and does not irritate my dry eyes or my contact lenses.</li>
            <li>Special Occasion Flare&lt;br /&gt;Rich</li>
            <li>It was not as great as expected</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not in love with the mascara tube formula because it doesn&#x27;t do much for volume</li>
            <li>Next time, I&#x27;ll wait a good minute before reapplying the gel.</li>
            <li>Would rarely splurge on myself, but this lash system is well worth it!</li>
            <li>Super product</li>
            <li>They were big and light! :-)</li>
            <li>I tend to only use this on my top lashes because the bottom are ok.</li>
            <li>You have to be quick</li>
            <li>I really love it and highly recommend it</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I reviewed the directions and first lightly applied the gel on one eye, then the fiber wand, and repeated.  </li>
            <li>but it actually worked pretty good.</li>
            <li>and it was so easy and fast.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not even funny!</li>
            <li>With Bella Rose my lashes look much longer, fuller, the fibers stay on pretty much all day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was a little hesitant looking at the two tubes (though the case is extremely attractive)</li>
            <li>I would recommend using a light hand when applying.&lt;br /&gt;Great results and a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I Received my Bella Rose 3D Fiber Lash Mascara today and before I could open the box my daughter took it and used it.</li>
            <li>If you are doubting whether or not it&#x27;s worth it, don&#x27;t doubt.</li>
            <li>When I received instructions from the seller via email in a PDF format, it was so much more clear.</li>
            <li>so I used a couple coats of my favorite mascara first, then the transplanting gel, which is pretty much just like mascara but thicker, then the fiber brush.</li>
            <li>I actually used my own mascara brush to do this and it separated them just as well.</li>
            <li>The product arrived in a nice storage box similar to an eyeglass case.</li>
            <li>It is amazing how long your lashes get!</li>
            <li>So easy to use and looks natural.</li>
            <li>My new mascara!!!</li>
            <li>My lashes are super long and I have gotten so many compliments on them, even people asking if i have gotteb eyelash extensions.</li>
            <li>Neither happened and while my lashes are still very straight they do appear fuller and longer</li>
            <li>Good results, though several layers definitely works best for a dramatic look.</li>
            <li>Really works!</li>
            <li>I first bought the 3D mascara from Younique.  </li>
            <li>I do not feel like it is better than regular mascara.</li>
            <li>I applied exactly as directed and still managed to get fibers in my eyes while trying to apply them.</li>
            <li>Got 3D fiber lashes before from a different company and it was much better.</li>
            <li>Thanks tho!</li>
            <li>The first time I applied the 3D mascara my mother asked if I had just gotten eyelash extensions put in, which is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found a better mascara than my current one yet.</li>
            <li>REAL!</li>
            <li>My package arrived fast, within 2 days of ordering!</li>
            <li>My eyes look more open too.</li>
            <li>This has worked really well for me!</li>
            <li>I have another product exactly like this</li>
            <li>You do one eye at a time, i apply the gel first then the fibers and then the gel</li>
            <li>Good product; eyelid felt heavy after applying and the fibers kept getting into my eye.</li>
            <li>It is just as good as other high quality brands.</li>
            <li>My opinions are my own and I was not paid or compensated in any other ways</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t blessed with long lashes and the ends are very light.</li>
            <li>Was going to skip the PDF How-to, but it was well worth the read since this is a new type lash mascara product that I was unfamiliar with.  </li>
            <li>:) I&#x27;m not sure how comfortable it might be for contact lens wearers because I have had a couple of fibers fall into my eye while applying</li>
            <li>I already have long eyelashes and 3D Fiber mascara makes my long lashes nice and full.</li>
            <li>I was so pleased when I tried to apply this mascara, especially that I was actually able to do it without making a mess.</li>
            <li>She is very into make-up</li>
            <li>Thanks for the fast delivery tho...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really amazed</li>
            <li>Relatively fast shipping as well.</li>
            <li>I think they are an independent business therefore reviews are important.</li>
            <li>Just follow the simple directions for fabulous results.</li>
            <li>Since I have a toddler and another baby on the way, I don&#x27;t really have 10 minutes to put on just one part of my makeup.  </li>
            <li>I really like this mascara.</li>
            <li>It makes my lashes look so much longer and thicker.</li>
            <li>(smoke really irritates my eyes)  but even with smoke irritation</li>
            <li>My lashes look longer and much fuller.</li>
            <li>It really gives me the boost of confidence I was looking for.</li>
            <li>This product works really well at extending and enhancing your lashes.</li>
            <li>It made my lashes so much thicker and longer.</li>
            <li>It gives my lashes so much volume.</li>
            <li>I put a coat of my normal mascara on first, then I apply the gel and then the fibers.</li>
            <li>I have been using Bella Rose 3D Eyelash Extension mascara for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a mascara that could perform as well as Fairydrops (my previous favorite, which Sephora no longer carries) - this stuff really delivers!  </li>
            <li>just as good if not better than younique!</li>
            <li>It lasts all day long and comes off easily with eyemakeup remover.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wants extra long lashes - works great as a regular mascara too</li>
            <li>finally I have full looking lashes.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t wait long enough for the fibers to dry in place before reapplying the gel, but my eyelashes still looked great.</li>
            <li>Then I used the same type of product on the other eye(different brand) and you can tell that this Bella Rose is so much better than the other brand I use.</li>
            <li>black fibers make your eye lashes look stunning.</li>
            <li>You want to make sure and let them fibers set a second before applying the gel the second time.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to any of you ladies.</li>
            <li>But it really is just as easy as applying regular mascara... and probably the same if you, like I, do repeat applications of the mascara to achieve the effect you desire.</li>
            <li>The mascara part is nice but the fibers are hard to put on.  </li>
            <li>The last picture has the eye on your left side(bella rose) and the right eye is the other brand.</li>
            <li>Although I have long and full lashes already, so maybe that makes a difference?</li>
            <li>/&gt;SN: This product feels so normal</li>
            <li>I was born with long lashes but my lashes aren&#x27;t as full as I&#x27;d prefer them to be.  </li>
            <li>Her eye lashes look full and long.</li>
            <li>They are easy to use and definitely make a big difference!</li>
            <li>In my picture, my left eye, no fiber lash; right eye, after fiber lash.</li>
            <li>3D fiber lashes are the big trend right now.</li>
            <li>I put the gel on first then when I apply the fibers (I usually dab them on and go side to side and up and down to get a good coating)</li>
            <li>less so than an eye lash and fairly easy to fix.</li>
            <li>Played with it for the first time today and really loved the long thick look!</li>
            <li>My lashes are short, very straight and won&#x27;t keep a curl.  </li>
            <li>Seller very professional and checked up on me.</li>
            <li>I ordered a different brand - a few dollars cheaper - expecting the same quality that I had received with my first order of Bella Rose.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know which tube to apply first even though there is a simple instruction booklet included in the case</li>
            <li>Almost completely waterproof without damaging your eyelashes and gives 10 times the length and volume of a normal mascara.</li>
            <li>again, I did this process only twice, Now the first picture below is my eyes with one eye done and one eye not.</li>
            <li>They are not quite as full as I expected</li>
            <li>I was kind of skeptical at first because my eyes are VERY sensitive.</li>
            <li>I thought the other brand was a amazing when I got it, but this blew the other one out of the water.</li>
            <li>Not too long ago, I tried a 3D Fiber Lash mascara for the first time</li>
            <li>I always start with my natural eyelashes for a clump-free look.</li>
            <li>I put in eye drops because of the eye scratchy feeling, and eye drops made the mascara completely &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; and clump.</li>
            <li>I may be old school, but I think it is a royal pain to apply.</li>
            <li>I have had no trouble getting my &amp;#34;new&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It makes your lashes long and very noticed!  </li>
            <li>As far as mascara, I&#x27;d recommend this.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s by far easier than any of this.</li>
            <li>I have only used these a few times so far but love the look.  </li>
            <li>Provide natural looking length and volume to your eyelashes.</li>
            <li>Hypo-allergenic and all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>16 year old daughter hates her eye lashes.  </li>
            <li>This mascara produces long, thick, amazing flirty lashes with no flaking.  </li>
            <li>First off the packaging is sleek and classic black.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use it everyday but, for special occasions.</li>
            <li>Works really well, makes lashes really long.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with the product overall-the only drawback is it takes just a few extra minutes to apply as there is the gel (mascara-like) and the tube of fiber lashes.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately my urban decay big fatty mascara works better than this.</li>
            <li>You first put a layer of the gel on your lashes and then immediately apply the fibers so they can stick to the wet gel.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really feel like it made my eyelashes look any longer, but the fibers felt like they were in my eyes all day and the extra time was the straw that broke the camel&#x27;s back...</li>
            <li>and I have had several eye surgeries so my eyes are very sensitive.  </li>
            <li>And I see why other women love using this everyday.</li>
            <li>I recently stopped getting eyelash extensions after about 5 years to give my eyes a break, and allow my natural lashes to start growing out again.</li>
            <li>Only two steps and takes maybe an extra minute longer then normal.</li>
            <li>I will use the rest of this product, but I&#x27;ll be going back to the other brand and pay a little more.</li>
            <li>I have a very pale complexion with light colored, short eyelashes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The other brand makes my lashes look full but it does not lengthen my lashes like I would like, the other brand also flakes off during the day making it look as though my lashes were falling out.</li>
            <li>I was a little intimidated at first.</li>
            <li>I sealed the fibers as instructed, but one of my eyes is sensitive and it hurt all day long.</li>
            <li>Very similiar to other more expensive brands</li>
            <li>It was easy to apply and no clumps like some mascara leaves behind.</li>
            <li>I received a discount for this product for quality testing and in return I&#x27;m offering up to you to read, my 100% opinion and review - whether it be good or bad.</li>

            <li> Bella Rose:</li>
            <li> but I prefer Bella Rose.</li>
            <li> then I recommend you try Bella Rose.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product during a promotion and the views I have expressed are my own.</li>
            <li> I also loved the package nice case and arrived very quick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to apply, it&#x27;s lightweight on your eyes</li>
            <li> Very easy to do</li>
            <li> It is great, it takes some practice to get it right but works amazingly.</li>
            <li> The result was far from impressive.</li>
            <li> :) Very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s better than that?</li>
            <li> Love, love this product</li>
            <li> Love this mascara.</li>
            <li> There are better instructions of application on their website than what came in the box.</li>
            <li> Overall very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I ordered this products.</li>
            <li> , the top picture is no mascara and</li>
            <li> The length it gives my lashes is fabulous!</li>
            <li> Then again I applied to gel and then repeated these steps one more time.</li>
            <li> I have tried that one and was ok with it.</li>
            <li> She love it.</li>
            <li> I think this one gives a more thick/clumpy result..</li>
            <li> I have tried several of the fiber mascaras and this one is the best!</li>
            <li> What a gret product,  Love the packaging to keep it in also.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this 3D Fiber Lash mascara, after I figured out how to use it.</li>
            <li> Make sure you have an eyelash comb.</li>
            <li> I need to practice more.</li>
            <li> and you can add more layers if you want so</li>
            <li> This did make my lashes more noticeable</li>
            <li> The 3d lashes falls out and it goes to the eye, it may irritate your eye most of the time, skip it.</li>
            <li> and this product looks much BETTER then when I had extensions.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.</li>
            <li> I use two coats on my top lashes and one coat on the bottom.</li>
            <li> In love with this mascara...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s basically putting lint on top of sticky mascara....</li>
            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> I wanted to see what all the fuss was about, but didn&#x27;t want to spend $40 or more for something I wasn&#x27;t sure</li>
            <li> I love the size of my lashes they look thicker and fuller</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this fiber mascara.</li>
            <li> then I put more gel on.</li>
            <li> and this brand worked so much better than I thought it could do.</li>
            <li> and she is in love.</li>
            <li> Love the product, it is easy to use and lasted all day :)</li>
            <li> If I was to buy these for a gift, they aren&#x27;t very eye catching or &amp;#34;pretty&amp;#34; Otherwise, I will continue to use this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase, 100% worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy love</li>
            <li> I also love that it stays on ALL day yet comes off easily with soap and water.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Bella Rose 3D Eyelash Extension Mascara for any gal who is eyelash impaired!</li>
            <li> Was looking at getting these through direct sales when I got a great deal here.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes looked great, and felt natural.  </li>
            <li> After reading the handy guide that came with the 3D lashes, I used the gel and fiber lashes right away.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply and stays on until you wash it off.</li>
            <li> And, as the instructions state, it was easy to remove.  </li>
            <li> Easy to,apply and not clumpy.</li>
            <li> It was really easy to apply to my lashes.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m back to Bella Rose for good.</li>
            <li> Overall I am very impressed with this and did not expect to have such good results.</li>
            <li> I could tell a huge difference in my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> When I saw that this one was available, I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it.</li>
            <li> This was a great purchase for any female!  </li>
            <li> made it sound.</li>
            <li> (I forgot I had it on sometimes) and you get beautiful, long eyelashes.</li>
            <li> She said she loved how the bristles were so soft and how it made her lashes thicker and darker.</li>
            <li> I now have the long, beautiful eyelashes that I have always wanted.</li>
            <li> My lashes still look good far into the evening.</li>
            <li> She sent me a picture and her eyelashes look long, thicker, and beautiful.</li>
            <li> Its not like the original product.</li>
            <li> I significant difference.</li>
            <li> and I only seem to successfully get fibers in my eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure this mascara is the type that if you have to shed a tear it won&#x27;t ruin your makeup.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> but once it&#x27;s dry, I&#x27;ve experienced no flaking at all.</li>
            <li> Great product and does not irritate my dry eyes or my contact lenses.</li>
            <li> Special Occasion Flare&lt;br /&gt;Rich</li>
            <li> It was not as great as expected</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not in love with the mascara tube formula because it doesn&#x27;t do much for volume</li>
            <li> Next time, I&#x27;ll wait a good minute before reapplying the gel.</li>
            <li> Would rarely splurge on myself, but this lash system is well worth it!</li>
            <li> Super product</li>
            <li> They were big and light! :-)</li>
            <li> I tend to only use this on my top lashes because the bottom are ok.</li>
            <li> You have to be quick</li>
            <li> I really love it and highly recommend it</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I reviewed the directions and first lightly applied the gel on one eye, then the fiber wand, and repeated.  </li>
            <li> but it actually worked pretty good.</li>
            <li> and it was so easy and fast.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not even funny!</li>
            <li> With Bella Rose my lashes look much longer, fuller, the fibers stay on pretty much all day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was a little hesitant looking at the two tubes (though the case is extremely attractive)</li>
            <li> I would recommend using a light hand when applying.&lt;br /&gt;Great results and a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I Received my Bella Rose 3D Fiber Lash Mascara today and before I could open the box my daughter took it and used it.</li>
            <li> If you are doubting whether or not it&#x27;s worth it, don&#x27;t doubt.</li>
            <li> When I received instructions from the seller via email in a PDF format, it was so much more clear.</li>
            <li> so I used a couple coats of my favorite mascara first, then the transplanting gel, which is pretty much just like mascara but thicker, then the fiber brush.</li>
            <li> I actually used my own mascara brush to do this and it separated them just as well.</li>
            <li> The product arrived in a nice storage box similar to an eyeglass case.</li>
            <li> It is amazing how long your lashes get!</li>
            <li> So easy to use and looks natural.</li>
            <li> My new mascara!!!</li>
            <li> My lashes are super long and I have gotten so many compliments on them, even people asking if i have gotteb eyelash extensions.</li>
            <li> Neither happened and while my lashes are still very straight they do appear fuller and longer</li>
            <li> Good results, though several layers definitely works best for a dramatic look.</li>
            <li> Really works!</li>
            <li> I first bought the 3D mascara from Younique.  </li>
            <li> I do not feel like it is better than regular mascara.</li>
            <li> I applied exactly as directed and still managed to get fibers in my eyes while trying to apply them.</li>
            <li> Got 3D fiber lashes before from a different company and it was much better.</li>
            <li> Thanks tho!</li>
            <li> The first time I applied the 3D mascara my mother asked if I had just gotten eyelash extensions put in, which is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found a better mascara than my current one yet.</li>
            <li> REAL!</li>
            <li> My package arrived fast, within 2 days of ordering!</li>
            <li> My eyes look more open too.</li>
            <li> This has worked really well for me!</li>
            <li> I have another product exactly like this</li>
            <li> You do one eye at a time, i apply the gel first then the fibers and then the gel</li>
            <li> Good product; eyelid felt heavy after applying and the fibers kept getting into my eye.</li>
            <li> It is just as good as other high quality brands.</li>
            <li> My opinions are my own and I was not paid or compensated in any other ways</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t blessed with long lashes and the ends are very light.</li>
            <li> Was going to skip the PDF How-to, but it was well worth the read since this is a new type lash mascara product that I was unfamiliar with.  </li>
            <li> :) I&#x27;m not sure how comfortable it might be for contact lens wearers because I have had a couple of fibers fall into my eye while applying</li>
            <li> I already have long eyelashes and 3D Fiber mascara makes my long lashes nice and full.</li>
            <li> I was so pleased when I tried to apply this mascara, especially that I was actually able to do it without making a mess.</li>
            <li> She is very into make-up</li>
            <li> Thanks for the fast delivery tho...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really amazed</li>
            <li> Relatively fast shipping as well.</li>
            <li> I think they are an independent business therefore reviews are important.</li>
            <li> Just follow the simple directions for fabulous results.</li>
            <li> Since I have a toddler and another baby on the way, I don&#x27;t really have 10 minutes to put on just one part of my makeup.  </li>
            <li> I really like this mascara.</li>
            <li> It makes my lashes look so much longer and thicker.</li>
            <li> (smoke really irritates my eyes)  but even with smoke irritation</li>
            <li> My lashes look longer and much fuller.</li>
            <li> It really gives me the boost of confidence I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This product works really well at extending and enhancing your lashes.</li>
            <li> It made my lashes so much thicker and longer.</li>
            <li> It gives my lashes so much volume.</li>
            <li> I put a coat of my normal mascara on first, then I apply the gel and then the fibers.</li>
            <li> I have been using Bella Rose 3D Eyelash Extension mascara for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a mascara that could perform as well as Fairydrops (my previous favorite, which Sephora no longer carries) - this stuff really delivers!  </li>
            <li> just as good if not better than younique!</li>
            <li> It lasts all day long and comes off easily with eyemakeup remover.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wants extra long lashes - works great as a regular mascara too</li>
            <li> finally I have full looking lashes.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t wait long enough for the fibers to dry in place before reapplying the gel, but my eyelashes still looked great.</li>
            <li> Then I used the same type of product on the other eye(different brand) and you can tell that this Bella Rose is so much better than the other brand I use.</li>
            <li> black fibers make your eye lashes look stunning.</li>
            <li> You want to make sure and let them fibers set a second before applying the gel the second time.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to any of you ladies.</li>
            <li> But it really is just as easy as applying regular mascara... and probably the same if you, like I, do repeat applications of the mascara to achieve the effect you desire.</li>
            <li> The mascara part is nice but the fibers are hard to put on.  </li>
            <li> The last picture has the eye on your left side(bella rose) and the right eye is the other brand.</li>
            <li> Although I have long and full lashes already, so maybe that makes a difference?</li>
            <li> /&gt;SN: This product feels so normal</li>
            <li> I was born with long lashes but my lashes aren&#x27;t as full as I&#x27;d prefer them to be.  </li>
            <li> Her eye lashes look full and long.</li>
            <li> They are easy to use and definitely make a big difference!</li>
            <li> In my picture, my left eye, no fiber lash; right eye, after fiber lash.</li>
            <li> 3D fiber lashes are the big trend right now.</li>
            <li> I put the gel on first then when I apply the fibers (I usually dab them on and go side to side and up and down to get a good coating)</li>
            <li> less so than an eye lash and fairly easy to fix.</li>
            <li> Played with it for the first time today and really loved the long thick look!</li>
            <li> My lashes are short, very straight and won&#x27;t keep a curl.  </li>
            <li> Seller very professional and checked up on me.</li>
            <li> I ordered a different brand - a few dollars cheaper - expecting the same quality that I had received with my first order of Bella Rose.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know which tube to apply first even though there is a simple instruction booklet included in the case</li>
            <li> Almost completely waterproof without damaging your eyelashes and gives 10 times the length and volume of a normal mascara.</li>
            <li> again, I did this process only twice, Now the first picture below is my eyes with one eye done and one eye not.</li>
            <li> They are not quite as full as I expected</li>
            <li> I was kind of skeptical at first because my eyes are VERY sensitive.</li>
            <li> I thought the other brand was a amazing when I got it, but this blew the other one out of the water.</li>
            <li> Not too long ago, I tried a 3D Fiber Lash mascara for the first time</li>
            <li> I always start with my natural eyelashes for a clump-free look.</li>
            <li> I put in eye drops because of the eye scratchy feeling, and eye drops made the mascara completely &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; and clump.</li>
            <li> I may be old school, but I think it is a royal pain to apply.</li>
            <li> I have had no trouble getting my &amp;#34;new&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It makes your lashes long and very noticed!  </li>
            <li> As far as mascara, I&#x27;d recommend this.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s by far easier than any of this.</li>
            <li> I have only used these a few times so far but love the look.  </li>
            <li> Provide natural looking length and volume to your eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Hypo-allergenic and all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> 16 year old daughter hates her eye lashes.  </li>
            <li> This mascara produces long, thick, amazing flirty lashes with no flaking.  </li>
            <li> First off the packaging is sleek and classic black.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use it everyday but, for special occasions.</li>
            <li> Works really well, makes lashes really long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with the product overall-the only drawback is it takes just a few extra minutes to apply as there is the gel (mascara-like) and the tube of fiber lashes.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my urban decay big fatty mascara works better than this.</li>
            <li> You first put a layer of the gel on your lashes and then immediately apply the fibers so they can stick to the wet gel.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really feel like it made my eyelashes look any longer, but the fibers felt like they were in my eyes all day and the extra time was the straw that broke the camel&#x27;s back...</li>
            <li> and I have had several eye surgeries so my eyes are very sensitive.  </li>
            <li> And I see why other women love using this everyday.</li>
            <li> I recently stopped getting eyelash extensions after about 5 years to give my eyes a break, and allow my natural lashes to start growing out again.</li>
            <li> Only two steps and takes maybe an extra minute longer then normal.</li>
            <li> I will use the rest of this product, but I&#x27;ll be going back to the other brand and pay a little more.</li>
            <li> I have a very pale complexion with light colored, short eyelashes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The other brand makes my lashes look full but it does not lengthen my lashes like I would like, the other brand also flakes off during the day making it look as though my lashes were falling out.</li>
            <li> I was a little intimidated at first.</li>
            <li> I sealed the fibers as instructed, but one of my eyes is sensitive and it hurt all day long.</li>
            <li> Very similiar to other more expensive brands</li>
            <li> It was easy to apply and no clumps like some mascara leaves behind.</li>
            <li> I received a discount for this product for quality testing and in return I&#x27;m offering up to you to read, my 100% opinion and review - whether it be good or bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried fake lashes a few times and they weren&#x27;t very comfortable!</li>
            <li> There  was only 3 simple steps that took less than 5 minutes to complete.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone who wants a little oomph in their lashes!</li>
            <li> lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Difficult to apply, fibers often fall into eyes and transplant gel smears easily.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first with the fiber tube because it looks like dark, dried, lint on the brush.</li>
            <li> I always heard that if you start with a base coat of your normal regular mascara, you get better results, but I found that this was not the case for me.</li>
            <li> I was in high hopes over this after watching reviews on 3d mascara but not sure if it is accepted for a return policy since I had to use it to try it.</li>
            <li> I repeated these steps at least twice, but you can repeat as much as you like till you get the desired length and fullness.</li>
            <li> Makes my lashes long and luscious.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if maybe it was old and dried up or what.</li>
            <li> I am not a professional makeup artist</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t cause me irritation and it lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> If you are looking to have long lushes eye lashes</li>
            <li> I was actually asked if my eye lashes were false or real!  </li>
            <li> Im not a fan of false eyelashes and since 3D Fiber Mascara is trending right now I decided to try this product</li>
            <li> I was expecting something better but these little fibers always go into my eyes and are really difficult to take them out .</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it, but it could work differently for other people.</li>
            <li> Completely different then other mascaras I have used.</li>
            <li> Then I did the same on the other eye.  </li>
            <li> I applied the magnifying gel and immediately followed by applying the fibers before the gel had time to dry.</li>
            <li> I then applied the dry fibers just as I had the gel.</li>
            <li> The transfer gel was fine,but the fiber tube was dry dry dry.</li>
            <li> I like to let it dry just a bit then add another layer if I need to.</li>
            <li> They are very short and she only has a few.</li>
            <li> The fibers actually are little pieces of fuzz on the wand.</li>
            <li> I really like that enhancing my eyelashes does not have to mean clumpy eyelashes!</li>
            <li> I have heavy upper eyelids and every mascara I&#x27;ve tried rubs off within an hour.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to wear false lashes anymore thanks to 3D fiber lash mascara.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have that issue with the other brand.  </li>
            <li> one is the mascara gel and the other is the fibers.</li>
            <li> Mine are so short I usually don&#x27;t bother with mascara at all.</li>
            <li> not worth it to me.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I curled my eyelashes and then applied the gel, making sure I started at the base.</li>
            <li> I no longer use false lashes and my old 3D fiber lashes.</li>
            <li> I ended up with flaking lashes, and small fibers in and under my eyes all day long!  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is the mascara gel is messy at the end of the brush.</li>
            <li> This makes them thick and ultra long drawing a lot of attention to my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Gives as much or as little volume and length as you want.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes have always been really little but with the 3D mascara</li>
            <li> It seems to flake a little</li>
            <li> I smear it on my skin a little</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Gel arrived totally dried up.</li>
            <li> Ive had a few people ask me if I had eyelash extensions done.</li>
            <li> I would from time to time get a few particle in my eye.</li>
            <li> But I just couldn&#x27;t fathom using a dried up lint brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few times and can&#x27;t get it to look like the pictures</li>
            <li> Just reading the instructions and reviews, I thought this would be a messy process.</li>
            <li> ends up looking messy and getting in contacts</li>
            <li> The fiber was dried so it didnt work at all</li>
            <li> It does nothing at all what a waste of money.</li>
            <li> You need to repeat the applications of the gel and fibers a few times until you get your desired look.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have thin and short eyelashes</li>
            <li> I recommended this product to a few friends.</li>
            <li> you are truly missing out.</li>
            <li> I have no money for implants and wearing false lashes became a big pain.</li>
            <li> If you have been disappointed by every other mascare you have tried, this really is the one for you!</li>
            <li> WHICH MAKES FOR A NASTY CLEAN UP AROUND YOUR EYES!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually black, which is hard to find.  </li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve applied false eyelashes because my natural lashes were so thin.</li>
            <li> All the mascaras I&#x27;ve tried in the past would either make my eyes water or itch all the time.</li>
            <li> Ill stick with my regular lashes.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes disappear, making my eyes look small.</li>
            <li> The only issue I has was removing it, it is a bit difficult to take off.</li>
            <li> I have small eyes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry I left</li>
            <li> I usually repeat the process 2 to 3 times to get desired thickness and length.</li>
            <li> I have very thin and short lashes</li>
            <li> This one tends to smudge after a few hours on my eye lids, also its hard to get the eye lashes to not go everywhere!</li>
            <li> The case is a hard shell</li>
            <li> I definitely feel like my eyes are bald and was searching for something to help get me through this awkward growing phase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so you can separate your lashes if it looks too thick or stuck together.</li>
            <li> BUT it does make your lashes look thick.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have to wear eyeliner because it makes my eyes look that much bigger, but if you want a real dramatic effect then putting on eyeliner before the fiber lash will give you that look.</li>
            <li> I finally bought these for my daughter site wanted these so bad and since they were on sale I gave in.  </li>
            <li> This product is NOT good.</li>
            <li> so I usually need to use fake lashes but with this mascara, its all i need.</li>
            <li> The newest craze seems to be getting fibers placed on the ends of your lashes versus getting the traditional faux lashes placed at the base of the lash line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not happy at all.</li>
            <li> Mine came broken.</li>
            <li> As a product tester, I stand behind my reviews.</li>
            <li> Everyone has been asking me if I&#x27;m wearing false eyelashes</li>
            <li> I no longer have to worry about fibers or false lashes on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> i developed eyelid edema (inflammation) and very painful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had longer eyelashes, but I wanted a thicker and dramatic look.</li>
            <li> Unable to use...</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about fiber lashes.</li>
            <li> I have thin to zero lashes and this made them so noticeable!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m already addicted!</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical that it would work</li>
            <li> This mascara is a game changer and you won&#x27;t be unhappy with it.</li>
            <li> I was worried about it being clumpy, uncomfortable, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is a game changer!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think any of the fiber mascara was as difficult to use as a lot of people</li>
            <li> Not all of us are born with voluminous lashes, and I for one was not, I have very thin ones, so I will use this for a month and try to update my review in this time</li>
            <li> I feel bad having to write this</li>
            <li> So disappointed.</li>
            <li> When I gave this to my daughter to try she looked doubtful but said she will give it a shot.</li>
            <li> was very disappointed when I tried my mascara.</li>
            <li> Terrible.</li>
            <li> This product is terrible.  </li>
            <li> I did get the fibers in my eyes a couple times, but it wasn&#x27;t especially painful...</li>

            <li> Terrible. Gel arrived totally dried up. Unable to use...</li>
            <li> I LOVE this 3D mascara! I was kind of skeptical at first because my eyes are VERY sensitive. All the mascaras I&#x27;ve tried in the past would either make my eyes water or itch all the time. But not this 3D mascara. It&#x27;s very easy to apply, it&#x27;s lightweight on your eyes (I forgot I had it on sometimes) and you get beautiful, long eyelashes. What&#x27;s better than that? They even send you and email with a How To guide to get the best results and tips. Every time I use it, I get compliments. I will DEFINITELY be ordering again!</li>
            <li> It was not as great as expected but it&#x27;s still good</li>
            <li> Love this mascara! Makes my lashes long and luscious.</li>
            <li> My lashes are short, very straight and won&#x27;t keep a curl.  I was concerned that the fibers would get into my eyes or that I would have raccoon eyes. Neither happened and while my lashes are still very straight they do appear fuller and longer</li>
            <li> Love, love this product</li>
            <li> Love this mascara. Gives as much or as little volume and length as you want. Lasts all day, doesn&#x27;t flake or smudge.</li>
            <li> Really works! Thank you! Super product</li>
            <li> This mascara lengthen my eye lashes. There are better instructions of application on their website than what came in the box. My only complaint is the mascara gel is messy at the end of the brush. Overall very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I first bought the 3D mascara from Younique.  I was looking to try and see if I would get the same effects cheaper.  This product still adds fullness and overall does what it says.  But, I find the the fiber tends to itch my eyes all day when I&#x27;m wearing it.  I didn&#x27;t have that issue with the other brand.  Also, I feel like this brand doesn&#x27;t wash off as nicely.  I will use the rest of this product, but I&#x27;ll be going back to the other brand and pay a little more.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT THE ONLY THING IS THAT ....IT SMEARS OVER YOUR EYES (IT MIGHT JUST BE ME) WHICH MAKES FOR A NASTY CLEAN UP AROUND YOUR EYES!! HOWEVER IT DOES WHAT IT SAID AND I WOULD BUY AGAIN...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use it everyday but, for special occasions. Works really well, makes lashes really long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not in love with the mascara tube formula because it doesn&#x27;t do much for volume but it&#x27;s a great concept.</li>
            <li> This is great. finally I have full looking lashes.</li>
            <li> These fiber lashes are great!  They are easy to use and definitely make a big difference!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about fiber lashes. I&#x27;m so glad I ordered this products. My eyelashes look amazing when I use it. Ive had a few people ask me if I had eyelash extensions done.</li>
            <li> The product does what it says! I have thin to zero lashes and this made them so noticeable! I love the box they come in as well! Only thing I would suggest is jazz either the tubes up or box. If I was to buy these for a gift, they aren&#x27;t very eye catching or &amp;#34;pretty&amp;#34; Otherwise, I will continue to use this product!</li>
            <li> The newest craze seems to be getting fibers placed on the ends of your lashes versus getting the traditional faux lashes placed at the base of the lash line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product comes in three pieces: the cae, the transplant gel, and the fiber wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product indeed creates the illusion of longer lashes but it does so at times with the end result mimicking spider legs or clumpy lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why five stars? The product works. Its purpose is to aid in the appearance of lengthier lashes. It does that. How the longer lashes look depends on the person applying the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Product sent for purpose of review</li>
            <li> I Received my Bella Rose 3D Fiber Lash Mascara today and before I could open the box my daughter took it and used it. She is very into make-up and she Loved it! She said she loved how the bristles were so soft and how it made her lashes thicker and darker. And I agree they were thicker and darker! So then I decided to do my eyes and I was impressed to with how it felt and looked thicker eyelashes and darker to</li>
            <li> Not too long ago, I tried a 3D Fiber Lash mascara for the first time and I fell in love! When I saw that this one was available, I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. When I got it, I used it according to the directions for the best results. I always heard that if you start with a base coat of your normal regular mascara, you get better results, but I found that this was not the case for me. I always start with my natural eyelashes for a clump-free look. I applied the magnifying gel and immediately followed by applying the fibers before the gel had time to dry. I then reapplied the magnifying gel to lock the fibers in place. I didn&#x27;t wait long enough for the fibers to dry in place before reapplying the gel, but my eyelashes still looked great. Next time, I&#x27;ll wait a good minute before reapplying the gel. The results are amazing. Definitely great for going out! I&#x27;m already addicted! The fibers stayed in place all day and overnight. None of them fell lose onto my face or into my eyes. Can&#x27;t wait to keep using it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*In the photo, the top picture is no mascara and the bottom picture is the Bella Rose 3D Fiber Lash mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review. All opinions stated are that of my own and have in no way been swayed.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this mascara! The length it gives my lashes is fabulous!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mascara? I do not feel like it is better than regular mascara. Although I have long and full lashes already, so maybe that makes a difference? I doubt I would buy it again because I didn&#x27;t notice a difference.</li>
            <li> I applied exactly as directed and still managed to get fibers in my eyes while trying to apply them. After spending forever getting the fibers cleaned off my contacts I decided I&#x27;d stick with regular mascara.</li>
            <li> I have heard a lot of people raving about 3D mascara and have been wanting to try it for awhile. The Bella Rose 3D Fiber Lash Extension Mascara comes in a nice case and comes with the mascara, Gel, and the instructions on how to use it. I was really skeptical that it would work but it actually worked pretty good. I curled my eyelashes and then applied the gel, making sure I started at the base. I then applied the dry fibers just as I had the gel. Then again I applied to gel and then repeated these steps one more time. You want to make sure and let them fibers set a second before applying the gel the second time. My eyelashes have always been really little but with the 3D mascara I now have the long, beautiful eyelashes that I have always wanted. I received this product as a sample to test and review. This review is solely my opinion. The information provided is what I experienced.</li>
            <li> was very disappointed when I tried my mascara. I have used youniqe and thought I,d try yours.The transfer gel was fine,but the fiber tube was dry dry dry.When I tried to put it on it wouldn&#x27;t even adhere to the gel on my lashes.I don&#x27;t know if maybe it was old and dried up or what.Thanks for the fast delivery tho...I wont buy again tho..Katie</li>
            <li> I was expecting something better but these little fibers always go into my eyes and are really difficult to take them out .</li>
            <li> Good product; eyelid felt heavy after applying and the fibers kept getting into my eye. I must add that it looked great. I didn&#x27;t need to put on lashes.</li>
            <li> I give it two thumbs up!!!</li>
            <li> Not that impressed. Got 3D fiber lashes before from a different company and it was much better. This product didnt enhance my eyelashes well. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it, but it could work differently for other people.</li>
            <li> These lash extensions work great.,they and volume and length to your existing lashes. I will definitely purchase again</li>
            <li> Its not like the original product. I have tried that one and was ok with it. This one tends to smudge after a few hours on my eye lids, also its hard to get the eye lashes to not go everywhere! I am not a professional makeup artist so I do not know how to properly put these on but personally I wasn&#x27;t stoked on them. Ill stick with my regular lashes. Thanks tho!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 1 week.  I have heavy upper eyelids and every mascara I&#x27;ve tried rubs off within an hour. My eyelashes disappear, making my eyes look small. I have contemplated getting eyelash extensions or at minimum having them dyed.  I read about this product and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I am very pleased at it&#x27;s durability.  My lashes still look good far into the evening. Finally!  I would recommend using a light hand when applying.&lt;br /&gt;Great results and a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I really love it and highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I loved my Bella Rose 3D Fiber Lash Mascara its amazing. Everyone has been asking me if I&#x27;m wearing false eyelashes and I tell them &amp;#34;no they&#x27;re my own lashes wink&amp;#34; lol! I&#x27;m really amazed, I&#x27;ll be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> I recently stopped getting eyelash extensions after about 5 years to give my eyes a break, and allow my natural lashes to start growing out again. I definitely feel like my eyes are bald and was searching for something to help get me through this awkward growing phase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Bella Rose: 3D Fiber Lash Extension Mascara! The 3D mascara is very easy to apply, and has helped my eyelashes go from drab to fab! The first time I applied the 3D mascara my mother asked if I had just gotten eyelash extensions put in, which is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in love with this mascara and will not use anything else!</li>
            <li> Not happy at all. So disappointed. Do not buy this product. Mine came broken.</li>
            <li> Where has this product been all my life! It is great, it takes some practice to get it right but works amazingly. I suggest getting a good comb and curler. The results are beautiful.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife, and she like it. come in very nice paking with two pen in it. She love it.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> Would rarely splurge on myself, but this lash system is well worth it! Was going to skip the PDF How-to, but it was well worth the read since this is a new type lash mascara product that I was unfamiliar with.  Played with it for the first time today and really loved the long thick look!</li>
            <li> I have been using Bella Rose 3D Eyelash Extension mascara for a few weeks now. I&#x27;m pleased with the product overall-the only drawback is it takes just a few extra minutes to apply as there is the gel (mascara-like) and the tube of fiber lashes. It lasts all day! Seller very professional and checked up on me. Relatively fast shipping as well. I will definitely order from the seller again!</li>
            <li> I think they are an independent business therefore reviews are important. I feel bad having to write this but yes it is clumpy and you have to use an eyelash comb to separate the lashes. Unfortunately my urban decay big fatty mascara works better than this. I think this one gives a more thick/clumpy result..I haven&#x27;t found a better mascara than my current one yet. Thicker results. Maybe I am not applying it correctly but the fiber brush did nothing....I was in high hopes over this after watching reviews on 3d mascara but not sure if it is accepted for a return policy since I had to use it to try it.</li>
            <li> This mascara is a 3 step system that is beautifully packaged, the case, the transplant gel, and the fiber wand. The case is a hard shell so if you drop it will be okay!! Not all of us are born with voluminous lashes, and I for one was not, I have very thin ones, so I will use this for a month and try to update my review in this time</li>
            <li> Like results. Don&#x27;t like the fiber that gets in my eyes</li>
            <li> it does work my lashes does look longer</li>
            <li> This product is NOT good. The fibers actually are little pieces of fuzz on the wand. The result was far from impressive. I sealed the fibers as instructed, but one of my eyes is sensitive and it hurt all day long. I put in eye drops because of the eye scratchy feeling, and eye drops made the mascara completely &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; and clump. I have used it once and will never try it again.</li>
            <li> It works really nicely. I would from time to time get a few particle in my eye. But it looks amazing. I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to any of you ladies. This mascara is a game changer and you won&#x27;t be unhappy with it. My lashes are super long and I have gotten so many compliments on them, even people asking if i have gotteb eyelash extensions. Shipping was also very fast which was awesome because I was so eager to try it. I promise this product works wonders to those lashes and you will be one happy coustomer. Never going back to a store sold brand again.</li>
            <li> Wonderful mascara! I have tried several of the fiber mascaras and this one is the best!</li>
            <li> I do like this mascara and it reminds me a lot of the younique brand. The quality is good and applies well. It does make my lashes longer but the only thing I did notice is if you don&#x27;t apply another coat of mascara after the fibers, you will have fall out. All in all I did like it and will continue to use it occasionally.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  The only mascara I will ever use. If you are doubting whether or not it&#x27;s worth it, don&#x27;t doubt. My husband came home and even noticed a difference and said he really liked my eyes. Thank you, I am a buyer for life!</li>
            <li> Excellent customer service! Love this mascara!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Just follow the simple directions for fabulous results. Added bonus the extensions stay put no migration to your lower face!!!!</li>
            <li> Great product. Works wonders</li>
            <li> Now that I played with it. It&#x27;s so easy love it. will buy again and again</li>
            <li> They provide how to apply. It&#x27;s  just like what u had seen on YouTube. Made your lashes longer and it&#x27;s finish up your makeup nicely.</li>
            <li> My wife said something like... &amp;#34;I wear contacts and I put on eye make-up daily, and this stuff irritated my eyes and took me about 10 minutes to apply.  Since I have a toddler and another baby on the way, I don&#x27;t really have 10 minutes to put on just one part of my makeup.  I didn&#x27;t really feel like it made my eyelashes look any longer, but the fibers felt like they were in my eyes all day and the extra time was the straw that broke the camel&#x27;s back... not worth it to me.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this mascara!!! Have been using it for over a year and I keep buying more! Except now Amazon is showing &amp;#34;item unavailable&amp;#34; &amp; I just opened my last tube....what now??!!!! 😩</li>
            <li> My box where I have them came cracked</li>
            <li> What a gret product,  Love the packaging to keep it in also.  This is the easiest lash lengthener I have found yet.  So easy to use and looks natural.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved it</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It is amazing!</li>
            <li> Pros: Ads noticeable length and volume to create gorgeous lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Difficult to apply, fibers often fall into eyes and transplant gel smears easily.</li>
            <li> Im not a fan of false eyelashes and since 3D Fiber Mascara is trending right now I decided to try this product and I must say I LOVE IT!! I already have long eyelashes and 3D Fiber mascara makes my long lashes nice and full. It was easy to apply and no clumps like some mascara leaves behind. I love my Bella Rose 3D Mascara!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this 3D Fiber Lash mascara, after I figured out how to use it. I was hesitant at first with the fiber tube because it looks like dark, dried, lint on the brush. I didn&#x27;t know which tube to apply first even though there is a simple instruction booklet included in the case and  the tubes aren&#x27;t labeled. But I just couldn&#x27;t fathom using a dried up lint brush. When I received instructions from the seller via email in a PDF format, it was so much more clear. I have very thin and short lashes so I used a couple coats of my favorite mascara first, then the transplanting gel, which is pretty much just like mascara but thicker, then the fiber brush. The fibers stuck to my lashes, making them longer and fuller. I repeated these steps at least twice, but you can repeat as much as you like till you get the desired length and fullness. Make sure you have an eyelash comb. It will come in handing so you can separate your lashes if it looks too thick or stuck together. I actually used my own mascara brush to do this and it separated them just as well. The outcome is amazing. And I see why other women love using this everyday. I don&#x27;t even have to wear eyeliner because it makes my eyes look that much bigger, but if you want a real dramatic effect then putting on eyeliner before the fiber lash will give you that look. In my picture, my left eye, no fiber lash; right eye, after fiber lash. I significant difference. I purchased this product on promo. As a product tester, I stand behind my reviews. I happily share my opinion on awesome products and this is 3D fiber lash is definitely awesome.</li>
            <li> Very similiar to other more expensive brands</li>
            <li> It seems to flake a little and it&#x27;s concerning since it&#x27;s on my lashes--I&#x27;m worried that it might actually get into my eye?</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this mascara and i have to admit it looks good on her.  I however am not a fan.  I may be old school, but I think it is a royal pain to apply.</li>
            <li> Gave it to my sister as a gift and she loves it! She sent me a picture and her eyelashes look long, thicker, and beautiful. She couldn&#x27;t be more happy.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara! It is awesome! Almost completely waterproof without damaging your eyelashes and gives 10 times the length and volume of a normal mascara. Will definitely be the only mascara I use in the future!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t quite mastered the art of using this product. I&#x27;ve tried a few times and can&#x27;t get it to look like the pictures and I only seem to successfully get fibers in my eyes. I need to practice more.</li>
            <li> Did not work as advertised. I would like to return this product.</li>
            <li> Works great! Love the length and fullness it gives to my lashes!</li>
            <li> Great quality product if you want longer and fuller looking lashes. There are two tubes - one is the mascara gel and the other is the fibers. You first put a layer of the gel on your lashes and then immediately apply the fibers so they can stick to the wet gel. Finish by applying another layer of gel to lock it all in place. Very easy to do and you can add more layers if you want so you can achieve the desired look. I have also just used the gel by itself on days I don&#x27;t wants extra long lashes - works great as a regular mascara too</li>
            <li> Most of us don&#x27;t have the eyelashes we want! However this product makes it so close to perfect it&#x27;s not even funny! I really enjoyed uding it and the fact that it lasted great all day. The only issue I has was removing it, it is a bit difficult to take off. Which in another way is a good thing. I&#x27;m pretty sure this mascara is the type that if you have to shed a tear it won&#x27;t ruin your makeup.</li>
            <li> Been wanting to try fiber lashes because I have none! I was worried about the fibers getting into my eyes but I didn&#x27;t have any issues with that. This did make my lashes more noticeable so I wonder what it would do for someone who already has lashes? Mine are so short I usually don&#x27;t bother with mascara at all.</li>
            <li> Was looking at getting these through direct sales when I got a great deal here. Love them!! Easy to use. I was a little intimidated at first. My new mascara!!! Recommend having an eyelash brush.</li>
            <li> It works! Made my eyelashes longer and thicker. My only problem is that, i have to comb my lashes everytime i apply the fibers because it clumps and it looks like a spider leg. Also, if you use contact lenses, this is not a product for you. The 3d lashes falls out and it goes to the eye, it may irritate your eye most of the time, skip it.</li>
            <li> I have small eyes these make my eyes pop. I also loved the package nice case and arrived very quick. I did get the product for discount for review.</li>
            <li> The Bella Rose 3D Fiber Lash Extension Mascara is awesome..the product comes in a great case with instructions. The product is simple to use and works like described making your lashes fuller and longer. In fact I used to pay $50 every 3 weeks for maintaining lash extensions......and this product looks much BETTER then when I had extensions. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this! I&#x27;ve always had longer eyelashes, but I wanted a thicker and dramatic look. This was the trick! It&#x27;s easy to apply and stays on until you wash it off.</li>
            <li> I was so pleased when I tried to apply this mascara, especially that I was actually able to do it without making a mess. Just reading the instructions and reviews, I thought this would be a messy process. But it really is just as easy as applying regular mascara... and probably the same if you, like I, do repeat applications of the mascara to achieve the effect you desire. I was walking around batting my eyes like a beauty queen!  And, as the instructions state, it was easy to remove.  I used makeup remover... didn&#x27;t try just the soap and water alone, but that may work too.</li>
            <li> Really great product. Easy to use and looks great!!! My sister said I looked Glamorous...can&#x27;t beat that review!! Company sends a great pdf for tips on usage. Will buy from this vendor again.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a mascara that could perform as well as Fairydrops (my previous favorite, which Sephora no longer carries) - this stuff really delivers!  This mascara produces long, thick, amazing flirty lashes with no flaking.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase, 100% worth it.</li>
            <li> AWESOME, I love it. I will be ordering again and again!</li>
            <li> Its awesome. My eyelashes are so short so I usually need to use fake lashes but with this mascara, its all i need. I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I really like this mascara. It is just as good as other high quality brands. Easy to,apply and not clumpy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually black, which is hard to find.  I love this mascara.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t blessed with long lashes and the ends are very light. This mascara was a great find for me. It makes my lashes look so much longer and thicker. I have had no trouble getting my &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; lashes on when I do one eye at a time. I use two coats on my top lashes and one coat on the bottom. I also love that it stays on ALL day yet comes off easily with soap and water. I wore this mascara to my daughter&#x27;s wedding last month and even though I got teary eyed, my mascara stayed put with no need for touch ups :) I&#x27;m not sure how comfortable it might be for contact lens wearers because I have had a couple of fibers fall into my eye while applying but once it&#x27;s dry, I&#x27;ve experienced no flaking at all. I highly recommend Bella Rose 3D Eyelash Extension Mascara for any gal who is eyelash impaired!</li>
            <li> It does extend the eyelashes, but with a price. The 4 different times i put it on i developed eyelid edema (inflammation) and very painful. Would not recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> In love with this mascara... Great product and does not irritate my dry eyes or my contact lenses. Will be ordering again!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s basically putting lint on top of sticky mascara....ends up looking messy and getting in contacts BUT it does make your lashes look thick.</li>
            <li> Maybe there&#x27;s a technique or how to video because I tried it after watching just a reg you tube how to video and the lashes look aweful. Like spider webby. The mascara part is nice but the fibers are hard to put on.  But maybe I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m doing.</li>
            <li> It is amazing how long your lashes get! Love the product, it is easy to use and lasted all day :)</li>
            <li> This mascara duo is wonderful!  It makes your lashes long and very noticed!  Love this!</li>
            <li> The fiber was dried so it didnt work at all</li>
            <li> Over all this is a great product! Completely different then other mascaras I have used. I really like that enhancing my eyelashes does not have to mean clumpy eyelashes! :) Very easy to apply. Only two steps and takes maybe an extra minute longer then normal. I could tell a huge difference in my eyelashes. They were big and light! :-)</li>
            <li> This product is terrible.  It does nothing at all what a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I was majorly impressed with this mascara.  I have a very pale complexion with light colored, short eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little hesitant looking at the two tubes (though the case is extremely attractive) I was worried about it being clumpy, uncomfortable, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I reviewed the directions and first lightly applied the gel on one eye, then the fiber wand, and repeated.  Then I did the same on the other eye.  My eyelashes looked great, and felt natural.  I even went out to a casino with smoking (smoke really irritates my eyes)  but even with smoke irritation my mascara didn&#x27;t bother me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive these through a discount promotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The opinions expressed in the review are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I finally bought these for my daughter site wanted these so bad and since they were on sale I gave in.  I will say this product is really nice and I love it and so does she! She does look really beautiful with this product. This was a great purchase for any female!  I was actually asked if my eye lashes were false or real!  REAL!</li>
            <li> 3D fiber lashes are the big trend right now. I wanted to see what all the fuss was about, but didn&#x27;t want to spend $40 or more for something I wasn&#x27;t sure about.&lt;br /&gt;I found Bell Rose 3D Fiber Lashes at an awesome price and couldn&#x27;t wait to try them out! My package arrived fast, within 2 days of ordering! After reading the handy guide that came with the 3D lashes, I used the gel and fiber lashes right away. I am very pleased with the results. My lashes look longer and much fuller. It was really easy to apply to my lashes. You need to repeat the applications of the gel and fibers a few times until you get your desired look.&lt;br /&gt;I have gotten a ton of compliments already. It really gives me the boost of confidence I was looking for. Great way to treat yourself and also makes a great gift!!</li>
            <li> This is a great mascara. I love the size of my lashes they look thicker and fuller</li>
            <li> This works great made my lashed thicker and longer and it was so easy and fast. I would definitely buy these again.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:28d7b4dbcc0d5ef087f59da18634ae61]] I&#x27;ve only tried fake lashes a few times and they weren&#x27;t very comfortable! This product is a game changer! You can have the lashes you&#x27;ve always desired, but also have comfort. Watch this video and I&#x27;ll show you the difference it made for me!!! Bella Rose: 3D Fiber Lash Extension Mascara is a must have for me! (Ladies my hubby loved them! ;o) )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SN: This product feels so normal I fell asleep with it on! The really great part is I woke up to great lashes..lol!!</li>
            <li> I have very short eyelashes and no matter they type of masscara I apply you could not see my lashes at all. I have no money for implants and wearing false lashes became a big pain. I had a different type of 3D fiber lashes but I prefer Bella Rose. The other brand makes my lashes look full but it does not lengthen my lashes like I would like, the other brand also flakes off during the day making it look as though my lashes were falling out. With Bella Rose my lashes look much longer, fuller, the fibers stay on pretty much all day. I no longer have to worry about fibers or false lashes on my cheeks. I no longer use false lashes and my old 3D fiber lashes.</li>
            <li> As far as mascara, I&#x27;d recommend this. I started getting eye lash extensions recently and that&#x27;s by far easier than any of this. I didn&#x27;t think any of the fiber mascara was as difficult to use as a lot of people made it sound. I did get the fibers in my eyes a couple times, but it wasn&#x27;t especially painful...less so than an eye lash and fairly easy to fix. Good results, though several layers definitely works best for a dramatic look.</li>
            <li> After completing chemo I had sparse lashes.  This product works really well at extending and enhancing your lashes. It also stays on all day, and requires makeup remover (I use coconut oil) to remove.  I&#x27;m a fan and will continue to order again and again.  Thank you!  Update 1/2016: I thought that perhaps all fiber lash brands were created equal,but they are not! I ordered a different brand - a few dollars cheaper - expecting the same quality that I had received with my first order of Bella Rose.  Big mistake.  I ended up with flaking lashes, and small fibers in and under my eyes all day long!  As a contact lens wearer, I do not want flakes of anything coming off my lashes and landing in my eye!  I&#x27;m sorry I left and I&#x27;m back to Bella Rose for good.</li>
            <li> I have only used these a few times so far but love the look.  They are not quite as full as I expected but I am still learning to use them so we will see!</li>
            <li> Tried out my 3d fiber lashes this week and I love what they do to my lashes!  I was born with long lashes but my lashes aren&#x27;t as full as I&#x27;d prefer them to be.  This makes them thick and ultra long drawing a lot of attention to my eyes.  I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone who wants a little oomph in their lashes!</li>
            <li> Great product!  I have thin and short eyelashes and this mascara definitely made them appear longer and fuller.  It lasts all day long and comes off easily with eyemakeup remover.  It comes in a great sturdy case too!</li>
            <li> I love this! If you have been disappointed by every other mascare you have tried, this really is the one for you! It made my lashes so much thicker and longer. My eyes look more open too.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this fiber mascara. It gives my lashes so much volume. They look amazing. I recommended this product to a few friends. They tried mine lived it and purchased their own!!!! :)</li>
            <li> Special Occasion Flare&lt;br /&gt;Rich black fibers make your eye lashes look stunning. Provide natural looking length and volume to your eyelashes. Package comes with two separate bottles, the transplanting gel and the all-natural fibers. Hypo-allergenic and all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I ordered this mascara as a sample for review and evaluation and I love it! After I had my daughter my lashes have been a bit thinner and shorter so I have been looking for volumizing products. This has worked really well for me! I was not expecting to be very good at applying this mascara but it has been really simple. I put the gel on first then when I apply the fibers (I usually dab them on and go side to side and up and down to get a good coating) then I put more gel on. I like to let it dry just a bit then add another layer if I need to. I tend to only use this on my top lashes because the bottom are ok. But when I do use it on the bottom I smear it on my skin a little so you may want to use a guard when applying the bottom, that way you don&#x27;t ruin your face make up. Overall I am very impressed with this and did not expect to have such good results. It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t cause me irritation and it lasts all day long. I really love it!</li>
            <li> Awesome 3D lashes.....just as good if not better than younique!</li>
            <li> I am so impressed with this product.  I have a eye condition and I have had several eye surgeries so my eyes are very sensitive.  I had NO issues using this product.  There is a visible difference in my before and after photos which will be attached.  There  was only 3 simple steps that took less than 5 minutes to complete. I was offered this product  at a reduced price but this is a unbiased  review and it solely based upon my usage of this product. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have another product exactly like this and this brand worked so much better than I thought it could do. First off the packaging is sleek and classic black. You do one eye at a time, i apply the gel first then the fibers and then the gel again, I did this process only twice, Now the first picture below is my eyes with one eye done and one eye not. Then I used the same type of product on the other eye(different brand) and you can tell that this Bella Rose is so much better than the other brand I use. I thought the other brand was a amazing when I got it, but this blew the other one out of the water. The last picture has the eye on your left side(bella rose) and the right eye is the other brand. You can tell the difference. It stayed on all day, I never had to reapply, it never irritated my eyes, nothing fell out and in my eye. And I used my regular makeup face cleaner and it came off with no problem. If you are looking to have long lushes eye lashes then I recommend you try Bella Rose. AMAZING!!! I received a discount for this product for quality testing and in return I&#x27;m offering up to you to read, my 100% opinion and review - whether it be good or bad. My opinions are my own and I was not paid or compensated in any other ways</li>
            <li> Amazing ☆☆☆☆☆&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 16 year old daughter hates her eye lashes.  They are very short and she only has a few. We have tried multiple mascaras but all of them just made her eyes look gunky. When I gave this to my daughter to try she looked doubtful but said she will give it a shot. Two weeks of trying it and she is in love. Her eye lashes look full and long.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried 3D fiber lash mascara you are truly missing out. This stuff is awesome! For years I&#x27;ve applied false eyelashes because my natural lashes were so thin. I don&#x27;t have to wear false lashes anymore thanks to 3D fiber lash mascara. The product arrived in a nice storage box similar to an eyeglass case. There are 2 tubes of product, the gel and the fibers. I put a coat of my normal mascara on first, then I apply the gel and then the fibers. You have to be quick so I do one eye at a time and I keep the lids unscrewed off both tubes. I usually repeat the process 2 to 3 times to get desired thickness and length. This stuff is awesome! Well worth the price! I purchased this product during a promotion and the views I have expressed are my own.</li>
