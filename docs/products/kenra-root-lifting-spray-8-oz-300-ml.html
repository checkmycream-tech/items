            <li>This is the best root lifting spray I have ever used.</li>
            <li>If this Kenra doesn&#x27;t work the best for you, maybe give Garnier a try.</li>

            <li>Love this stuff would not do my hair without it!</li>

            <li>I have had many compliments on my hair after using this product.</li>
            <li>Love love love this product.  </li>
            <li>Gives my hair more body than anything else.</li>
            <li>It works better if you spray it on and massage into scalp and roots of hair.</li>
            <li>Love this product and all the Kenra products.  </li>
            <li>I felt like it worked better to use the Kenra 25 hairspray at my roots instead.</li>
            <li>Perhaps if I got one with greater holding power, it would work better.  </li>
            <li>I will be looking for a lifting spray with greater holding power.  </li>
            <li>I have used Kenra&#x27;s Root Lifting Spray for years and love it.</li>
            <li>And I never thought I would say that.  :)</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>great product highly reccommend</li>
            <li>I have extremely fine hair and have never found a product that adds volume for more that a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and this product helps me manage it.</li>
            <li>The root lifter is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t take much to do the job and it does give my hair nice lift at the roots.  </li>
            <li>It saved me a lot of running around, the price was good, especially considering the free shipping credit.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li>I got it quickly</li>
            <li>She normally gets it from her hairdresser but bought it here since it was notably cheaper.</li>
            <li>The price is right as well.</li>
            <li>works wonders on my very straight hair to give it a bit of volume without feeling like I have a lot of product in my hair</li>
            <li>The product works but the sprayer stopped working after the first week.  </li>
            <li>Very satisified!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used my original one for eight years straight and no other brand has come close.</li>
            <li>I also liked their conditioner for fine thin hair but have discovered that they have stopped making it.</li>
            <li>This product does give a nice lift to my fine, thin, straight hair.  </li>
            <li>Now I may have used too much</li>
            <li>I just didn&#x27;t notice much difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also gentle on  my hair.  </li>
            <li>but because I don&#x27;t use my hair dryer very often and to acivate the product you must use your hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I do buy other Kenra products and love them.</li>
            <li>I get compliments from peole telling me how full my hair is, which is just the opposite.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This holds your hair together very well and is not stiff.</li>
            <li>The volume did last a very long time though which is a bonus because most products that I have used looses effect in a couple hours.</li>
            <li>Same as the one I have been using, no alterations, and price was right.</li>
            <li>We live in Phoenix, so the temp and sweating is also a factor.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without my kenra root lift</li>
            <li>I have tried other products, but always go back to my favorite . . .</li>
            <li>And it looks like I just have natural volume.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it works for other people, so it might just be that different types of hair need different products.</li>
            <li>It does work to some degree if you use it after drying your hair first but doesn&#x27;t do anything if you use it when your hair is wet.</li>
            <li>The lady at my hair salon recommended it to me because my hair is very fine and thin in some spots.  </li>
            <li>and like it so much I decided to try some of their other products.  </li>
            <li>Solid hairspray apparently!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really work, added little to no volume.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have very thin, fine hair &amp; this spray</li>
            <li> but then my hair deflates down 80% ten minutes later.</li>
            <li> (I just spray it on the roots of dry hair and blow-dry them.)</li>

            <li> and it is what I expected.</li>

            <li> The remaining 20% of it stays in for a few hours.</li>
            <li> This spray is one of the few things that gives my hair lift and shape.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure this product is something I will order again.  </li>
            <li> Helps with the lift of the roots with thin hair, but I still have to use gel along with it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product did not work either.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed with the quality of this product.  </li>

            <li> Great product....especially for fine hair!</li>
            <li> I love the Kendra rootlifter. It is a great product. This time I bought two on Amazon.  It saved me a lot of running around, the price was good, especially considering the free shipping credit.</li>
            <li> I read the revews for this product but it made my hair flat...one person&#x27;s opinion.</li>
            <li> Very good product adding lift and bounce to hair.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work, added little to no volume.</li>
            <li> I have naturally blonde, thin, stick straight hair and have had a hard time finding a product that adds volume but that doesnt weigh it down and fall flat mid day. We live in Phoenix, so the temp and sweating is also a factor.  This product is my saving grace! I LOVE IT!  I have had many compliments on my hair after using this product. I will never be without it.</li>
            <li> Got this product after a co-worker told me that&#x27;s what she uses. Now I may have used too much but this made my hair crunchy to touch. The volume did last a very long time though which is a bonus because most products that I have used looses effect in a couple hours.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products to add volume to my hair throughout the years and this is the best.  I get compliments from peole telling me how full my hair is, which is just the opposite.  I also liked their conditioner for fine thin hair but have discovered that they have stopped making it.</li>
            <li> love this for it&#x27;s lightness and doing a good job</li>
            <li> Love love love this product.  For my hair it gives body and lift.  Your hair feels thicker.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is the best root lifting spray I have ever used. Its expensive but so worth it.</li>
            <li> The product works but the sprayer stopped working after the first week.  I was really disappointed with the quality of this product.  Will NOT be buying from them again.</li>

            <li> works wonders on my very straight hair to give it a bit of volume without feeling like I have a lot of product in my hair</li>
            <li> Solid hairspray apparently! Got it as a gift and my mom loves it and that is all she uses! Definitely not a hair expert but she uses it</li>
            <li> Love this product and all the Kenra products.  Very satisified! This holds your hair together very well and is not stiff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad it works for other people, so it might just be that different types of hair need different products. But for me it looks awesome right after I finish blow-drying but then my hair deflates down 80% ten minutes later. (I just spray it on the roots of dry hair and blow-dry them.) The remaining 20% of it stays in for a few hours. I gave this (and several others) a try after my go-to root lifter was discontinued. I&#x27;ve used my original one for eight years straight and no other brand has come close. I have an A-line bob that gets comments all the time and Garnier Root Booster is 80% of what makes it look great. It&#x27;s been my life saver. If this Kenra doesn&#x27;t work the best for you, maybe give Garnier a try. I was elated to find it on Amazon today and bought a pack of six bottles.</li>
            <li> I have used Kenra Root Lifting Spray for several years.  The lady at my hair salon recommended it to me because my hair is very fine and thin in some spots.  She said it was the best product for my type of hair and she uses it all the time.  I have never been disappointed when using Kenra products.</li>
            <li> Nothing seems to hold my hair up, so maybe it&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love or hate this. I just didn&#x27;t notice much difference in my hair. I felt like it worked better to use the Kenra 25 hairspray at my roots instead.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping it would give my hair some fullness at the roots.  Even though it gives some, it&#x27;s not quite enough for me.  I think that it has something to do with the holding power of the spray.  Perhaps if I got one with greater holding power, it would work better.  I will be looking for a lifting spray with greater holding power.  My hair is fine but I have a lot of it.  It does work to some degree if you use it after drying your hair first but doesn&#x27;t do anything if you use it when your hair is wet.</li>
            <li> Bar none, Best Root Lift!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about six months refuse to run out of this product use it every time I style my hair.</li>
            <li> Smells delicious!  Give roots volume and body</li>
            <li> Love this stuff would not do my hair without it!</li>
            <li> I have extremely fine hair and have never found a product that adds volume for more that a couple of minutes. Unfortunately, this product did not work either. It does smell nice though</li>
            <li> Good product.  I got it quickly and it is what I expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Kenra hairspray No. 25 and like it so much I decided to try some of their other products.  The root lifter is fantastic.  Just like the hairspray it doesn&#x27;t take much to do the job and it does give my hair nice lift at the roots.  And it looks like I just have natural volume.  It&#x27;s also gentle on  my hair.  Doesn&#x27;t dry it out.  Kenra is an excellent line.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li> I have used Kenra&#x27;s Root Lifting Spray for years and love it. I have tried other products, but always go back to my favorite . . . Kenra - Root Lifting Spray!</li>
            <li> Best root booster on the market..I have fine hair and this product helps me manage it. I keep my hair short and this product works wonders for me.</li>
            <li> Found nothing wrong with this product but again nothing special from the other products I currently use. I do buy other Kenra products and love them.</li>
            <li> Great product!  I have very thin, fine hair &amp; this spray gave it some volume!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure this product is something I will order again.  Not because it doesn&#x27;t, but because I don&#x27;t use my hair dryer very often and to acivate the product you must use your hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Helps with the lift of the roots with thin hair, but I still have to use gel along with it. Arrived in the time stated by seller.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without my kenra root lift</li>
            <li> Just what I ordered.  Same as the one I have been using, no alterations, and price was right.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of the root lifter with my Kenra hairapray.  And I am thankful I did.  This  lifter is wonderful.  I have very fine hair and it gives my hair the body it needs. I also would recommend using the Kenra Platinum Glaze in conjunction.  Between all three products,  I do not need to keep a perm in my hair for body.  And I never thought I would say that.  :)</li>
            <li> This spray is one of the few things that gives my hair lift and shape.  Love it.  The price is right as well.</li>
            <li> used a different brand and decided to try kenra because I have occasionally used some of their other products, even with shipping I got this cheaper than I could buy it here great product highly reccommend</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this stuff regularly for years and swears by it. She normally gets it from her hairdresser but bought it here since it was notably cheaper.</li>
