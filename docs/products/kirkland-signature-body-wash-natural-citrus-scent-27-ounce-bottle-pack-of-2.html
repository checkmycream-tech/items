            <li>I love this product after using it you are clean and smelling great.</li>
            <li>The scent is great, and it always leaves me feeling fresh and clean!</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite ever.</li>
            <li>I love that the Kirkland Signature products are plant based.  </li>
            <li>Also most bath wash&#x27;s have lot&#x27;s of perfumes and chemicals that can be irritants</li>
            <li>I love Arbonne products which are also vegan as well.</li>
            <li>More companies like Kirkland are jumping on the band wagon to make safer products, like this.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I have dry sensative skin, this stuff is the best I have found for it</li>
            <li>I liked the paraben free and sulfate free properties.</li>
            <li>I loved the scent,  and was glad to see it was natural,  and free of chemicals that we didn&#x27;t want to come in contact with.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t say enough good about it, I am extremely satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>I originally hesitated purchasing this body wash because I thought it smelled a bit like cleaning solution.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had a reaction to any kind of body wash before, nor do I have have particularly sensitive skin or any known allergies, but there&#x27;s something in this formula that does not agree with my skin.</li>

            <li>It feels so good on my skin and my skin is not so dry in the winter.</li>

            <li>Have been using this exact thing for quite some time.</li>
            <li>upset to have to give this only 2 starts, because I love this brand.  </li>
            <li>So on my most recent trip to Costco, I thought I would compromise and buy</li>
            <li>But no matter how many times I&#x27;ve used it (working on the second bottle now), it still smells like cleaning solution.</li>
            <li>No harsh perfumes (natural scents instead) and washes very clean with no residue.  </li>
            <li>always look for something that cleans and doesn&#x27;t leave much of its chemicals sitting on my skin.</li>
            <li>If you love the nostalgic smell of orange Creamsicle (the orange sherbet and vanilla ice cream combo on a stick or in a cup) then you&#x27;ll love this scent.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>

            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s the natural citrus?</li>
            <li>So far, SebaMed face and body cleanser worked well for me.</li>
            <li>I love that it is all natural, has a subtle citrus-y smell which I like.</li>
            <li>So next time I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be purchasing this particular body wash, but will keep an eye out to see if Costco decides to carry another non-citrus scented body wash.</li>

            <li> Not sure what&#x27;s in this body wash, but I&#x27;ve used it 3 times (twice on purpose but the third time was an accident - there was residue left on my loofah) and every time got itchy hives all over.</li>
            <li> Only takes a few minutes for there to be a reaction.  </li>

            <li> This is the only body wash I use. I&#x27;ve been using it for years. Super sudsy, no sticky or filmy coating or residue, just naturally fresh and clean. The double pack I buy has a pump though. Lovit!</li>
            <li> If you love the nostalgic smell of orange Creamsicle (the orange sherbet and vanilla ice cream combo on a stick or in a cup) then you&#x27;ll love this scent.  I was surprised by my sentimental emotion when the suds foamed up all around me - Whoa and talk about Lather! Just a small amount on a body sponge and you get a frothy mass of bubbles. How Wonderful.  My product was gifted to me and came with a pump dispenser.  I will Buy This For Sure. LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> Not sure what&#x27;s in this body wash, but I&#x27;ve used it 3 times (twice on purpose but the third time was an accident - there was residue left on my loofah) and every time got itchy hives all over. I&#x27;ve never had a reaction to any kind of body wash before, nor do I have have particularly sensitive skin or any known allergies, but there&#x27;s something in this formula that does not agree with my skin. I&#x27;ll be returning this to customer service.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this body wash since the first time I got it at Costco a couple years ago.. It&#x27;s my favorite ever. My skin is sensitive and my hands peel when I use regular soap so I use this body wash as hand soap.. and on body and even my face and hair. Smells great, foams well, doesn&#x27;t leave any residue, leaves me feeling clean. So happy that Amazon has it when I can&#x27;t make it to Costco.</li>
            <li> I love this product after using it you are clean and smelling great.</li>

            <li> BUYER BEWARE!&lt;br /&gt;Very upset to have to give this only 2 starts, because I love this brand.  I had no problem in the winter, but have been having very strong reactions to sun while using it this summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hate having to write this review, but here goes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the good:  I loved the scent,  and was glad to see it was natural,  and free of chemicals that we didn&#x27;t want to come in contact with. No slimy feeling,  but still hydrated the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad: ever since I started using this,  I have had horrible reactions to the sun, and my skin is normally far from sensitive.  Only takes a few minutes for there to be a reaction.  Took a while to figure out it was the culprit, but after a few minutes in the sun,  I have been breaking it into hives like I&#x27;ve never seen the likes of before.  Maybe it&#x27;s the natural citrus? Idk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My bf has NOT had a problem (why I have it 2 rather than 1 star), but think about it twice if you&#x27;re planning to be outdoors just the same.</li>
            <li> I love that the Kirkland Signature products are plant based.  I use the shampoo, conditioner and body lotion.  But for some reason, this body wash makes my skin itch like crazy.  No break outs or rashes, just annoying itchiness.  It&#x27;s too bad because I can use the other Kirkland Signature products with no problem.</li>
            <li> Cheaper at Costco.&lt;br /&gt;Product has good citrus smell.&lt;br /&gt;Works well on skin, but leaves oily-residue on skin, kind of irritating and gets worse when body produces its natural oil, which mixes with this residue already sitting on skin.&lt;br /&gt;My skin type: sensitive/somewhat oily.&lt;br /&gt;I always look for something that cleans and doesn&#x27;t leave much of its chemicals sitting on my skin. So far, SebaMed face and body cleanser worked well for me.</li>
            <li> I have dry sensative skin, this stuff is the best I have found for it and I have tried a lot of soaps.  I sometimes have acne outbreaks and rosacea every once in a while with other products but this one seems to calm my skin down and I get great results.  I couldn&#x27;t say enough good about it, I am extremely satisfied with this product.</li>

            <li> It feels so good on my skin and my skin is not so dry in the winter.</li>
            <li> I originally hesitated purchasing this body wash because I thought it smelled a bit like cleaning solution. But my husband was sick of using super girly body wash and, truthfully, I was sick of the oily feeling left behind by some other big name body washes. So on my most recent trip to Costco, I thought I would compromise and buy the not-too-girly scented Kirkland Signature Body Wash. It definitely is not oily, nor is it girly scented. But no matter how many times I&#x27;ve used it (working on the second bottle now), it still smells like cleaning solution. So next time I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be purchasing this particular body wash, but will keep an eye out to see if Costco decides to carry another non-citrus scented body wash.</li>
            <li> I never use bar soap, hate the sticky residue.  Also most bath wash&#x27;s have lot&#x27;s of perfumes and chemicals that can be irritants later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wash is great.  No harsh perfumes (natural scents instead) and washes very clean with no residue.  About the only wash I&#x27;ll use now.</li>
            <li> I love this soap! The scent is great, and it always leaves me feeling fresh and clean! I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I sent my husband to get a body wash. He came home with this from Costco. I liked the paraben free and sulfate free properties. I love Arbonne products which are also vegan as well. I put some of this on my hands and washed. Smells great, hands feel clean. Plant based like Arbonne, but way less expensive. More companies like Kirkland are jumping on the band wagon to make safer products, like this.</li>
            <li> This product contains two types of artificial dyes: RED 4 (CI 14700) and YELLOW 6 (CI 15985).</li>
            <li> This is a terrific body wash product.  I prefer it to any other &amp;#34;name&amp;#34; brands as it is rich but very cleansing, very softly scented (hardly has&lt;br /&gt;a scent at all), is a good hand as well as body wash, and it is gentle to my sensitive skin. The pricing is great and because it comes in a package of&lt;br /&gt;two, I don&#x27;t worry about having to be stingy with using it.  Love it.</li>
            <li> No soy in this product, so it&#x27;s perfect for people with soy allergies. And it smells great!</li>
