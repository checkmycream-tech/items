            <li>Product was in perfect condition and on time.</li>
            <li>Going to buy more of the shades!!!</li>
            <li>very good product .</li>
            <li>It gives great fullness and drama to my lashes without looking caked on.  </li>
            <li>and this mascara doesn&#x27;t bother me, stays on nicely, and hasn&#x27;t given me raccoon eyes which is great!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this mascara!!</li>
            <li>Good price for a Loreal product</li>
            <li>The mascara itself was fine - nothing great</li>
            <li>It feels like I have nothing on and looks amazing.  </li>
            <li>It also would have been nice</li>
            <li>The mascara goes on nicely</li>
            <li>And can say I liked it a lot.</li>
            <li>Adds volume and thickens lashes nicely.</li>
            <li>My eye brows are kind of blond and with my curly hair, they are unruly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been impressed with the quality, so much so, that I plan to buy more of this mascara when my tube has run out.</li>
            <li>I would have liked the illuminator to be more defined.  </li>
            <li>I would have liked it more if it was water- or smudge-proof.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m a loyal Maybelline Great Lash user and have never found anything I like better).  </li>
            <li>Still, when I get it just right, it&#x27;s a great effect.  </li>
            <li>My eyes looked great right away.</li>
            <li>Those two things aside, I still love this product, and I still use it.</li>
            <li>so I am always searching for the next greatest mascara.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this mascara.</li>
            <li>So many compliments I&#x27;ve had already.</li>
            <li>However, this mascara went on perfectly smooth with no clumps and stayed on all day with no smudging!</li>
            <li>Such a wonderful mascara!</li>
            <li>Guess I am more used to a longer thinner wand and the nature of this product</li>
            <li>and I find myself applying more than I need in an attempt to separate lashes.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I had to apply quite a bit of it to be able to notice any difference.  </li>
            <li>but I love the look of the bronze.</li>
            <li>Love, Love love this product.</li>
            <li>I love how it makes my hazel eyes stand out.  </li>
            <li>and it was okay too.</li>
            <li>I received this as a part of a Bzz Campaign and was very excited to try it - who doesn&#x27;t like some sparkle?  </li>
            <li>I have loved this mascara since L&#x27;Oreal first introduced it.  </li>
            <li>However, I am a coupon shopper and I would hope to use something so as not to pay full price!</li>
            <li>It went on easy</li>
            <li>It lasted about 6 hours before I removed it, and came off easily.</li>
            <li>The mascara went on easy, did not clump and had a pleasent smell to it.</li>
            <li>Fantastic i absolutely love the light shimmer it gives my lashes</li>
            <li>Its easy to apply and looks fab.</li>
            <li>it does not clump easily and the bursh is huge</li>
            <li>I like the mascara just fine.  </li>
            <li>Overall, great product</li>
            <li>I received this as a free sample from BzzAgent.com</li>
            <li>I received a free sample of this product as a buzz agent to offer my opinion of.</li>
            <li>I received this free sample as a Bzz Agent.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m not crazy about the top coat.</li>
            <li>, i just go lightly with the bronze color for day time.</li>
            <li>so Loreal will continue to make it available.  </li>
            <li>I received this mascara free as a Bzz Agent.  </li>
            <li>I received this product for free for being and bzzagent to try and review.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes were for sure much longer then most mascaras saying that they make them look longer.</li>
            <li>After receiving a free sample of this product through BzzAgent, I was excited to give it a try.</li>
            <li>Long, bold and beautiful lashes.</li>
            <li>First, let me just say, I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li>but since it usually can be found for under $8 and my eyes look awesome when I wear it I buy it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty picky :)</li>
            <li>Depending how much you apply, you can get saddle sparkles or more.</li>
            <li>I had people telling me that my makeup looked really good and asking what I had done different.  </li>
            <li>As a mother who never gets a full night of sleep, I was sold.  </li>
            <li>I did have several people comment about how good I looked when I used it</li>
            <li>I do see a bit of sparkle --this might be good for younger party girls, but since I&#x27;m in my 40s</li>
            <li>If you are looking for extra length alone, this would probably be a good choice.    </li>
            <li>OK I just don&#x27;t see much glitter when I try to use that side of the mascara.</li>
            <li>My first thought was that I love that the tub is larger then most, making it easy to hold.</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference when I used the \\&quot;illuminating topcoat\\&quot;, but that quickly changed.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definatlly worth the price.</li>
            <li>For work, I use it without the golden coat.</li>
            <li>I have used golden coat once</li>
            <li>The result is good - I finally get decent separation with tons of volume.</li>
            <li>It really makes them look full.</li>
            <li>I feel it&#x27;s a strong 3 star product, and maybe more if you&#x27;re looking for extreme length.</li>
            <li>I like this very much.</li>
            <li>very fast delivery .</li>
            <li>I think the L&#x27;Oreal Double Extend did a great job of making my lashes look SUPER long, but it didn&#x27;t do much to volumize them.</li>
            <li>The only brand of mascara I will purchase anymore and love the sparkles for hazel eyes</li>
            <li>Overall, I am pleased with the product and would buy it again.  </li>
            <li>the top coat, as a result, flakes off earlier than I like.</li>
            <li>I stopped using it, but LOVE using the regular mascara.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally bother to write product reviews, but felt this one was worthy.  </li>
            <li>However, by the time I apply the illuminating top coat the lashes are pretty dry and</li>
            <li>and there, it actually works fine.</li>
            <li>It really makes my lashes look so much longer than they are.  </li>
            <li>I was even told that I looked very rested.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>It works much better if you do it when the bottom coat is still wet</li>
            <li>this doesn&#x27;t really suit my lifestyle.</li>
            <li>I will say that the part on the brown side, that is the \\&quot;Illuminator\\&quot; side that you put on after the mascara, did not do that much for me.</li>
            <li>It did seem to smudge more that other mascaras I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>I use other L&#x27;Oreal mascaras and love them.</li>
            <li>the bronze side does have a slight sparkle to it, but it really isn&#x27;t noticed at all, so if you were wanting just sparkle, then you probably can find another product that would sparkle more.</li>
            <li>This burned my eyes and the golden color barely shows up on top of the black.</li>
            <li>I do not get the same result with this mascara every time, but I figured out it&#x27;s because it dries really quickly.  </li>
            <li>I was pretty skeptical, because I have a mascara brand that I&#x27;ve been pretty loyal to for years, and many others that I&#x27;ve tried clump and smudge.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes, especially around allergy season, and they stayed comfortable while I was wearing it.    </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t like the shiny and brown part of the Mascara (which is the main reason of the product).</li>
            <li>I used the black color with grey illuminator before, and this one is as good.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this mascara.</li>
            <li>Decent mascara, interesting gold color on other end, can get thick but good enough to use</li>
            <li>Normally by about 4 pm</li>
            <li>The highlighter brush is round, which is interesting, but if you are just using it to add some sparkle here</li>
            <li>Though it was really fun to try, I would probably not purchase this mascara again, just because I prefer extra volume.</li>
            <li>I love the bronze illuminator it makes my green eyes sparkle</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still not too sure about the \\&quot;illuminating\\&quot; part of the mascara, I&#x27;m not sure if I would wear it for everyday use, but I think it might be fun for a special occasion or date night.</li>
            <li>It can be hard to see unless you look closely, or if the light hits your lashes just right.    </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes</li>
            <li>I usually only use two coats max of mascara - prefer a natural to classic look.</li>
            <li>My lashes are naturally pretty long, so I generally prefer a volumizing mascara formula.</li>
            <li>Overall I highly recommend this mascara.  </li>
            <li>I am not sure as price wise how well this product compares to other products, but it would be worth a little extra money.</li>
            <li>And it really did make my lashes look much longer, which is something my usual mascara doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>The illuminator was was kind of useless in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>I buy it for the bronze and use it over different formula black mascara, right now I&#x27;m using the L&#x27;Oreal Telescopic</li>
            <li>Basically, the top coat make eyes sparkle because the lashes do in a very subtle way.    </li>
            <li>not long after I got this product, and let&#x27;s just it didn&#x27;t pass the test.    </li>

            <li> My lashes are naturally pretty long, so I generally prefer a volumizing mascara formula.</li>
            <li> Overall I highly recommend this mascara.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure as price wise how well this product compares to other products, but it would be worth a little extra money.</li>
            <li> And it really did make my lashes look much longer, which is something my usual mascara doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> The illuminator was was kind of useless in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> I buy it for the bronze and use it over different formula black mascara, right now I&#x27;m using the L&#x27;Oreal Telescopic</li>

            <li> not long after I got this product, and let&#x27;s just it didn&#x27;t pass the test.    </li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I let the mascara coat dry before adding the illuminator and noticed the little sparkles flaked off.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a mascara that does that for such a long time, and just never found it..</li>
            <li> I tried using it a few times, but found that it seemed to just leave little clumps of a golden color on my lashes.</li>
            <li> If I apply it really fast, I can have lush, long lashes coated in black, but if I take a little too long, they dry and what I end up with is clumpy and spider-leg-looking lashes.  </li>
            <li> My lashes are already long and thick, but it makes them appear soooo much longer.  </li>
            <li> Receiving this from BzzAgent, I was anxious to try it because I was looking for a new mascara anyway.  </li>
            <li> The L&#x27;Oreal double Extend Eye Illuminator is a neat mascara in that it has a mascara end, and the other is a bulbous end that is infused with light-reflecting pearls which are meant to enhance eye color.  </li>
            <li> Also, I have to do one eye at a time because I have to apply the topcoat before it&#x27;s completely dry, or it will make it look clumpier.  </li>
            <li> But I think the effect is so subtle that it doesn&#x27;t really achieve this.</li>
            <li> I only use half of</li>

            <li> and it&#x27;s subtle enough to wear even during the day.</li>
            <li> I have to say, using the mascara was a little odd for me.  </li>

            <li> Product was in perfect condition and on time. No complaints at all! I used the black color with grey illuminator before, and this one is as good. Depending how much you apply, you can get saddle sparkles or more. Overall, great product</li>
            <li> I received this product from BzzAgent.    First, let me just say, I love this mascara.  It really makes my lashes look so much longer than they are.  I&#x27;ve been looking for a mascara that does that for such a long time, and just never found it..Until now.  I didn&#x27;t notice flaking.  I did notice the glitter in the illuminator would fall off.    The things I didn&#x27;t like?  I would have liked the illuminator to be more defined.  It also would have been nice had it been waterproof.  I had to attend a funeral not long after I got this product, and let&#x27;s just it didn&#x27;t pass the test.    Those two things aside, I still love this product, and I still use it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this mascara!! It gives great fullness and drama to my lashes without looking caked on.  It doesn&#x27;t clump and lasts all day.  Normally by about 4 pm my mascara becomes heavy feeling and a little itchy.  I have very sensitive eyes so I am always searching for the next greatest mascara.  This is it.  It feels like I have nothing on and looks amazing.  At first I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference when I used the \\&quot;illuminating topcoat\\&quot;, but that quickly changed.  I had people telling me that my makeup looked really good and asking what I had done different.  I was even told that I looked very rested. As a mother who never gets a full night of sleep, I was sold.  Overall I highly recommend this mascara.  *I received this as a free sample from BzzAgent.com</li>
            <li> Receiving this from BzzAgent, I was anxious to try it because I was looking for a new mascara anyway.  The L&#x27;Oreal double Extend Eye Illuminator is a neat mascara in that it has a mascara end, and the other is a bulbous end that is infused with light-reflecting pearls which are meant to enhance eye color.  Basically, the top coat make eyes sparkle because the lashes do in a very subtle way.    I do not get the same result with this mascara every time, but I figured out it&#x27;s because it dries really quickly.  If I apply it really fast, I can have lush, long lashes coated in black, but if I take a little too long, they dry and what I end up with is clumpy and spider-leg-looking lashes.  Also, I have to do one eye at a time because I have to apply the topcoat before it&#x27;s completely dry, or it will make it look clumpier.  Still, when I get it just right, it&#x27;s a great effect.  My lashes are already long and thick, but it makes them appear soooo much longer.  I can&#x27;t wear eyeglasses with the mascara, to put it like that, because my lashes constantly brushing the lenses annoys me.    It&#x27;s also one of those types that will last all day and won&#x27;t run or flake off.  I&#x27;ve been impressed with the quality, so much so, that I plan to buy more of this mascara when my tube has run out.</li>
            <li> I received this as a part of a Bzz Campaign and was very excited to try it - who doesn&#x27;t like some sparkle?  The mascara itself was fine - nothing great (I&#x27;m a loyal Maybelline Great Lash user and have never found anything I like better).  It did seem to smudge more that other mascaras I&#x27;ve used.  The real disappointment was the second step - the sparkle application.  I kept putting the wand back in because I wasn&#x27;t seeing any difference or any sparkle making it to my lashes.  I would not consider this $10 mascara.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mascara. Long, bold and beautiful lashes. Then come the \\&quot;sparkles\\&quot; that compliment your eye color. So many compliments I&#x27;ve had already.</li>
            <li> After receiving a free sample of this product through BzzAgent, I was excited to give it a try. I was pretty skeptical, because I have a mascara brand that I&#x27;ve been pretty loyal to for years, and many others that I&#x27;ve tried clump and smudge. However, this mascara went on perfectly smooth with no clumps and stayed on all day with no smudging! And it really did make my lashes look much longer, which is something my usual mascara doesn&#x27;t. I&#x27;m still not too sure about the \\&quot;illuminating\\&quot; part of the mascara, I&#x27;m not sure if I would wear it for everyday use, but I think it might be fun for a special occasion or date night.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this mascara. it does not clump easily and the bursh is huge so you don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re going to poke yourself in the eye or miss one eyelash. the sparkles that you can apply sometimes don&#x27;t show up as well as one would hope but it does add a wet look to your lashes which on me worked. The colors for each eye do make your eyes pop. Give it a shot and if you don&#x27;t like the sparkles you can just rock the mascara!</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this product as a buzz agent to offer my opinion of. I have used it a few times and I really like it. It makes my lashes thick and provides definition. My husband thought it gave me \\&quot;bedroom eyes\\&quot;, which he has never commented before. The mascara doesn&#x27;t clump and applies evenly. The highlighter brush is round, which is interesting, but if you are just using it to add some sparkle here and there, it actually works fine. I would continue to use this product and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Such a wonderful mascara! It really makes them look full. The only brand of mascara I will purchase anymore and love the sparkles for hazel eyes</li>
            <li> I too received this product as a Bzz Agent.  I have to say, using the mascara was a little odd for me.  Guess I am more used to a longer thinner wand and the nature of this product means it&#x27;s shorter and the wand is thicker (I have been using a Rimmel product).  The mascara goes on nicely and I like how my lashes look.  The first time I used it, I let the mascara coat dry before adding the illuminator and noticed the little sparkles flaked off.  It works much better if you do it when the bottom coat is still wet so it adheres.  I did have several people comment about how good I looked when I used it - did I get my hair cut, etc. - and that was the only change.  Overall, I am pleased with the product and would buy it again.  However, I am a coupon shopper and I would hope to use something so as not to pay full price!</li>
            <li> I was given this thru bzzagent to try. And can say I liked it a lot. It went on easy, it did not clump up it did not smudge or run either thru out the day. I am not sure as price wise how well this product compares to other products, but it would be worth a little extra money.</li>
            <li> I received this free sample as a Bzz Agent. I do like the black mascara. Adds volume and thickens lashes nicely. However, I&#x27;m not crazy about the top coat. It seems to flake with me. I usually only use two coats max of mascara - prefer a natural to classic look. However with this mascara tends to clump a bit and I find myself applying more than I need in an attempt to separate lashes. The result is good - I finally get decent separation with tons of volume. However, by the time I apply the illuminating top coat the lashes are pretty dry and the top coat, as a result, flakes off earlier than I like. I do see a bit of sparkle --this might be good for younger party girls, but since I&#x27;m in my 40s this doesn&#x27;t really suit my lifestyle. I&#x27;ll skip this in the future.</li>
            <li> I received this product as part of the Bzz Agent program. My lashes are naturally pretty long, so I generally prefer a volumizing mascara formula. I think the L&#x27;Oreal Double Extend did a great job of making my lashes look SUPER long, but it didn&#x27;t do much to volumize them. I did experience a bit of clumping, but no flaking. It lasted about 6 hours before I removed it, and came off easily. If you are looking for extra length alone, this would probably be a good choice.    The illuminator end was a bit underwhelming. The package claims the hint of light-reflecting pearls will enhance your eye shade. But I think the effect is so subtle that it doesn&#x27;t really achieve this. It can be hard to see unless you look closely, or if the light hits your lashes just right.    A plus to this mascara is that it did not irritate my eyes. I have sensitive eyes, especially around allergy season, and they stayed comfortable while I was wearing it.    Though it was really fun to try, I would probably not purchase this mascara again, just because I prefer extra volume. I feel it&#x27;s a strong 3 star product, and maybe more if you&#x27;re looking for extreme length.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes and this mascara doesn&#x27;t bother me, stays on nicely, and hasn&#x27;t given me raccoon eyes which is great! I&#x27;m not a young chicken and need a mascara that thickens my eye lashes.  I think this does the trick and the gold spec part brings out my green eyes even though I can&#x27;t see the gold part when I apply it, but my eyes do seem to pop.  It also makes my lashes look longer too. It seems like you&#x27;re getting less product though.  The reservoirs on both sides look small.</li>
            <li> I like this very much. I find that black or even black/brown mascaras look too stark with my strawberry blond hair. It is really hard to find a mascara that doesn&#x27;t look too fake. I use both sides on my eyes and the bronze side on my eye brows to comb and color them. My eye brows are kind of blond and with my curly hair, they are unruly. If you need to make your eye brows thicker without getting weird looking or you like to make the eye brows more shapely without over plucking, this is for you. PS. the bronze side does have a slight sparkle to it, but it really isn&#x27;t noticed at all, so if you were wanting just sparkle, then you probably can find another product that would sparkle more.</li>
            <li> This burned my eyes and the golden color barely shows up on top of the black. Only used it once and threw it out.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.  I&#x27;ve tried lots of mascaras over the years, none have every thickened and lengthed my lashes like this one does.  It stays on well, doesn&#x27;t run.  i wear it every day, i just go lightly with the bronze color for day time. I don&#x27;t normally bother to write product reviews, but felt this one was worthy.  And I want to encourage other to buy it so Loreal will continue to make it available.  :)</li>
            <li> I received this mascara free as a Bzz Agent.  I like the mascara just fine.  It went on my lashes without looking clumpy, and my lashes did look thicker and a bit longer.  I would have liked it more if it was water- or smudge-proof.  The illuminator was was kind of useless in my opinion.  I had to apply quite a bit of it to be able to notice any difference.  It became a little annoying because I kept seeing the light reflecting off of the illuminator in my line of vision throughout the day.  I will continue using the mascara part, but will skip the illuminator step from now on.  I would not buy this product again, especially at the $10 sale price.</li>
            <li> I received this product for free for being and bzzagent to try and review. My first thought was that I love that the tub is larger then most, making it easy to hold. The mascara went on easy, did not clump and had a pleasent smell to it. My eyelashes were for sure much longer then most mascaras saying that they make them look longer. My eyes looked great right away. I will say that the part on the brown side, that is the \\&quot;Illuminator\\&quot; side that you put on after the mascara, did not do that much for me. I tried using it a few times, but found that it seemed to just leave little clumps of a golden color on my lashes. I stopped using it, but LOVE using the regular mascara. I&#x27;ve had a few compliments on it already about how long my lashes look. It&#x27;s definatlly worth the price.</li>
            <li> I love the bronze illuminator it makes my green eyes sparkle and it&#x27;s subtle enough to wear even during the day. Unfortunately the black mascara runs so I can&#x27;t use it. I buy it for the bronze and use it over different formula black mascara, right now I&#x27;m using the L&#x27;Oreal Telescopic and it&#x27;s great. I hate paying for mascara I only use half of but I love the look of the bronze. I use other L&#x27;Oreal mascaras and love them. I don&#x27;t know why this black formula is such a dud but since it usually can be found for under $8 and my eyes look awesome when I wear it I buy it.</li>
            <li> Decent mascara, interesting gold color on other end, can get thick but good enough to use and I&#x27;m pretty picky :)</li>
            <li> Love, Love love this product. I get so many compliments when I wear it casually and dress up!!!  Going to buy more of the shades!!!</li>
            <li> Fantastic i absolutely love the light shimmer it gives my lashes i put enough to wear it looks deliberate and not like fall out from eyeshadow!! i ordered every color hooked i dont wear lashes as this does it for me</li>
            <li> This product works OK I just don&#x27;t see much glitter when I try to use that side of the mascara.</li>
            <li> Good price for a Loreal product but I don&#x27;t like the shiny and brown part of the Mascara (which is the main reason of the product). It is suppose for green eyes and I have green eyes but the results are not as I expected.</li>
            <li> I have loved this mascara since L&#x27;Oreal first introduced it.  I love how it makes my hazel eyes stand out.  I get compliments every time I wear it and people have stopped me just to look at my eyes.</li>
            <li> For work, I use it without the golden coat. Its easy to apply and looks fab. I have used golden coat once and it was okay too.</li>
            <li> very good product . very fast delivery . thank you</li>
