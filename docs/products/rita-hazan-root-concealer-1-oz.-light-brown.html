            <li>Best gray coverage out there.  </li>
            <li>AMAZING product to stretch the time between touch ups!!  </li>
            <li>Still, it goes on and stays on great until I get to the salon for a touch up.</li>
            <li>Great stuff.  </li>
            <li>This root concealer does a great job</li>
            <li>I bought this product 3 days ago, thinking it would be great for in between salon visits.  </li>
            <li>This is the best product of its kind.</li>
            <li>Love this product!!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind paying for a good product (do it all the time).  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s how good</li>
            <li>I just ordered 2 more cans, I never want to run out of this great product.</li>
            <li>Ok this does a great job of covering the gray roots.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care how good this works - and it&#x27;s just OK, nothing miraculous here.  </li>
            <li>It is kind of medium length.</li>
            <li>Great for that quick cover-up.</li>
            <li>there is some kind of volatile chemical or alcohol that changes the texture of your hair, so use sparingly, or better yet, not at all.  </li>
            <li>Love this product and I continue to use and recommend to all my family and friends.</li>
            <li>So glad I saw this product on the Today Show/Hoda and Kathie Lee Show.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>however I think for the price I should get more than 1 oz.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s got to be a better way.</li>
            <li>You can ask for more words once but not continualy.</li>
            <li>But for now this will work until I find something better .</li>
            <li>but better than going out with &amp;#34;roots&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li>I used this product a year or so ago and loved it - the answer to my problem of that stubborn, fast growing gray in the front of my hair.......</li>
            <li>It is available at Sephora</li>
            <li>These should have been given as free samples.  </li>
            <li>This root concealer really covers the gray well and blends in nicely.  </li>
            <li>I tried it on the first day and wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the consistency, but my hair wasn&#x27;t freshly washed, so I thought it might have been me.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price!</li>
            <li>, It DOES get on your fingers if you touch or itch your head where you sprayed it, washes out easily (wouldn&#x27;t be fun getting caught in the rain, I imagine?</li>
            <li>The can looked full size in the picture.  </li>
            <li>I would like  to find a larger size spray root concealer at a fair price.</li>
            <li>I thoroughly wash my hair, and it doesn&#x27;t totally wash out, which is a good thing.</li>
            <li>color which is cool, too).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah</li>
            <li>I will use the product for quick touch ups on special occasions but it is definately not something I could use every day.</li>
            <li>matching eye shadow will do the job in just as quick a time.  </li>
            <li>READ REVIEWS FIRST!</li>
            <li>I is well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>but it is totally worth it.  </li>
            <li>And the description (&#x27;what you get&#x27; part that Amazon usually goes a great job with), NEVER SAYS it&#x27;s a sample size.  </li>
            <li>If I have to buy more, due to the container being empty before I get home off of this travel assignment, I won&#x27;t be happy, and will buy something else for this purpose.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Buyers - be aware you are spending $30 for a SAMPLE SIZE and the spray is &#x27;OK\\&quot;,</li>
            <li>I noticed a lot of the makeup was a lot higher than buying the products in the stores.  </li>
            <li>First, the color rubs off.  </li>
            <li>they should be more specific about their hair color...</li>
            <li>Works pretty well .</li>
            <li>I love the chance to go longer between salon visits but still not have grey roots!  </li>
            <li>Covers my gray hair quickly and looks natural.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, dries instantly and doesn&#x27;t rub off!</li>
            <li>I get professional color dark blonde/bronde - and the match is just fair.  </li>
            <li>The bottle felt really light when it arrived and upon seeing the same item &amp; lifting it up in a store, the one in the store was much heavier.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other brands but nothing works better than this product.</li>
            <li>My hair grows fast and Rita Hazan root concealer provides quick and efficient coverage of my gray the week prior to my hair appointment.</li>
            <li>The directional tube delivers too much product (yes, I watched the video) and the color is far too intense....</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The small size really turns me off, and though I like the product, the size of the container might prevent me from buying more.</li>
            <li>It certainly wasn&#x27;t light brown; it was almost black...</li>
            <li>or that reason I am going to try some new copycat brands.</li>
            <li>I have found other concealers that are just as good for half the price,.</li>
            <li>I was told that the light brown would cover my dark brown hair and it does.  </li>
            <li>Probably too dark for truly light brown hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, assuming everything else is manageable for you and you still plan to buy this product - be warned, the color that I bought is way too dark to be called \\&quot;Light</li>
            <li>This little teeny nozzle lets you just spray on where you want a highlight or for me, more likely cover up a renegade spot of gray (depends on what color you get, they have a &amp;#34;highlights&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t beleive I paid so much for a tiny sample size.  </li>
            <li>My hair grows incredibly fast and the front roots are white.</li>
            <li>I have them colored professionally every four weeks.  </li>
            <li>They all look natural.</li>
            <li>This product is good but too expensive.</li>
            <li>was more subtle before.  </li>
            <li>How many hair washes will this small container last?</li>
            <li>I can use dark brown, light brown and red.</li>
            <li>The light brown is too dark, but atleast it thoroughly covers my grey.</li>
            <li>The sprayer has a little nozzle so that you can direct right where you need it to cover.</li>
            <li>Two major, deal-breaking problems with this--</li>
            <li>I have alot of grey, but my natural color was brown, and I have chunky blonde highlights.</li>
            <li>It covers, but it&#x27;s hard to direct to roots without wasting a lot, and coloring the scalp, which looked a little bizarre, especially around the hairline.  </li>

            <li> It covers, but it&#x27;s hard to direct to roots without wasting a lot, and coloring the scalp, which looked a little bizarre, especially around the hairline.  </li>
            <li> I used it only five times and it was empty.</li>
            <li> but it arrived almost empty and only lasted a couple of uses.</li>
            <li> I only spray it on the part, and also I spray it sometimes on the other roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seems to last longer than other products that I have tried.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry - a little pricey but will lt a long time  - well worth the $$!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have SEEN the size is a SINGLE OUNCE.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised at how small it is</li>
            <li> You only need a little bit if you style your hair then cover the exposed roots.</li>
            <li> /&gt;PS - I bought the blonde since other reviews on Sephora.com said the brown was VERY DARK.  </li>
            <li> I have passed on this information to other friends.</li>
            <li> Second, the texture is dull and drying, even after washing out.  </li>
            <li> I ordered Rita Hazan&#x27;s Root Concealer in Dark Brown/Black about a month ago</li>
            <li> Also, no matter what you do, it coats your scalp and makes it unnaturally dark.  </li>
            <li> if you touch your head, you come away with stained dark finger tips and nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am traveling for a month and a half, from place to place.</li>
            <li> issue is (2 stars or less), the size of the container.</li>
            <li> My hair color is dark brown and when I sprayed it on my roots where covered immediately!</li>
            <li> The application is also a little uncontrolled.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ridiculously expensive and the bottle does not last very long</li>
            <li> Only complaint is it leaves my hair sticky and icky.</li>
            <li> but it was too much trouble to return it.</li>
            <li> stuff is VERY difficult to get along your hairline - exactly where you&#x27;d expect to want to touch up your color.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s not easy</li>
            <li> I usually buy it at sephora.</li>
            <li> It covers the grey but makes my hair feel dirty - it never really dries.  </li>
            <li> Used it this morning on freshly washed (and dried) hair and my roots are soooo greasy - disgusting!  </li>
            <li> BEWARE OF FALSE ADVERTISING.  </li>
            <li> The treated area feels a little sticky but doesn&#x27;t look bad.  </li>
            <li> Even after washing, my roots remained dry and hard, which is a terrible way to set your roots up between chemical colorings.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s too expensive, but I will continue to buy it, because it works.</li>
            <li> And forget ever carelessly scratching an itch, unless you want a chimney sweep&#x27;s manicure.  </li>
            <li> This works well, just to expensive.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser was appalled by the stuff.  </li>
            <li> However I do find this review process extrememly annoying.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this product and I continue to use and recommend to all my family and friends. When I appy this product it makes my hair look fuller.</li>
            <li> I love Rita Hazan root concealer, however when I received the product it was another brand and wrong shade.  The store has refunded both my cost of product and the postage and also sending me a postage label to return the product.  They apologized for the  mishap, but I see it is still listed as the name brand product which they do not carry.  If you can find the Rita Hazan product it works very well to temporarily cover gray roots.  It is available at Sephora</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t beleive I paid so much for a tiny sample size.  These should have been given as free samples.  I wish I read the reveiws before my purchase.  The can looked full size in the picture.  BEWARE OF FALSE ADVERTISING.  READ REVIEWS FIRST!</li>
            <li> Covers my gray hair quickly and looks natural.  I was told that the light brown would cover my dark brown hair and it does.  Probably too dark for truly light brown hair.  Definately a time saver between colors.</li>
            <li> I ordered Rita Hazan&#x27;s Root Concealer in Dark Brown/Black about a month ago and I just tried it because my gray roots are starting to show. My hair color is dark brown and when I sprayed it on my roots where covered immediately! Now I don&#x27;t have to color my hair as often. The sprayer has a little nozzle so that you can direct right where you need it to cover. So glad I saw this product on the Today Show/Hoda and Kathie Lee Show. I is well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I should have looked closer at the image for then I&#x27;d have SEEN the size is a SINGLE OUNCE.  I don&#x27;t care how good this works - and it&#x27;s just OK, nothing miraculous here.  It&#x27;s a RIP OFF for Thirty dollars for a sample size of tinted hair spray?????  I could get this at the costume shop - and I should have, for I would have then paid two dollars.  In this case - YOU DON&#x27;T GET what you&#x27;ve PAID FOR. Ms. Hazan must have graduated from the Madoff School of Business.  CAVEAT EMPTOR.  And the description (&#x27;what you get&#x27; part that Amazon usually goes a great job with), NEVER SAYS it&#x27;s a sample size.  I don&#x27;t mind paying for a good product (do it all the time).  But I DO MIND GETTING TAKEN to the CLEANERS which is what Sephora does here via Amazon with this marginal product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buyers - be aware you are spending $30 for a SAMPLE SIZE and the spray is &#x27;OK\\&quot;, nothing your avg. matching eye shadow will do the job in just as quick a time.  RIP OFF EXTRAORDINAIRE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS - I bought the blonde since other reviews on Sephora.com said the brown was VERY DARK.  I get professional color dark blonde/bronde - and the match is just fair.  Never again Ms. Hazan.</li>
            <li> This product is good but too expensive. I used it only five times and it was empty. I felt ripped off!! I would like  to find a larger size spray root concealer at a fair price.</li>
            <li> I think this works okay but it arrived almost empty and only lasted a couple of uses. The bottle felt really light when it arrived and upon seeing the same item &amp; lifting it up in a store, the one in the store was much heavier. I don&#x27;t know what happened but it was too much trouble to return it. I have since found one I really like from Bumble &amp; Bumble.</li>
            <li> My hair grows incredibly fast and the front roots are white. I have them colored professionally every four weeks.  By two weeks in, I begin to use this root concealer.  It&#x27;s amazing.  I could probably even extend my roots being done by two weeks.</li>
            <li> Perfect for that week before my roots are done.  I&#x27;ve tried other brands but nothing works better than this product. I just ordered 2 more cans, I never want to run out of this great product.</li>
            <li> I give this product 5 stars for quality however I think for the price I should get more than 1 oz. Still, it goes on and stays on great until I get to the salon for a touch up.</li>
            <li> AMAZING product to stretch the time between touch ups!!  It actually does what it promotes!!  You won&#x27;t be sorry - a little pricey but will lt a long time  - well worth the $$!!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!!!  I&#x27;ve tried mascara&#x27;s, etc. to hide those grays until I can get to the salon.  I&#x27;ve tried it all.  This is the only product that has worked.  I must say it&#x27;s a bit pricey for the size.  I was surprised at how small it is but it is totally worth it.  I now, no longer have to run to the salon when I start to see the grays.  This covers them up so well.  I just wish they would make a bigger can.  And the best thing is, it&#x27;s waterproof.  It only comes out when you shampoo it out.  Great stuff.  I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I am traveling for a month and a half, from place to place. No time to make arrangements to get my hair colored. I went into Sephora&#x27;s, expecting my Blandi pen, which I didn&#x27;t care for, but it&#x27;s what they had. I have alot of grey, but my natural color was brown, and I have chunky blonde highlights. I keep my hair colored and maintained. It is kind of medium length. The lady at Sephora&#x27;s sold me this  spray product. I love it. It covers very well. It is a focused sprayer, so therefore doesn&#x27;t tend to spray everything brown. The light brown is too dark, but atleast it thoroughly covers my grey. Infact, I was thinking about growing my hair out, and using this product until it grows out, then going and getting it colored. That&#x27;s how good a product it is. I thoroughly wash my hair, and it doesn&#x27;t totally wash out, which is a good thing. The hotel sheets are white, and there&#x27;s no rub off. I only spray it on the part, and also I spray it sometimes on the other roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My issue is (2 stars or less), the size of the container. Is Ms. Hazen intending to only sell a sample size of this? How many hair washes will this small container last? If I have to buy more, due to the container being empty before I get home off of this travel assignment, I won&#x27;t be happy, and will buy something else for this purpose. The small size really turns me off, and though I like the product, the size of the container might prevent me from buying more. Ms. Hazen needs to consider creating a larger bottle of this, with the same price.</li>
            <li> What a rip off when I purchased a can of Rita Hazon for $20.00.  It was a one ounce instead of two ounces. for 25.00.  I&#x27;m thinking of stopping my purchases at Amazon.  This is fraud.  I noticed a lot of the makeup was a lot higher than buying the products in the stores.  Very deceiving.  Thinking about quitting Amazon.</li>
            <li> This root concealer does a great job but it is overpriced. I have found other concealers that are just as good for half the price,.</li>
            <li> I bought this product 3 days ago, thinking it would be great for in between salon visits.  I tried it on the first day and wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the consistency, but my hair wasn&#x27;t freshly washed, so I thought it might have been me.  Used it this morning on freshly washed (and dried) hair and my roots are soooo greasy - disgusting!  I will be returning this product.  Yuck</li>
            <li> I used this product a year or so ago and loved it - the answer to my problem of that stubborn, fast growing gray in the front of my hair.......that purchase was a gift from my daughter.  I decided to order again but the product is not the same.  The directional tube delivers too much product (yes, I watched the video) and the color is far too intense....I use the brown and I know it was was more subtle before.  I think something is very different with the formula now.  I don&#x27;t know if I will try it again or not.</li>
            <li> Best gray coverage out there.  I usually buy it at sephora.</li>
            <li> I saw this advertised on one of the morning shows and thought I would give it a try. Definitely worth the price! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it two stars rather than one because, in a pinch, you can use it to cover your roots.  But it&#x27;s not easy and it&#x27;s not pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is VERY difficult to get along your hairline - exactly where you&#x27;d expect to want to touch up your color.  The spray is not focused enough to avoid spraying it outside the hairline while still getting the roots.  The ears are especially likely to get coated.  Also, no matter what you do, it coats your scalp and makes it unnaturally dark.  Assuming you do get it where you want it, it still makes your scalp feel gross and (as another reviewer points out) if you touch your head, you come away with stained dark finger tips and nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, assuming everything else is manageable for you and you still plan to buy this product - be warned, the color that I bought is way too dark to be called \\&quot;Light brown,\\&quot; so if you do buy it, I recommend going lighter rather than darker.</li>
            <li> I use this to stretch the time between colorings. You only need a little bit if you style your hair then cover the exposed roots. I think it&#x27;s too expensive, but I will continue to buy it, because it works. My hair color is medium reddish brown. I can use dark brown, light brown and red. They all look natural.</li>
            <li> Two major, deal-breaking problems with this-- First, the color rubs off.  Every time i run my fingers through my hair, my nails look like a coal miner&#x27;s.  This is well after letting it \\&quot;dry\\&quot;.  And forget ever carelessly scratching an itch, unless you want a chimney sweep&#x27;s manicure.  Second, the texture is dull and drying, even after washing out.  there is some kind of volatile chemical or alcohol that changes the texture of your hair, so use sparingly, or better yet, not at all.  My hair dresser was appalled by the stuff.  Even after washing, my roots remained dry and hard, which is a terrible way to set your roots up between chemical colorings.  The application is also a little uncontrolled.  It covers, but it&#x27;s hard to direct to roots without wasting a lot, and coloring the scalp, which looked a little bizarre, especially around the hairline.  I was trying to be stingy because of the drying crunch it imparts to my hair, and the spray painted scalp issue, but never succeeded.  I never gave it a second chance.  It was unworkable for me.  There&#x27;s got to be a better way.</li>
            <li> Only 3 stars for this product.  It covers the grey but makes my hair feel dirty - it never really dries.  The treated area feels a little sticky but doesn&#x27;t look bad.  I will use the product for quick touch ups on special occasions but it is definately not something I could use every day.</li>
            <li> This is the best product of its kind. However I do find this review process extrememly annoying. You can ask for more words once but not continualy.</li>
            <li> Ok this does a great job of covering the gray roots. Only complaint is it leaves my hair sticky and icky.</li>
            <li> this product looked like shoe polish... It certainly wasn&#x27;t light brown; it was almost black... they should be more specific about their hair color...</li>
            <li> Love this product!! It conceals my regrowth until I can get to my hairdresser. I have passed on this information to other friends. Great for that quick cover-up. Not sticky and does the trick! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> My hair grows fast and Rita Hazan root concealer provides quick and efficient coverage of my gray the week prior to my hair appointment.</li>
            <li> I love the chance to go longer between salon visits but still not have grey roots!  It&#x27;s easy to use, dries instantly and doesn&#x27;t rub off!</li>
            <li> This works well, just to expensive.</li>
            <li> This root concealer really covers the gray well and blends in nicely.  It seems to last longer than other products that I have tried.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well . Could be improved on . But for now this will work until I find something better .</li>
            <li> I had used B&amp;B but the spray nozzle was big and went everywhere, and got all over everything. This little teeny nozzle lets you just spray on where you want a highlight or for me, more likely cover up a renegade spot of gray (depends on what color you get, they have a &amp;#34;highlights&amp;#34; color which is cool, too).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, It DOES get on your fingers if you touch or itch your head where you sprayed it, washes out easily (wouldn&#x27;t be fun getting caught in the rain, I imagine? but better than going out with &amp;#34;roots&amp;#34;...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-2 stars for the price.  It&#x27;s ridiculously expensive and the bottle does not last very long (I guess the rationale is that you&#x27;re saving $$ lessening your salon coloring costs? by faking it for awhile in between each time?) or that reason I am going to try some new copycat brands.</li>
