            <li> I use the Wonder 8 oil on my skin after a shower and although I have not used it long enough to give an expert&#x27;s opinion, I like it so far.    It was recommended to me by a friend who said it has stopped her itching from allergies.   In time I hope to use it for some of the other recommended uses.</li>
