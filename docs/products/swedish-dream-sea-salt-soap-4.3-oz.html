            <li>The smell is amazing</li>
            <li>I had never purchased this kind of soap before.</li>
            <li>Some that I&#x27;ve seen are just scented (and that&#x27;s what I was honestly expecting -</li>
            <li>This is good soap for many purposes.</li>
            <li>I liked washing with it, and the salt crystals had a nice loofah-like feel.</li>
            <li>My wife keeps it in a dish and uses it just for the nice sent.</li>
            <li>The salt embedded within the soap provides an exfoliating effect, which is nice.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is pricey though, but it also comes in a cute package that looks good as a decoration in your bathroom.</li>
            <li>The smell is great, the lather is great, the sea salt grit felt great --- but my dried up skin post shower did not feel great.  </li>
            <li>The salt crystals in the soap are OK, though I don&#x27;t know how much good they do.</li>
            <li>The scent is so refreshing and clean and yes --- reminds you of happy summer days seaside.  </li>
            <li>liked it much better as just a body soap.</li>
            <li>The anchor was a nice touch for my sailor:)</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t seem to do any more for my skin than a nice shea-butter soap.</li>
            <li>I would say that it isn&#x27;t best for sensitive skin, but it is still one of my favorite scents.</li>
            <li>There is nothing unique about this soap that makes it especially great for shaving, as good as regular bar or liquid</li>
            <li>If this was just pure soap with sea salt added in, it would&#x27;ve been great...</li>
            <li>my boyfriend is a huge sea salt soak-er, every bathing session!</li>
            <li>I bought this as a stocking stuffer and I love it.</li>
            <li>I will buy more of this product.</li>
            <li>I actually really, really love this soap.  </li>
            <li>My husband and I both love this soap.</li>
            <li>Smells great, however it really dries out my skin.</li>
            <li>More than anything I love the scent.  </li>
            <li>This is another one of my favorite soaps.</li>
            <li>It is one I reach for the most</li>
            <li>I love the way it lathers</li>
            <li>The name almost seems to promise more than it delivers...</li>
            <li>To me it smells like Dial or Zest,- which I was hoping for a more refined fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell it reminds me of my youth when I bascially swam in the ocean all day.  </li>
            <li>and I love the salt granules in the soap.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of the soap and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this soap.  </li>
            <li>You will love this soap.</li>
            <li>I will probably purchase more because my girlfriend loves it and thinks it smells like heaven.</li>
            <li>I love this soap.  </li>
            <li>Smells nice and makes me feel clean.  </li>
            <li>It lathers well, and has a nice clean scent without being perfume like.</li>
            <li>It has gift quality packaging, is high quality, and works great.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin without a trace of film and very clean.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for feeling like summer all year long.</li>
            <li>And the size of the bar is perfect -- not one of those huge rectangular soaps that slip out of your hand constantly.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this soap if you are looking for a nice quality soap!</li>
            <li>Smell is light and refreshing.  </li>
            <li>My skin is ridiculously smooth and it made for better (leg) shaving results.</li>
            <li>and I love clean smelling soaps.  </li>
            <li>It smells wonderful, feels clean, and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>I bought it because I wanted something clean and refreshing</li>
            <li>Any moment of my day that I can make more refreshing - and look forward to doing - is worth investing in.</li>
            <li>The scent isn&#x27;t feminine or overly strong.</li>
            <li>Also a pretty nice gift.</li>
            <li>I used this as a shave soap first and it works ok in that capacity and is a step up from many of the bargain soaps like williams or van der hagen stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The box that the soap comes in is also super cute</li>
            <li>I loved it so much at first - the salt in it feels nice &amp; exfoliating &amp; it smells wonderful, but after about a week or so both my partner &amp; I ended up this weird itchiness where you would swear something was crawling on you</li>
            <li>I use it in the shower, especially on legs, elbows and hands --- and it makes a great &amp;#34;after gardening&amp;#34; soap too.  </li>
            <li>Love this soap and worth ever scent.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using this soap.  </li>
            <li>I love the soap, smells extremely fresh and is rejuvenating for the skin.  </li>
            <li>The salt crystals are noticeably exfoliating, which I enjoy and my spouse hates.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin moisturized and smelling so fresh, I love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This soap was fantastic.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>While it is a nice soap and helps clear up your skin, it&#x27;s ok for shaving.  </li>
            <li>Strong, very fresh and unique scent that almost works as a room fragrance just sitting out.</li>
            <li>Really feels nice and leaves my skin feeling really smooth and clean after a shave.</li>
            <li>Gets a good lather quickly, smells outstanding and does not dry you out.</li>
            <li>My favorite part is the texture of the very, very course grain salt in the soap, and how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>Rich, creamy lather.</li>
            <li>It did not give me as smooth a shave as the shaving soaps I&#x27;ve used that contain tallow, but it did do a better job of holding its lather than any of the other animal fat free shaving soaps I&#x27;ve tried, so it might be a good choice for vegans.</li>
            <li>I need more and I haven&#x27;t even finished the first</li>
            <li>This a great soap that doesn&#x27;t dry out my &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; skin.</li>
            <li>There are bits of salt in it, so it&#x27;s pretty abrasive, which surprised me the first time I used it lol.</li>
            <li>This soap will totally moisturize your skin, and as it stands is a good body and face bar.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Perhaps it might do better on someone else&#x27;s skin - we are both fair-haired and fair-skinned, easily sunburned, sensitive, etc.</li>
            <li>Other reviewers indicated it smelled great.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is unique and fresh.  </li>
            <li>The soap itself smells invigorating, fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it, and will be buying more for myself and as gifts.</li>
            <li>They break out of the bar easily, so they don&#x27;t do much for exfoliation.</li>
            <li>It smells great and leaves your skin soft and not dry.</li>
            <li>The sea salt is an excellent exfoliator, especially in the winter when skin can be so dry and itchy.  </li>
            <li>(It does require using a good lotion right after to avoid dry skin, just like going to the beach.)</li>
            <li>It smells great and the little salt particle helps scrubbing while cleaning your skin.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the soap with little idea of how great this product would be.  </li>
            <li>The scent is so intriguing you just wanna smell the bar all day.</li>
            <li>I think it is worth it though.  </li>
            <li>It lathers nicely and gets me clean without making my skin feel  dry.</li>
            <li>My skin is clear and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>I also recommend the hand creme of the same kind.</li>
            <li>I love it, it feels natural.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a really mild, clean scent and it lathers really well for shaving.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny, the only one I own.</li>
            <li>Price&lt;br /&gt;It was worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li>That said, I do like this soap for bathing, the scent is enjoyable and I&#x27;m left feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>The salt crystals are good for scrubbing, but other than that the scent is unremarkable, and it doesn&#x27;t have any softeners in it that I can detect.</li>
            <li>, however I didn&#x27;t feel that this soap produced a good lather for shaving compared to other soaps I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>The packaging is also clever and unique.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t begin to describe how amazing it feels to have the soap exfoliate in such a gentle way.</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S Soap!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s Nice Smelling, and it doesn&#x27;t leave the cleaned area too dry...</li>
            <li>The soap is for any user, after reading about it, I purchased it, at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used thousands of different bar soaps and this has got to be in my top 5.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast!</li>
            <li>so I tried the one Made in USA first.  </li>
            <li>The bar is fairly big but fits in most shave soap cups nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the second Swedish Dream soap bar I&#x27;ve used, and it is definitely my favorite body soap ever.</li>
            <li>Love everything about it, I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering this again.</li>
            <li>Bars are good sized and round, which makes them easier to use.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s soft and creamy, yet it makes me feel so clean.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and it lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li>I have mild to sensitive caucasian skin, so I&#x27;d keep that in mind before ordering if that&#x27;s your skin type.</li>
            <li>It certainly didn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li>I use the soap as a scrub and it really works well.</li>
            <li>really great!&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell is light enough to use for myself as well!</li>
            <li>This scent is also much cleaner, fresher and lighter than anything at the drug store.</li>
            <li>However, as a bath soap I really like it.</li>
            <li>It has not dried my skin out so far, I have only used this soap twice, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin so clear, soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>There are other soaps specifically for shaving that are much better.</li>
            <li>It has such a clean fragrance.  </li>
            <li>, it has little salt beads in it which help to &amp;#34;exfoliate&amp;#34; your skin, and is more unique than regular bar</li>
            <li>Just doesn&#x27;t feel like sea salt or at least what I was expecting but does have a nice aroma and something in it that is scratchy that sloughs the skin.</li>
            <li>But, the soap is relatively tiny, and for the price, not sure whether a more economical replacement could be found.  </li>
            <li>It also has a nice subtle scent that lingers.</li>
            <li>Tends to dry too quickly on your face.</li>
            <li>It does foam up fairly well, and seems reasonably long-lasting for soap, but I am unlikely to purchase another bar once this one is done.</li>
            <li>Will clear your acne and change your skin!</li>
            <li>I lather up my hands, though, because you wouldn&#x27;t want to put the bar directly on your face.  </li>
            <li>It cleared my skin up and never dried it out.  </li>
            <li>Exfoliating and invigorating soap, leaves my skin soft and the lemon like smell is quite soothing.</li>
            <li>Only 4/5 stars because there aren&#x27;t many options for ordering it, when it can definitely be found cheaper buying directly from other sites.</li>
            <li>Easy to hold for my wife who has small hands.</li>
            <li>long lasting , fresh scent.</li>
            <li>Not bad, but definitely harsh on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found on lists where it is rated as highly so - and that is definitely the experience I had with this soap.</li>
            <li>Perhaps I am finicky because I usually buy Roger &amp; Gallet soaps which to me is the finest available.  </li>
            <li>it works very well and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s pretty typical for my old house and soap products.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, and the scent is lovely, but not overpowering (at least to me).  </li>

            <li> I will buy more of this product.</li>
            <li> I actually really, really love this soap.  </li>
            <li> My husband and I both love this soap.</li>
            <li> Smells great, however it really dries out my skin.</li>
            <li> More than anything I love the scent.  </li>
            <li> This is another one of my favorite soaps.</li>
            <li> It is one I reach for the most</li>
            <li> I love the way it lathers</li>
            <li> The name almost seems to promise more than it delivers...</li>
            <li> To me it smells like Dial or Zest,- which I was hoping for a more refined fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell it reminds me of my youth when I bascially swam in the ocean all day.  </li>
            <li> and I love the salt granules in the soap.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of the soap and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I love this soap.  </li>
            <li> You will love this soap.</li>
            <li> I will probably purchase more because my girlfriend loves it and thinks it smells like heaven.</li>
            <li> I love this soap.  </li>
            <li> Smells nice and makes me feel clean.  </li>
            <li> It lathers well, and has a nice clean scent without being perfume like.</li>
            <li> It has gift quality packaging, is high quality, and works great.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin without a trace of film and very clean.  </li>
            <li> Perfect for feeling like summer all year long.</li>
            <li> And the size of the bar is perfect -- not one of those huge rectangular soaps that slip out of your hand constantly.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this soap if you are looking for a nice quality soap!</li>
            <li> Smell is light and refreshing.  </li>
            <li> My skin is ridiculously smooth and it made for better (leg) shaving results.</li>
            <li> and I love clean smelling soaps.  </li>
            <li> It smells wonderful, feels clean, and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> I bought it because I wanted something clean and refreshing</li>
            <li> Any moment of my day that I can make more refreshing - and look forward to doing - is worth investing in.</li>
            <li> The scent isn&#x27;t feminine or overly strong.</li>
            <li> Also a pretty nice gift.</li>
            <li> I used this as a shave soap first and it works ok in that capacity and is a step up from many of the bargain soaps like williams or van der hagen stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The box that the soap comes in is also super cute</li>
            <li> I loved it so much at first - the salt in it feels nice &amp; exfoliating &amp; it smells wonderful, but after about a week or so both my partner &amp; I ended up this weird itchiness where you would swear something was crawling on you</li>
            <li> I use it in the shower, especially on legs, elbows and hands --- and it makes a great &amp;#34;after gardening&amp;#34; soap too.  </li>
            <li> Love this soap and worth ever scent.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this soap.  </li>
            <li> I love the soap, smells extremely fresh and is rejuvenating for the skin.  </li>
            <li> The salt crystals are noticeably exfoliating, which I enjoy and my spouse hates.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin moisturized and smelling so fresh, I love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This soap was fantastic.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> While it is a nice soap and helps clear up your skin, it&#x27;s ok for shaving.  </li>
            <li> Strong, very fresh and unique scent that almost works as a room fragrance just sitting out.</li>
            <li> Really feels nice and leaves my skin feeling really smooth and clean after a shave.</li>
            <li> Gets a good lather quickly, smells outstanding and does not dry you out.</li>
            <li> My favorite part is the texture of the very, very course grain salt in the soap, and how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> Rich, creamy lather.</li>
            <li> It did not give me as smooth a shave as the shaving soaps I&#x27;ve used that contain tallow, but it did do a better job of holding its lather than any of the other animal fat free shaving soaps I&#x27;ve tried, so it might be a good choice for vegans.</li>
            <li> I need more and I haven&#x27;t even finished the first</li>
            <li> This a great soap that doesn&#x27;t dry out my &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; skin.</li>
            <li> There are bits of salt in it, so it&#x27;s pretty abrasive, which surprised me the first time I used it lol.</li>
            <li> This soap will totally moisturize your skin, and as it stands is a good body and face bar.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Perhaps it might do better on someone else&#x27;s skin - we are both fair-haired and fair-skinned, easily sunburned, sensitive, etc.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers indicated it smelled great.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is unique and fresh.  </li>
            <li> The soap itself smells invigorating, fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it, and will be buying more for myself and as gifts.</li>
            <li> They break out of the bar easily, so they don&#x27;t do much for exfoliation.</li>
            <li> It smells great and leaves your skin soft and not dry.</li>
            <li> The sea salt is an excellent exfoliator, especially in the winter when skin can be so dry and itchy.  </li>
            <li> (It does require using a good lotion right after to avoid dry skin, just like going to the beach.)</li>
            <li> It smells great and the little salt particle helps scrubbing while cleaning your skin.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the soap with little idea of how great this product would be.  </li>
            <li> The scent is so intriguing you just wanna smell the bar all day.</li>
            <li> I think it is worth it though.  </li>
            <li> It lathers nicely and gets me clean without making my skin feel  dry.</li>
            <li> My skin is clear and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> I also recommend the hand creme of the same kind.</li>
            <li> I love it, it feels natural.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a really mild, clean scent and it lathers really well for shaving.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny, the only one I own.</li>
            <li> Price&lt;br /&gt;It was worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li> That said, I do like this soap for bathing, the scent is enjoyable and I&#x27;m left feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> The salt crystals are good for scrubbing, but other than that the scent is unremarkable, and it doesn&#x27;t have any softeners in it that I can detect.</li>
            <li> , however I didn&#x27;t feel that this soap produced a good lather for shaving compared to other soaps I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> The packaging is also clever and unique.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t begin to describe how amazing it feels to have the soap exfoliate in such a gentle way.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S Soap!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s Nice Smelling, and it doesn&#x27;t leave the cleaned area too dry...</li>
            <li> The soap is for any user, after reading about it, I purchased it, at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used thousands of different bar soaps and this has got to be in my top 5.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> so I tried the one Made in USA first.  </li>
            <li> The bar is fairly big but fits in most shave soap cups nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the second Swedish Dream soap bar I&#x27;ve used, and it is definitely my favorite body soap ever.</li>
            <li> Love everything about it, I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> Bars are good sized and round, which makes them easier to use.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s soft and creamy, yet it makes me feel so clean.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and it lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> I have mild to sensitive caucasian skin, so I&#x27;d keep that in mind before ordering if that&#x27;s your skin type.</li>
            <li> It certainly didn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li> I use the soap as a scrub and it really works well.</li>
            <li> really great!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell is light enough to use for myself as well!</li>
            <li> This scent is also much cleaner, fresher and lighter than anything at the drug store.</li>
            <li> However, as a bath soap I really like it.</li>
            <li> It has not dried my skin out so far, I have only used this soap twice, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin so clear, soft and clean.  </li>
            <li> There are other soaps specifically for shaving that are much better.</li>
            <li> It has such a clean fragrance.  </li>
            <li> , it has little salt beads in it which help to &amp;#34;exfoliate&amp;#34; your skin, and is more unique than regular bar</li>
            <li> Just doesn&#x27;t feel like sea salt or at least what I was expecting but does have a nice aroma and something in it that is scratchy that sloughs the skin.</li>
            <li> But, the soap is relatively tiny, and for the price, not sure whether a more economical replacement could be found.  </li>
            <li> It also has a nice subtle scent that lingers.</li>
            <li> Tends to dry too quickly on your face.</li>
            <li> It does foam up fairly well, and seems reasonably long-lasting for soap, but I am unlikely to purchase another bar once this one is done.</li>
            <li> Will clear your acne and change your skin!</li>
            <li> I lather up my hands, though, because you wouldn&#x27;t want to put the bar directly on your face.  </li>
            <li> It cleared my skin up and never dried it out.  </li>
            <li> Exfoliating and invigorating soap, leaves my skin soft and the lemon like smell is quite soothing.</li>
            <li> Only 4/5 stars because there aren&#x27;t many options for ordering it, when it can definitely be found cheaper buying directly from other sites.</li>
            <li> Easy to hold for my wife who has small hands.</li>
            <li> long lasting , fresh scent.</li>
            <li> Not bad, but definitely harsh on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found on lists where it is rated as highly so - and that is definitely the experience I had with this soap.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I am finicky because I usually buy Roger &amp; Gallet soaps which to me is the finest available.  </li>
            <li> it works very well and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s pretty typical for my old house and soap products.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, and the scent is lovely, but not overpowering (at least to me).  </li>
            <li> It rinses clean but leaves behind a feeling of soap film.  </li>
            <li> However, the soap doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> The lasting power as a shaving soap is very limited.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wanted to try this soap for a long time.</li>
            <li> (stopped when usage of this soap stopped), and I broke out with crazy large cyst-like acne - even in places I have NEVER had any in my whole life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does&#x27;nt dry my skin.</li>
            <li> It leaves a clean smell vaguely of the ocean.</li>
            <li> What I did not expect, and not sure why, is that the salt is not dissolved into the soap, but is mixed into the soap, thereby acting as a &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I have sort of oily skin, but even moisturizing soaps make my skin feel tight or dry.  </li>
            <li> I bought this soap based on other reviews here.  </li>
            <li> The little salt chunks are pretty useless though.</li>
            <li> These are mediocre and very over-priced american-made soaps that are &#x27;inspired&#x27; by Swedish spa soaps and culture.  </li>
            <li> Only complaint is that my sink drain does not like this soap</li>
            <li> also didn&#x27;t think it lathered thick enough for beard shaving.</li>
            <li> Smells yummy, works well, less and $10 and lasts.  </li>
            <li> The reason I have to rate it so low because I recently discovered that the little bits of &amp;#34;salt&amp;#34; are actually polyethylene beads...those bad boys that are polluting the water and soaking up toxins.  </li>
            <li> They just detach and cling to you which is a little annoying.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t begin to tell you what this little bar of soap did for my skin.  </li>
            <li> ; man, he doesn&#x27;t even mind that it&#x27;s a little pricey.</li>
            <li> The round shape adds to the ease of use.  </li>
            <li> No strong scents or perfumes either.</li>
            <li> It is a little on the expensive side, but it goes a long way, thankfully.</li>
            <li> Too bad, because this was my absolute favourite soap.</li>
            <li> Sadly, this one did not achieve the same results when it came to that.</li>
            <li> No more worrying about the chemicals in your sope.</li>
            <li> Makes my family crazy when I leave a bar at their house because they too love the smell, but they find the scratchy salty bit when you are nearing the end of the bar a bit painful.  </li>
            <li> I was actually looking for a different sea salt soap that seemed to stop an annoying itchiness I get in my lower legs.</li>
            <li> but of course they had to add heavy perfume into it, which is NOT good for your skin.  </li>
            <li> But lately I seem to be developing an allergy to it.</li>
            <li> I agree with those who say this is not a good shave soap.</li>
            <li> They are extraordinarily expensive given the quality, the pedestrian ingredients and the fact that they are made in the US.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m obsessed with the smell of it.</li>
            <li> Not overly perfumed or artificial.</li>
            <li> Shaving soap is almost impossible to find anywhere but the web....</li>
            <li> I was also disappointed with the fragrance.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> If you go online to look up comedogenicity, there&#x27;s sometimes a debate as to whether sea salt is or is not. I&#x27;ve found on lists where it is rated as highly so - and that is definitely the experience I had with this soap. I loved it so much at first - the salt in it feels nice &amp; exfoliating &amp; it smells wonderful, but after about a week or so both my partner &amp; I ended up this weird itchiness where you would swear something was crawling on you (stopped when usage of this soap stopped), and I broke out with crazy large cyst-like acne - even in places I have NEVER had any in my whole life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps it might do better on someone else&#x27;s skin - we are both fair-haired and fair-skinned, easily sunburned, sensitive, etc.</li>
            <li> These are mediocre and very over-priced american-made soaps that are &#x27;inspired&#x27; by Swedish spa soaps and culture.  They are extraordinarily expensive given the quality, the pedestrian ingredients and the fact that they are made in the US.  A big rip off.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a stocking stuffer and I love it. The soap itself smells invigorating, fresh and clean. Not overly perfumed or artificial. The packaging is also clever and unique. I will buy more of this product. Added bonus that it is made in the USA.</li>
            <li> Great product and great smell. Bathing is now invigorating with the soap. I use the soap as a scrub and it really works well.</li>
            <li> The scent is so refreshing and clean and yes --- reminds you of happy summer days seaside.  What I did not expect, and not sure why, is that the salt is not dissolved into the soap, but is mixed into the soap, thereby acting as a &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34;.  Therefore it is not &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34;, but invigorating.  I use it in the shower, especially on legs, elbows and hands --- and it makes a great &amp;#34;after gardening&amp;#34; soap too.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, and the scent is lovely, but not overpowering (at least to me).  And the size of the bar is perfect -- not one of those huge rectangular soaps that slip out of your hand constantly.  The round shape adds to the ease of use.  Love this soap and worth ever scent.</li>
            <li> Just doesn&#x27;t feel like sea salt or at least what I was expecting but does have a nice aroma and something in it that is scratchy that sloughs the skin.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give this product one star because I don&#x27;t like it - I actually really, really love this soap.  I adore the scent and the exfoliating properties.  The reason I have to rate it so low because I recently discovered that the little bits of &amp;#34;salt&amp;#34; are actually polyethylene beads...those bad boys that are polluting the water and soaking up toxins.  They also look like fish food, so fish eat them, and then we eat the fish....and then we are ingesting the toxins ourselves.  So until they remove polyethylene from the ingredient list, I&#x27;ll have to stick to something else. Too bad, because this was my absolute favourite soap.</li>
            <li> I had never purchased this kind of soap before. I bought it for my boyfriends stocking stuffer. It certainly didn&#x27;t disappoint. It&#x27;s got a great grit to it that feels super good when you scrub with it. The scent isn&#x27;t feminine or overly strong. It&#x27;s neutral. The bar seems to last awhile.</li>
            <li> Makes my family crazy when I leave a bar at their house because they too love the smell, but they find the scratchy salty bit when you are nearing the end of the bar a bit painful.  I think this is a divine treat to have in the shower not matter where you are.</li>
            <li> The smell and the texture are wonderful. I&#x27;ve used the soap for years happily. But lately I seem to be developing an allergy to it. I would say that it isn&#x27;t best for sensitive skin, but it is still one of my favorite scents.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both love this soap. We sometimes miss living at the beach, and this does a good job of imitating what the ocean does for you. We both use it as a shower soap. It has gift quality packaging, is high quality, and works great. My favorite part is the texture of the very, very course grain salt in the soap, and how it makes my skin feel. (It does require using a good lotion right after to avoid dry skin, just like going to the beach.) I highly recommend it, and will be buying more for myself and as gifts.</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin so clear, soft and clean.  It has such a clean fragrance.  I get it for my grandson because he is at the age where his skin breaks out , it is wonderful</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this soap!  It smells so good and my skin feels wonderful!  The only drawback is the price.  I think it is worth it though.  I will definitely be buying this again</li>
            <li> Smells great, however it really dries out my skin.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this soap.  Smell is light and refreshing.  Sea salt does wonders for my skin (I have psoriasis).  Feels great, not drying.  Only complaint is that my sink drain does not like this soap but that&#x27;s pretty typical for my old house and soap products.</li>
            <li> I concur with everyone else here based on one use.  I have sort of oily skin, but even moisturizing soaps make my skin feel tight or dry.  This must match my skin perfectly, because I get all the clean feeling with none of the dryness.</li>
            <li> Love this soap! Exfoliates and smells great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wanted to try this soap for a long time. I use it after working out. It lathers nicely and gets me clean without making my skin feel  dry. It also has a nice subtle scent that lingers.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap because I heard how great it is to shave with. While it is a nice soap and helps clear up your skin, it&#x27;s ok for shaving.  There is nothing unique about this soap that makes it especially great for shaving, as good as regular bar or liquid soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would however reccommend this product because it smells great, it has little salt beads in it which help to &amp;#34;exfoliate&amp;#34; your skin, and is more unique than regular bar soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product, but it won&#x27;t make a world of difference in your shaving.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soap. The salt crystals are good for scrubbing, but other than that the scent is unremarkable, and it doesn&#x27;t have any softeners in it that I can detect.</li>
            <li> Rich, creamy lather. Super-fine sea salt.  More than anything I love the scent.  I wish there was a matching cologne or fragrance. Bars are good sized and round, which makes them easier to use. Also, it&#x27;s made in the USA!</li>
            <li> long lasting , fresh scent. My skin is clear and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this soap.  It smells great and the little salt particle helps scrubbing while cleaning your skin.  However, the soap doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> This is another one of my favorite soaps. I use the soap because of my autoimmune issues. The soap is for any user, after reading about it, I purchased it, at a very reasonable price. I intend to get more of the soap, it smells wonderful, it&#x27;s soft and creamy, yet it makes me feel so clean. Thank you, Amazon!</li>
            <li> This is legit sea salt soap. Some that I&#x27;ve seen are just scented (and that&#x27;s what I was honestly expecting - maybe I didn&#x27;t read enough). There are bits of salt in it, so it&#x27;s pretty abrasive, which surprised me the first time I used it lol. Not bad, but definitely harsh on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is good soap for many purposes. I liked washing with it, and the salt crystals had a nice loofah-like feel. I was actually looking for a different sea salt soap that seemed to stop an annoying itchiness I get in my lower legs. Sadly, this one did not achieve the same results when it came to that. I also tried using it as a shaving soap. It did not give me as smooth a shave as the shaving soaps I&#x27;ve used that contain tallow, but it did do a better job of holding its lather than any of the other animal fat free shaving soaps I&#x27;ve tried, so it might be a good choice for vegans.</li>
            <li> Excellent, clean smelling soap.  Perfect size to hold in my hand.  It is one I reach for the most and I will always have it on hand.  I love the way it lathers and I&#x27;m obsessed with the smell of it.</li>
            <li> Has a great smell. My wife keeps it in a dish and uses it just for the nice sent. Haven&#x27;t actually used it as soap yet.</li>
            <li> Totally awesome love it!!!  Can&#x27;t begin to describe how amazing it feels to have the soap exfoliate in such a gentle way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clean scent smells great!</li>
            <li> The name almost seems to promise more than it delivers... But it doesn&#x27;t...IT&#x27;S Soap!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s Nice Smelling, and it doesn&#x27;t leave the cleaned area too dry...it&#x27;s soap...</li>
            <li> I bought this soap based on other reviews here.  It is a great soap for shaving but not bathing.  Others have said it is a great all around soap but I degress.  It rinses clean but leaves behind a feeling of soap film.  I was also disappointed with the fragrance.  Other reviewers indicated it smelled great.  To me it smells like Dial or Zest,- which I was hoping for a more refined fragrance.  Perhaps I am finicky because I usually buy Roger &amp; Gallet soaps which to me is the finest available.  After using the Swedish Dream Sea Salt soap I will not purchase it again.  It is simply not for me.  It may be good for you but you will just have to try it for yourself.  I gave it 5 stars because it is advertised to be a shaving soap  - to that end it works very well and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> my boyfriend is a huge sea salt soak-er, every bathing session! so this was a big hit for a gift.</li>
            <li> I have senitive skin and I love clean smelling soaps.  I am a bit of a soap, lotion potion junky this is not a one hit tried it once product... this soap is now on the must have and use all the time list.  I love the smell it reminds me of my youth when I bascially swam in the ocean all day.  It leaves your skin without a trace of film and very clean.  The salt gives you a tint bit of a scrub.</li>
            <li> The best soap ever!! Will clear your acne and change your skin! The smell is amazing and I love the salt granules in the soap.</li>
            <li> I used this as a shave soap first and it works ok in that capacity and is a step up from many of the bargain soaps like williams or van der hagen stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked it much better as just a body soap. It smells great and leaves your skin soft and not dry. Lasts for a while too.</li>
            <li> i tried this and re-ordered from Amazon. I love the smell of the soap and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Really feels nice and leaves my skin feeling really smooth and clean after a shave. No strong scents or perfumes either.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Smells nice and makes me feel clean.  Does&#x27;nt dry my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used thousands of different bar soaps and this has got to be in my top 5. The scent is so intriguing you just wanna smell the bar all day. I also recommend the hand creme of the same kind. It&#x27;s addicting!</li>
            <li> great soap - lathers nicely.  Easy to hold for my wife who has small hands.</li>
            <li> If this was just pure soap with sea salt added in, it would&#x27;ve been great... but of course they had to add heavy perfume into it, which is NOT good for your skin.  I&#x27;m asking to return it for a refund.</li>
            <li> Love the soaps I ordered!  Shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> Gave this try and it definitely smells really great!&lt;br /&gt;Im pretty sure you WONT be disappointed. Also a pretty nice gift.</li>
            <li> I love it, it feels natural. No more worrying about the chemicals in your sope. The packaging design and materials are amazing, Best of all they wrote an hand written thank-you on the receipt.</li>
            <li> This product is over rated. The lasting power as a shaving soap is very limited. Tends to dry too quickly on your face. Move on and try another shaving product.</li>
            <li> I love this soap.  The fragrance is unique and fresh.  The sea salt is an excellent exfoliator, especially in the winter when skin can be so dry and itchy.  I use it in the shower.  To wash my face I lather up my hands, though, because you wouldn&#x27;t want to put the bar directly on your face.  You will love this soap.</li>
            <li> Shaving soap is almost impossible to find anywhere but the web.... so I tried the one Made in USA first.  The anchor was a nice touch for my sailor:)</li>
            <li> I love the soap, smells extremely fresh and is rejuvenating for the skin.  The salt embedded within the soap provides an exfoliating effect, which is nice.  But, the soap is relatively tiny, and for the price, not sure whether a more economical replacement could be found.  All in all though, great product!</li>
            <li> This soap will totally moisturize your skin, and as it stands is a good body and face bar. But using this for shaving is excellent as well. Gets a good lather quickly, smells outstanding and does not dry you out. The bar is fairly big but fits in most shave soap cups nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is pricey though, but it also comes in a cute package that looks good as a decoration in your bathroom.</li>
            <li> I like this soap. It smells wonderful, feels clean, and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. The little salt chunks are pretty useless though. They break out of the bar easily, so they don&#x27;t do much for exfoliation. They just detach and cling to you which is a little annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also didn&#x27;t think it lathered thick enough for beard shaving.</li>
            <li> I find that the scent of this, while gender-neutral, still comes off as a stronger scent than I want from my soap—it definitely lingers. The salt crystals are noticeably exfoliating, which I enjoy and my spouse hates. It does foam up fairly well, and seems reasonably long-lasting for soap, but I am unlikely to purchase another bar once this one is done. This doesn&#x27;t seem to do any more for my skin than a nice shea-butter soap.</li>
            <li> The smell is great, the lather is great, the sea salt grit felt great --- but my dried up skin post shower did not feel great.  It actually dried my skin up so much that it cracked, (it was not the exfoliation of the salt) --- after 1 week use, I stopped.  I have mild to sensitive caucasian skin, so I&#x27;d keep that in mind before ordering if that&#x27;s your skin type.</li>
            <li> For the price, this is a nice sized bar of soap! It smells great on my fiancé and lathers well! The smell is light enough to use for myself as well! It rinses well and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue. I highly recommend this soap if you are looking for a nice quality soap!</li>
            <li> I bought this soap for the purpose of shaving, based on claims I had read stating that this soap is well suited for the task, however I didn&#x27;t feel that this soap produced a good lather for shaving compared to other soaps I&#x27;ve used. That said, I do like this soap for bathing, the scent is enjoyable and I&#x27;m left feeling clean and refreshed. I will probably purchase more because my girlfriend loves it and thinks it smells like heaven.</li>

            <li> I purchased the soap with little idea of how great this product would be.  I can&#x27;t begin to tell you what this little bar of soap did for my skin.  It cleared my skin up and never dried it out.  It is a little on the expensive side, but it goes a long way, thankfully.</li>
            <li> Strong, very fresh and unique scent that almost works as a room fragrance just sitting out. We love the scent so that&#x27;s great for us.</li>
            <li> Exfoliating and invigorating soap, leaves my skin soft and the lemon like smell is quite soothing.</li>
            <li> Smells yummy, works well, less and $10 and lasts.  The box that the soap comes in is also super cute and I&#x27;ve seen it used in designer homes.</li>
            <li> This is the second Swedish Dream soap bar I&#x27;ve used, and it is definitely my favorite body soap ever. It&#x27;s got a really mild, clean scent and it lathers really well for shaving. It leaves my skin moisturized and smelling so fresh, I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is also adorable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again and again and again.</li>
            <li> This a great soap that doesn&#x27;t dry out my &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; skin. Also it doesn&#x27;t leave me smelling like flowers like the soaps my dermatologist recommended. It leaves a clean smell vaguely of the ocean. I use Swedish Dream Sea Salt Soap for shaving and it is great for that too.</li>
            <li> This soap has the best scent out there because it is low-key and it smells like the sea.....and not the Salton Sea. Worth every penny, the only one I own.</li>
            <li> This soap was fantastic. I bought it because I wanted something clean and refreshing and I got that. It exfoliates so well, I wasn&#x27;t expecting that. My skin is ridiculously smooth and it made for better (leg) shaving results. I need more and I haven&#x27;t even finished the first bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Re: Price&lt;br /&gt;It was worth it in my opinion. Any moment of my day that I can make more refreshing - and look forward to doing - is worth investing in. This scent is also much cleaner, fresher and lighter than anything at the drug store. Perfect for feeling like summer all year long.</li>
            <li> My fiance swears by this stuff! A self-declared &amp;#34;unfrilly&amp;#34; man, he doesn&#x27;t even mind that it&#x27;s a little pricey. Deep cleans and has salt in it to exfoliate. Last FOREVER! Only 4/5 stars because there aren&#x27;t many options for ordering it, when it can definitely be found cheaper buying directly from other sites.</li>
            <li> I love this soap.  It has cleared up my acne on my face without drying it out.  Lather is good and the smell reminds me of the ocean.  Arrived quickly.  Will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> I use this soap a few times a week, not daily because its an exfoliating bar really. Love the smell and it lasts a very long time. Love everything about it, I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> I agree with those who say this is not a good shave soap. There are other soaps specifically for shaving that are much better. However, as a bath soap I really like it. It lathers well, and has a nice clean scent without being perfume like. Best of all, it seems to rinse off cleanly. It has not dried my skin out so far, I have only used this soap twice, but so far so good. The salt crystals in the soap are OK, though I don&#x27;t know how much good they do. Overall, I am happy with the purchase. I do think they should stop advertising this soap for shaving.</li>
