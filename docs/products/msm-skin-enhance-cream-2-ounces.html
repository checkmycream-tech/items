            <li>This cream seems to have good reviews on Amazon and was able to be shipped to Australia.</li>
            <li>Subjectively it feels nice</li>
            <li>The Natural MSM Cream is the best.</li>
            <li>It goes on nicely and I can apply makeup on top of it during the day.</li>
            <li>The cream is lightly scented,  feels good on my skin - seems to soak in rather than sitting on the surface.</li>
            <li>i read that this would be good for acne, but, like most creams, this didn&#x27;t do anything special for my skin.</li>
            <li>Most creams clog my pores, but this one doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>way  better  ,  </li>

            <li>I love it and would repurchase.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After even more research I found again that the MSM cream should help...</li>
            <li>They have discovered that many teenagers now show the beginnings of it and people in their 20&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks better.</li>
            <li>I did try to order some more, but now found the price has gone up</li>
            <li>(I will update if I notice any more improved effects)</li>
            <li>I also love the price.</li>
            <li>Will know more in a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>Love the way it feels</li>
            <li>: This cream goes on nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m glad I tried it,</li>
            <li>and  the  beautiful  live  </li>
            <li>Like others, I would like to know how much MSM is in it, where the MSM comes from (China?), and even better would be OptiMSM type (the best most pure stuff as that is important in choosing MSM).</li>
            <li>This is a light cream with no scent (very important feature for me), which is now my go-to cream for itchy skin.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t as impressed with this as other reviews I&#x27;ve read..</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Everything else about the cream seems fine.  </li>
            <li>I gave it to my Dad and it works fine for him...</li>
            <li>Product arrived fine within 1-2 weeks.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin smooth and reduces appearance of fine lines.</li>
            <li>my under eye puffiness is gone and my skin overall looks great.</li>
            <li>was  fabulous.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy I came across this stuff, did some research and finally purchased it.</li>
            <li>A larger tub would also be great.</li>
            <li>I decided to buy this cream because of some acne marks that I want filled in.</li>
            <li>Makes makeup go smoothly on as well.</li>
            <li>No breakouts and smooth skin.  </li>
            <li>so far so good.</li>
            <li>Seems to tighten the skin in general and has a light pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product, it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>many thanks for such a great product.</li>
            <li>Within 3 days of using the cream, my rash was significantly reduced and within a week it was gone.</li>
            <li>loving this stuff so far.</li>
            <li>I use another brand as my daily body lotion (more oz for a reasonable price), but it&#x27;s not as good as this stuff...</li>
            <li>For acne scars you may need to needle or just add vitamnib c to them to get a full fill in because this cream won&#x27;t fully fill them in</li>
            <li>another cheap amazon gem as instores its very pricey compared !</li>
            <li>It has a decent not overpowering smell and a nice fast soaking into skin consistency.</li>
            <li>think higher and more pure levels of MSM/ DMSO for the therapeutic effect I need, and will also buy a roll on DMSO.</li>
            <li>though sometimes it does not get easily absorbed into skin.</li>
            <li>I love this soft, pudding like consistency cream.</li>
            <li>I only need to use about a dime size amount on my skin and it goes on nicely and helps keep my rosacea at bay.</li>
            <li>You will Stay Alive &amp; Healthy that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;God</li>
            <li>Nice comfortable cream for a slightly damaged skin area.</li>
            <li>Delivery was very fast.  </li>
            <li>see if I feel better then try it again, and see if the queasy feeling comes back.</li>
            <li>is  that  evidently  </li>
            <li>Even better when mixed with organic flaxseed oil.</li>
            <li>I love this cream, I use it on my face and body, non greasy, leaves you feeling refreshed, looking younger, diminishes wrinkles and scars!</li>
            <li>I am specifically interested in the amount or percentage of sulfur content in the cream, as it is the sulfur that improves and produces</li>
            <li>smooth and clear skin&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes my skin smooth and clear and no redness of my rosacea.</li>
            <li>/&gt; All in all, I really like this cream  very much.</li>
            <li>delivered on time; I love it - stays on your skin a long time.</li>

            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>if people really knew about this</li>
            <li>, I suffer from eczema and this really calms the tightness, redness and pain associated the peeling skin</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very nourishing and soothing.</li>

            <li>This has really helped to clear up my psoriasis on my face.</li>
            <li>Wow.... A no frills product that really delivers.  </li>
            <li>what  these  new  </li>
            <li>by morning the 6 new spots on the one leg were gone...</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft and supple!</li>
            <li>not sure if that raises GMO issues as I hear most soy in USA is GMO.</li>
            <li>it does have a slight unique scent, but once it soaks into your skin you cannot smell it.</li>
            <li>I always used very high priced creams but this one beats them all especially in cost!!!!</li>
            <li>maybe they won&#x27;t disappear completely, bug with makeup</li>
            <li>the  old  </li>
            <li>young  </li>
            <li>Completely cleared up my hand eczema.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and have had no problems.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive acne prone skin and</li>
            <li>I think you should give this cream a try if you have acne prone and sensitive skin and some acne scars..</li>
            <li>It is not at all greasy and it leaves your skin feeling baby soft.</li>
            <li>I switched to this brand after petroleum jelly was added to the ingredient list of my old MSM cream.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who struggles with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>any new pimples and risidual red marks are completely gone within days.</li>
            <li>It really moisturizes well and doesn&#x27;t take long before you can feel the difference!</li>
            <li>I have been using it now for 2 weeks on skin (general and dermatitis issues), and also on nerve pains.</li>
            <li>The first night after I washed and exfoliated my skin, I rubbed down my face and neck with this stuff</li>
            <li>otherwise I would have looked right past it.</li>

            <li> not sure if that raises GMO issues as I hear most soy in USA is GMO.</li>
            <li> it does have a slight unique scent, but once it soaks into your skin you cannot smell it.</li>
            <li> I always used very high priced creams but this one beats them all especially in cost!!!!</li>
            <li> maybe they won&#x27;t disappear completely, bug with makeup</li>
            <li> the  old  </li>

            <li> I think you should give this cream a try if you have acne prone and sensitive skin and some acne scars..</li>
            <li> It is not at all greasy and it leaves your skin feeling baby soft.</li>
            <li> I switched to this brand after petroleum jelly was added to the ingredient list of my old MSM cream.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who struggles with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> any new pimples and risidual red marks are completely gone within days.</li>

            <li> I have been using it now for 2 weeks on skin (general and dermatitis issues), and also on nerve pains.</li>
            <li> The first night after I washed and exfoliated my skin, I rubbed down my face and neck with this stuff</li>
            <li> otherwise I would have looked right past it.</li>

            <li> We all have the beginnings of it from eating the traditional poisonous American Diet... and we do not know it until it is often too late as 50% of those find out they have it after their first heart attack and do not survive.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it for very long.  </li>
            <li> I had started to get the typical red sores on one foot...</li>
            <li> im sure they would give up on expensive creams that take forever to work or hardly work at all</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been ordering this cream when I get down to 1/4 of the tub</li>
            <li> but I have just gotten down to the half way mark after 5 months of using every night.</li>
            <li> the redness in my acnd marks have disappeared and my dolling scars are definitely less noticeable.</li>
            <li> in  a  2  oz  jar  in  black  </li>
            <li> It does absorb quickly, no greasiness .  </li>
            <li> I paid half the price for 2 oz.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> delivered on time; I love it - stays on your skin a long time.</li>
            <li> so far so good. This product was extremely fast to ship and arrive. I have used it for two applications and my acne marks on my face are already reduced. I have a few rolling scars I&#x27;m hopeful it will reduce as well. as an experiment, I applied it to my left arm where I have always had what looks like permanent goosebumps. I can&#x27;t believe it... but those are diminishing as well! I will update in a few weeks. I&#x27;m very happy so far!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I have been using this religiously for several weeks now. the redness in my acnd marks have disappeared and my dolling scars are definitely less noticeable. maybe they won&#x27;t disappear completely, bug with makeup you would never know they are there. any new pimples and risidual red marks are completely gone within days. my under eye puffiness is gone and my skin overall looks great. I would definitely give this a try. it does have a slight unique scent, but once it soaks into your skin you cannot smell it. loving this stuff so far.</li>
            <li> This has really helped to clear up my psoriasis on my face. You only need a bit, so I think this jar will last awhile. I only use it before bed, so hasn&#x27;t taken a bunch of applications everyday either.</li>
            <li> Nice cream though sometimes it does not get easily absorbed into skin.</li>
            <li> Most creams clog my pores, but this one doesn&#x27;t. Makes my skin smooth and reduces appearance of fine lines. Seems to tighten the skin in general and has a light pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> I like this cream.  Would be exaggerating if I said I notice &amp;#34;drastic&amp;#34; changes, but my facial lines have not gotten worst; to me, that is a triumph!  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Used this for my rolling acne scars and it broke me out, even when I used the tiniest bit :(</li>
            <li> Softens and relieves pain. Last thing I use at night. It&#x27;s on my night stand. Jar was too little. Will order again in larger size.  One particular night my feet were a little achy. After bath I massaged cream into feet. Did the job. Pain gone. I slept well.</li>
            <li> I love this soft, pudding like consistency cream. I only need to use about a dime size amount on my skin and it goes on nicely and helps keep my rosacea at bay. I would highly recommend this product, it&#x27;s amazing. Will definitely purchase again, thank you.</li>
            <li> I received this cream about 8 days ago and have been using it and it seemed good. It doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell and it really does moisturize. However, I think it may be making me sick. I&#x27;ve been feeling queasy for the past 6 days and feeling a little headachy. I&#x27;m going to discontinue using it for a week and see if I feel better then try it again, and see if the queasy feeling comes back. If it does not I&#x27;ll come back here and change my rating to 4 stars. Everything else about the cream seems fine.  UPDATE: I tried it again yesterday and today and there were no problems at all. I guess it was something else that was making me sick. I like this cream, it has no smell and the consistency is nice.</li>
            <li> I  GOT  TO  SAY  I  HATE  IT.  this  cream  i  searched  for  since  the  1980 s  has  now  i  found  has  changed  its  formulation  and  and  is  greasier  and  wetter  when  it  was  sort  of  drier,  and  way  better  ,  and  the  beautiful  live  yeast  it  use  to  have  in  it  that  use  to work  immediately  on  your  skin  and  beautify  it  ,  does  not  work,  and  shocked  as  i  was  is  that  evidently  the  makers  despise  the  name  JESUS  or  the  word  that  this  wonder  working  cream  use  to  be  called  and  i  was  there  called  BORN  AGAIN.  please  i  am  not  a  lying  customer  or  dumb,  i  know  they  changed  there  formulation  in  this  cream  of  2015  and  had  the  audasicity  to  remove  the  label  it  carried  it  large  letters  in  a  2  oz  jar  in  black  called  BORN  AGAIN .  WHOEVER  MADE  THIS  CREAM  WAS  A  MESS  IN  A  JAR.  it  also  did  nothing  for  my  face  like  the  one  in  the  past,  but  now  this  formulation  caused  my  eyes  to  tear  and  puff  up  bad  and  and  the  ingredients  of  the  old  born  again  was  fabulous.  i  dont  know if  the  company  manager died  or  left  or  got  some  incompetant  young  folk  and  might hate  the  name  of  JESUS  OR  BORN  AGAIN  AS  IT  USE TO  CALLED  ON  THE  JAR  and  i know  it  and  was  there  when  it  was  that  was  the  sentence  of  the  jar  i  spoke  of  but  this  mess  is  horrible  and  iam  afraid  to ever  put  mess  on  my  face  it  was  once  called .  people  you  need  to  watch  what  these  new  uncaring  your  people  are  creating  in  these  jars  because  may  get  a  mess  and  lose  money  or  worse.  this  mess  ,  i  never  want  on  my  face  or  around  my  eyes  again.</li>
            <li> Love it....This has become my go to moisturizer. Completely cleared up my hand eczema. I havent had a break out since. My skin loves this stuff... I wish they sold larger containers. I use another brand as my daily body lotion (more oz for a reasonable price), but it&#x27;s not as good as this stuff... Even better when mixed with organic flaxseed oil.</li>
            <li> I love this cream, I use it on my face and body, non greasy, leaves you feeling refreshed, looking younger, diminishes wrinkles and scars!</li>
            <li> The ingredients listed on Amazon are not the same as on the product label. There are no parabens listed on the product label, this should be changed promptly. Parabens are shown to have an array of negative effects. Some studies indicate when methylparaben reacts with UBV rays it increases skin damage and aging.&lt;br /&gt;Link to study: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0300483X06004641&lt;br /&gt;Also parabens are xenoestrongenic, meaning they mimic estrogen in you body, not good for any male.</li>
            <li> i read that this would be good for acne, but, like most creams, this didn&#x27;t do anything special for my skin. It still gets 4 stars because its of good quality and I like the ingredient list better than the mrm brand. So i don&#x27;t waste it, I ise it on my body now.</li>
            <li> I have used several different MSM or sulfur creams. The Natural MSM Cream is the best. It goes on smoothly, moisturizes thoroughly and is not greasy nor does it give you a shiny face.&lt;br /&gt;The reason I gave it only 4 stars instead of five is that I am missing the listing of ingredients. I am specifically interested in the amount or percentage of sulfur content in the cream, as it is the sulfur that improves and produces smooth and clear skin&lt;br /&gt; All in all, I really like this cream  very much. Excellent face and body  cream for a very reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, it can compete with an 80 Dollar cream from Lancome or Estee Lauder.</li>
            <li> Good Product, but pricy</li>
            <li> It is taking care of my skin problem. Thanks</li>
            <li> This cream is a good moisturizer at an affordable price. I can&#x27;t say more since I just have been using it for a couple of days.</li>
            <li> Lotion makes my skin feel great.&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my face and neck, great product, and I will purchase more.</li>
            <li> Okay just recieved this stuff 2 days ago! The first night after I washed and exfoliated my skin, I rubbed down my face and neck with this stuff -a little goes a long way. My skin feels so soft and supple! I&#x27;m so happy I came across this stuff, did some research and finally purchased it. I will definitely have an update after a month of use.</li>
            <li> You can feel the difference in your skin even after just a few uses.  It really moisturizes well and doesn&#x27;t take long before you can feel the difference!</li>
            <li> Definitely helps nourish my skin!</li>
            <li> Great product for scars.  Better than expected!</li>
            <li> this cream is awesome for wrinkles, better than any wrinkle cream out there. i put a thick layer on my hands and under my eyes and it just lifts up your skin overnight! if people really knew about this im sure they would give up on expensive creams that take forever to work or hardly work at all...i never used it for arthritis but im sure it works well for this too</li>
            <li> Non greasy, feels like it firms my skin, I suffer from eczema and this really calms the tightness, redness and pain associated the peeling skin</li>
            <li> I use this AFTER applying the M S M skin lotion dries. seems to work great for me,ill continue to use it.  many thanks for such a great product. I use it as an after shave also,, very very nice!!</li>
            <li> feels so good on the skin.  can&#x27;t get enough of it.</li>
            <li> I have been experimenting with sulfur products to help my acne and rosacea, this is a very nice cream.  The jar is 2 oz, smaller than I thought I had ordered. No smell that I can tell. It goes on nicely and I can apply makeup on top of it during the day. It makes my skin smooth and clear and no redness of my rosacea. I love it and would repurchase. I have no experienced any breakouts.</li>
            <li> This product is incredible... I have been having problems with neuropathy in my feet and legs caused by a heart attack triggered by severe stress.  I had started to get the typical red sores on one foot... I had tried several creams/medications none had worked.  I tried the other MSM cream sold here and I had a reaction to it which I noted many of the other reviewers stated they had a reaction to it... I gave it to my Dad and it works fine for him... Thank God.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After even more research I found again that the MSM cream should help... so decided to come back on to Amazon and see if there was another MSM cream that did not have reviews of people having a negative reaction to it... and found this one.  I also thought the added vitamin E in this one might be of further help.  So I ordered it.  6 red spots had just shown up on the opposite leg when I had received this bottle... scary...  so before bed I rubbed the cream on all the spots... and OMG ... by morning the 6 new spots on the one leg were gone... the others on the other foot which had been there now for about 2 weeks was notably better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, I am also taking internal products to abate the progression of the neuropathy which of course is caused by atherosclerosis as is almost all heart attacks and strokes.  We all have the beginnings of it from eating the traditional poisonous American Diet... and we do not know it until it is often too late as 50% of those find out they have it after their first heart attack and do not survive.  They have discovered that many teenagers now show the beginnings of it and people in their 20&#x27;s.  That is why it is called the &#x27;Silent Killer&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Word to the Wise... go to a healthy diet and stay away from Soda; Boxed and Canned Foods.  You will Stay Alive &amp; Healthy that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;God Bless...Be Well!</li>
            <li> The cream is lightly scented,  feels good on my skin - seems to soak in rather than sitting on the surface. My skin looks better. Crepeyness is not so noticeable. I use the cream all over along with the MSM soap. I like them a lot. I&#x27;ve been taking a teaspoon of sulphur in the mornings as well. The roughness on my hands has disappeared after trying all sorts of creams and soaps and vitamins for years.</li>
            <li> another cheap amazon gem as instores its very pricey compared !</li>
            <li> I bought this after coming across the supposed great benefits of MSM/ DMSO recently (and the fact that probably most people are now deficient in it), so am now taking OptiMSM orally and topically this. This cream seems to have good reviews on Amazon and was able to be shipped to Australia. I have been using it now for 2 weeks on skin (general and dermatitis issues), and also on nerve pains. Subjectively it feels nice but I can&#x27;t say I have noticed any other effects, yet? Like others, I would like to know how much MSM is in it, where the MSM comes from (China?), and even better would be OptiMSM type (the best most pure stuff as that is important in choosing MSM). A larger tub would also be great. I note it also has soybean oil in it - not sure if that raises GMO issues as I hear most soy in USA is GMO. I did try to order some more, but now found the price has gone up and they won&#x27;t now ship to Australia? So I ordered from another seller. Product arrived fine within 1-2 weeks. However I have also since found a product with I think higher and more pure levels of MSM/ DMSO for the therapeutic effect I need, and will also buy a roll on DMSO. Cheers. (I will update if I notice any more improved effects)</li>
            <li> Skin enhancer  Clearer  brighter  refreshed skin</li>
            <li> Delivery was very fast.  I haven&#x27;t used it for very long.  It does absorb quickly, no greasiness .  I think I will like this cream. I have sensitive skin and have had no problems.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm just thought it would be more of it!</li>
            <li> Better than any cosmetic company&#x27;s &#x27;wrinkle cream&#x27;! And I&#x27;m testing it on areas of psoriasis (don&#x27;t like the Dr.&#x27;s ointments) but it&#x27;s a little too soon to know if that&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It&#x27;s very nourishing and soothing. I have sensitive acne prone skin and so many creams don&#x27;t help my skin or would make my skin worst. The only cream I was able to use was total effects from Olay.. I decided to buy this cream because of some acne marks that I want filled in. I was scared it would make me break out but it hasn&#x27;t at all! In fact some pimples leave the next day when you wake up because of this cream. It&#x27;s not a cure but it is a great cream. Makes makeup go smoothly on as well. It&#x27;s matte as well. I also love the price. I think you should give this cream a try if you have acne prone and sensitive skin and some acne scars.. For acne scars you may need to needle or just add vitamnib c to them to get a full fill in because this cream won&#x27;t fully fill them in but it definitely will help. Also no need to worry about the Vitamin E making you break out because this cream seems to have a very small amount of it.</li>
            <li> Started using this cream with the soap from this company to see if it would help my skin.  Used last night, and I like it.  Will know more in a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> Love the way it feels</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream on my face every night as my night cream since February 2015, it feels light on my skin and has lightened the dark spot on my cheek,,,, It&#x27;s a small jar but I have just gotten down to the half way mark after 5 months of using every night. I always used very high priced creams but this one beats them all especially in cost!!!! Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Wow.... A no frills product that really delivers.  No breakouts and smooth skin.  My skin feels hydrated and I feel like it is healing any breakouts (one or two) or acne scarring that I have.  A great great product!  So happy that I found the reviews here otherwise I would have looked right past it.</li>
            <li> Nice comfortable cream for a slightly damaged skin area. Feels great.</li>
            <li> Excellent moisturizer...love it</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just me but it seems to make my skin browner.</li>
            <li> I was recommended this MSM cream for my lupus rash onmy face and chest. Within 3 days of using the cream, my rash was significantly reduced and within a week it was gone. I have tried prescription topical medications in the past with no luck. This cream is amazing! It is not at all greasy and it leaves your skin feeling baby soft. I&#x27;ve been ordering this cream when I get down to 1/4 of the tub so I do not run out. It is that nourishing!</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Product arrived on time.</li>
            <li> This is a light cream with no scent (very important feature for me), which is now my go-to cream for itchy skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome.  I switched to this brand after petroleum jelly was added to the ingredient list of my old MSM cream.  The AT Last Naturals cream is thick, but doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy.  Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t as impressed with this as other reviews I&#x27;ve read..I have awful dry skin and it did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> I disagree with reviewers who feel this product is too expensive.  I paid half the price for 2 oz. of this compared to 1.7 oz. of my regular moisturizer (Oil of Olay Regenerist).&lt;br /&gt;Pros: This cream goes on nice and smooth.  It did not cause my face to break out.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The product evaporates (or absorbs into the skin) after applying it. It left my face feeling taunt instead of smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I tried it, but I did not like it enough to buy again.</li>
            <li> Very nice cream. I use it for my neck.  It has a decent not overpowering smell and a nice fast soaking into skin consistency.</li>
            <li> This item is AMAZING. I found it by searching for lotion that worked for acne/acne prone skin. I have tried using proactive and other &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; skin products and they all made my face break out! This has cleared up my skin and keeps it moisturized! I have also noticed improvement in my acne marks and scars. I would recommend this to anyone who struggles with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer feel great after using the MSM soap</li>
