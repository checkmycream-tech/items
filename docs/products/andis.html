            <li>\\&quot;Dual voltage charger for worldwide use\\&quot; - unlike the chargers for my laptop, phone, and tablet; which can all safely be connected to 100 to 240 volts</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>(:)</li>
            <li>so good&lt;br /&gt;i love it, i recommend</li>
            <li>Why can&#x27;t they make a more durable guard?</li>
            <li>Was certainly expecting more from a brand promoted as made in USA!!</li>
            <li>The batteries are very good last with out charge for weeks.</li>
            <li>Pretty good cut , light weight, with a slim design fits well in my hand.</li>
            <li>Attachments are easy to get on and off and it comes with a ncie stroage pouch.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a versatile thing, trims my beard, I even used it to cut my hair once, but that did not go well, as the thing clogs easily.</li>
            <li>My husband said it worked just fine.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight</li>
            <li>It is cheap and that is what you get.</li>
            <li>with accessories inside then i enjoy using it.</li>
            <li>Works great, but wish charge would last longer.</li>
            <li>Very useful.</li>
            <li>I was excited</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t use the attachments, so I haven&#x27;t experienced the problems some other reviewers reported.</li>
            <li>It also does a tremendous finishing job on the hair cuts I do for my son.</li>
            <li>It works fine but the battery dies quickly when compared to my older version of this trimmer.</li>
            <li>This trimmer works as good as any other I have had with the benefit of coming with a dual voltage charger.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned cordless rechargeable trimmers before that performed better on their last leg than this one did right out of the box.</li>
            <li>I owned one that looked exactly like the trimmer in the photo (with a shorter blade)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love to demand my money back</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately the guards are a little cheaply made, he just broke his favorite guard (says 5 day?)</li>
            <li>Maybe the one I was shipped never had its blades sharpened or something, but it mainly pulls - it does not cut worth anything.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a Wahl in comparison and this unit is just as good,  if not better.  </li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>Got these for my husband for Christmas, and he really likes it.</li>
            <li>nice small size</li>
            <li>After several attempts to use this on different days - making sure it was full charged - the results were always the same</li>
            <li>do I have to purchase a whole new kit to get one guard???</li>
            <li>I switched from a regular hair clipper to an actual beard trimmer assuming it would do a better job.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer works well and is a decent quality.  </li>
            <li>I had high expectations after reading the reviews and decided to switch from Wahl to Andis.</li>
            <li>Would like it replaced with a new shaver!&lt;br /&gt;Marty Nowell&lt;br /&gt;3348281521</li>
            <li>This is exactly the kind of decision/mistake you don&#x27;t want to make when jet-lagged/traveling, or simply when tired and shaving in early morning.</li>
            <li>It far exceeds my expectations in terms of quality and effectiveness.</li>
            <li>So far the battery is holding up well</li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s just about two weeks since its being used so far</li>
            <li>Much, much better than any other trimmer I considered , some being considerably more expensive.</li>
            <li>The resulting cut is reasonable although it took a long time to get the job done.</li>
            <li>I got this for my husband to replace his old one, which finally gave out.</li>
            <li>The smaller size makes it easy to get into small spots on my face, but this trimmer pulls my hair often (ouch!)</li>
            <li>You only are left with a soft stubble</li>
    </ol>

            <li> You only are left with a soft stubble</li>
            <li> Also it does not cut stiff hair very close to skin if your trying to shape your facial hair.</li>
            <li> Like so many other trimmers, the plastic guides that go with this product are easily broken when traveling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a significant usability failure, especially when the Andis charger is also quite bulky compared to those for other devices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> long enough to comment on battery life.</li>
            <li> actual model being sold here is NOT the same one pictured in the photo, but rather, a similar looking Andis model that has a slightly longer blade.</li>
            <li> If you use it for cutting your beard, you should be safe.</li>
            <li> and doesn&#x27;t keep the charge long.</li>
            <li> It just takes a long time to charge.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a complete shave</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 2014 for chrissakes, put an actual 100-240v power supply in the damn thing or at least make the flip switch obvious and not hidden.</li>
            <li> It appears to be of above average quality, and makes a sometimes tedious personal grooming task almost fun.</li>
            <li> immediately burned out the power supply before getting a single use.  </li>
            <li> I have used the larger professional Andis trimmer for years but the teeth got broken in a recent trip.</li>
            <li> and I simply want to smash it into little bits for all that beard plucking pain</li>
            <li> This product was nothing of what I expected it did not trim or cut at all</li>
            <li> So the power plug is not really 100-240V supported.  </li>
            <li> he likes his new trimmers however they recently started cutting him it may be a simple adjustment of tightening the blades</li>
            <li> I find that the clippers almost lack power as you need to move them quite slowly in order to cut properly.</li>
            <li> It is flat flush flip switch which is hardly noticeable.  </li>
            <li> My previous Andis trimmer lasted about 8 years.</li>
            <li> My husband just loves this little shaver.  </li>
            <li> Never smooth and often grabby.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought these after reading a few reviews and have been using them for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t be his everyday trimmer</li>
            <li> and he used it everyday.</li>
            <li> Small but efficient.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so small and portable ...</li>
            <li> and I mean with a passion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Worst of all, it is not the same model depicted in the photo, which makes a hell-of a big difference if you are buying it online and can&#x27;t see it in person.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, the battery is old and will not charge even after 15 hours.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this product I actually don&#x27;t use it threw in trash</li>
            <li> /&gt;This model snags, cuts unevenly and is absolutely crap...</li>
            <li> Picking the wrong option permanently fries the charger.</li>
            <li> It can not make single pass without PULLING and SNAGGING your beard hair - and that is both very annoying and painful.</li>
            <li> but where it counts is the cutting edge</li>
            <li> its bad .but</li>
            <li> I have to say I was reasonably disappointed.</li>
            <li> well, I absolutely hate it...</li>
            <li> Terrible trimmer...</li>
            <li> This is the worst of all.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I switched from a regular hair clipper to an actual beard trimmer assuming it would do a better job.  The smaller size makes it easy to get into small spots on my face, but this trimmer pulls my hair often (ouch!) and doesn&#x27;t keep the charge long. I now just leave it plugged in when I use it.  Overall it doesn&#x27;t give the best trim and I don&#x27;t recommend it.  I would like to find a better product eventually.</li>
            <li> Terrible trimmer... just terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actual model being sold here is NOT the same one pictured in the photo, but rather, a similar looking Andis model that has a slightly longer blade. I owned one that looked exactly like the trimmer in the photo (with a shorter blade) and it was great. The one I purchased here from Amzaon.... well, I absolutely hate it... and I mean with a passion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model snags, cuts unevenly and is absolutely crap... Worst of all, it is not the same model depicted in the photo, which makes a hell-of a big difference if you are buying it online and can&#x27;t see it in person. Get it together Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 Star</li>
            <li> This trimmer is an excellent value. It far exceeds my expectations in terms of quality and effectiveness. It appears to be of above average quality, and makes a sometimes tedious personal grooming task almost fun. Much, much better than any other trimmer I considered , some being considerably more expensive.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is another Andis quality product. It&#x27;s light weight but where it counts is the cutting edge and that&#x27;s where Andis quality comes through. I keep my trimmer well lubed and it rewards me with a beard trim that doesn&#x27;t pull or pinch. So far the battery is holding up well but like all Ni-Cads in a year or two it will die. Then it will just run as a corded trimmer unless I take it apart and retrofit some NiMH batteries. There&#x27;s a good selection of beard guides that work well for me. For the price it&#x27;s a good trimmer.</li>
            <li> Small but efficient. Bought two as presents and both persons really love it. Although it&#x27;s just about two weeks since its being used so far I think it was a good buy.</li>
            <li> Works well! I enjoy being cordless! My man appreciates the convenience.</li>
            <li> I have owned many beard trimmers. This is the worst of all. It can not make single pass without PULLING and SNAGGING your beard hair - and that is both very annoying and painful. After several attempts to use this on different days - making sure it was full charged - the results were always the same and I simply want to smash it into little bits for all that beard plucking pain it has caused me... Maybe the one I was shipped never had its blades sharpened or something, but it mainly pulls - it does not cut worth anything. I&#x27;d love to demand my money back but I can&#x27;t figure out how.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  Good set of attachments.  For $20, you can&#x27;t beat it.  My previous Andis trimmer lasted about 8 years.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Dual voltage charger for worldwide use\\&quot; - unlike the chargers for my laptop, phone, and tablet; which can all safely be connected to 100 to 240 volts; the Andis 22725 requires you *manually* choose the power input. Picking the wrong option permanently fries the charger. This is exactly the kind of decision/mistake you don&#x27;t want to make when jet-lagged/traveling, or simply when tired and shaving in early morning. It&#x27;s a significant usability failure, especially when the Andis charger is also quite bulky compared to those for other devices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That aside, the \\&quot;raw\\&quot; trimmer works, and it&#x27;s cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use the attachments, so I haven&#x27;t experienced the problems some other reviewers reported. I also haven&#x27;t owned an Andis 22725 long enough to comment on battery life.</li>
            <li> awesome product and awesome quilty fast shipping and great price...</li>
            <li> It works good if you want to trim sideburns, longer and softer hair than beards or staches.  The guards pull stiffer hair when you trim.  Also it does not cut stiff hair very close to skin if your trying to shape your facial hair.</li>
            <li> I think this is a great trimmer for the price.  I&#x27;ve had a Wahl in comparison and this unit is just as good,  if not better.  Attachments are easy to get on and off and it comes with a ncie stroage pouch.</li>
            <li> This product don&#x27;t do  what it suppose to do, after trying the trimer, I windup using the cliper to finish the job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a versatile thing, trims my beard, I even used it to cut my hair once, but that did not go well, as the thing clogs easily. If you use it for cutting your beard, you should be safe.</li>
            <li> Quiet and works well.  Includes an abundance of accessories.  Love it.  I have used the larger professional Andis trimmer for years but the teeth got broken in a recent trip.</li>
            <li> I do a lot of international travel and was looking for a trimmer that I could use when traveling abroad without having to carry a voltage converter. It is weird that most off the shelf trimmers are not multi-voltage, but shavers are. Even from the same manufacturers. Do they think that people sporting a beard should not be traveling?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is great, has all the attachments and they fit perfectly. I am happy with it, and will recommend. Especially if you travel and would need to use it outside the US.</li>
            <li> Just never got a good beard trimming experience. Never smooth and often grabby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suggest checking out the Remington MB-200. I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Did not like it at all.</li>
            <li> Got these for my husband for Christmas, and he really likes it. He likes that he can go anywhere with it and use it in either bathroom, or just grab it and go if we go out of town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately the guards are a little cheaply made, he just broke his favorite guard (says 5 day?) and I can&#x27;t find the replacement for this one guard...do I have to purchase a whole new kit to get one guard??? Off to check out their website!</li>
            <li> My husband just loves this little shaver.  It also does a tremendous finishing job on the hair cuts I do for my son.</li>
            <li> It is cheap and that is what you get. I purchased it and worked for 4 months and battery started to lose charge.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this trimmer!</li>
            <li> This product was nothing of what I expected it did not trim or cut at all I was very disappointed in this product I actually don&#x27;t use it threw in trash</li>
            <li> Love it..works great... nice small size ..powerful.. good attachments..(:)</li>
            <li> I bought these after reading a few reviews and have been using them for a few weeks now. I had high expectations after reading the reviews and decided to switch from Wahl to Andis. I have to say I was reasonably disappointed. I find that the clippers almost lack power as you need to move them quite slowly in order to cut properly. The resulting cut is reasonable although it took a long time to get the job done. I&#x27;m on the fence with this product. Was certainly expecting more from a brand promoted as made in USA!!</li>
            <li> Did not cut one piece of hair on my face</li>
            <li> The precision on this razor is great for the money. It has a great amount of trim attachments as well.</li>
            <li> Pretty good cut , light weight, with a slim design fits well in my hand. It just takes a long time to charge.</li>
            <li> he likes his new trimmers however they recently started cutting him it may be a simple adjustment of tightening the blades</li>
            <li> This lasted six months before the battery went. Not so good.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, the battery is old and will not charge even after 15 hours. Would like it replaced with a new shaver!&lt;br /&gt;Marty Nowell&lt;br /&gt;3348281521</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband to replace his old one, which finally gave out. It works well and comes with everything needed.</li>
            <li> Very handy. The batteries are very good last with out charge for weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned cordless rechargeable trimmers before that performed better on their last leg than this one did right out of the box. Not enough power when fully charged to trim a \\&quot;light\\&quot; goatee without pulling at my facial hairs. Same power output when plugged in so I&#x27;m buying a Wahl.</li>
            <li> Battery life its bad .but do your funtion.</li>
            <li> Works good.  All pieces as described.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so small and portable ... with accessories inside then i enjoy using it. so good&lt;br /&gt;i love it, i recommend</li>
            <li> This is meant to trim and shape your beard and not for shaving. Very useful.</li>
            <li> So the power plug is not really 100-240V supported.  It is flat flush flip switch which is hardly noticeable.  I was excited when I got this thing, grabbed it out of the box and plugged it in to get the charge up .... immediately burned out the power supply before getting a single use.  It&#x27;s 2014 for chrissakes, put an actual 100-240v power supply in the damn thing or at least make the flip switch obvious and not hidden.</li>
            <li> It works fine but the battery dies quickly when compared to my older version of this trimmer.</li>
            <li> We purchased this because its dual voltage and we were traveling Europe for 3 weeks.  My husband said it worked just fine.  It wouldn&#x27;t be his everyday trimmer but it worked great for our trip.  Zero complaints.  I believe we only charged it once and he used it everyday.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done. I was paying $20 a month to have my hair cut.</li>
            <li> Like so many other trimmers, the plastic guides that go with this product are easily broken when traveling. Why can&#x27;t they make a more durable guard? Otherwise, a good product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a complete shave but it does the job. You only are left with a soft stubble</li>
            <li> Works great, but wish charge would last longer.</li>
            <li> I want to returned it but I dont have the box anymore. they dont cut well and jamed.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works as good as any other I have had with the benefit of coming with a dual voltage charger.  I travel overseas often and a dual voltage charger is a must and this is the only trimmer I could find that listed that in the product description.  The trimmer works well and is a decent quality.  I recommend for international travelers.</li>
