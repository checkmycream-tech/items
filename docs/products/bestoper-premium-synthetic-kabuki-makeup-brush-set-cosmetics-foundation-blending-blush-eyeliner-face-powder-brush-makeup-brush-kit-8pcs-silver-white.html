            <li>beautiful brushes that are very soft and apply very smooth!</li>
            <li>They are very silky so more ideal for liquid product, or blending/blurring.</li>
            <li>was so excited considering most of the good reviews, but I do not recommended this set.</li>
            <li>so nice to work with fresh good quality brushes, love them</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking about purchasing more.</li>

            <li>Love them</li>
            <li>I love the feel of these brushes.</li>
            <li>More that you can expect for just 12 bucks.</li>
            <li>I would get more of these brushes.</li>
            <li>Mostly those with one star and saw a lot of ppl complaining about the chemical smell( which means they are sanitised ) and the brushes falling apart.</li>
            <li>The big brushes are the best!</li>
            <li>Im not a pro make artist but having all these brushes sure do make me feel like i am.</li>
            <li>Am in love with this broshes</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li>love these brushes, helped my foundation apply smoothly!</li>
            <li>They are better then</li>
            <li>Spend $5 more and purchase the Berry Set from BH Cosmetics.</li>
            <li>Friendly advice, save your money!</li>
            <li>These brushes are great and they feel very soft .</li>
            <li>They look very nice and are very soft.</li>
            <li>They shipped it very quickly.  </li>
            <li>They did have a strong odor when I took them out of the bag.</li>
            <li>Just air them out and they&#x27;ll be fine other then that I&#x27;m satisfied with them.!!!</li>
            <li>I cleaned the brushes and they were fine.</li>
            <li>The brushes them self are very soft and feel like good quality.</li>
            <li>Brushes for your eyes are HUGE.  </li>
            <li>They are so cheaply glued.</li>
            <li>It was worth the money and more I would buy them again.</li>
            <li>They are great quality and more than what I expected for the price.</li>
            <li>So worth the price!</li>
            <li>I clean them after each use</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and the quality is great so far.</li>
            <li>They are so amazing soft!</li>
            <li>Love them so much.</li>
            <li>But I attended hair skin and nail academy for a year full time.</li>
            <li>It goes away quickly.</li>
            <li>;0( anyways.. I ended up fixing it with super glue.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re definitely the best on the net.</li>
            <li>I washes the brushes with a gentle soap, as I would recommend washing them before use anyways!!</li>
            <li>Smaller brushes are amazing dor concealer, contouring with precision.</li>
            <li>Worth it.</li>
            <li>These brushes are definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>The brushes are nice and dense, but after a couple uses the handles fell off, I had to glue the handles back on....</li>
            <li>Came super fast!</li>
            <li>and they are better than the bare mineral brushes everyone raves about!</li>
            <li>they arrived real quick and they&#x27;re thick and so soft for a great price</li>
            <li>However, not worth the money for ONE good brush.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>when I opened them for the first time one brush has something on it.</li>
            <li>They came a day early and they do have a smell to them but just lightly rinse them</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I received these brushes very quicky!</li>
            <li>I wish some of the brushes were a bit smaller, in the pictures they look more petite.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are soft, shedd free, makes your makeup look flawlesssssss.</li>
            <li>Nothing beats the price thought, so far when I pull there no shedding and they come in a cheaply made travelers bag; in my case this will end up in the trash, but some might like it.</li>
            <li>Exactly what i want it 🙌</li>
            <li>I have bought many sets of these makeup brushes in different colors.  </li>
            <li>other than that they seem like good, decent brushes</li>
            <li>so I only use the large concealer brush, which I&#x27;m in love with.</li>
            <li>Super glue made this product 3 stars, but you shouldn&#x27;t have to use glue on something that is brand new.</li>
            <li>So basically I got three large flat top brushes.</li>
            <li>Great price for amateur or professional makeup enthusiast.</li>
            <li>They were super soft.</li>
            <li>Its super soft as well</li>
            <li>Only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because they smell SO strong.</li>
            <li>Super soft, the don&#x27;t shed, they survived the first wash and stay as new as they came.</li>
            <li>Problem was that they shed and arent very sturdy.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these!</li>
            <li>very thick.they get a lot of product.</li>
            <li>I do wish they were slightly smaller so they would fit in my makeup bag without the bristles being smoshed.</li>
            <li>fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Which doesnt really bother me...</li>
            <li>They turned out to be better than expected.  </li>
            <li>The brush heads broke off the handle on all of them straight out of the box.</li>
            <li>For the price you really can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li>I was excited to open them!</li>
            <li>The brushes are nice and soft, however, when they arrived the first thing you notice is the harsh smell.</li>
            <li>They are decent brushes&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>When I opened my packages I was super stoked to finally receive them!!!!!</li>
            <li>The brushes are fit for it&#x27;s intended use although I will agree with some other review the eyeshadow brushes are a bit large so</li>
            <li>The bristles are very sturdy as well as soft.</li>
            <li>These are so soft and dense and very well made.</li>
            <li>so soft and very hight quality.  </li>
            <li>They are setting out to dry right now!</li>
            <li>I noticed alot of people are saying the eye brushes are too big, but they are great size to me, not to big not to small.</li>
            <li>oh well live</li>
            <li>Very soft.</li>
            <li>Very professional like brushes.</li>
            <li>Soft and well blended!</li>
            <li>They are super thick (thicker than my eco tools brushes) and super soft.</li>
            <li>The large angled brush is barely angled, and the large rounded brush is really flat.</li>
            <li>They are extremely soft and dense.</li>
            <li>These are dense and soft.</li>
            <li>They are extremely soft and I haven&#x27;t seen any shedding yet.</li>
            <li>They are so soft and blend my foundation into my skin so well</li>
            <li>Their soft and durable.</li>
            <li>Bristles are super soft and brushes are heavy.</li>
            <li>Last but not least the topper on the cake</li>
            <li>The small brushes really are too large to use on your eyes</li>
            <li>Hardly any fallout.they&#x27;re smaller than what I expected but still amazing.</li>
            <li>They do have a slight odor upon arrival, but the stench went away after the first cleaning.</li>
            <li>I ordered RED and got hot pink!</li>
            <li>They do have a little shedding at first and the smell is just the plastic wrapping,  </li>
            <li>, like other&#x27;s have said, they did have a heavy sent you have to clean them.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend black since I feel they would get dirty quickly (mines are clean so far).</li>

            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I received these brushes very quicky!</li>
            <li> I wish some of the brushes were a bit smaller, in the pictures they look more petite.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are soft, shedd free, makes your makeup look flawlesssssss.</li>
            <li> Nothing beats the price thought, so far when I pull there no shedding and they come in a cheaply made travelers bag; in my case this will end up in the trash, but some might like it.</li>
            <li> Exactly what i want it 🙌</li>
            <li> I have bought many sets of these makeup brushes in different colors.  </li>
            <li> other than that they seem like good, decent brushes</li>
            <li> so I only use the large concealer brush, which I&#x27;m in love with.</li>
            <li> Super glue made this product 3 stars, but you shouldn&#x27;t have to use glue on something that is brand new.</li>
            <li> So basically I got three large flat top brushes.</li>
            <li> Great price for amateur or professional makeup enthusiast.</li>
            <li> They were super soft.</li>
            <li> Its super soft as well</li>
            <li> Only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because they smell SO strong.</li>
            <li> Super soft, the don&#x27;t shed, they survived the first wash and stay as new as they came.</li>
            <li> Problem was that they shed and arent very sturdy.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these!</li>
            <li> very thick.they get a lot of product.</li>
            <li> I do wish they were slightly smaller so they would fit in my makeup bag without the bristles being smoshed.</li>
            <li> fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Which doesnt really bother me...</li>
            <li> They turned out to be better than expected.  </li>
            <li> The brush heads broke off the handle on all of them straight out of the box.</li>
            <li> For the price you really can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> I was excited to open them!</li>
            <li> The brushes are nice and soft, however, when they arrived the first thing you notice is the harsh smell.</li>
            <li> They are decent brushes&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> When I opened my packages I was super stoked to finally receive them!!!!!</li>
            <li> The brushes are fit for it&#x27;s intended use although I will agree with some other review the eyeshadow brushes are a bit large so</li>
            <li> The bristles are very sturdy as well as soft.</li>
            <li> These are so soft and dense and very well made.</li>
            <li> so soft and very hight quality.  </li>
            <li> They are setting out to dry right now!</li>
            <li> I noticed alot of people are saying the eye brushes are too big, but they are great size to me, not to big not to small.</li>
            <li> oh well live</li>
            <li> Very soft.</li>
            <li> Very professional like brushes.</li>
            <li> Soft and well blended!</li>
            <li> They are super thick (thicker than my eco tools brushes) and super soft.</li>
            <li> The large angled brush is barely angled, and the large rounded brush is really flat.</li>
            <li> They are extremely soft and dense.</li>
            <li> These are dense and soft.</li>
            <li> They are extremely soft and I haven&#x27;t seen any shedding yet.</li>
            <li> They are so soft and blend my foundation into my skin so well</li>
            <li> Their soft and durable.</li>
            <li> Bristles are super soft and brushes are heavy.</li>
            <li> Last but not least the topper on the cake</li>
            <li> The small brushes really are too large to use on your eyes</li>
            <li> Hardly any fallout.they&#x27;re smaller than what I expected but still amazing.</li>
            <li> They do have a slight odor upon arrival, but the stench went away after the first cleaning.</li>
            <li> I ordered RED and got hot pink!</li>
            <li> They do have a little shedding at first and the smell is just the plastic wrapping,  </li>
            <li> , like other&#x27;s have said, they did have a heavy sent you have to clean them.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend black since I feel they would get dirty quickly (mines are clean so far).</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting them to be so large especially since I have small eye area.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that the eye one are too big for my eyes, I mainly use they small brushes to contour my nose and only use one for my eyes.</li>
            <li> They look like they wont last a long time.</li>
            <li> They are heavy and the bristles are very soft.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that all the brushes are pretty big an fluffy, there is no variation in application of makeup because of this.</li>
            <li> Minor issues from the get go.</li>
            <li> I have the black set for work and the white set for my personal use.</li>
            <li> I was actually having trouble deciding which set I should go for, I actually accidentally ordered this!</li>
            <li> One handle is loose.</li>
            <li> Nothing is loose or falling apart.</li>
            <li> Bought a very similar set in black and gold and they didn&#x27;t even compare.</li>
            <li> My favorites are the fluffy smaller brushes!</li>
            <li> They are very dense and I have not experienced any shedding.  </li>
            <li> Really do not like these brushes</li>
            <li> I Need to watch them after the glue has dried from putting one back together.</li>
            <li> They are soft but thick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a makeup artist, amongst other things.</li>
            <li> but I know that kinda thing does bother other people.</li>
            <li> First off, they give off a very bad smell, one of the first things I noticed.</li>
            <li> ( I honestly do not care cuz you can easily fix with crazy glue but other</li>
            <li> Is it possible to give negative stars?</li>
            <li> any pro line of makeup brushes on the market and their one brush set costs less then one pro brush.  </li>
            <li> I have quite a few years under my belt using this knowledge , a few testing products and tools for my salon.</li>
            <li> and I use them everyday with no shedding.</li>
            <li> the hairs of the brush are firmly intact.</li>
            <li> Not a huge deal.</li>
            <li> This would usually be half of the price of one very small brush.</li>
            <li> I use them everyday!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure where to begin</li>
            <li> The quality is less than poor.</li>
            <li> If your not sure If you should buy this, dont be, buy them!</li>
            <li> By the way, they are hard as a rock!</li>
            <li> Plu 2 of the brushes where broken.  </li>
            <li> I took them out of the package and they were BROKEN!</li>
            <li> Very poor quality product.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with these brushes.</li>
            <li> Awful!!!!</li>
            <li> Just received this today and the smell so horrible.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Excellent quality brushes,  even comparable to some high end brushes I have. The bristles are very sturdy as well as soft. I&#x27;m thinking about purchasing more.</li>
            <li> one of them came up defective</li>
            <li> Hello,&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a makeup artist based in Chicago and I love these brushes! I purchased them on Friday and received them in the mail on Monday. They do have a slight odor upon arrival, but the stench went away after the first cleaning. They are extremely soft and dense. I have the black set for work and the white set for my personal use. This was a great buy and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone... Even frugal a MUA such as myself!!!</li>
            <li> These brushes are AMAZING!!!  If you&#x27;re like me, you read these ratings and are still sketchy,..DON&#x27;T BE! These are so soft and dense and very well made. I pulled on the bristles and none came out. I can&#x27;t wait to use them. They are beautiful. Great price for amateur or professional makeup enthusiast.</li>
            <li> No shedding after over a dozen washes. These are dense and soft. I use the smaller brushes for applying products from &amp;#34;pots&amp;#34; so I don&#x27;t have to use my fingers. I will be buying these again. Bought a very similar set in black and gold and they didn&#x27;t even compare.</li>
            <li> Absolutely great quality. Love them so much. Very soft. Very easy to apply cosmetic products with. Thank you to seller and Amazon also.</li>
            <li> Unbeatable value! Better quality than the price reflects. Smaller brushes are amazing dor concealer, contouring with precision. (Around nose especially) and blending. Highly recommend to anyone, even great for gifting!</li>
            <li> They are decent brushes&lt;br /&gt;But when I opened them for the first time one brush has something on it. Like some kind of liquid that has some bristles stuck together.&lt;br /&gt;But other than that they seem like good, decent brushes</li>
            <li> I really loved these brushes. They were super soft. Now, they are falling apart.</li>
            <li> Great quality for the price</li>
            <li> They came a day early and they do have a smell to them but just lightly rinse them and you&#x27;re good to go. I am very satisfied with these brushes! They are great quality and more than what I expected for the price.</li>
            <li> I really love these brushes! Makeup goes on great &amp; brushes are durable. I would recommend,  good quality &amp; great price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a makeup artist, amongst other things. But I attended hair skin and nail academy for a year full time. I have quite a few years under my belt using this knowledge , a few testing products and tools for my salon. I must say I am amazed with the quality and sturdiness of these brushes especially at this price. This would usually be half of the price of one very small brush. Wonderful</li>
            <li> Great brush set, like other&#x27;s have said, they did have a heavy sent you have to clean them.  One handle is loose. However they are VERY good quality and have been easy to clean and great to apply my makeup. They are not cheapo. Worth it.</li>
            <li> They look very nice and are very soft. They shipped it very quickly.  Problem was that they shed and arent very sturdy. They look like they wont last a long time. I also feel like it was overpriced because for the price that i paid ,i can find better quality brushes.</li>
            <li> so nice to work with fresh good quality brushes, love them</li>
            <li> When I opened my packages I was super stoked to finally receive them!!!!! Fast shipping! But the only downside was one of the brushes had came off:( I honestly do not care cuz you can easily fix with crazy glue but other then that I am in love with how perfect and soft they are!!!! They do smell a bit of paint but that&#x27;s no bother to me. Just air them out and they&#x27;ll be fine other then that I&#x27;m satisfied with them.!!!</li>
            <li> These are great brushes. They are well made and the bristols do not fall out like the others I have purchased. The apply great and wash good too!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. I received them within 3 days and I use them everyday with no shedding. Its super soft as well</li>
            <li> Two of these brushes already broke. They are so cheaply glued.</li>
            <li> THESE BRUSHES ARE VERY USEFUL AND WORK LIKE A CHARM !!! HAPPY CUSTOMER!!!!!!</li>
            <li> These brushes are great and they feel very soft . Product goes on nicely. Very professional like brushes. And for the price their a steal. Love them</li>
            <li> I ordered these about a week ago and they have already arrived! I love the feel of these brushes. They are extremely soft and I haven&#x27;t seen any shedding yet. I highly recommend these!</li>
            <li> Got my brushes in 9 days. Bristles are super soft and brushes are heavy. They did have a strong odor when I took them out of the bag. I cleaned the brushes and they were fine.</li>
            <li> Great product! More that you can expect for just 12 bucks. Amazing, really amazing product! Blends foundation so well! Soooo well! My favorites are the fluffy smaller brushes! Great for eye shadow too!</li>
            <li> Soft and well blended!</li>
            <li> Brushes for your eyes are HUGE.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting them to be so large especially since I have small eye area.</li>
            <li> these work amazing. They are very thick.they get a lot of product. Hardly any fallout.they&#x27;re smaller than what I expected but still amazing. I would get more of these brushes. It was worth the money and more I would buy them again.</li>
            <li> I was happy to receive them and happier to see they were all intact. I read some of the reviews. Mostly those with one star and saw a lot of ppl complaining about the chemical smell( which means they are sanitised ) and the brushes falling apart. Well I&#x27;m elated to say not one brush came in pieces and the hairs of the brush are firmly intact. The brushes are fit for it&#x27;s intended use although I will agree with some other review the eyeshadow brushes are a bit large so</li>
            <li> beautiful brushes that are very soft and apply very smooth! comparable to my Sigma or MAC brushes. would purchase again for gift or personal use.</li>
            <li> LOVEEE the brushes! I have washed them 4 times and there has been no shedding! They are super thick (thicker than my eco tools brushes) and super soft. The only thing is that the eye one are too big for my eyes, I mainly use they small brushes to contour my nose and only use one for my eyes. The big brushes are the best! (I got mine in white) I would recommend black since I feel they would get dirty quickly (mines are clean so far). Came super fast!</li>
            <li> Awful!!!! They reeked with chemicals!  I just tossed they in the can.  Plu 2 of the brushes where broken.  I went to Ulta and purchased IT makeup brushes...so soft and very hight quality.  I don&#x27;t know why I thought I could get a nice set for 10 bucks...oh well live n learn!</li>
            <li> Love love love these brushes!! They are so soft and blend my foundation into my skin so well</li>
            <li> These brushes are definitely worth the money. Im not a pro make artist but having all these brushes sure do make me feel like i am. Their soft and durable. I do wish they were slightly smaller so they would fit in my makeup bag without the bristles being smoshed.</li>
            <li> Am in love with this broshes</li>
            <li> great brushes. good packaging. fast shipping. would order again.</li>
            <li> Great brushes for the price</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing! I was actually having trouble deciding which set I should go for, I actually accidentally ordered this! Im glad i did! These are great! They are soft but thick. I noticed alot of people are saying the eye brushes are too big, but they are great size to me, not to big not to small. They are also great for contouring my nose and concealing. All of these brushes blend makeup so well and make it look flawless! If your not sure If you should buy this, dont be, buy them! They are great for what you pay for!</li>
            <li> Great brushes. Only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because they smell SO strong. They smell like permanent markers or spray paint. Which doesnt really bother me...but I know that kinda thing does bother other people. Just trying to warn yall!</li>
            <li> I honestly loved these. Super soft, the don&#x27;t shed, they survived the first wash and stay as new as they came. Would repurchase in the future!</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing!!!! Especially for the price. I use them everyday!</li>
            <li> These brushes are good for the price. They are very silky so more ideal for liquid product, or blending/blurring. They do have a little shedding at first and the smell is just the plastic wrapping,  It goes away quickly. Good buy for 10 bucks.</li>
            <li> I only bought these brushes for the color ad price. They turned out to be better than expected.  I especially like the buffing brush.  only complaint is that all the brushes are pretty big an fluffy, there is no variation in application of makeup because of this.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality product. The brush heads broke off the handle on all of them straight out of the box. Super glue made this product 3 stars, but you shouldn&#x27;t have to use glue on something that is brand new.</li>
            <li> I love these! So worth the price! I clean them after each use and I have used them daily since I bought them and they are better than the bare mineral brushes everyone raves about!</li>
            <li> These brushes are awesome.  They are very dense and I have not experienced any shedding.  You can definitely create that airbrushed finish with them.  They&#x27;re my go to brushes.</li>
            <li> Really do not like these brushes</li>
            <li> I received these brushes very quicky! I was excited to open them! First off, they give off a very bad smell, one of the first things I noticed. I then took them out of their individual packaging as one of the handles was not attached to the brush!!! ;0( anyways.. I ended up fixing it with super glue. Not a huge deal. I washes the brushes with a gentle soap, as I would recommend washing them before use anyways!! They are setting out to dry right now! Can&#x27;t wait to try them out tomorrow! The brushes them self are very soft and feel like good quality. I wish some of the brushes were a bit smaller, in the pictures they look more petite.  All in all...Minor issues from the get go. But I think they are a good buy for the price.</li>
            <li> 5 star product.... i loved them ...great quality for the price:)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love. ..I ordered on Thursday and received them on Friday. The brushes are soft, shedd free, makes your makeup look flawlesssssss. I would recommend this to EVERYONE!</li>
            <li> I just received these brushes and they look wonderful. They are heavy and the bristles are very soft. Shipping was fast and the quality is great so far. Nothing is loose or falling apart. For the price you really can&#x27;t beat it. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Ordered on 2/2/2015 received on 2/5/2015. 8 brushes received all individually wrapped. But I thought I would have a smaller brush for doing eyeshawdow. So for now, I&#x27;ll give four stars, after I use the products i&#x27;ll probably be back to rate it a 5.</li>
            <li> Just received this today and the smell so horrible.  Its smells like gasoline.</li>
            <li> Beautiful inexpensive brushes. Must have!</li>
            <li> I cannot tell the difference between these brushes and my Sigma brushes! Except my Sigma brushes were $80.00 MORE!</li>
            <li> The brushes are nice and soft, however, when they arrived the first thing you notice is the harsh smell. I Need to watch them after the glue has dried from putting one back together. Nothing beats the price thought, so far when I pull there no shedding and they come in a cheaply made travelers bag; in my case this will end up in the trash, but some might like it. A friend of mine is a make-up artist and he recormended those brushes so that is why I bought them.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with these brushes. The large angled brush is barely angled, and the large rounded brush is really flat. So basically I got three large flat top brushes. The small brushes really are too large to use on your eyes so I only use the large concealer brush, which I&#x27;m in love with. However, not worth the money for ONE good brush.&lt;br /&gt;I was so excited considering most of the good reviews, but I do not recommended this set.</li>
            <li> Is it possible to give negative stars? I&#x27;m not sure where to begin but I&#x27;ll start with the brushes wreaking like paint and gasoline... yuck! I ordered RED and got hot pink! The brushes literally have no structure to them, its basically a stick with &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; at the end. SAVE your money! Last but not least the topper on the cake, They&#x27;re ALL THE SAME! I sat there for 30+ minute trying to distinguish which brush had which duty only to come to the fact that they&#x27;re all the same just dyed differently. Friendly advice, save your money! By the way, they are hard as a rock!</li>
            <li> Just got these today.  They are so amazing soft! I cannot wait till use them. follow my makeup page on instagram and facebk at meangirllaura for more makeup stuff!</li>
            <li> love these brushes, helped my foundation apply smoothly!</li>
            <li> Exactly what i want it 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼</li>
            <li> Oh my glob!! Never been happier about makeup brushes until now. Best ones I&#x27;ve bought they arrived real quick and they&#x27;re thick and so soft for a great price oh my goodness. I love them!!</li>
            <li> I have bought many sets of these makeup brushes in different colors.  They are better then any pro line of makeup brushes on the market and their one brush set costs less then one pro brush.  Thank you BESTOPE you&#x27;re definitely the best on the net.</li>
            <li> I would pay YOU not to purchase these!!!! The quality is less than poor. I never had the chance to use them. I took them out of the package and they were BROKEN! Spend $5 more and purchase the Berry Set from BH Cosmetics.</li>
            <li> The brushes are nice and dense, but after a couple uses the handles fell off, I had to glue the handles back on....</li>
