            <li>Because I do much of my shopping through Amazon, I was so glad to see it on the website.  </li>
            <li>I based my choices mainly on the reviews, which is why I felt safe buying this one.  </li>
            <li>tremendously received.</li>
            <li>It is long lasting and wonderful smelling.</li>
            <li>I love the initial scent and feel like I&#x27;m starting the day with a pleasant introduction to others instead of an onslaught of overpowering fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Classy but fun light scent I can wear anytime and enjoy all day.</li>
            <li>A lite fresh sent.</li>
            <li>I keep it in the refrigerator and spray cool mist on hot days.</li>
            <li>I wanted something fresh with a Spring floral twist!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It was great to find this so much less than it is sold in the stores!  </li>
            <li>Although my two daughters love this clean scent, it does not smell that same way on me.</li>
            <li>Price was right  </li>
            <li>you aren&#x27;t that familiar with because it is so soft and just makes you smell clean.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume, it&#x27;s such a soft feminine scent, I use it all the time and get many compliments on it.</li>
            <li>Soft but a very noticed fragrance when worn.&lt;br /&gt;Price is much better then department stores.&lt;br /&gt;Delivered</li>
            <li>I have been wearing it for years and the price through here was very reasonable.  </li>
            <li>Very real gardenia smell.</li>
            <li>This is not the same original light scent.  </li>
            <li>Sweet lily of the valley main note with a bit of lilac.</li>
            <li>, that is why I still keep this as one of several perfumes I love wearing.</li>
            <li>Very upset!</li>
            <li>it was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>I was married in a Jessica Mcclintock dress but don&#x27;t let that prejudice get in the way of this review.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is one of my favorite daily fragrances.</li>
            <li>Smells rich and classy also try Brilliance by Jessica, they just can&#x27;t keep it in stock.</li>
            <li>product arrived quickly and in brand new condition.</li>
            <li>Once upon a time, they made a body powder and large puff</li>
            <li>I will say that once it dries down the scent turns from bug spray to a very strong floral scent.  </li>
            <li>Some men have stopped by to specifically say how much they like it.  </li>
            <li>I really like sent&#x27;s with lemon nodes and Jessica McClintock has nailed it.</li>
            <li>Two of the three I really like; not so with this</li>
            <li>I was very upset when I received the perfume...</li>
            <li>What a dissappointment, this perfume doesn&#x27;t seem to be the real one.</li>
            <li>Fast service</li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife and really notice when she wears it.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Celia</li>
            <li>but I think its a knock off product and not the real Jessica McClintock perfume.</li>
            <li>It is very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>I believe this perfume is for a more mature woman than for the younger girls!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve loved and used this cologne for a number of years, but almost didn&#x27;t order it because of some of the negative comments.</li>
            <li>It is a soft scent of flowers and a bit of citrus that is not overpowering and just right for the summer.</li>
            <li>It smells better than any other perfume I&#x27;ve ever smelled.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much lighter than the original that I have, and the scent doesn&#x27;t last more than a few minutes.</li>
            <li>I also occasionally smoke and i spitz this on after a quick one.</li>
            <li>It goes for almost twice the price at your high end retailers, amazon dot com&lt;br /&gt;has</li>
            <li>I usually wear more aggressive scents like Evny, Chance or Marc Jacobs and this is so much softer</li>
            <li>After moving to a new state, I ran out and could never find it in any store where I was living.  </li>
            <li>Surfing the web on day, I came across it and new</li>
            <li>Now, I can leave one in California and take one to where I live or travel.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a new fragrance and thought I&#x27;d give it another try.  </li>
            <li>This is very light, not one of those heavy scents that give you a headache!</li>
            <li>no substitute the real deal I ordered this for 4 different people</li>
            <li>The department stores quit carrying Jessica and the last time I purchased it it cost 2-3 times as much.</li>
            <li>Everything looks the same but on the bottom of the bottle it does not state it was formulated specifically for Jessica McClintock as the bottle of real stuff I have states.</li>
            <li>However, the scent seems to be much lighter, so I&#x27;m wondering if this item has been in stock too long on Amazon&#x27;s shelf.  </li>
            <li>Very femanine, and long lasting.</li>
            <li>the smell is great, does not make me sick to wear it.</li>
            <li>I assure you that this is the same product, with the same scent, in the same packaging that I have purchased at high end department stores.</li>
            <li>This perfume is a stronger soft floral that last a long time when you wear it.  </li>

            <li> it was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> I was married in a Jessica Mcclintock dress but don&#x27;t let that prejudice get in the way of this review.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is one of my favorite daily fragrances.</li>
            <li> Smells rich and classy also try Brilliance by Jessica, they just can&#x27;t keep it in stock.</li>
            <li> product arrived quickly and in brand new condition.</li>
            <li> Once upon a time, they made a body powder and large puff</li>
            <li> I will say that once it dries down the scent turns from bug spray to a very strong floral scent.  </li>
            <li> Some men have stopped by to specifically say how much they like it.  </li>
            <li> I really like sent&#x27;s with lemon nodes and Jessica McClintock has nailed it.</li>
            <li> Two of the three I really like; not so with this</li>
            <li> I was very upset when I received the perfume...</li>
            <li> What a dissappointment, this perfume doesn&#x27;t seem to be the real one.</li>
            <li> Fast service</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and really notice when she wears it.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Celia</li>
            <li> but I think its a knock off product and not the real Jessica McClintock perfume.</li>
            <li> It is very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I believe this perfume is for a more mature woman than for the younger girls!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved and used this cologne for a number of years, but almost didn&#x27;t order it because of some of the negative comments.</li>
            <li> It is a soft scent of flowers and a bit of citrus that is not overpowering and just right for the summer.</li>
            <li> It smells better than any other perfume I&#x27;ve ever smelled.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much lighter than the original that I have, and the scent doesn&#x27;t last more than a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I also occasionally smoke and i spitz this on after a quick one.</li>
            <li> It goes for almost twice the price at your high end retailers, amazon dot com&lt;br /&gt;has</li>
            <li> I usually wear more aggressive scents like Evny, Chance or Marc Jacobs and this is so much softer</li>
            <li> After moving to a new state, I ran out and could never find it in any store where I was living.  </li>
            <li> Surfing the web on day, I came across it and new</li>
            <li> Now, I can leave one in California and take one to where I live or travel.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a new fragrance and thought I&#x27;d give it another try.  </li>
            <li> This is very light, not one of those heavy scents that give you a headache!</li>
            <li> no substitute the real deal I ordered this for 4 different people</li>
            <li> The department stores quit carrying Jessica and the last time I purchased it it cost 2-3 times as much.</li>
            <li> Everything looks the same but on the bottom of the bottle it does not state it was formulated specifically for Jessica McClintock as the bottle of real stuff I have states.</li>
            <li> However, the scent seems to be much lighter, so I&#x27;m wondering if this item has been in stock too long on Amazon&#x27;s shelf.  </li>
            <li> Very femanine, and long lasting.</li>
            <li> the smell is great, does not make me sick to wear it.</li>
            <li> I assure you that this is the same product, with the same scent, in the same packaging that I have purchased at high end department stores.</li>
            <li> This perfume is a stronger soft floral that last a long time when you wear it.  </li>
            <li> I started wearing this when I was in my late 30&#x27;s (now almost 50) and noticed I was always being told that I smelled so pretty</li>
            <li> The frangrance does not last on my skin very long</li>
            <li> Quite disappointed as the scent is not the same as the many that I&#x27;ve purchase from Macy&#x27;s or Nordstrom stores!</li>
            <li> and I was a little skeptical because Jessica McClintock always reminded me of bad prom dresses, but I love it so much I quickly finished the first bottle</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed when it arrived with the box labeled &amp;#34;tester&amp;#34; and it did not even have a top on the bottle--only a cardboard tube.</li>
            <li> I previously got ripped off using another&lt;br</li>
            <li> For me it&#x27;s too heavy once it dries down</li>
            <li> This perfume is a little too flowery smelling for me.  </li>
            <li> I cannot wear heavy perfume at all.</li>
            <li> Think this is not a genuine Jessica Mcclintock.</li>
            <li> I gave to my wife as my gift, but she told me that this not a genuine Jessica Mcclintock.</li>
            <li> I ordered a small bottle to take on a trip.</li>
            <li> I usually pay $65.00 for this size.</li>
            <li> It is overpowering, heavy, and I found it sickening sweet.  </li>
            <li> would recommend this as a daily use, casual scent.</li>
            <li> This is one of my old time favorites- can&#x27;t go wrong with this signature scent!</li>
            <li> It seriously smells like raid bug spray.  </li>
            <li> My co-workers noticed the perfume immediately, which is not a good sign.</li>
            <li> I live overseas, and I hated having to pack the bottle to go and forth all the time.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this was not the scent that I thought it was when I ordered it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, since I tossed the packaging and shipping info, I&#x27;m assuming that I cannot return it.</li>
            <li> , so I gave it a go!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not particularly impressed with the scent.  </li>
            <li> I got a bad one or what</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed that Amazon doesn&#x27;t specify that it&#x27;s a fake.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> It is very unfortunate that Amazon does not allow returns or exchange for perfumes!</li>
            <li> but the scent is horrible!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This perfume does not even smell close to the \\&quot;real\\&quot; Jessica Mcclintock perfume.  YES!  I am requesting a full refund.  I will not buy from this person again.</li>
            <li> I previously got ripped off using another&lt;br /&gt;company, so was so happy when all worked out&lt;br /&gt;with this service - Thank-you!</li>
            <li> I have worn this perfume for years.  After moving to a new state, I ran out and could never find it in any store where I was living.  Surfing the web on day, I came across it and new I had to buy it.  I love the aroma.  I could not pass up the price.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Jessica Mcclintock perfume, but dread paying the department store price.  What a find this was.  Delivery was prompt and I&#x27;m thrilled with the perfume.</li>
            <li> This is the only scent I wear, and I get compliments on it all the time.  Some men have stopped by to specifically say how much they like it.  It is floral and should be applied with a light touch, because the scent carries well.  It also lasts well, for 4 - 6 hours.</li>
            <li> I have worn this parfume ever since she came out with it. It is still my favorite!</li>
            <li> Sweet lily of the valley main note with a bit of lilac. Classy but fun light scent I can wear anytime and enjoy all day. Perfect for everyday, work, and most evening events.</li>
            <li> Great price for this gorgeous fragrance.</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle of this 2 years ago at Nordstrums Rack to try and decided pretty quickly that this is my favorite.  I&#x27;ve looked in different stores and haven&#x27;t been to find it. That is until I thought to look on Amazon.  I was happy to get a new bottle of this.  I live overseas, and I hated having to pack the bottle to go and forth all the time.  Now, I can leave one in California and take one to where I live or travel.  If you haven&#x27;t tried this perfume, please do.  I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll like it also.</li>
            <li> Jessica Mcclintock By Jessica Mcclintock For Women. Eau De Parfum Spray 1.7...&lt;br /&gt;Jessica Mcclintock</li>
            <li> I used to wear this perfume all the time about 10 years ago and was complimented on it regularly.  I was looking for a new fragrance and thought I&#x27;d give it another try.  I don&#x27;t remember it being so strong, too sweet smelling to me.  Maybe they&#x27;ve changed their formula.</li>
            <li> I really like sent&#x27;s with lemon nodes and Jessica McClintock has nailed it. This lite fragrance is perfect for any occasion. I always worry that my perfume my be too strong for my office. However, Jessica McClintock is perfect for the office. Not too over-bearing. A lite fresh sent. Will definitely purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, it&#x27;s such a soft feminine scent, I use it all the time and get many compliments on it.</li>
            <li> As a gift I received this perfume from a friend and I was a little skeptical because Jessica McClintock always reminded me of bad prom dresses, but I love it so much I quickly finished the first bottle and I ordered another one. I usually wear more aggressive scents like Evny, Chance or Marc Jacobs and this is so much softer, I call it my \\&quot;interview perfume.\\&quot; It really is a great gift for someone&#x27;s taste you aren&#x27;t that familiar with because it is so soft and just makes you smell clean.</li>
            <li> Soft but a very noticed fragrance when worn.&lt;br /&gt;Price is much better then department stores.&lt;br /&gt;Delivered in no time.&lt;br /&gt;My favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is one of three perfumes that I bought on amazon recently.  I based my choices mainly on the reviews, which is why I felt safe buying this one.  Two of the three I really like; not so with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know of I got a bad one or what but the scent is horrible!  It seriously smells like raid bug spray.  I will say that once it dries down the scent turns from bug spray to a very strong floral scent.  For me it&#x27;s too heavy once it dries down and I just can&#x27;t get around the bug spray scent.</li>
            <li> Great service and delivered as promised.  Still an excellent perfume after all these years!</li>
            <li> This is not the same original light scent.  It&#x27;s a lot stronger and sweeter like what a couple others have said.  So strong that it gives me a headache and makes me sneeze.  I am disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> This perfume is light.  I have been wearing it for years and the price through here was very reasonable.  The fragrance is like lily of the valley.</li>
            <li> This is a great scent for summer.  My all time favorite.  I keep it in the refrigerator and spray cool mist on hot days.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this was not the scent that I thought it was when I ordered it. It is overpowering, heavy, and I found it sickening sweet.  I tried it for a couple of days, hoping it would fade into something lighter and more tolerable or maybe I would just get used to it. The perfume stays on strong for hour.  My co-workers noticed the perfume immediately, which is not a good sign.</li>
            <li> This light, summery scent has always made me swoon.  Once upon a time, they made a body powder and large puff and it was a delightful layering of scent.  I might try to make a powder using the perfume, I&#x27;ll let you know how it turns out.</li>
            <li> love it! the smell is great, does not make me sick to wear it. came right on time, nice for a gift.</li>
            <li> I have used this scent for many years and made my purchase each time from Macy&#x27;s.  When I saw it on the Amazon website at a lesser price, I decided to order it from Amazon.  However, the scent seems to be much lighter, so I&#x27;m wondering if this item has been in stock too long on Amazon&#x27;s shelf.  Unfortunately, since I tossed the packaging and shipping info, I&#x27;m assuming that I cannot return it.</li>
            <li> Although my two daughters love this clean scent, it does not smell that same way on me. The frangrance does not last on my skin very long</li>
            <li> This perfume is a stronger soft floral that last a long time when you wear it.  I believe this perfume is for a more mature woman than for the younger girls!  I started wearing this when I was in my late 30&#x27;s (now almost 50) and noticed I was always being told that I smelled so pretty, that is why I still keep this as one of several perfumes I love wearing.</li>
            <li> I have used this fragrance for years and always get compliments on it and plan to continue using it. It has a nice flower scent that&#x27;s not overpowering to others.</li>
            <li> Price was right  order came on time and compliments galore no substitute the real deal I ordered this for 4 different people and it&#x27;s different on all</li>
            <li> A wonderful summer scent.  I use it every day.  Love it!!!!  It is light and airy, and receive lots of compliments.</li>
            <li> I love it,i&#x27;ve had this product before so i wanted so more so thats what i did buy it and love it.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance.  Light and feminine.  Jessica Mcclintock makes a fine product and at a good price.  I&#x27;ve seen this product at Macy&#x27;s but  liked the convenience of ordering it through Amazon.</li>
            <li> What can I say it&#x27;s timeless</li>
            <li> Very lovely, clean and freshly showered smell. Will buy again. Would like the matching lotion to layer the fragrance since it is a light scent.&lt;br /&gt;D. Williams</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved and used this cologne for a number of years, but almost didn&#x27;t order it because of some of the negative comments. I assure you that this is the same product, with the same scent, in the same packaging that I have purchased at high end department stores. The only difference is that this is by far the most attractive pricing I have ever encountered!</li>
            <li> I get compliments on this ALL day. I also occasionally smoke and i spitz this on after a quick one. no one is none the wiser... in fact, they say &amp;#34;you say you smoke, but you never smell like it&amp;#34;..... or &amp;#34;something smells like flowers&#x27;.... and this truly does. Very real gardenia smell. Love it!</li>
            <li> I was very upset when I received the perfume...I ordered a small bottle to take on a trip. What a dissappointment, this perfume doesn&#x27;t seem to be the real one. It&#x27;s much lighter than the original that I have, and the scent doesn&#x27;t last more than a few minutes. I&#x27;m very disappointed that Amazon doesn&#x27;t specify that it&#x27;s a fake. Needles to say I was without perfume during my trip. Very upset!</li>
            <li> Very pleased.  Such a great price.  The department stores quit carrying Jessica and the last time I purchased it it cost 2-3 times as much.</li>
            <li> Glad I could fing this brand of perfume here.  It has a great floral scent.</li>
            <li> It was great to find this so much less than it is sold in the stores!  I always get compliments when I wear this :)</li>
            <li> I have used this perfume for years.  I love it and it was exactly as described.  Fast service also!&lt;br /&gt;Happy.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this perfume</li>
            <li> This perfume is a little too flowery smelling for me.  I still wear it occasionally basically just to use it up.  Won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Smells like lilacs,even though there isn&#x27;t any lilac notes in it.It is long lasting and wonderful smelling.A great power flower.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this item as a gift numerous times and in each and every case it has&lt;br /&gt;been tremendously received. It is just such an awesome fragrance, not overbearing or&lt;br /&gt;sweet. It goes for almost twice the price at your high end retailers, amazon dot com&lt;br /&gt;has given me the chance to gift it more often and make the world a more fragrant place.</li>
            <li> I ordered the 3.4 oz size for a gift. I was so disappointed when it arrived with the box labeled &amp;#34;tester&amp;#34; and it did not even have a top on the bottle--only a cardboard tube.</li>
            <li> Nice floral fragrance of Lily of The Valley. I bought this for my wife and really notice when she wears it.  product arrived quickly and in brand new condition.</li>
            <li> I purchased Jessica Mcclintock&#x27;s Eau De Parfume for Women for a friend&#x27;s birthday.  She loves this&lt;br /&gt;fragrance and I have purchased it for her several times.  I am very pleased with this product - the delivery time was perfect - my purchase experience was A+++++.  Thanks Celia</li>
            <li> This has always been my favorite cologne and have worn it for years.  I have always purchased it at department stores and now it isn&#x27;t available any longer.  I was happy to see it sold at amazon and yet it&#x27;s not the same quality.  I would not purchase this perfume again from Amazon....</li>
            <li> This is one of my old time favorites- can&#x27;t go wrong with this signature scent! So glad I ordered it at this price!</li>
            <li> Yum.  Smells like spring flowers. I use it every day, several times a day.  The grandchildren love it, too. ThanX!</li>
            <li> I was married in a Jessica Mcclintock dress but don&#x27;t let that prejudice get in the way of this review. I&#x27;ve used this perfume for almost 20 years and still love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is one of my favorite daily fragrances. It is light, flowery but not too sweet, not too heavy and perfect for daytime. I get compliments on it constantly even though I can&#x27;t smell it on myself. I love the initial scent and feel like I&#x27;m starting the day with a pleasant introduction to others instead of an onslaught of overpowering fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this as a daily use, casual scent.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this on others more than myself, but it is beautiful!  Very femanine, and long lasting.</li>
            <li> Quite disappointed as the scent is not the same as the many that I&#x27;ve purchase from Macy&#x27;s or Nordstrom stores! It has a cheap cologne scents that you get at the pharmacy! It is very unfortunate that Amazon does not allow returns or exchange for perfumes!</li>
            <li> Did not smell like the ones I have purchased in stores</li>
            <li> Love the springtime lilly of the valley smell</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Jessica Mcclintock Eau De Parfum for years and I love it.  I usually pay $65.00 for this size. Totally satisfied.</li>
            <li> Nice price but I think its a knock off product and not the real Jessica McClintock perfume. Everything looks the same but on the bottom of the bottle it does not state it was formulated specifically for Jessica McClintock as the bottle of real stuff I have states. Doesnt smell the same either. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Smells rich and classy also try Brilliance by Jessica, they just can&#x27;t keep it in stock.</li>
            <li> I wanted something fresh with a Spring floral twist!&lt;br /&gt;I enjoyed the reviews I read for this product, so I gave it a go!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not particularly impressed with the scent.  There&#x27;s something extra in the fragrance that I don&#x27;t care for--it sort of smells like  soda or something..LOL&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll just roll with it for now, but I can&#x27;t see how someone would come up to me wanting to know who I&#x27;m wearing.&lt;br /&gt;...onward then!</li>
            <li> I have worn this perfume for 20 years and have been told by so many people what a wonderful scent it is. It is light and&lt;br /&gt;airy on me. Perfumes smell differently on different people. I cannot wear heavy perfume at all. This one was a winner from the get go, so I have stuck with it.</li>
            <li> I have always loved Jessica Mcclintock perfume but hadn&#x27;t worn it for years.  When I purchased this, I received so many compliments from friends that I just have to keep it in my repertoire from now on.  It is a soft scent of flowers and a bit of citrus that is not overpowering and just right for the summer.</li>
            <li> I love this scent.  Nice summer fragrance.  I will buy this fragrance again.  Try it for yourself.  It is very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> The lady seated in front of me wore this scent last year at a Broadway musical and I loved it!  Because I do much of my shopping through Amazon, I was so glad to see it on the website.  This is very light, not one of those heavy scents that give you a headache!</li>
            <li> Think this is not a genuine Jessica Mcclintock. I gave to my wife as my gift, but she told me that this not a genuine Jessica Mcclintock. Be ware of it.</li>
            <li> this is my favorite and will order again.  Received in a timely manner</li>
            <li> Although the packaging was identical to the product I&#x27;ve been buying for several years at Macys, the quality did not prove to be the same. It had a different fragrance and was not lasting. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> There was this one girl at work who always smelled so good and I eventually got up the courage to go up and ask her what perfume she had on. As soon as she told me, I bought it and I&#x27;ve been buying it ever since and that was over 10 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot say how much I love this perfume. It smells better than any other perfume I&#x27;ve ever smelled. It does not smell like alcohol like so many others do.</li>
