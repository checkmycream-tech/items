            <li>I bought this for a friend that has pressure ulcers and also 1 tube for myself to try on my eczema but he was very happy to find this at such a great price</li>
            <li>I have used many wound gels and this one is the thickest and best one for really protecting your wound.</li>
            <li>like I can Neosporin or the solosite dries up on the cut making it hurt more to remove the Band-Aid.</li>

            <li>Totally satisfied with the results.  </li>
            <li>DONT HAVE NOTHING MORE TO SAID.</li>
            <li>My wounds, while chronic, respond much more favorably to Solosite wound gel than any vaseline based wound care.</li>
            <li>Not my kind of first aid ointment -</li>
            <li>This stuff seems fine for keeping wounds moist.  </li>
            <li>Product is fantastic</li>
            <li>Smooth wound gel.</li>
            <li>New user could buy this more if in the description it came more uses and/or directions.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had more success with the Solosite with greater areas healing completely in the moist, antibacterial conditions provided by Solosite .</li>
            <li>It is a lot more comfortable, and the ulcer is definitely getting better.  </li>
            <li>Chose this rating because it is worthy.  </li>
            <li>Useful wound</li>
            <li>Hope you never need this stuff, but it&#x27;s useful if you do.</li>
            <li>I scar pretty easily and this really helps my wounds heal.</li>
            <li>Shipping was very fast, I recieved it 2 days after ordering.</li>
            <li>I will also have to order more of this item in the future.  </li>
            <li>This wound gel is exactly what our doctor uses in his office for wounds that are not infected and don&#x27;t require antibiotics.</li>
            <li>I do recommend that the wound dressing be changed every other day due to the fact that this gel is best for keeping a moist environment but not preventing bacterial growth over a longer period of time between dressing changes.  </li>
            <li>This definitely works better.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>This really helped with the healing process.</li>
            <li>VERY</li>
            <li>SoloSite really helped speed up the healing process.  </li>
            <li>We highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>It has been working well on a difficult area to heal, making it softer and more comfortable sitting.</li>
            <li>This item was rated by my grandmas nurse as an excellent product unfortunately had to return it due to person being deceased.</li>
            <li>I now know exactly what I&#x27;ll do the next time I have an oozing</li>
            <li>I chose this product because I have used it in the past and needed some more.</li>
            <li>Perfect for quick healing of nasty wounds.</li>
            <li>I also found that it dries quickly between dressing changes, so I now use a small square of coconut oil-soaked gauze pad over the gel, instead of the dry non-stick pad I was using; then wrapping it with gauze bandage, to hold the pad in place.  </li>

            <li> If you have wounds that hang around for long periods of time like my leg wounds you should buy more than one tube, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> Long story,</li>
            <li> The wounds are located on the back and subject to constant movement plus gravity.</li>
            <li> I had a spot removed that resulted in an open wound and healing was not quick.  </li>
            <li> Was introduced to this product at a Wound Care Center and have been ordering it from Amazon out of convenience ever since.</li>
            <li> Wish the Wound Care Center had used it</li>
            <li> This gel is the least expensive of all the wound gels I have used, therefore making that &amp;#34;feature&amp;#34; most desirable.</li>
            <li> While vaseline based wound care is better than nothing, wounds tended to macerate and look unhealthy, sometimes get worse, and not heal at all.</li>
            <li> Having finally resolved the small abscess at the edge of my Ostomy</li>
            <li> gel does get slightly gummy (as opposed to Duoderm gel) which is why I onlly use it around my wound, not in it.&lt;br /&gt;I deducted 1 star for that because I couldn&#x27;t deduct half a star.  </li>
            <li> My mom was using the typical neosporin.</li>
            <li> It tends to dry out, though and form something of a little softer consistency than gummy bears, which is a bit annoying to remove from the skin unless you&#x27;re already going to be showering so it can just wash away.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend managed to gash her thumb - badly - on a pair of scissors.  </li>

            <li> I will also have to order more of this item in the future.  It works great for the purpose I bought it for.  Thanks</li>
            <li> arrived in perfect condition. Would order again. Product is fantastic</li>
            <li> Smooth wound gel. I really like it.</li>
            <li> This item was rated by my grandmas nurse as an excellent product unfortunately had to return it due to person being deceased.</li>
            <li> I must admit it didn&#x27;t harm me but did not have some of the glowing healing results others claim to have had with this gel</li>
            <li> This wound gel is exactly what our doctor uses in his office for wounds that are not infected and don&#x27;t require antibiotics. My husband has diabetes and sometimes get wounds on his feet from his shoes. His podiatrist recommends this brand.</li>
            <li> Purchased for use on chronic wounds. The wounds are located on the back and subject to constant movement plus gravity. This gel stays where placed and does achieve the stated ability to absorb low level wound exudate. I Would purchase again</li>
            <li> I learned of SoloSite from my grandmother. It works but it takes some time and carful bandaging. I cant just Band-Aid this stuff like I can Neosporin or the solosite dries up on the cut making it hurt more to remove the Band-Aid.</li>
            <li> We needed &amp;#34;wound gel&amp;#34; said our doctor for a scrape on my mother&#x27;s leg. The pharmacy wasn&#x27;t sure specifically what that meant, but this is it, you get it from pharmaceutical houses and a search on Amazon popped it up. Has helped her heal a lot. Thank you Amazon!</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend that has pressure ulcers and also 1 tube for myself to try on my eczema but he was very happy to find this at such a great price and I hope it will help me as much (or more) then it helps him... thank you</li>

            <li> Speedy delivery. Useful wound treatment.&lt;br /&gt;Grace Wakefield</li>
            <li> My girlfriend managed to gash her thumb - badly - on a pair of scissors.  Long story, that.  SoloSite definitely helped that wretched wound to finally heal.  Hope you never need this stuff, but it&#x27;s useful if you do.</li>
            <li> The best med for my foot ulcer ,My forearms and chest itch from diabetes problems  and it works on that as well</li>
            <li> Having finally resolved the small abscess at the edge of my Ostomy I now know exactly what I&#x27;ll do the next time I have an oozing wound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;NT</li>
            <li> This gel has kept the wound moist and has speeded healing My mother&#x27;s visiting nurse used SoloSite for sores on her legs. This really helped with the healing process. I am so happy to be able to purchase this on line..</li>
            <li> It is the best product of its kind we have ever used.  Totally satisfied with the results.  We highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> For wounds not requiring medicated (or antibiotic gels) this one works well.  It keeps the wound moist under whatever type dressing (bandage) you use.  I do recommend that the wound dressing be changed every other day due to the fact that this gel is best for keeping a moist environment but not preventing bacterial growth over a longer period of time between dressing changes.  This gel is the least expensive of all the wound gels I have used, therefore making that &amp;#34;feature&amp;#34; most desirable.</li>
            <li> Perfect for quick healing of nasty wounds.</li>
            <li> Excellent wound gel.  I use around my foot wound, then use Duoderm gel in my foot wound (after placement of Prisma).&lt;br /&gt;This gel does get slightly gummy (as opposed to Duoderm gel) which is why I onlly use it around my wound, not in it.&lt;br /&gt;I deducted 1 star for that because I couldn&#x27;t deduct half a star.  It is EXCELLENT for keeping the bottom/sides of my foot from drying out&lt;br /&gt;beneath layers of Adaptic and gauze.  Excellent product, good price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Excellent product works just as described.  Would highly recommend.  Thank you</li>
            <li> Tube isn&#x27;t sealed. Not my kind of first aid ointment - I wouldn&#x27;t trust that on a wound!</li>
            <li> I LIKE IT.IT&#x27;S FINE.THE SERVICE WAS GOOD.I WANT TO CONTINUE BUYING THIS ITEM WITH US.THANK YOU VERY MUCH.I DONT HAVE NOTHING MORE TO SAID.</li>
            <li> Very good medicine excellent service of Amazon</li>
            <li> Excellent wound care product at a great price</li>
            <li> I chose this product because I have used it in the past and needed some more. It does the job required of it.</li>
            <li> My wounds, while chronic, respond much more favorably to Solosite wound gel than any vaseline based wound care. While vaseline based wound care is better than nothing, wounds tended to macerate and look unhealthy, sometimes get worse, and not heal at all. I&#x27;ve had more success with the Solosite with greater areas healing completely in the moist, antibacterial conditions provided by Solosite .</li>
            <li> I had a spot removed that resulted in an open wound and healing was not quick.  SoloSite really helped speed up the healing process.  I wish the doctor would have suggested it sooner!  I think it&#x27;s great stuff!</li>
            <li> I scar pretty easily and this really helps my wounds heal. I discovered it in Australia when I bought some to put on coral scratches. My mom was using the typical neosporin. This definitely works better. She stopped using the Neo and started using this.</li>
            <li> Product was as advertized. Delivered on time as stated.</li>
            <li> I have used many wound gels and this one is the thickest and best one for really protecting your wound. Shipping was very fast, I recieved it 2 days after ordering. If you have wounds that hang around for long periods of time like my leg wounds you should buy more than one tube, you won&#x27;t be sorry. This is the only one that I have ordered again and again.</li>
            <li> Chose this rating because it is worthy.  Product is healing and one of the best prodicts around.  Would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Will buy mine from Amazon from now on.  Wish the Wound Care Center had used it; they finished with me, but the ulcer did not.  Vein Dr. told me to get Wound Gel; this is what the pharmacy ordered (and much more expensive).  I also found that it dries quickly between dressing changes, so I now use a small square of coconut oil-soaked gauze pad over the gel, instead of the dry non-stick pad I was using; then wrapping it with gauze bandage, to hold the pad in place.  It is a lot more comfortable, and the ulcer is definitely getting better.  They had cauterized it with Silver Nitrate, but that did not heal it; actually seemed to make it have to heal all over again.  Try the coconut oil on gauze, to cover the wound; it keeps the gel from soaking into the gauze. The coconut oil is anti-bacterial and anti-fungal, so should not hurt the wound.</li>
