            <li>i wish i could give this a better review</li>
            <li>and I love the dr&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>At first when put under eyes it looked OK, as soon as you smiled it CRACKED</li>
            <li>/&gt; HUGE RIP OFF.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work (doesn&#x27;t fill in or smooth wrinkles, as stated) and looks cakey when on.</li>
            <li>Really could not say that I was able to see any difference.</li>
            <li>Hope I am using it right.</li>
            <li>This does EXACTLY what it claims.</li>
            <li>I first saw this on an infomercial and should have bought it through that....</li>
            <li>Did not have the results I was hoping for, but probably need to use it more regularly.</li>
            <li>thank goodness for the extra pen that was thrown in for free.  </li>
            <li>The product is much thicker than I imagined it or how it appeared on TV when I saw it in use.</li>
            <li>After watching infomercials I expected a lot better results.</li>
            <li>you got a tube and a second one free for about $40.  </li>
            <li>It is far superior and will last you about a year for about the same price!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to apply this with any other product like under eye creams as it would clump.  </li>
            <li>Took couple days for my eyes to.net look normal.</li>
            <li>I used it the first morning, and show instant results.  </li>
            <li>I received the product and surprised at the size of the pen, I thought...</li>

            <li>It barely works at all.  </li>
            <li>First tube I used 4 times and just opened the second one(free) and it was empty.</li>
            <li>I applied it under makeup on bare skin &amp; also after makeup to see if the results were any different.</li>

            <li> Its works but the enormous cost and only 4 uses and the second one empty, they should be ashamed.</li>
            <li> You can find other products with the same ingredients and effect but not the wallet buckling price.</li>
            <li> The next morning, I went to squeeze the little tube and realized it was just about empty.  </li>
            <li> Not as I expected.</li>
            <li> Try Peter Thomas Roth Instant Firm if you want a wrinkle smoother.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just like all the other products on the market for this purpose.</li>
            <li> A total waste of money!  </li>
            <li> This product does not live up to the claims it makes and is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> i used a couple little dabs for 2 days and then the tube was empty.</li>
            <li> When I returned home from work, I called customer service and told the representative what happened, and she said that she was sorry that, that happened and she is now sending me the actual size tube that should last for 30 days.  </li>
            <li> Within a week or less the product was gone.  </li>
            <li> Too little for the price</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Very Bad  should be half of a star, paid $ 45.00 and was only enough in bottle to put in one small place on my face one</li>
            <li> hard to twist.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t listen to the negative reviews on this product.</li>
            <li> The company that sells it is rude, too.</li>
            <li> I have had it for a few weeks and used it approximately 4x, so I can&#x27;t comment on its effectiveness unfortunately.</li>
            <li> and the lines looked much worse.  </li>
            <li> The worst part is that the tube is SO tiny it is ridiculous!  </li>
            <li> The item does what it claims, however, it is quite expensive.</li>
            <li> This is an expensive product.  </li>
            <li> It is getting too expensive.</li>
            <li> difficult to use.</li>

            <li> Kind of a small bottle.... Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see if it works.</li>

            <li> This is an expensive product.  You can find other products with the same ingredients and effect but not the wallet buckling price.</li>
            <li> It was one of the worst products I have ever bought. Did NOT do a blessed thing.  At first when put under eyes it looked OK, as soon as you smiled it CRACKED and the lines looked much worse.  A Total was of my $45 plus dollars.</li>
            <li> Just wish the price would go back to $34.99.  It is getting too expensive.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t listen to the negative reviews on this product.This does EXACTLY what it claims. Apply sparingly, FIRMS the hood of the brow with in about a minute- NO residue. Can apply makeup over this with no problems at all! Also fills in  the crows feet and great for under eye puffiness. This stuff is GREAT. I hope they NEVER stop making it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> difficult to use. hard to twist.</li>
            <li> Too little for the price</li>
            <li> i wish i could give this a better review but i didn&#x27;t have enough of the product to experience anything.  i used a couple little dabs for 2 days and then the tube was empty. either i got ripped off or ...got ripped off.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money,  I was very hopeful since Dr Ordin&#x27;s name is attached to it and I love the dr&#x27;s.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> The product is much thicker than I imagined it or how it appeared on TV when I saw it in use. I have had it for a few weeks and used it approximately 4x, so I can&#x27;t comment on its effectiveness unfortunately. In that time, I have not noticed any change in the appearance of lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work (doesn&#x27;t fill in or smooth wrinkles, as stated) and looks cakey when on. What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> This product does not live up to the claims it makes and is a waste of money. The company that sells it is rude, too.</li>
            <li> Not as I expected. After watching infomercials I expected a lot better results. It&#x27;s just like all the other products on the market for this purpose. It is visible in the lines you apply it to &amp; develops a flakey residue. I applied it under makeup on bare skin &amp; also after makeup to see if the results were any different. I won&#x27;t buy it again &amp; advise you to skip this one, it&#x27;s a loser in my book.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything for me.  Hope I am using it right.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t even deserve a One star!  Made my eyes puffy and old. Took couple days for my eyes to.net look normal. Says I have to rate this with so I can exit out.</li>
            <li> Very Bad  should be half of a star, paid $ 45.00 and was only enough in bottle to put in one small place on my face one time.&lt;br /&gt; HUGE RIP OFF.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to apply this with any other product like under eye creams as it would clump.  Within a week or less the product was gone.  Really could not say that I was able to see any difference.</li>
            <li> I first saw this on an infomercial and should have bought it through that....you got a tube and a second one free for about $40.  You also could get your money back after a month or two if you were dissatisfied.  I paid about $45 for just one tube and it is just a total rip off.  It barely works at all.  The worst part is that the tube is SO tiny it is ridiculous!  A total waste of money!  Try Peter Thomas Roth Instant Firm if you want a wrinkle smoother.  It is far superior and will last you about a year for about the same price!</li>
            <li> Did not have the results I was hoping for, but probably need to use it more regularly.</li>
