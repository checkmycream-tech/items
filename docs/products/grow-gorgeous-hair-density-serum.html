            <li>I don&#x27;t think I would&#x27;ve noticed the growth change as much if I didn&#x27;t dye my hair.</li>

            <li>Just a few drops a day every day has proven to be effective.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s bleached platinum, and I consequently had a hard time finding hair products with the strength to heal and nourish it.</li>
            <li> Will update my reviews after few months!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Just started last night - very optimistic. However, my husband asked if I was wearing patulli perfume ( which I/we cannot stand ). I couldn&#x27;t quite place the smell until his comment😞.  Hopefully the fragrance disapates (and the product works!). Other than fragrance, I like how it feels...not greasy -actually seems to improve my fine hair texture/style.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing everything to grow out my hair after a disaster last year which lead me to the big chop. I started using this product less than 2 months ago and I and seeing insane results. I&#x27;ve already grown more than an inch in 2 months when I normally grow way less. My hair is also thicker and experiencing less shed! Definitely repurchasing soon!</li>
            <li> Saw no effect after using the whole bottle. But... I would be willing to try again. The product smells and feels very nice.</li>
            <li> I have seen my baby hairs growing like crazy.  They say you have to use this for a least 2 bottles to see any real growth. My hair is already long I just wanted to thicken it. Seems to be working I&#x27;m just lazy to use it. I didn&#x27;t find it greasy or bothersome.</li>
            <li> Can men use this product to grow they hair? Or which is the best product for male to grow there hair?</li>
            <li> I have used up one bottle of Grow Gorgeous. It really worked. My hair reduces less and grows more. I can see new short hair on my head.</li>
            <li> A bit pricey for such a small bottle</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and after a few minutes the oil sinks right in. My daughter who has very oily hair is a huge fan of this and needs/uses it because of coloring her hair every week a new color. I did buy it for myself but the smell was way to woods like for my taste but it is a good smell.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and it last me 3 months. It has a pleasant smell and my scalp felt cleaner between washes. I have PCOS  and my hair has been getting thinner this year, so far I have not seen any difference only  more thinning hair. My problems needs to be addressed first with my doctor with medicine then I will try a regrow hair product. Will I get another bottle? No..not until I see some real results from others. So far all I hear are people that are just in trial.</li>
            <li> Just okay, haven&#x27;t really noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I wanted to regrow part of my eyebrow and after nightly application it quickly grew in.  I think it took four weeks total.</li>
            <li> Works great for me, my hair did grow as said it would if used properly.</li>
            <li> I bought this over summer, because I&#x27;ve desperately been trying to grow my thin edges out. I posted a video on youtube and I&#x27;ll be doing a one month update.&lt;br /&gt;Check it out at this link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;2WTiIiJqxm4</li>
            <li> I am so satisfied with this product. After using this product the first  week actually I did notice instant growth. The first time of applying this product to my scalp I felt a tingly sensation so I knew then that this product was going to work for me. the second week I noticed how strong my hair had  become. I have also noticed less shedding and hair loss. I know that I will continue to use this product as long as it remains on the market. It&#x27;s been well over 4 months now and my hair has grown tremendously and still less shedding. What I also like about this product is that it&#x27;s not greasy and have no odor. Just a few drops a day every day has proven to be effective. There no other product on the market that adds up to this product since Capilong PSB which you cannot find anywhere online anymore. I definitely recommend this product to anyone who is experiencing hair loss or hair thinning</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for about 3 weeks now and have not seen any difference in my hair. I have to admit that I have not been using it regularly though. I am going to give it some more time so see if there are any results. I&#x27;m still hoping for something to show.</li>
            <li> I start using it, it is excellent but i have to wait to see the changes.</li>
            <li> smells wonderful and seems to be working wonderfully!</li>
            <li> Item I received was used.</li>
            <li> Very good results.. My hair has never been so thick and healthy... It has completely changed the texture of my hair which was very fine ,thin... Results are not instant , I started seeing results only after one month.... Just simply love this product....</li>
            <li> This serum made a HUGE difference in the condition of my hair. It&#x27;s bleached platinum, and I consequently had a hard time finding hair products with the strength to heal and nourish it. Not only did I notice my roots growing much faster within 2 weeks of regular use, but my hair also became much stronger, softer, with better elasticity. Grow Gorgeous is an essential part of my routine now. I imagine the results would be even more pronounced on non-processed hair.&lt;br /&gt;I do wish they sold bigger quantities for this price though.</li>
            <li> Not impressed at all. If anything my hair feels thinner.</li>
            <li> I am giving five because I used it only for few days and I see results!! Will update my reviews after few months!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been growing my hair forever but it&#x27;s hard for me since I have thin, fragile hair.  Almost looks like a sick person which I really hate and I&#x27;m very healthy by the way.. According to my doctors and exams. I rarely use heat styling tools so my hair needs to look healthy when it air dries. I have tried various hair regrowth products like Ovation Cell T. and Minoxidil (I do not reccommend).  A note on Minoxidil, since I had to put it twice a day the product gave me itchy scalp and flakes (changed from oily to dry and itchy), heart palpitations, and the hairs you grow will fall off when you stop using that product.  About this one, I have been using it for about three weeks now, I see many baby hairs at the crown where it&#x27;s thinnest. It instantly gives you a lift adds volume and it smells like pretty flowers.. So feminine.  My hair feels silky at the roots, you just have to be careful not to put too much product because it will look oily.  Scalp feels like it&#x27;s prepped for healthy growth. I feel this, and other measures are helping my hair grow faster/ healthier and made it wake up from that terminal length.  I will buy the second bottle for sure.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I&#x27;ve been using it for 4 months now and it exceeded my expectations. I was losing so much hair while shampooing I had to clean my hair out of the drain after every shower. Since using I haven&#x27;t had to clean it because there&#x27;s no hair in my drain to pull out. I noticed my hair looking fuller after 4 days of using. I had people noticing after 5 days commenting on how much more fuller my hair was. As for growth, I have gray hair and use to dye it every 3-4 weeks because I hate being 33 with gray hair. Now I struggle to make it to 3 weeks. I&#x27;m usually doing roots only every 20 days. I did notice I have to leave my hair dye on longer as well. Its made my gray slightly more resistant to my hair dye. I use to be good leaving it on for 25 minutes. Now I need to keep it on about 35. I don&#x27;t think I would&#x27;ve noticed the growth change as much if I didn&#x27;t dye my hair. If your like I was, just watching your hair go down the drain, then please try this! For $35 it&#x27;s worth a try. Also I noticed a huge change in my scalp. Before I had to wash my hair almost everyday because of some build-up on my scalp and because of my hair being super oily. Now I get no build-up and I can actually go 3 days without washing my hair. I could probably go 4 days but don&#x27;t. So again, if your considering this product, just try it. You won&#x27;t regret that you did.</li>
