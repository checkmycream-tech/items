    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>not so great.</li>
            <li>Really good product.  </li>
            <li>It is also sticky and maybe would be better as a roll on instead of having to apply it with your finger.    </li>
            <li>love the eye cream in this brand but the face creams make my skin look puckered like it has glue on it.</li>
            <li>Weight loss and expertise will do a better job.</li>
            <li>Love this, really works!</li>
            <li>Be sure not to use too much, it can get sticky.</li>
            <li>This product helps tighten my double chin better than others I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>It smothes on nice and clear and It works instantly and would recomend it to everyone.</li>
            <li>bottle pretty fast.</li>
            <li>Unless you want to use this as prop makeup if you&#x27;re going to a costume party as a reptile, it&#x27;s probably a good idea to spend your hard earned dinero on something else.</li>
            <li>This is really geart for that sagging neck.</li>
            <li>This product does absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>It will be a great product for the working mature lady who wants to get back a few years of her youthful look, without surgery.</li>
            <li>Should have know it would take more than a topical product to remove a double chin.  </li>
            <li>Bought this chin firmer for the second time I really like it</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>My chin is still the same it&#x27;s just really soft.</li>

            <li> Bought this chin firmer for the second time I really like it</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> My chin is still the same it&#x27;s just really soft.</li>
            <li> I put it on, let it dry and bent my head back to apply mascara and immediately saw giant white flakes.</li>
            <li> Well I have only used it for a few days but so far I have seen no difference</li>
            <li> Used for three weeks as directed, still no reduction, tightening, nothing.&lt;br /&gt;Would steer you clear away from this waste of money product.</li>
            <li> Only thing I don&#x27;t like is the sticky texture, and the quantity is very less......</li>
            <li> I found that this firming cream takes patience as you must use this product at least three days before seeing any change and if and when you miss a day all goes back the way it was.</li>
            <li> Thank goodness I didn&#x27;t leave the house before discovering this mess.</li>
            <li> I will try it a little while longer</li>
            <li> My guess is the substance is supposed to pull any loose skin taut, which it does do, but if only it would do it without leaving a weird flaky, snakeskin-like layer.</li>
            <li> Unless something happens soon, I would say it was a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t find that this product worded and it made my face dried out.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money with this stuff.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no notable difference after using it and it creates a film on the skin that makes your skin look like it&#x27;s peeling.</li>
            <li> If used everyday, twice a day this product works!</li>
            <li> Used for over a month, twice a day as directed, saw no results, waste of money!!</li>
            <li> I mainly bought this because of the caffeine content (which tends to work wonders on puffiness of all types) but was very disappointed in the tackiness and end result.</li>
            <li> makes weird wrinkly patches that made the skin appear much worse.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> This is really geart for that sagging neck. It smothes on nice and clear and It works instantly and would recomend it to everyone.This productq quality was above my expectations</li>
            <li> Well I have only used it for a few days but so far I have seen no difference whats so ever.  Unless something happens soon, I would say it was a waste of money.  It is also sticky and maybe would be better as a roll on instead of having to apply it with your finger.    I purchased the serum because I lost weight and now have some looseness and some wrinkles under my chin which I wanted to tighten up.</li>
            <li> I found that this firming cream takes patience as you must use this product at least three days before seeing any change and if and when you miss a day all goes back the way it was. I find men do not had the dedication for this product.   It will be a great product for the working mature lady who wants to get back a few years of her youthful look, without surgery.</li>
            <li> It works!  Use it every morning before my make up.  Tip:  Don&#x27;t put foundation over the serum on  throat area because you will rub off the serum and cause flakiness.</li>
            <li> not so great. love the eye cream in this brand but the face creams make my skin look puckered like it has glue on it. makes weird wrinkly patches that made the skin appear much worse. did not help my chin at all.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no notable difference after using it and it creates a film on the skin that makes your skin look like it&#x27;s peeling.</li>
            <li> My chin is still the same it&#x27;s just really soft. Didn&#x27;t do the trick for me. I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s any tighter than before. Save your money</li>
            <li> Bought this chin firmer for the second time I really like it I feel like I can see a difference in my chin and I use it daily!</li>
            <li> Sticky, overpriced garbage. Used for three weeks as directed, still no reduction, tightening, nothing.&lt;br /&gt;Would steer you clear away from this waste of money product.</li>
            <li> I can feel the tighten of area, but I don&#x27;t see the difference. I will try it a little while longer</li>
            <li> Wow. I can&#x27;t believe this is even still on the market. I mainly bought this because of the caffeine content (which tends to work wonders on puffiness of all types) but was very disappointed in the tackiness and end result. My guess is the substance is supposed to pull any loose skin taut, which it does do, but if only it would do it without leaving a weird flaky, snakeskin-like layer. I put it on, let it dry and bent my head back to apply mascara and immediately saw giant white flakes. Thank goodness I didn&#x27;t leave the house before discovering this mess. Unless you want to use this as prop makeup if you&#x27;re going to a costume party as a reptile, it&#x27;s probably a good idea to spend your hard earned dinero on something else.</li>
            <li> This product does absolutely nothing. It&#x27;s like putting Elmer&#x27;s Glue under your chin and you can see the same type of residue. Save your money and stay away from this stuff.</li>
            <li> I called the company to find out about their ingredients.  There are no parabens and there is no animal testing.  And it works!</li>
            <li> Should have know it would take more than a topical product to remove a double chin.  Weight loss and expertise will do a better job.</li>
            <li> Used for over a month, twice a day as directed, saw no results, waste of money!!</li>
            <li> If used everyday, twice a day this product works!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t find that this product worded and it made my face dried out. Don&#x27;t waste your money with this stuff.</li>
            <li> Till now this serum has shown results and it&#x27;s been 2 weeks I have used it. Only thing I don&#x27;t like is the sticky texture, and the quantity is very less......</li>
            <li> Really good product.  Be sure not to use too much, it can get sticky.</li>
            <li> This product helps tighten my double chin better than others I&#x27;ve tried.  Doesn&#x27;t eliminate the flap of course, but helps minimize it.  Wish it were sold in larger sizes.  I run through the 1/2 oz. bottle pretty fast.</li>
            <li> Love this, really works!</li>
