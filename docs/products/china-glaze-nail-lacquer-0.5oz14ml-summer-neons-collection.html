            <li>Love this color!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and perfect color!!!!!</li>
            <li>Kind of like a neon coral/orange.</li>
            <li>I soon discovered it was a &amp;#34;retired&amp;#34; color, so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon and ordered it.</li>
            <li>Remember, this is a matte, so just add a top coat if your looking for that shine :)</li>
            <li>i was looking for more of a coral</li>

            <li>Such a great color like always</li>
            <li>It changes with the light and is guaranteed to get compliments.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It shipped fast and was packaged nicely.</li>
            <li>It is really pretty w/ the top coat</li>
            <li>I was also looking for more of a neon orange color (haven&#x27;t been able to find the shade I have in mind) &amp; was hoping this was it, but it has more of a pink (coral) tone to it.  </li>
            <li>however im very pleased with the color although its more neon pink than coral.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a super bright, vibrant coral that reads more pink in certain lights and more orange in others.</li>
            <li>so youd need a clear top coat to make it shiny.</li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;ve got the time this color is absolutely worth it</li>
            <li>It dries matte so if you like it shiny, a clear top coat will be needed.</li>
            <li>out a clear top coat.  </li>
            <li>super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>dries matte so a top coat is necessary and takes 3 coats for a fully saturated look.</li>
            <li>Really pretty orangish shimmer neon.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the product overall and shipping was very prompt.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it chips easily.</li>
            <li>This color is more orange than pink.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still cute, but if you were expecting pink, keep looking.</li>
            <li>and it is so much cheaper in price on here.</li>
            <li>I really like the color</li>
            <li>The picture on the left is from the salon, the picture on the right is the product I received..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hot pink with a touch of &amp;#34;Hell Yeah&amp;#34; orange... Or neon orange with a splash of sweet hot pink!</li>
            <li>Really pretty color that I totally passed on when I saw them in the stores.</li>
            <li>The only downside is it dries really dull/flat, so</li>

            <li> Not the quality I expected from this brand. Polish chipped off the same day.</li>
            <li> super fast shipping. i was looking for more of a coral however im very pleased with the color although its more neon pink than coral. matte but sparkly so youd need a clear top coat to make it shiny.</li>
            <li> This color is more orange than pink. It&#x27;s still cute, but if you were expecting pink, keep looking.</li>

            <li> Never dries!!!! I LOVE the color but I swear it never dries, no matter what you do!!!!</li>
            <li> Such a great color like always and it is so much cheaper in price on here. It always comes on time and is packaged with great care. The quality of the nail polish is great and I can find a wider range of colors on here. I just love this color.</li>
            <li> I always get tons of compliments on this color! Shipped in the amount of time specified. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!!! this color. It&#x27;s hot pink with a touch of &amp;#34;Hell Yeah&amp;#34; orange... Or neon orange with a splash of sweet hot pink! It changes with the light and is guaranteed to get compliments.&lt;br /&gt;It dries matte so a top coat is necessary and takes 3 coats for a fully saturated look. If you&#x27;re looking for a last minute color change this isn&#x27;t your girl but if you&#x27;ve got the time this color is absolutely worth it</li>
            <li> Love this polish! It&#x27;s a neon dayglo orange with pearlescent to it. It dries matte so if you like it shiny, a clear top coat will be needed. It shipped fast and was packaged nicely. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it chips easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this color before, this was not the color!!! :/</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Surfing For Boys&amp;#34; has become one of my favorite summer nail polish shades! It&#x27;s a super bright, vibrant coral that reads more pink in certain lights and more orange in others. This is a go-to pedicure color all summer long.</li>
            <li> Just the color I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Love this color! Looks perfect for summer nails. Would definitely order this color again from China Glaze! Would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I received your product on time, but it was not as what I was expecting. The color wasn&#x27;t what the picture shows. Half the bottle was pink and the other half was reddish orange. I shook the bottle several times, but it remains discolored. Not happy. I would like a refund please</li>
            <li> bring this color back</li>
            <li> My nail salon had this color and I wanted one to have on hand if they ran out. I soon discovered it was a &amp;#34;retired&amp;#34; color, so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon and ordered it. I am pleased with the product overall and shipping was very prompt. Very happy!</li>
            <li> Really pretty color that I totally passed on when I saw them in the stores. Was delivered on time at a great price point. Really pretty orangish shimmer neon.</li>
            <li> I really like the color -- it&#x27;s a REALLY bright (neon) coral &amp; will look great w/ a tan.  The only downside is it dries really dull/flat, so you definitely can&#x27;t go w/out a clear top coat.  I was also looking for more of a neon orange color (haven&#x27;t been able to find the shade I have in mind) &amp; was hoping this was it, but it has more of a pink (coral) tone to it.  It is really pretty w/ the top coat though...it will be perfect for this spring/summer!</li>
            <li> The color I have received looks nothing like the color at the salon..  The picture on the left is from the salon, the picture on the right is the product I received..</li>
