            <li>It does keep the hair feeling healthy.</li>

            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love Wen.</li>
            <li>I plan on giving it to a friend and continuing to use Wen cleansing conditioner as a leave-in - that seems to work much better, anyway.</li>
            <li>My hair has seen better days do to coloring it every couple months.  </li>
            <li>It looks fuller, thicker &amp; much more healthier than it has been.  </li>

            <li>It makes my hair feel so healthy and silky</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a fabulous deal!</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the texture.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend and will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li>My hair has never looked better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used WEN for many years now but never tried this product before.</li>
            <li>I love this product when I decided to curl my hair.  </li>
            <li>my daughter and i both love it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>This gives more definition and texture, which I like a lot.  </li>
            <li>The Volume Styling Creme is MUCH better.</li>
            <li>This is an okay product along with Wen Cleansing cream.  </li>
            <li>The first time she used this product, almost all the frizz was gone!!!</li>
            <li>I use this great product and normally purchase it on QVC, but on Amazon I was able to get it at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft and I have locks!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Its pretty good-</li>
            <li>, felt like there was residue, hair tangled easily and had static.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know; maybe this product is more for people with fine hair??</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft and smells great ,  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had this kind of success since I was in my teens.</li>
            <li>I love Wen and I am a true convert.  </li>
            <li>I have fine curly curly hair.</li>
            <li>i am caucasion and have fine curly hair, but a lot of it.</li>
            <li>Even with my fine hair!&lt;br /&gt;Adds</li>
            <li>I put this on everytime I get out of the shower &amp; my hair is shiny smooth.</li>
            <li>It is not only a treatment but also great for styling my hair.  </li>
            <li>It is cheap on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>This cream makes my bangs stay where I comb them and my frizzy hair becomes smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>Wen is fabulous.  </li>
            <li>All products  from Wen they are fabulous</li>
            <li>I would by fromthis vendor again for future products....very happy with iteam.</li>
            <li>I love wearing my hair both straight and curly now. :)</li>
            <li>so I use a generous amount but great for flat iron straighting.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and was worried this product would be too heavy on my hair, but it works great.  </li>
            <li>WEN is such an amazing product!</li>
            <li>B00435WONE Original Sprout Tahitian Hair Oil - 4 oz.]]</li>
            <li>I was really excited to have this product, but it didn&#x27;t work for my hair...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the original styling cream</li>
            <li>Got it at such a great price that its worth a try.</li>
            <li>really just did nothing was expecting something much better</li>
            <li>OVERALL, GOOD PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>It helps to make my hair fuller and full of body.</li>
            <li>Would not pay full retail.</li>
            <li>My hair is very damaged from bleaching but wen has made it look healthy again.</li>
            <li>but I find that this finishing treatment absorbs quickly yet helps my hair maintain</li>
            <li>Luckily I had time that day</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>I was quite suprised that I received it so quickly.  </li>
            <li>I love Chaz Dean&#x27;s line of hair care items and use several different ones and love most all including this one!</li>
            <li>I thought it would calm the frizzes and just make my hair smoother, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>It may work for people who want more texture in their hair, but as a person who uses Wen because of how smooth it makes my hair, this definitely did not work for me.</li>
            <li>Now she has beautiful, luxurious curls that look like a professional spent hours on them, but thanks to wen its wash and wear!!</li>
            <li>, I had to shampoo it right out.  </li>
            <li>This goes right into the hair.  </li>
            <li>Im working on getting the right amount.</li>
            <li>I can easily blow it silky straight straight</li>
            <li>only positive thing, in my opinion, is that it smells nice.</li>
            <li>Great finishing product, no more knots....</li>
            <li>So far this is a definite keeper and hope Amazon will continue to have it for such a wonderful price.</li>
            <li>I used this concoction on a super humid Pennsylvania day and it really held my curls in place and thickened them with no frizz.</li>
            <li>I do like the Wen hair cleanser very much, so I will use the creme.  </li>
            <li>she is in the Navy, she also likes the Wen hair cleanser very much.</li>
            <li>I love it &amp; would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li>I love WEN products and this one is added to my must have daily routine.</li>
            <li>I love this product but wish they did it in a different perfume.  </li>
            <li>I used this on my hair and it gave me body and texture, even in this hot humid weather.  </li>
            <li>I will  definitely order more of this.</li>
            <li>Today is the first day I added the finishing creme to my hair regime.</li>
            <li>If used as directed, this 4oz. tube could last you 2 years or more.</li>
            <li>The first couple of times I used this</li>
            <li>Buy one tube and try it first, and then if it works, buy more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And they ship fast!</li>
            <li>Just put it on the ends to spruce up your hairdo on the second day after a shampoo or work into roots for more volume.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll finish this tube (it will take me about a year, most likely) but I will not buy it again.</li>
            <li>It definitely helps to refine my curls and keep my hair from frizzing, even on the most humid of days.  </li>
            <li>I have good hair days everyday.</li>
            <li>I use WEN shampoo *cleanser* because my hair stays shiny and clean and very soft.  </li>
            <li>I have long, very fine hair</li>
            <li>Great for when you want a little extra texture, or if you really want to smooth out your look.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not greasy, it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, I just love it!</li>
            <li>My hair was nice and soft prior to applying this creme.</li>
            <li>less is more with this product!</li>
            <li>My hair stays soft full of body</li>
            <li>I have super curly hair and frequently straighten it.</li>
            <li>B004Z209HS Pura D&#x27;or Pure &amp; Organic Argan Oil (4 fl.</li>
            <li>I use this as an alternative to the treatment oil which adds a nice shine, but can become a little oily if accidentally use too much.  </li>
            <li>My hair has grown longer and is much healthier.</li>
            <li>have color treated hair &amp; this creme really works</li>
            <li>great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much cheaper to buy through Amazon &amp; shipping was fast</li>
            <li>And it doesnt take much, I just use a quarter size of the cream and rub it between my hands, then rub some on my bangs and the rest through my hair.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>The creme is very think &amp; has the feel of glue.</li>
            <li>and I really prefer that.  </li>
            <li>Once my hair was styled I conveniently received the finishing creme from Amazon :) My hair is bouncy, shiny and extra soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of heavy on my hair and by the end of the evening feels sticky.</li>
            <li>Pomregranate is better than the other cremes in the WEN product line in my opinion.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way..and smells great.</li>
            <li>I like a lot of other products much better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a strange texture, likened to how my hair feels at the end of a drive when I&#x27;ve ridden in a convertible with my hair flying free.</li>
            <li>It even makes the curls separate a little, instead of frizzing together and when my hair is straight, it makes the cut more defined.</li>
            <li>New fave!</li>
            <li>Found this product for more than 2/3 less the cost they sell it on QVC.  </li>
            <li>I have used similar products (Bed Head, Short Sexy Hair, Nexxus)</li>
            <li>It really helped keep my frizz down, and my hair looks healthy and soft.</li>
            <li>highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>Again, I felt there was a large difference in quality between what I purchased directly and what I purchased through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>it leaves your hair very  smooth and soft, not greasy or heavy at all.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be able to soften my hair but it actually left it very dry</li>
            <li>I have only used the product a few days, but I am very pleased with how soft and silky it makes my hair.</li>
            <li>I use it in combination with gel in my hair when I scrunch it for a different, easy look once in a while, to keep the frizzies away, and it creates large loose curls without spending all the extra time with a curling iron or hot rollers.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine hair down.</li>
            <li>this cream is never heavy and it drenches your curls with softness ans moisture, I am hooked!</li>
            <li>and you really don&#x27;t need much at a time, so it lasts long.</li>
            <li>I only use serum to de volume and de frizz, but I have a pretty soft hair texture naturally.</li>
            <li>I have thin curly hair and wanted something to give my hair more thickness!  </li>
            <li>While it seemed that at times it was okay; I have very thick hair and these products make my hair very waxy/sticky feeling.</li>
            <li>It does a great job on my crazy hair.</li>
            <li>I am extremely sensitive to beauty products of all kinds.  </li>
            <li>and it makes it so soft.</li>
            <li>Not heavy on your hair.</li>
            <li>The only con is that if I put too much in it has a tendency to make my hair feel a bit greasy.</li>
            <li>I put this on my natural hair and it seemed like it made it frizz.</li>
            <li>I am in the process of going natural and have not had a relaxer for 11 months.</li>
            <li>It is worth every bid spent to get this product in your home; to use.</li>
            <li>This is a useless product and I should not have purchased it without a good recommendation.</li>
            <li>you can NEVER go wrong with Wen products, love the scent, very light and does not weigh your hair down</li>
            <li>I recently went pretty short and the WEN moisture spray</li>
            <li>A little bit expensive but works very good....</li>
            <li>A little pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t greasy and adds definition to my style by holding it softly throughout the day and even the next.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m back to my old quality shampoo.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was different from the one I order from Wen Products directly from the Company Wen</li>
            <li>After washing my hair with the sweet almond mint cleansing conditioner and using the styling creme, I blow dried and flat ironed my hair.</li>
            <li>I have tried ALL the wen products, and I think this one is the LEAST useful for my hair so far.</li>
            <li>I have long straight hair and use a curling iron to get big bouncy loose curls that last 2 or 3 days.  </li>
            <li>Had to use large amount form little if any result.</li>

            <li> It does keep the hair feeling healthy.</li>
            <li> I think this styling product is better than a styling cream.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love Wen.</li>
            <li> I plan on giving it to a friend and continuing to use Wen cleansing conditioner as a leave-in - that seems to work much better, anyway.</li>
            <li> My hair has seen better days do to coloring it every couple months.  </li>
            <li> It looks fuller, thicker &amp; much more healthier than it has been.  </li>

            <li> i am officially in love.</li>
            <li> i just LOVE this cream.  </li>

            <li> It makes my hair feel so healthy and silky</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a fabulous deal!</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the texture.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend and will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> My hair has never looked better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used WEN for many years now but never tried this product before.</li>
            <li> I love this product when I decided to curl my hair.  </li>
            <li> my daughter and i both love it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> This gives more definition and texture, which I like a lot.  </li>
            <li> The Volume Styling Creme is MUCH better.</li>
            <li> This is an okay product along with Wen Cleansing cream.  </li>
            <li> The first time she used this product, almost all the frizz was gone!!!</li>
            <li> I use this great product and normally purchase it on QVC, but on Amazon I was able to get it at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft and I have locks!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Its pretty good-</li>
            <li> , felt like there was residue, hair tangled easily and had static.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know; maybe this product is more for people with fine hair??</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and smells great ,  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had this kind of success since I was in my teens.</li>
            <li> I love Wen and I am a true convert.  </li>
            <li> I have fine curly curly hair.</li>
            <li> i am caucasion and have fine curly hair, but a lot of it.</li>
            <li> Even with my fine hair!&lt;br /&gt;Adds</li>
            <li> I put this on everytime I get out of the shower &amp; my hair is shiny smooth.</li>
            <li> It is not only a treatment but also great for styling my hair.  </li>
            <li> It is cheap on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> This cream makes my bangs stay where I comb them and my frizzy hair becomes smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> Wen is fabulous.  </li>
            <li> All products  from Wen they are fabulous</li>
            <li> I would by fromthis vendor again for future products....very happy with iteam.</li>
            <li> I love wearing my hair both straight and curly now. :)</li>
            <li> so I use a generous amount but great for flat iron straighting.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and was worried this product would be too heavy on my hair, but it works great.  </li>
            <li> WEN is such an amazing product!</li>
            <li> B00435WONE Original Sprout Tahitian Hair Oil - 4 oz.]]</li>
            <li> I was really excited to have this product, but it didn&#x27;t work for my hair...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the original styling cream</li>
            <li> Got it at such a great price that its worth a try.</li>
            <li> really just did nothing was expecting something much better</li>
            <li> OVERALL, GOOD PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> It helps to make my hair fuller and full of body.</li>
            <li> Would not pay full retail.</li>
            <li> My hair is very damaged from bleaching but wen has made it look healthy again.</li>
            <li> but I find that this finishing treatment absorbs quickly yet helps my hair maintain</li>
            <li> Luckily I had time that day</li>
            <li> Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> I was quite suprised that I received it so quickly.  </li>
            <li> I love Chaz Dean&#x27;s line of hair care items and use several different ones and love most all including this one!</li>
            <li> I thought it would calm the frizzes and just make my hair smoother, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It may work for people who want more texture in their hair, but as a person who uses Wen because of how smooth it makes my hair, this definitely did not work for me.</li>
            <li> Now she has beautiful, luxurious curls that look like a professional spent hours on them, but thanks to wen its wash and wear!!</li>
            <li> , I had to shampoo it right out.  </li>
            <li> This goes right into the hair.  </li>
            <li> Im working on getting the right amount.</li>
            <li> I can easily blow it silky straight straight</li>
            <li> only positive thing, in my opinion, is that it smells nice.</li>
            <li> Great finishing product, no more knots....</li>
            <li> So far this is a definite keeper and hope Amazon will continue to have it for such a wonderful price.</li>
            <li> I used this concoction on a super humid Pennsylvania day and it really held my curls in place and thickened them with no frizz.</li>
            <li> I do like the Wen hair cleanser very much, so I will use the creme.  </li>
            <li> she is in the Navy, she also likes the Wen hair cleanser very much.</li>
            <li> I love it &amp; would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I love WEN products and this one is added to my must have daily routine.</li>
            <li> I love this product but wish they did it in a different perfume.  </li>
            <li> I used this on my hair and it gave me body and texture, even in this hot humid weather.  </li>
            <li> I will  definitely order more of this.</li>
            <li> Today is the first day I added the finishing creme to my hair regime.</li>
            <li> If used as directed, this 4oz. tube could last you 2 years or more.</li>
            <li> The first couple of times I used this</li>
            <li> Buy one tube and try it first, and then if it works, buy more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And they ship fast!</li>
            <li> Just put it on the ends to spruce up your hairdo on the second day after a shampoo or work into roots for more volume.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll finish this tube (it will take me about a year, most likely) but I will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> It definitely helps to refine my curls and keep my hair from frizzing, even on the most humid of days.  </li>
            <li> I have good hair days everyday.</li>
            <li> I use WEN shampoo *cleanser* because my hair stays shiny and clean and very soft.  </li>
            <li> I have long, very fine hair</li>
            <li> Great for when you want a little extra texture, or if you really want to smooth out your look.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not greasy, it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, I just love it!</li>
            <li> My hair was nice and soft prior to applying this creme.</li>
            <li> less is more with this product!</li>
            <li> My hair stays soft full of body</li>
            <li> I have super curly hair and frequently straighten it.</li>
            <li> B004Z209HS Pura D&#x27;or Pure &amp; Organic Argan Oil (4 fl.</li>
            <li> I use this as an alternative to the treatment oil which adds a nice shine, but can become a little oily if accidentally use too much.  </li>
            <li> My hair has grown longer and is much healthier.</li>
            <li> have color treated hair &amp; this creme really works</li>
            <li> great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much cheaper to buy through Amazon &amp; shipping was fast</li>
            <li> And it doesnt take much, I just use a quarter size of the cream and rub it between my hands, then rub some on my bangs and the rest through my hair.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> The creme is very think &amp; has the feel of glue.</li>
            <li> and I really prefer that.  </li>
            <li> Once my hair was styled I conveniently received the finishing creme from Amazon :) My hair is bouncy, shiny and extra soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of heavy on my hair and by the end of the evening feels sticky.</li>
            <li> Pomregranate is better than the other cremes in the WEN product line in my opinion.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way..and smells great.</li>
            <li> I like a lot of other products much better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a strange texture, likened to how my hair feels at the end of a drive when I&#x27;ve ridden in a convertible with my hair flying free.</li>
            <li> It even makes the curls separate a little, instead of frizzing together and when my hair is straight, it makes the cut more defined.</li>
            <li> New fave!</li>
            <li> Found this product for more than 2/3 less the cost they sell it on QVC.  </li>
            <li> I have used similar products (Bed Head, Short Sexy Hair, Nexxus)</li>
            <li> It really helped keep my frizz down, and my hair looks healthy and soft.</li>
            <li> highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> Again, I felt there was a large difference in quality between what I purchased directly and what I purchased through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> it leaves your hair very  smooth and soft, not greasy or heavy at all.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be able to soften my hair but it actually left it very dry</li>
            <li> I have only used the product a few days, but I am very pleased with how soft and silky it makes my hair.</li>
            <li> I use it in combination with gel in my hair when I scrunch it for a different, easy look once in a while, to keep the frizzies away, and it creates large loose curls without spending all the extra time with a curling iron or hot rollers.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine hair down.</li>
            <li> this cream is never heavy and it drenches your curls with softness ans moisture, I am hooked!</li>
            <li> and you really don&#x27;t need much at a time, so it lasts long.</li>
            <li> I only use serum to de volume and de frizz, but I have a pretty soft hair texture naturally.</li>
            <li> I have thin curly hair and wanted something to give my hair more thickness!  </li>
            <li> While it seemed that at times it was okay; I have very thick hair and these products make my hair very waxy/sticky feeling.</li>
            <li> It does a great job on my crazy hair.</li>
            <li> I am extremely sensitive to beauty products of all kinds.  </li>
            <li> and it makes it so soft.</li>
            <li> Not heavy on your hair.</li>
            <li> The only con is that if I put too much in it has a tendency to make my hair feel a bit greasy.</li>
            <li> I put this on my natural hair and it seemed like it made it frizz.</li>
            <li> I am in the process of going natural and have not had a relaxer for 11 months.</li>
            <li> It is worth every bid spent to get this product in your home; to use.</li>
            <li> This is a useless product and I should not have purchased it without a good recommendation.</li>
            <li> you can NEVER go wrong with Wen products, love the scent, very light and does not weigh your hair down</li>
            <li> I recently went pretty short and the WEN moisture spray</li>
            <li> A little bit expensive but works very good....</li>
            <li> A little pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t greasy and adds definition to my style by holding it softly throughout the day and even the next.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m back to my old quality shampoo.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was different from the one I order from Wen Products directly from the Company Wen</li>
            <li> After washing my hair with the sweet almond mint cleansing conditioner and using the styling creme, I blow dried and flat ironed my hair.</li>
            <li> I have tried ALL the wen products, and I think this one is the LEAST useful for my hair so far.</li>
            <li> I have long straight hair and use a curling iron to get big bouncy loose curls that last 2 or 3 days.  </li>
            <li> Had to use large amount form little if any result.</li>
            <li> I have normal, slightly wavy hair that doesn&#x27;t  stay in place.</li>
            <li> I like thick curls that are more tacky; not hard, thin and crunchy</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount and the bottle is very large....will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> I apply this daily to my dry hair and it adds body and thickness</li>
            <li> I am in my 50&#x27;s and color my hair to disguise the grey.  </li>
            <li> After I wash and dry my hair, I squeeze a bit into my palms and use it to scrunch my long shoulder length hair into a style which gives my hair volume, and it looks like I have been to the hairdresser.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, short, full bodied hair and it is hard to manage.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used it on my dry hair before I straighten it</li>
            <li> /&gt;The directions say to use on dry styled hair.  </li>
            <li> after shampooing, before using the hair dryer, will eliminate dry, frizzy, fly-away hair while still maintaining the curls created with my curling iron.  </li>
            <li> Helps the ends of my dry damaged hair</li>
            <li> Sometimes a finishing product will dry your hair or build up.  </li>
            <li> This product is a \\&quot;finishing treatment\\&quot; and is supposed to be used on dry hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is the make of the product or the scent, but it makes my hair dry like a broom.</li>
            <li> I thought it was just me, so my husband used it and his hair was dry like straw too.</li>
            <li> A little too soft for my coarse hair, conditions and softens the hair with some styling,  Feels like the conditioner just a little thicker.</li>
            <li> Tried it on straight hair, not good.  </li>
            <li> I put it on while my hair is still wet and then blow dry my hair, then I straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> Dry hair or wet hair, this styling cream reakky works.</li>
            <li> I noticed absolutely no difference to the look and feel of my hair after putting it in.</li>
            <li> This \\&quot;finishing\\&quot; cream instantly turned them into limp waves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I use it when my hair wet and comb hair.</li>
            <li> expensive but as an add on its worth it.</li>
            <li> this product is really sticky than I expected, also it made my hair even worse.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Never again will I use any other product.</li>
            <li> I had used other Wen hair care and styling products, but this one isn&#x27;t for me.  </li>
            <li> It poofed up and was dry feeling, and a little sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> to long hair, squeeze out a very small pea, rub it between your hands and glide it over your dry hair.</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Prefer other Wen product, this was a little &#x27;sticky&#x27; for me.</li>
            <li> I have only used the Wen treatment creme once, it does seem a little too thick.  </li>
            <li> I have long thick hair and only need to use a dime size of this because it&#x27;s so thick.</li>
            <li> I am a black woman who does not relax her hair.</li>
            <li> have thick curly hair, the product makes my hair really dry and messy.</li>
            <li> Less than a pea sized amount rubbed between palms and smoothed through the surface helps tame the flyers.</li>
            <li> I then tried it after I dried my hair</li>
            <li> I found this product to be way too heavy for my hair, but I have friends that swear by it.</li>
            <li> Did not like it was heavy and</li>
            <li> I  like using  after I have dried my hair and want to &amp;#34;set&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Now at those times, I had air dried my hair with hair serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used it on air dried hair without hair serum, and it seemed like this stuff dried out my hair.</li>
            <li> body, doesn&#x27;t make my hair limp and enhances the curl.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t just washed and dried your hair forget it.</li>
            <li> I like heavy hair</li>
            <li> Annoyed I need it, but the cleasing conditioner isn&#x27;t enough to tame my overprocessed flyaway hair.</li>
            <li> As soon as it dries, I can brush my hair and it&#x27;s not sticky or stiff but the style stays.</li>
            <li> you have curly, frizzy hair that you are trying to tame, this product might be for</li>
            <li> It weighs down the hair and makes it appear dull.  Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin and curly with no natural body.</li>
            <li> This creme is thick but it doesn&#x27;t weight your hair down.</li>
            <li> Made it thick and heavy, not smooth or shiny.</li>
            <li> Tried it on thick coarse hair, worse, I don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> and i am not sure i needed this -</li>
            <li> I use a small amount after blowdrying my hair.  </li>
            <li> I usually use a $25 finishing cream from Sephora.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure what hair type</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why.</li>
            <li> It was very heavy feeling in the hair</li>
            <li> If you try to shampoo every other day, this add on will make your hair look greasy, and tired.</li>
            <li> It also keeps it from looking dull.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and I still need to use a bottled conditioner.</li>
            <li> I am not a favorite of pomegranate!</li>
            <li> (you curly girls out there know what I mean).</li>
            <li> Texture is not good, the cream is too thick and sticky.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> i wanted something that would replace hair spray and give my hair body and hold - not sure this does that - I have just used it a couple of times and was not particularly impressed - i do like the styling product</li>
            <li> BUT IT IS VERY THICK.  </li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t go wrong with WEN all their product is off the chain, i use it on my LOCS.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not impressed.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone with crazy hair like I have.</li>
            <li> I was expecting something that would complement it, but this just leaves my hair feeling sticky and dirty.</li>
            <li> Anyone out there who is afraid to try this product don&#x27;t I promise u will not regret it.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel too dirty .I</li>
            <li> This finishing creme is sticky, and disappointing.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Absolutely great! this cream is never heavy and it drenches your curls with softness ans moisture, I am hooked!</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful for my hair type.  I have thick, short, full bodied hair and it is hard to manage.  I am in my 50&#x27;s and color my hair to disguise the grey.  I have used similar products (Bed Head, Short Sexy Hair, Nexxus) but I find that this finishing treatment absorbs quickly yet helps my hair maintain it&#x27;s style without using a ton of hairspray.  This is a quality product and meets my expectations.</li>
            <li> I put this on everytime I get out of the shower &amp; my hair is shiny smooth. I love it &amp; would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> Wen is the best hair product I have found to date.  I use the shampoo, styling cream and now this.  I would recommend it.  My hair is so soft and I have locks!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have tried ALL the wen products, and I think this one is the LEAST useful for my hair so far. I noticed absolutely no difference to the look and feel of my hair after putting it in. Maybe it is meant to make a difference only after months of continuous use. I will not be finding out, as I will not buy this one again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a year; I don&#x27;t leave home without it.  It is not only a treatment but also great for styling my hair.  After I wash and dry my hair, I squeeze a bit into my palms and use it to scrunch my long shoulder length hair into a style which gives my hair volume, and it looks like I have been to the hairdresser.  highly recommend.  Wen suggests mixing with the cleansing conditioner for styling but I find the product can be used alone.</li>
            <li> Nice finishing cream that helped smooth my hair and keep its style throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Best hair products around!!!</li>
            <li> I thought it would be able to soften my hair but it actually left it very dry and I had to keep wetting my hair to retain the softeness to my hair</li>
            <li> This product lasted me more than a year.  My hair is frizzy and coarse. I can easily blow it silky straight straight but the frizzies creep back. Less than a pea sized amount rubbed between palms and smoothed through the surface helps tame the flyers. I love Wen and I am a true convert.  I try all of it now.</li>
            <li> I ordered some cleansing cream from another website and received this product along with it.  I do have curly hair and it works wonders at controlling the frizz.  Don&#x27;t use a lot though.  A small amount goes a long way.  I am extremely sensitive to beauty products of all kinds.  I&#x27;ve been using the Wen products for over a month now and I haven&#x27;t had any problems.  My hair is in the best condition it&#x27;s been in over 20 years</li>
            <li> Had to use large amount form little if any result. Would not purchase again. Shampoo and styling cr√®me OK to good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not for me .but its the real thing !!!!!! so I would recommend this product for users. Great price!!</li>
            <li> Wen is an amazing line. I use this for my hair &amp; skin, with wonderful results. Never again will I use any other product.</li>
            <li> Wen Products are very good quality.  This finishing cream gives your hair fabulous shine and great hold.  This product does not leave your feeling tacky.</li>
            <li> I really love the finishing treatment. I put it on while my hair is still wet and then blow dry my hair, then I straighten my hair. I&#x27;ve also used it on my dry hair before I straighten it and it makes it so soft.</li>
            <li> Price on this is great. I love WEN products and this one is added to my must have daily routine. I recently went pretty short and the WEN moisture spray and then the finishing creme and I&#x27;m out the door. Holds my hair in place without the crunchy hairspray feeling.</li>
            <li> I have long straight hair and use a curling iron to get big bouncy loose curls that last 2 or 3 days.  This \\&quot;finishing\\&quot; cream instantly turned them into limp waves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions say to use on dry styled hair.  I did that.  I then tried it after I dried my hair but before I curled it.  Still had the same results -- my hair would no longer hold a curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have curly, frizzy hair that you are trying to tame, this product might be for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find using [[ASIN:B004Z209HS Pura D&#x27;or Pure &amp; Organic Argan Oil (4 fl. oz.)]] after shampooing, before using the hair dryer, will eliminate dry, frizzy, fly-away hair while still maintaining the curls created with my curling iron.  I also use [[ASIN:B00435WONE Original Sprout Tahitian Hair Oil - 4 oz.]] and [[ASIN:B001ET78CY Giovanni Frizz Be Gone, 2.75 fl oz Containers (Pack of 3)]].</li>
            <li> Love it Wen is the best</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using wen for several months now, so I bought the finishing cream for my sister to try. She has curly hair that can be quite unmanageable at times. The first time she used this product, almost all the frizz was gone!!! Now she has beautiful, luxurious curls that look like a professional spent hours on them, but thanks to wen its wash and wear!! Great product and it smells fantastic!</li>
            <li> it leaves your hair very  smooth and soft, not greasy or heavy at all. and you really don&#x27;t need much at a time, so it lasts long.</li>
            <li> I use this great product and normally purchase it on QVC, but on Amazon I was able to get it at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> you can NEVER go wrong with Wen products, love the scent, very light and does not weigh your hair down</li>
            <li> Just say WEN! Summer sun and chlorine takes a toll on my mane, but WEN understands the importance of moisture. Finishing Treatment fixes fly away strands and adds a smooth finish whatever your style.</li>
            <li> It is great for your hair.  It is cheap on Amazon.  I recommend it for anyone.  Pomregranate is better than the other cremes in the WEN product line in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It helps to get rid of the fly away ends and it works great in humidity.&lt;br /&gt;Would buy it again.</li>
            <li> This product has made a world of difference to my hair. I have fine curly curly hair. I was prone to breakage as I also have been dying my hair for thirty years. My hair has grown longer and is much healthier.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to keep your hair beautiful! I also love the pomegranate smell - its great!  This is a great styling product and does not make hair greasy.</li>
            <li> WEN is such an amazing product! I don&#x27;t know what hasn&#x27;t already been said about it. My hair is in love with it. This item was promptly received in excellent condition. :o)</li>
            <li> Keeps my wavy hair from being frizzy.  Have used it for a few years and really like it.</li>
            <li> I had used other Wen hair care and styling products, but this one isn&#x27;t for me.  It weighs down the hair and makes it appear dull.  Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Great product. I have relaxed African hair. Works well after the cleansing conditioner. It improves texture and is not greasy so there is no build up. I can use it every day.</li>
            <li> I have only used the Wen treatment creme once, it does seem a little too thick.  I have used another creme I ordered through Amazon, which feels better.  But I will give it a try, it does smell very good. I do like the Wen hair cleanser very much, so I will use the creme.  I am sending some of the treatment creme to my niece who was deployed to Japan,  she is in the Navy, she also likes the Wen hair cleanser very much.</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t go wrong with WEN all their product is off the chain, i use it on my LOCS. its nice and light</li>
            <li> I love this product but wish they did it in a different perfume.  I am not a favorite of pomegranate!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen this advertised and decided to give it a try.  Saw a difference immediately.  Have shared to the product with others and they are now purchasing the WEN products,</li>
            <li> he also love the finishing creme wen is a great product.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It does a great job on my crazy hair. Glad I can find it on amazon and at a good price.</li>
            <li> I found this product to be way too heavy for my hair, but I have friends that swear by it. Got it at such a great price that its worth a try.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine who this might work for!  The one and only time I tried this product, I had to shampoo it right out.  Luckily I had time that day or I would have had to wear a hat.  It made my hair look greasy even though I had just shampooed.  It was very heavy feeling in the hair and I only used a tiny amount since I don&#x27;t like a lot of product on my hair.</li>
            <li> Did not like it was heavy and really just did nothing was expecting something much better just would not recommended</li>
            <li> This is my second tub of WEN Finishing Creme.  I  like using  after I have dried my hair and want to &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; it for the day.  It isn&#x27;t greasy and adds definition to my style by holding it softly throughout the day and even the next.</li>
            <li> she received them used them and was very happy of the results it gave she never told me much but it made her hair feel good so thats all i can say</li>
            <li> Great stuff!!  My hair is thin and curly with no natural body. I apply this daily to my dry hair and it adds body and thickness</li>
            <li> THIS HAIR CREAM SMELLS GREAT BUT IT IS VERY THICK.  IT HAS A PASTEY OR TACKY FEEL TO IT SO ONLY APPLY A DIME SIZED AMOUNT. OVERALL, GOOD PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Woks well at a great price.  Makes my hair soft and smells great ,  Helps the ends of my dry damaged hair</li>
            <li> Tried the WEN shampoo and finishing cream but I&#x27;m not impressed. I didn&#x27;t like the way my hair felt, felt like there was residue, hair tangled easily and had static. I&#x27;m back to my old quality shampoo. Thank goodness I could return it via Amazon, they&#x27;re the BEST</li>
            <li> Been using Wen products &amp; luv them.&lt;br /&gt;I have color treated hair &amp; this creme really works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much cheaper to buy through Amazon &amp; shipping was fast</li>
            <li> Not what I expected. I thought it would calm the frizzes and just make my hair smoother, but it didn&#x27;t. I guess Wen is just not for me.</li>
            <li> I love all of the Wen products...no exceptions! I have super curly hair and frequently straighten it. This helps repair makes it look great! I love wearing my hair both straight and curly now. :)</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It helps to make my hair fuller and full of body.</li>
            <li> I use WEN shampoo *cleanser* because my hair stays shiny and clean and very soft.  I saw this styling cream on tv and looked on the web; Amazon had the best price (no surprise!) So I ordered it. This cream makes my bangs stay where I comb them and my frizzy hair becomes smooth and silky. As soon as it dries, I can brush my hair and it&#x27;s not sticky or stiff but the style stays. I will keep using this. And it doesnt take much, I just use a quarter size of the cream and rub it between my hands, then rub some on my bangs and the rest through my hair. Dry hair or wet hair, this styling cream reakky works. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Bought on sale. Would not pay full retail. Annoyed I need it, but the cleasing conditioner isn&#x27;t enough to tame my overprocessed flyaway hair. It&#x27;s thick and I still need to use a bottled conditioner.</li>
            <li> Great product and pricing. Shipping was done in timely manner.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like product.&lt;br /&gt;It was different from the one I order from Wen Products directly from the Company Wen</li>
            <li> This product is great....gives your hair body and definition but never greasy.  A little goes a long way..and smells great.</li>
            <li> Not heavy on your hair. It also doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. I would recommend this to anyone with crazy hair like I have.</li>
            <li> Best stuff I have ever used on my hair started buying on qvc but found here for a cheaper price so have been buying here ever since best stuff I have ever used for a leave in condioner I give it 5 stars .Won&#x27;t use any thing else on my hair for a leave in condioner love this stuff.</li>
            <li> My wife swears by the Wen products to keep her hair in its greatest condition.</li>
            <li> Liked product and smelled great.</li>
            <li> Another great Wen product.  I used this on my hair and it gave me body and texture, even in this hot humid weather.  It is an excellent smoother for your hair.  A little bit goes a long way.  Sometimes a finishing product will dry your hair or build up.  This goes right into the hair.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine hair down.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.  Haven&#x27;t had this kind of success since I was in my teens. Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> I use it when my hair wet and comb hair. My hair look volume and good swing.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for just over a year.  I like all the Wen products.  I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> Great finishing product, no more knots....great smell and no need to have tangles with colored hair anymore.  Thank you for a great product...</li>
            <li> this product is really sticky than I expected, also it made my hair even worse. I was really excited to have this product, but it didn&#x27;t work for my hair...so disappointed. I use wen cleansing conditioner, and it works well. that&#x27;s why I thought this finishing treatment would have worked for me but it didn&#x27;t. Texture is not good, the cream is too thick and sticky.&lt;br /&gt;I have thick curly hair, the product makes my hair really dry and messy.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair - i wanted something that would replace hair spray and give my hair body and hold - not sure this does that - I have just used it a couple of times and was not particularly impressed - i do like the styling product and i am not sure i needed this - But it was such a bargain i couldn&#x27;t resist - I&#x27;ll keep using it</li>
            <li> Its pretty good-but I prefer the shampoo. It does keep the hair feeling healthy. It also keeps it from looking dull.</li>
            <li> I use a small amount after blowdrying my hair.  I have normal, slightly wavy hair that doesn&#x27;t  stay in place. The Finishing cream  provided  some nice shine, body and  hold. I will  definitely order more of this. I think this styling product is better than a styling cream.</li>
            <li> Prefer other Wen product, this was a little &#x27;sticky&#x27; for me. Perhaps I don&#x27;t know how to use it correctly.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t help my hair. Made it thick and heavy, not smooth or shiny. This is a useless product and I should not have purchased it without a good recommendation. Doesn&#x27;t do what it says.</li>
            <li> Wen is fabulous.  My hair is very damaged from bleaching but wen has made it look healthy again. I would definitely recommend this product. The styling cream holds curls all day without damaging chemicals. Love it.</li>
            <li> All products  from Wen they are fabulous</li>
            <li> Found this product for more than 2/3 less the cost they sell it on QVC.  I use it in combination with gel in my hair when I scrunch it for a different, easy look once in a while, to keep the frizzies away, and it creates large loose curls without spending all the extra time with a curling iron or hot rollers.  It&#x27;s wonderful !  Love it.</li>
            <li> It is not as great as it was hype to be I use as required and have yet to see a improvement.</li>
            <li> I love Wen. I was expecting something that would complement it, but this just leaves my hair feeling sticky and dirty. It may work for people who want more texture in their hair, but as a person who uses Wen because of how smooth it makes my hair, this definitely did not work for me. I plan on giving it to a friend and continuing to use Wen cleansing conditioner as a leave-in - that seems to work much better, anyway.</li>
            <li> Works good!  My hair has seen better days do to coloring it every couple months.  Since using the Wen products it has change a lot.  It looks fuller, thicker &amp; much more healthier than it has been.  It works best when using with the conditioning cleanser.</li>
            <li> A great product for any occasion.  Great for when you want a little extra texture, or if you really want to smooth out your look. Looking to add volume? Then this is your product for you too! The only con is that if I put too much in it has a tendency to make my hair feel a bit greasy. Im working on getting the right amount. Love this product!</li>
            <li> I love love love Wen products. I am a black woman who does not relax her hair. Wen products are the best. My hair stays soft full of body I have good hair days everyday. Anyone out there who is afraid to try this product don&#x27;t I promise u will not regret it.</li>
            <li> I am an African American woman with relaxed hair. I began using wen about a month ago. Today is the first day I added the finishing creme to my hair regime. After washing my hair with the sweet almond mint cleansing conditioner and using the styling creme, I blow dried and flat ironed my hair. Once my hair was styled I conveniently received the finishing creme from Amazon :) My hair is bouncy, shiny and extra soft. So far this is a definite keeper and hope Amazon will continue to have it for such a wonderful price.</li>
            <li> i am caucasion and have fine curly hair, but a lot of it. I don&#x27;t like the wet-gel look curls that salons always want to give me. I like thick curls that are more tacky; not hard, thin and crunchy (you curly girls out there know what I mean). I mix a generous squeeze of this with my aveda b-curly and my hair is amazing. I used this concoction on a super humid Pennsylvania day and it really held my curls in place and thickened them with no frizz. i am officially in love.</li>
            <li> I use all of WEN products and just love them all! I have long, very fine hair and this is great to add texture and volume! The price is amazing too!!</li>
            <li> i just LOVE this cream.  It doesn&#x27;t get much better Wen products are wonderful Please give this cream a try</li>
            <li> I just started using Wen and I&#x27;m in love! This product is a \\&quot;finishing treatment\\&quot; and is supposed to be used on dry hair. I will warn you...less is more with this product! If you use too much, you will not be happy. If used as directed, this 4oz. tube could last you 2 years or more. I&#x27;ve seen Chaz Dean present this product and he said, for med. to long hair, squeeze out a very small pea, rub it between your hands and glide it over your dry hair. It makes my hair feel so healthy and silky, it&#x27;s not greasy, it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, I just love it! I can also say, ordering this from Amazon saved me a ton of money...it&#x27;s a fabulous deal!</li>
            <li> This product does NOT work! I have medium frizz so I applied the suggested amount &amp; it did nothing. The creme is very think &amp; has the feel of glue. The creme made it more difficult to style or straighten my hair because it is somewhat sticky. Everyone is different as is their hair so what won&#x27;t work for some, will work for others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only positive thing, in my opinion, is that it smells nice.</li>
            <li> is not at all what you hear in the commercials, i have used it and will finishall, I will not buy this product again</li>
            <li> The first couple of times I used this, it worked great and my hair felt smooth and nice. Now at those times, I had air dried my hair with hair serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I used it on air dried hair without hair serum, and it seemed like this stuff dried out my hair. My hair was nice and soft prior to applying this creme. I only use serum to de volume and de frizz, but I have a pretty soft hair texture naturally. I put this on my natural hair and it seemed like it made it frizz. It poofed up and was dry feeling, and a little sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, heads up: Buy one tube and try it first, and then if it works, buy more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should also note that I tried this on damp hair, and the results were amazing.</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount and the bottle is very large....will last a long time.  I love the smell and the texture.  It works great and it is very gentle...I use it on my 18 month olds hair.  I would recommend and will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> A little bit expensive but works very good....nice results....</li>
            <li> This a wonderful product.  It is worth every bid spent to get this product in your home; to use. I would advise any one to purchase it.</li>
            <li> Great products! Always happy with the way these products make my hair look and feel. My hair has never looked better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used WEN for many years now but never tried this product before. I have thin curly hair and wanted something to give my hair more thickness!  This does the trick!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for keeping the Frizzies out of your hair.</li>
            <li> I like a lot of other products much better.</li>
            <li> Wen Finishing Treatment is a great product!  I love Chaz Dean&#x27;s line of hair care items and use several different ones and love most all including this one!</li>
            <li> I love WEN stuff, works great and good for my hair!</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my daughter as a gift to help her repair her hair. She loves the way it makes her hair feel.</li>
            <li> I have only used the product a few days, but I am very pleased with how soft and silky it makes my hair. It is nog greasy at all. I am in the process of going natural and have not had a relaxer for 11 months. This product will be a keeper for my hair regimen.</li>
            <li> WEN products are incredible, and this is no exception. It smells delicious, a nice clean fruity scent that lingers. I have long thick hair and only need to use a dime size of this because it&#x27;s so thick. After just a few uses, I absolutely notice the difference. My hair feels softer and looks healthier.</li>
            <li> I usually use a $25 finishing cream from Sephora.  I got this for $7 as an add on and it works just as well.  Great smell too.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel too dirty .I guess I like to use lather for my hair. Didn&#x27;t want  to be a Wen girl at this time.</li>
            <li> I love this product when I decided to curl my hair.  No need for hairspray and the next morning curls are still in tact.  I use this product along with the styling cr√®me.</li>
            <li> it does wonders for the hair. my daughter and i both love it. expensive but as an add on its worth it.</li>
            <li> Great stuff!  Even with my fine hair!&lt;br /&gt;Adds body, doesn&#x27;t make my hair limp and enhances the curl.&lt;br /&gt;what&#x27;s not to like!</li>
            <li> This finishing creme is sticky, and disappointing.  Don&#x27;t like, won&#x27;t use and won&#x27;t recommend it.  I am not sure what hair type it&#x27;s for.  Tried it on straight hair, not good.  Tried it on thick coarse hair, worse, I don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> the iteam is as desribed.....it also arrived on time.......I would by fromthis vendor again for future products....very happy with iteam.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is the make of the product or the scent, but it makes my hair dry like a broom. I thought it was just me, so my husband used it and his hair was dry like straw too.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t just washed and dried your hair forget it. If you try to shampoo every other day, this add on will make your hair look greasy, and tired.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try this but it was pricey on the Q. So I decided to order it from here and I&#x27;m so glad I did. It really helped keep my frizz down, and my hair looks healthy and soft. And they ship fast! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and was worried this product would be too heavy on my hair, but it works great.  Just put it on the ends to spruce up your hairdo on the second day after a shampoo or work into roots for more volume.  I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Smells nice. Not for my hair since I don&#x27;t straighten is</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I am african-american with relaxed hair. This creme is thick but it doesn&#x27;t weight your hair down. I like heavy hair so I use a generous amount but great for flat iron straighting. New fave!</li>
            <li> I have been using Wen products for almost four years: cleanser, mark, finishing treatment, mouse, ...</li>
            <li> Excellent seller! Quick shipping. Great product! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Again, I felt there was a large difference in quality between what I purchased directly and what I purchased through Amazon.  I&#x27;m not sure why.</li>
            <li> This is another product that I don&#x27;t get.  What is it supposed to do because I see no difference from using or not using it.</li>
            <li> I use this as an alternative to the treatment oil which adds a nice shine, but can become a little oily if accidentally use too much.  This gives more definition and texture, which I like a lot.  It even makes the curls separate a little, instead of frizzing together and when my hair is straight, it makes the cut more defined.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the original styling cream and I really prefer that.  This doesn&#x27;t control my curls and frizz as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Wen products for about a year now and actually thought I was getting the styling creme when I bought this. It&#x27;s kind of heavy on my hair and by the end of the evening feels sticky. I&#x27;ll finish this tube (it will take me about a year, most likely) but I will not buy it again. The Volume Styling Creme is MUCH better.</li>
            <li> I read a ton of reviews on WEN products. While it seemed that at times it was okay; I have very thick hair and these products make my hair very waxy/sticky feeling. It&#x27;s a strange texture, likened to how my hair feels at the end of a drive when I&#x27;ve ridden in a convertible with my hair flying free. I don&#x27;t know; maybe this product is more for people with fine hair??</li>
            <li> I ordered WEN Finishing Treatment Creme.  It definitely helps to refine my curls and keep my hair from frizzing, even on the most humid of days.  I ordered from Poopsy Plump&#x27;s Boutique.  I received my order within days.  I was quite suprised that I received it so quickly.  Poopsy Plump&#x27;s Boutique is honest and dependible.  I would definitely order from Poopsy&#x27;s again and again.[[ASIN:B0075GXW0W WEN Finishing Treatment Creme in Pomegranate 4 fl. oz.]]</li>
            <li> A little too soft for my coarse hair, conditions and softens the hair with some styling,  Feels like the conditioner just a little thicker. Smells yummy!</li>
            <li> This is an okay product along with Wen Cleansing cream.  If anyone has tried the Wen Mist, I would like to know how that works.  I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this again.  You can use the Wen cleansing shampoo as a conditioner as well.  A little pricey but worth it.</li>
