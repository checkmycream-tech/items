    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Great doing business with this seller.</li>
            <li>It is a good product.</li>
            <li>I love the comfort of this pillow, it seemed to work great as I could fill it with water and use it in the tub.</li>
            <li>Very good product, made of very durable material, seller was wonderful and very fast shipping!  </li>
            <li>I originally bought this item to use as a tub cushion while I sit in the tub giving my infant a bath, but it is wonderful, very comfortable and great for just relaxing in the tub yourself, It could also be used as a regular seat cushion if you so choose.  </li>
            <li>On the positive - made in the US and great quality construction.  </li>
            <li>When filling with water most comes out when you TRY to close/seal the valve.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking for a better cushion to replace this one.</li>
            <li>I thoroughly enjoyed using this product in the bath tub for the two months that it lasted.</li>
            <li>The air &amp;#34;opening&amp;#34; is very large, and a good bit of air is lost before the cap can be replaced.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not an easy fill in the sink, use the bathtub.</li>
            <li>However, this particular booster/cushion is as good as any.</li>
            <li>I was comfortable and happy, until I got out and realized the holes had left hicky looking marks all over my bottom.</li>
            <li>I filled it with water</li>
            <li>I have scoliosis which make it comfortable to sit in a walk in bath.  </li>
            <li>It is comfortable to sit on and saves wear on bathing suits.  </li>
            <li>This product was purchased with the belief (perhaps mistakenly) that the pillow, when filled with water, would remain secure to the bottom of our spa.  </li>
            <li>I filled mine with silica sand.  </li>
            <li>It stays wherever I put it, and still is a comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Price is great,  I will get a second one.</li>
            <li>I returned mine and was not refunded the original shipping cost of approx.</li>
            <li>None are outstanding, as the hot spa water and chemicals tend to deteriorate the product quickly.  </li>
            <li>it works good for short bathes &amp; Don&#x27;t drop it</li>
            <li>when filled with water as directed, the pillow floats around and gets in the way -- an obvious point when plastic is more buoyant than water.    </li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>The &#x27;pillow&#x27; doesn&#x27;t stay put, and isn&#x27;t tall enough (2\\&quot;) for most people.</li>
            <li>I spent more than I wanted to trying to find a \\&quot;booster seat\\&quot; for my hot tub.</li>
            <li>Had it not have blown apart at the seam, I would certainly have given it a five star review.</li>
            <li>This booster cushion that you fill with water works very well in the spa.  </li>
            <li>For the cost, I expected a better product.</li>
            <li>even at that it becomes very slippery if any soap gets on it.  </li>
            <li>It wants to lift you off the seat.</li>
            <li>Pros: is soft, durable welds, good size, came fast on order, reasonably priced, functional, meets the objective of boosting the individual a few inches, no leaks.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am definitely far from obese, yet the cushion &amp;#34;blew</li>
            <li>I am going to throw this out and pay $60 for a usable hot tub &#x27;brick&#x27; which gives 4\\&quot; of height and allows the addition of pea gravel or other high density material to prevent floatation.</li>
            <li>Suction cups are equally useless, as many hot tubs are textured and prevent adhesion.</li>
            <li>I placed the empty pillow on top of my bath water, with the opening down on the underside.  </li>
            <li>We have been looking for padding for our disabled family member to use in the hot tub.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately it wasn&#x27;t that expensive and might have been a flaw in that particular product.</li>

            <li> These cushions are hard to keep under your bottom and don&#x27;t raise me enough.</li>
            <li> My husband bought this for me because I have back issues and soaking in a hot tub seams to help; however it was also painful sitting in the tub.  </li>
            <li> I must take sit down showers with a hand held shower head.  </li>
            <li> I bought it to use as a pillow behind my back in the bath tub, but how do you get air to stay in when the opening is 1 inch wide?</li>
            <li> The fuller, the less waviness you&#x27;ll feel.</li>
            <li> but it was too heavy to use as a back rest, and was rather scary maneuvering such a heavy item while in the tub.  </li>
            <li> At 5&#x27;1\\&quot; I need a little lift.</li>
            <li> Gets a little heavy when its out of water, I can deal with that.  </li>
            <li> This was a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T waste your money.</li>
            <li> This air cushion is not fit to use as a shower or spa cushion.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> It will not fit, and I uave no use for it</li>
            <li> I called the company but they would not refund my money even though the description said you could fill it with air and get a refund if not satisfied, so I devised a way to make it useable.  </li>
            <li> Filling with water kinda worked, until anyone (no matter how small) went to sit on it....</li>
            <li> Yet the valve is so big it is impossible to inflate and keep pressurized when you try to put the cap in.  </li>
            <li> I am not saying it is not a good product</li>
            <li> again poor valve design.</li>
            <li> Filling was difficult since there is no  one way valve to keep the water from running out.</li>
            <li> Wrong).    </li>
            <li> The cushion is difficult to fill because it does not have a valve in the stem.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t seem to use it in any way without it leaving marks that not only look awful but take days to go away.</li>
            <li> So unfortunately I can&#x27;t use it for the purpose I bought it.</li>
            <li> it is cold to sit on.  </li>
            <li> It is also very difficult to blow up.  </li>

            <li> This was a waste of money.  I bought it to use as a pillow behind my back in the bath tub, but how do you get air to stay in when the opening is 1 inch wide? As soon as I removed my mouth, the air rushed out. I called the company but they would not refund my money even though the description said you could fill it with air and get a refund if not satisfied, so I devised a way to make it useable.  I filled it with water but it was too heavy to use as a back rest, and was rather scary maneuvering such a heavy item while in the tub.  I had to find a way to keep air in it.  I placed the empty pillow on top of my bath water, with the opening down on the underside.  Then I inserted a long straw into the opening and blew water into the pillow, then closed the cap under water.  Some air escaped, and some water seeped in, but at least it was usable, though only 2/3 full.&lt;br /&gt;The pillow plastic and closing cap seemed extremely durable, looking exactly like our waterbed plastic and cap.  But it wasn&#x27;t long until it leaked and was thrown away.</li>
            <li> I have scoliosis which make it comfortable to sit in a walk in bath.  the only problem is that the cushion blow-up pillow sticks to my buttock.</li>
            <li> This booster cushion that you fill with water works very well in the spa.  It is comfortable to sit on and saves wear on bathing suits.  You need to put in in the spa while it is heating otherwise it is cold to sit on.  It is a good product.</li>
            <li> I gave this item as a gift and it is doing what it says it can do.[[ASIN:B000BYPLMM Luxury Bath &amp; Spa Booster Seat Cushion]]</li>
            <li> The &#x27;pillow&#x27; doesn&#x27;t stay put, and isn&#x27;t tall enough (2\\&quot;) for most people. When filling with water most comes out when you TRY to close/seal the valve. DON&#x27;T waste your money. I am going to throw this out and pay $60 for a usable hot tub &#x27;brick&#x27; which gives 4\\&quot; of height and allows the addition of pea gravel or other high density material to prevent floatation. Suction cups are equally useless, as many hot tubs are textured and prevent adhesion.</li>
            <li> I bought this for our indoor tub. Filling was difficult since there is no  one way valve to keep the water from running out. Several days later  and with little use it decided to leak. Fortunately it wasn&#x27;t that expensive and might have been a flaw in that particular product.</li>
            <li> I spent more than I wanted to trying to find a \\&quot;booster seat\\&quot; for my hot tub. At 5&#x27;1\\&quot; I need a little lift. These cushions are hard to keep under your bottom and don&#x27;t raise me enough. For the cost, I expected a better product.</li>
            <li> This product was purchased with the belief (perhaps mistakenly) that the pillow, when filled with water, would remain secure to the bottom of our spa.  (In point of fact, I had believed that the pillow had suction cups built in to achieve this.  Wrong).    Event when filled with water as directed, the pillow floats around and gets in the way -- an obvious point when plastic is more buoyant than water.    On the positive - made in the US and great quality construction.  Just not was I thought is was going to be.</li>
            <li> We have been looking for padding for our disabled family member to use in the hot tub.  Nothing would stay in place.  (Suction cups don&#x27;t appear to last very long and we had many disappointing experiences..)  But this product enables you to fill it with water!!  It stays on the bottom of the tub and provides the comfort our family member needs!!</li>
            <li> Very good product, made of very durable material, seller was wonderful and very fast shipping!  Great doing business with this seller.</li>
            <li> I must take sit down showers with a hand held shower head.  This air cushion is not fit to use as a shower or spa cushion.  I am definitely far from obese, yet the cushion &amp;#34;blew up&amp;#34; at my 2nd use.  It is also very difficult to blow up.  The air &amp;#34;opening&amp;#34; is very large, and a good bit of air is lost before the cap can be replaced.  I would not recommend this as anything but use for a child, and even at that it becomes very slippery if any soap gets on it.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This seat is not as advertised. The cushion is difficult to fill because it does not have a valve in the stem. Therefore when you fill it with water, it shoots back out on you while you work to plug it. Secondly, it does not stay put. It wants to lift you off the seat. I returned mine and was not refunded the original shipping cost of approx. $6.00. So I&#x27;m out $12. Yuck.</li>
            <li> I had seen the mat on amazon my girl friend likes to take bathes she like how it looked on the p.c when we got it it works good for short bathes &amp; Don&#x27;t drop it it will pop.I am not saying it is not a good product it is thats why i bought 1 more.p.s. it poped with water in it.</li>
            <li> This is not what I wanted. I wanted to use it in my walk in bath. It will not fit, and I uave no use for it</li>
            <li> I have a back injury and love taking long hot baths, but find it difficult to sit and tolerate the hard tub surface. I love the comfort of this pillow, it seemed to work great as I could fill it with water and use it in the tub. I was comfortable and happy, until I got out and realized the holes had left hicky looking marks all over my bottom. I can&#x27;t seem to use it in any way without it leaving marks that not only look awful but take days to go away. So unfortunately I can&#x27;t use it for the purpose I bought it.</li>
            <li> I have purchased several similar products over the years. None are outstanding, as the hot spa water and chemicals tend to deteriorate the product quickly.  However, this particular booster/cushion is as good as any.</li>
            <li> I filled mine with silica sand.  It stays wherever I put it, and still is a comfortable.  Gets a little heavy when its out of water, I can deal with that.  Price is great,  I will get a second one.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this item to use as a tub cushion while I sit in the tub giving my infant a bath, but it is wonderful, very comfortable and great for just relaxing in the tub yourself, It could also be used as a regular seat cushion if you so choose.  I like it very much.</li>
            <li> My husband bought this for me because I have back issues and soaking in a hot tub seams to help; however it was also painful sitting in the tub.  This cushion worked well but only lasted about a month before the seam in one of the circles opened up.  Wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. I&#x27;m looking for a better cushion to replace this one.</li>
            <li> I thoroughly enjoyed using this product in the bath tub for the two months that it lasted. Had it not have blown apart at the seam, I would certainly have given it a five star review.</li>
            <li> Yes it&#x27;s made in the U.S. and is durable.  Yet the valve is so big it is impossible to inflate and keep pressurized when you try to put the cap in.  Filling with water kinda worked, until anyone (no matter how small) went to sit on it.... again poor valve design.</li>
            <li> Pros: is soft, durable welds, good size, came fast on order, reasonably priced, functional, meets the objective of boosting the individual a few inches, no leaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: the access port is like a beach ball but about 2 inches in diameter. The problem is that it does not recess into itself leaving the spout sticking out and that gets in the way of comfort. It&#x27;s not an easy fill in the sink, use the bathtub. It&#x27;s not solid under the user meaning it tends to be a bit wavy in motion depending on how well you fill it. The fuller, the less waviness you&#x27;ll feel.</li>
