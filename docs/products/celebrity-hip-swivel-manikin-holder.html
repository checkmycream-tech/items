    <ol>
            <li> It did not work, and I think it was missing pieces. Please save your money!</li>
            <li> works as it is supposed to, no issues easy to clamp and helps when you working on the head fantastic</li>
            <li> This holder has proven very useful at our house. My daughter has a mannequin head that she uses for play, and this holder makes it very portable and easy  to use.</li>
            <li> first time i used BROKE</li>
            <li> The stand for the wig was what I expected it to be.  It swivels and will adjust.  I received it in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> It does hold the manikin head well and constantly needs adjusting, part if the problem maybe that I bought it for my daughter</li>
            <li> I ordered this product recently with a mannequin head. It works well, and is easy to assemble ( I assembled it on my own, that&#x27;s a miracle). It can be tightened to swivel less, or loosened to swivel more.</li>
            <li> needed this for the mannequin head for my daughter to do hair and make up on...works as it should--hold on to table and mannequin well.</li>
            <li> It came just as expected :)</li>
            <li> The Hip Swivel Mankin Holder works great. It&#x27;s like asking someone to move their head so you can braid it.  Love it.&lt;br /&gt;CR</li>
            <li> I LIKE IT EVEN THINKING OF BUYING MORE, YOU CAN USE THEM ON ALL KINDS OF SURFACES</li>
            <li> I really like this thing. I use it to hold my cosplay wig and it clamps very easily onto my desk. The only problem I have with it is that it&#x27;s a little short. I think it&#x27;d be nice if I could raise it and lower it to make life easy.</li>
            <li> Secures the mannequin head to the table and allows you to position the head the way you like.  Truly worth the extra expense.</li>
            <li> Works fine after you figure out how to put it together.  A bit flimsy, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> Its perfect, you can simply post it on anything, such as a table, counter, or even a desk. Its very strong, tall, and Durable. I love it.</li>
            <li> Manikin head fit perfectly on this holder.  It can be loosened to allow the head to tilt in different directions or it can be tightened to keep the head in one position.  Great!</li>
            <li> God quality and price.</li>
            <li> this product look very professional,i am very satisfy with dis product and i love it,very good product to buy,i am a  beauty school student and this is exactly what i wanted,i really recommend this product for home use and cosmetology students,this is a good product to buy and enjoy.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent clamp.  The only problem is that the stem that fits inside the cosmetology head does not have a screw to tighten it.  So you will have to be careful with your touch, it rotates very freely.  This clamp works well on anything with an overhanging lip.  Couner, table, chair.  Easy to attach and remove.</li>
            <li> very sturdy and well made and sets still in a position when you tighten it up,,ive been looking for one of these,,and the price was great  thanks</li>
            <li> Not sure if I was missing a piece for this device.  the inside rod would not stand straight up and kept falling out of the holder.</li>
            <li> The product is very good! Better than I purchased before!!! Steady not flimsy... Will buy again!</li>
            <li> This is very sturdy.  Holds  wig heads in place well for styling and cutting.  Can turn to different angles as needed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the right product but when I got it the top won&#x27;t come off for me to put it together.  Plus it didn&#x27;t come with instructions so went on YouTube and found how to put it together but the top will not just come off.</li>
            <li> The stand for the wig was what I expected it to be. It swivels and will adjust. I received it in a timely manner daughter is enjoying this with mannequin head we purchased seperately .</li>
            <li> Appears to be strong and sturdy.  Should be able to take a lifetime of abuse.</li>
            <li> This mannequin holder arrived without any instrutions on assembling. I know it is very basic but for a first time user it would have been god to have one. It is not the best fit for my yolanda mannequin as it is a bit loose after it is attached.</li>
            <li> This Celebrity Hip Swivel Manikin Holder inserted perfectly for the Celebrity Lexi Manikin.  To protect the desk, stool, table, we put a thick wash cloth in-between.  It worked perfectly and was happy with this product.  Too bad the Manikin&#x27;s hair was a nightmare.</li>
            <li> Constant adjusting. Cheap! I was under the impression that the holder allows easy maneuver but it was too much and too often.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter and she loves it!</li>
            <li> It is cool when you are making wigs wish it was less cheaply made but it does the job</li>
            <li> Just what I needed to keep my mannequin heads from moving when making wigs or holding a wig. Shipping was fast and item looked exactly as advertised. will buy again :)</li>
            <li> Mannequin didn&#x27;t stay on it</li>
            <li> PROFESSIONAL QUALITY!!!</li>
            <li> Works perfectly.  I am very happy with it.  i am using it put a large monster mask on.  Now the mask scares the visitors in my living room.</li>
            <li> Very strong and sturdy, however, clamp could be wider to fit thicker tables and counters</li>
            <li> Quality. Used as intended.</li>
            <li> Needed these to go with my male head block. Very portable and I can take to hotel with me and set my Santa beard and wig anyplace.</li>
            <li> I have not used this yet.  Waiting for the wig heads to be able to style using this swivel. Seems well made.</li>
            <li> Item cane fast and just as expected works perfectly fine.  Would have given it 5 stars but it has rust spots all over it that I had to clean off.... gross</li>
            <li> Cheap just as expected. Nothing to say. Holds a manikin just as it should.</li>
            <li> This was a last minute order for a mannequin head I bought as a Christmas present for my grand daughter who is thinking about going into cosmetology. When I discovered that the head did not come with a stand I quickly ordered this and thanks to Amazon and my &amp;#34;Prime&amp;#34; membership it arrived in time for Christmas. My guess is that this would be adequate for holding the mannequin, although it&#x27;s kind of a cheaply made product of China. I&#x27;ve not heard any complaints form my grand daughter so would guess it&#x27;s okay. My real complaint is with the mannequin manufacturer who could easily have included this cheap piece with the mannequin. The mannequin is kind of useless if you can&#x27;t stand it up to practice on!</li>
            <li> I got the heads and hair and needed something to put them on while I style them this was just what needed</li>
            <li> Not that good very cheap plastic part my dauther does not like it cause the round ball its keep moving</li>
