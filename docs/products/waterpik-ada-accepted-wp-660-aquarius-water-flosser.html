            <li>I have never been great at dental hygiene in the past-hence the gum disease, so</li>
            <li>I find the &amp;#34;flosser&amp;#34; function to be just great at doing it job.  </li>
            <li>I have found that the &amp;#34;flossing&amp;#34; function does a great &amp;#34;massage&amp;#34; and finish using what remains on my gums.  </li>
            <li>This Waterpik does a great job of removing stubborn food particles.  </li>
            <li>Response was great</li>

            <li>It does a good job.  </li>
            <li>A good product, with one flaw.  </li>
            <li>Good pressure.  </li>
            <li>This is another example of a company trying to squeeze every penny to save on a unit instead of concentrating on make a good customer unit.</li>
            <li>good</li>
            <li>good for the money.  </li>
            <li>Almost as good as the one I had for 20 years,  it too was a waterpik brand.</li>
            <li>I use a sonicare and my dentist always tells my I&#x27;m doing a good job when he sees me.</li>

            <li>Love this updated Waterpik!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>Great product at a great price plus free shipping, doesn&#x27;t get any better than that.</li>

            <li>Works great, easy to use.</li>
            <li>the Waterpik Aquarius Water Flosser makes the world a more pleasant place to breathe, as well.  </li>
            <li>its been one month now and no complaints Easy to use and dos a great job</li>
            <li>Amazing cleaner.</li>
            <li>This thing is amazing.</li>
            <li>the pressure is amazing though.</li>
            <li>A trick my dentist told me is to run warm salt water through, it works wonders for the gums.</li>
            <li>nice design  </li>
            <li>This is a concept that Waterpik has used for a great many years and has become more versatile and improved.</li>
            <li>I still use dental floss at night, brush with an electric toothbrush then use the Waterpik with slightly warm water.</li>
            <li>A littlr noisy but effective</li>
            <li>I have been using WaterPiks for years and have always liked them.  </li>
            <li>Nice quality,good product.</li>
            <li>Flawless, no problems and lots of different attachments which makes it a great deal.</li>
            <li>It does not seem to be that effective to remove my plaque as claimed.</li>
            <li>Nice design with the lid.</li>
            <li>I use an eight and it is a nice forceful power level.  </li>
            <li>I have this sitting on a  six inch shelf over my sink where it fits nicely .  </li>
            <li>The device looks nice sitting on mybathroom sink.</li>
            <li>effective-</li>
            <li>I own a Waterpik for a while now</li>
            <li>She is also loving it.</li>
            <li>Nicely packaged, arrived as promised.  </li>
            <li>I use warm water and Listerine</li>
            <li>and it is effective as my dentist said.</li>
            <li>This water flosser/massager came with a variety of tips to use, and the &#x27;pick pocket&#x27; does the job of flossing nicely.  </li>
            <li>Nice and compact.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, it does a good job at what it was designed to do!</li>
            <li>What a great smile she has!</li>
            <li>This will be a great way to keep braces sparkling and clean.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended and yours was the best price too.</li>
            <li>This new model is perfect for me.</li>
            <li>Meets my expectations, works good, easy to use</li>
            <li>The waterpik is perfect to keep teeth super clean.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and adjustments</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Way easier and more effective than using floss.  </li>
            <li>Putting it on one made it more effective and practical to work with.</li>
            <li>Cleaning teeth has never been so easy!</li>
            <li>The unit is very light.  </li>
            <li>nice quite and easy to move around</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s easy to become adept at working it.</li>
            <li>It appears to be quite effective and is easy to use and one can take the tip off and pretend it&#x27;s a microphone while singing along with the radio and looking in the bathroom mirror.</li>
            <li>The unit is attractive and not too large.</li>
            <li>I used it for 6 months and my dental hygienist noticed a huge improvement in my gum health!</li>
            <li>Pleased with my order.  </li>
            <li>I AM HIGHLY PLEASED.</li>
            <li>I spend many money.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The original is better!  </li>
            <li>Product works well, and my teeth feel so much better.  </li>
            <li>Although if you look up on the internet (and even as per my dentist) flossing is still better but then using waterpik is better than not flossing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love the variety of interchangable flosser heads.</li>
            <li>Surely would recommend this product to anyone and everyone.</li>
            <li>Much better at cleaning food particles from under my gums that caused irritation.  </li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t quite take the enamel off your teeth, but it&#x27;s noticeably stronger (and has more settings).</li>
            <li>a more forceful water flow?</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>what more could one want from floss???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>10x better than flossing.</li>
            <li>one the counter top.</li>
            <li>I love the Waterpik company and their products.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>so I have to use the on/off switch on the unit and just make sure the wand is in my mouth</li>
            <li>Well, as it turns out, there&#x27;s some minimally convincing evidence that water flossing may be better than just brushing and string-flossing alone.  </li>
            <li>Despite our best efforts, this device is starting to accumulate mold.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>After some months I started using it and love it too.  </li>
            <li>Definitely satisfied.</li>
            <li>The inconvenience of having to use a transformer, but it still satisfied.</li>
            <li>Love timer function</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>My gums and teeth are healthy :)</li>
            <li>Absolutely love the water flossed ...highly recommend</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Now I am more than pleased and like it even better than the Ultra.</li>
            <li>I have been using waterpik for many years.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d like it better if it worked.</li>
            <li>I need to be able to use it.!!!&lt;br /&gt;Water OFF/ON button will not move.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the &amp;#34;just came from the dentist&amp;#34; feeling I get from using this pic.</li>
            <li>There are better ones, but for quite a bit more.  </li>
            <li>What can I say, I love this thing.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t even able to use it once</li>
            <li>This one is much more reliable and I noticed no reduction in efficiency.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a cavity since I started using a sonicare more than 10 years ago.</li>
            <li>My gums were in much better shape in just one week.</li>
            <li>My dentist was so pleased with the results</li>
            <li>I wish that was designed better.</li>
            <li>Love this thing.</li>
            <li>It does a better job than a toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Really enjoying the Waterpik.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually enjoyable and my gums don&#x27;t bleed anymore.</li>
            <li>Most of it has been discussed here, like the placement of the on/off on the handle too close to the water pic remover button.  </li>
            <li>I love the adjustability of the flow.</li>
            <li>fast shipping, great product</li>
            <li>Satisfied.  </li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how I ever lived without this, I love it.</li>
            <li>I love it and am using it twice a day.</li>
            <li>Found this one and LOVE it so much more.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, especially like to the options provided.</li>
            <li>And my dental hygentist reported that my gums have never looked better.</li>
            <li>the water flosser I&#x27;ve found more than once</li>
            <li>But most reviews voted against</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it has more power than the hand</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>include so many heads?</li>
            <li>My guess is that it was marginal cost to manufacture and makes people feel better about buying the product because they have more</li>
            <li>so she can enjoy it too!</li>
            <li>be sure to start at lower pressure or you will have burns on your gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this thing, works fantastic!</li>
            <li>So glad I got it.  </li>
            <li>Just brushing and flossing is OK</li>
            <li>My dentist says this is better than flossing.</li>
            <li>I love this water pick appliance.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I bought three more as presents for family members.</li>
            <li>Love this one--a newer model.  </li>
            <li>my teeth are very clean</li>
            <li>It keeps my familys teeth very clean along with brushing.</li>
            <li>Works good but the pump is really noisy!</li>
            <li>Love it, works great and no problems so far</li>
            <li>Easy to use and feels better than using piece of string.</li>
            <li>Easy to use .. Love it.</li>
            <li>The tips switch out easily, and the water reservoir is more than sufficient for 2-3 flossing sessions.  </li>
            <li>While this was cheap, I feel like there must be a more elegant water flosser out there than this.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive gums and tend to bleed when I floss, but this product is great.</li>
            <li>my clean teeth- Waterpik &amp; Oral B get all the credit!</li>
            <li>That said, it does leave a clean feeling in the mouth!</li>
            <li>I also believe good dentistry is heart smart.  </li>
            <li>this is a great upgrade to the 20 yr old</li>
            <li>This is a good thing if you really want to knock debris out of your teeth.  </li>
            <li>My husband&#x27;s breath smells as fresh as a rose.</li>
            <li>Good price and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Very happy with my new Waterpik, went from rechargeable pik to this model, much happier with this one.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this simple operating model without all the super refinements.</li>
            <li>The product is very easy to use, very fast delivery!</li>
            <li>Better than my original Hydro-Floss unit.</li>
            <li>That you can dial up the water pressure is a great feature, just make sure you read the manual since some tips should only be used at the lowest pressure settings.  </li>
            <li>Makes easy work of oral hygiene.  </li>
            <li>Easy to fill up and floss.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>easy work around with power button.</li>
            <li>So easy to use</li>
            <li>This flosser makes flossing so easy.  </li>
            <li>There was a strong chemical taste in the water the 1st 4  or 5  times</li>
            <li>This mouth health gadget is quite effective and pretty easy to use.</li>
            <li>but I am using an inexpensive 220 to 110 V step down and the waterpik is working perfectly with</li>
            <li>the fact that this flosser makes it so quick and easy to achieve the desired results is a huge deal!</li>
            <li>Smooth and easy to use.</li>
            <li>but mine goes in just fine.</li>
            <li>works fine, kinda noisy tho.</li>
            <li>It works fine.</li>
            <li>Cleans just fine</li>
            <li>For me the weight is fine.  </li>
            <li>and you will do fine.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this unit for about a month now, and it seems to work fine.</li>
            <li>It runs fine on that.</li>
            <li>this is a huge improvement over the WP-100.  </li>
            <li>It is more powerful than the Ultra if that matters to anyone (it does to me).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how much stuff gets lodged in your teeth during the day.</li>
            <li>It is so light that you have to hold it with one hand to turn it on.  </li>
            <li>The on/off switch is now loosening up, and I discovered that the led light goes off by itself, it just has a delayed reaction sometimes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve come accustom to and enjoy using the machine.</li>
            <li>The Waterpik does a fantastic job removing food particles between the teeth, and earns 5 stars for its primary function.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know what to compare it to, but it works great and is not as big and bulky as it appears in the picture.  </li>
            <li>The next check up was great</li>
            <li>So, I figured this would be a really great present</li>
            <li>Sounds gross but this thing is great.</li>
            <li>This flosser does a fantastic job of the unenviable task of dislodging food from my grill.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does take a week or two to get comfortable with this product.  </li>
            <li>After using it for a few  months, I had my best checkup ever.</li>
            <li>I use the strong power, but still can&#x27;t clean my gum line.</li>
            <li>He says it is easy to use and makes his mouth feel really clean.</li>
            <li>This is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t remember my old Waterpik failing, so I think the outlook for this one is good in terms of longevity.</li>
            <li>Working good so far.</li>
            <li>Works as good as the old version</li>
            <li>Using for a few days good cleaning and good design.</li>
            <li>It is the original and works fine</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with my new Waterpik Flosser.</li>
            <li>Over the years my experience with  Water Piks has been positive so I expect that I and this Pik will live happily ever after.</li>
            <li>I think there is no other Water Flosser in the market that is more cost effective</li>
            <li>Quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I should&#x27;ve stayed with the original.</li>
            <li>It is not user friendly.  </li>
            <li>I would have rated it higher if it had better storage.</li>
            <li>Easy for first time waterpik users, easy instructions</li>
            <li>Although it works as advertised and leaves your mouth feeling very clean, it takes up a fair amount of limited bathroom vanity space and requires an electrical outlet to operate (in my case, I need an extension cord to reach the nearest outlet).  </li>
            <li>We have used water flossers for an extended time, and have tried different brands of flossers, but this one is the best so far.  </li>
            <li>Hey, keep them clean.</li>
            <li>I liked the basic one better</li>
            <li>Verry nice but yhe sound is loud</li>
            <li>Blasts your mouth clean.</li>
            <li>of keeping your teeth clean.</li>
            <li>Easier to clean.</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t clean the holes that food went into I</li>
            <li>I like the color and design of the unit...simple with clean lines.  </li>
            <li>and mouth has never felt this clean</li>
            <li>teeth are a lifelong investment, this costs a fraction the cost of a cavity, and makes me feel good too. :)</li>
            <li>Use my oldie but goldie twice a day and am happy to say this new model has the same output, but is more compact.</li>
            <li>I could never really get into the habit of flossing and hence waterpik turned out to be a great alternative.</li>
            <li>Works great, as expected.  </li>
            <li>Works great, but be careful.</li>
            <li>Nice selection of tools and clear instructions for use of each.  </li>
            <li>As far as being effective, I do feel the difference in my teeth after using the waterpik.</li>
            <li>i FINALLY had a good dental check up.</li>
            <li>and I left the dentist feeling good for once.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s much quicker and easier than string floss with better results.</li>
            <li>As good as my former waterpik flosser</li>
            <li>On the whole, I&#x27;ve enjoyed using this waterpik.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about the Aquarius.  </li>
            <li>Once I realized that you need to close your mouth at least partway around the tip, it worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>Other than that problem it has been great.</li>
            <li>Its kinda of noisy but for the clean feeling its worth it.</li>
            <li>Makes my teeth feel fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels so clean and fresh after I am done</li>
            <li>, it does not take up so much room, and is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>,so i plug it in our 220v,and the machine dead now,it&#x27;s my own fault,and the waterpik looks nice, and i already buy the WP-100EC  in china now, cause china has no wp-660, and</li>
            <li>Works very well as all Water Piks and is easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li>The pressure is OK but loud since the unit again is so light.  </li>
            <li>More features than my older model.  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery in south America.</li>
            <li>Really works well and easy to keep clean</li>
            <li>received quickly.</li>
            <li>All it does is quickly switch the pump on and off, and since the pump already pulses, there is no need for that.</li>
            <li>If you did want to massage your gums, the main flossing mode would work better.</li>
            <li>and I have to say I like it very much!  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t say I love it, but it&#x27;s much easier to use than the old &#x27;tank&#x27; I had and looks a heckuva lot better too.</li>
            <li>The new one is even better.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love mine and feel I cannot live without it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy maintenance and the noise of the motor is very tolerable.</li>
            <li>The whole family is actually using it and loving it!</li>
            <li>We had an old waterpik and loved it, but it was time for a new one.</li>
            <li>Love the different water settings and easy to change tips.</li>
            <li>I also found that, if you are not careful with your hand when using it, it is very easy to mistakenly release the tip and become unintentionally sprayed with water.</li>
            <li>Its loud and drips a little but its great for a healthy mouth</li>
            <li>This is a great product and don&#x27;t know what I would do without it because it really keeps your gums cleaned and implants clean under the gum line and plaque down under my dental Implants.  </li>
            <li>One nice new feature is the choice between pulsing and steady flow of water.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s always that feeling that you might not be cleaning your teeth well enough, and then you fear that one day you&#x27;ll have to go to the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s actually amazing how this cleans well.</li>
            <li>Very portable and comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li>Just remember to run fresh water through it</li>
            <li>Cleaner teeth, healthier gums, fresh air and happier friends and acquaintances...</li>
            <li>The changes were well thought out and useful.  </li>
            <li>Compact, powerful, works well for my wife.  </li>
            <li>Pleased that it is all white and more compact in design, also really like the attached hinged lid.  </li>
            <li>Downgrading to two stars, you are better off with the old model.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>It was more cumbersome and took up more space than I expected.</li>
            <li>Powerful settings, too.</li>
            <li>so it was worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>and I feel it was well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>I do agree with the many other reviewers who commented that it feels as if it is made with very cheap materials.</li>
            <li>if a Waterpik was used daily, it makes my mouth feel so clean and healthy.</li>
            <li>It was working great and now exactly 90 days later it has stopped working completely.</li>
            <li>Downside of course is water around so needs a sink right there</li>
            <li>My teeth really feel clean after using the product.</li>
            <li>It has various setting and very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>But other than that, it works great at cleaning your teeth, and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Previous machine finally gave out after 14 years and this was one of the best rated and I can see why.</li>
            <li>We actually maintain a wicked clean bathroom, thanks in-part, to our wonderful maid, but this device is used constantly and always near water.  </li>
            <li>Small footprint is great; just a bit noisey.</li>
            <li>So much better than the large, unruly old one I had.</li>
            <li>The design of the &amp;#34;pik&amp;#34; with the &amp;#34;off/on&amp;#34; button is great and the other release button for separating the &amp;#34;pik&amp;#34; form the handle is great also because on just the normal &#x27;Waterpiks&amp;#34; it was more difficult release the &amp;#34;pik&amp;#34; from the handle.  </li>
            <li>It has superior controls, and runs more quietly than other models we&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>and I sent it for repair they sent me new one for free.  </li>
            <li>Will know for sure in a few more months when I visit the dental hygienist who recommended it to me.</li>
            <li>Light to powerful pulses clean deep.</li>
            <li>it is useful~~~~,to be short, Waterpik Aquarius Water Flosser is useful to me :)</li>
            <li>works great and has several different levels to use.</li>
            <li>Delivery was super fast.</li>
            <li>While I can&#x27;t argue that the Waterpik is easy to use and will/has improved my dental hygiene I find it loud and it rattles my sink counter.  </li>
            <li>There is also a wide range of water pressure settings, so you can try them out to find out which is most comfortable for you.  </li>
            <li>Over the months we&#x27;ve had this thing, it&#x27;s clear that it&#x27;s doing a pretty good job grabbing at stuff that we might have otherwise missed, but I&#x27;ve got three big gripes with this device:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very fast and convenient.</li>
            <li>This model comes with several different tips for more thorough action on gums, something i need&lt;br /&gt;In summary; a good appliance for home use</li>
            <li>It came with a host of attachments, that I am yet to use, I have used the standard flosser, and my teeth feel clean and fantastic.</li>
            <li>Use them daily or even weekly and ward off huge dental bills!</li>
            <li>love it and might have kept some of my back teeth lost a while ago</li>
            <li>Better tan the last one.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re planning to keep your significant other asleep when you floss, well, you&#x27;d better be flossing in another building.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>It really works!  </li>
            <li>Fast shipment!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li>SOOOO much better than traditional flossing.</li>
            <li>On/Off switch broke in the first two weeks of usage.</li>
            <li>The only thing I would change would be to have the ability to store more pick heads.</li>
            <li>Works exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>Dental tech was amazed and commented how much healthier my gums where!</li>
            <li>The Waterpik Aquarius performs exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>I recommend you start at a lower setting and work your way up to the higher setting and use war water.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using a water flosser.</li>
            <li>First impressions.</li>
            <li>My first waterpik</li>
            <li>It does exactly what its suppose to do.</li>
            <li>My first try it was at 2</li>
            <li>Powerful water spray cleans very well.</li>
            <li>I would use the flosser to get out any food debris and then take the Waterpik and run it between all my teeth and there was always so many food particles still left in there -</li>
            <li>This is my first Waterpik.  </li>
            <li>This product provides more than enough pressure to do the job.  </li>
            <li>I use it on full power and seems to do at least as good a job as flossing.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It also has a 30 second timer (it pulses) if you are trying to make sure you do the minimum of brushing/flossing.  </li>
            <li>From a personal perspective though, it was love at first sight.  </li>
            <li>Whole family now flosses twice a day!</li>
            <li>In the old case, all the attachments fit into the lid.  </li>
            <li>The new water pic is more compact than the old.</li>
            <li>My son got new braces and this really helps keep the hardware clean.  </li>
            <li>Nice compact design, more solidly built than the one I previously owned.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised - clean and petite design</li>
            <li>I have settled on the standard one for about one full minute, which means filling the water reservoir about 1/4 or 1/3 full.</li>
            <li>Love it so much that I bought a second one for my wife.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Only 4 stars as the Waterpik is bigger than I had anticipated, so that it takes up a good deal of counter space in the bathroom.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, it does a good job but given the choice I would go back to the basic model</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space and works as good as our last one that was twice as big.</li>
            <li>Use a good whitening pre-brush, then brush with a sonic tooth brush, floss to scrape the stuff out and then use this water pick with a little Listerine in the water (to kill gems under the gums and between) and you are set!</li>
            <li>Seems to work ok and achieves the desired outcome, I just hope it lasts long than it&#x27;s predeccessor.</li>
            <li>Item work really well, but pretty noisy</li>
            <li>Good size for small spaces, we don&#x27;t have a lot of room</li>
            <li>I had some areas where my gum tissue wasn&#x27;t tight enough around my teeth, and using this tightened things up beautifully within 3 months between visits.</li>
            <li>Noisy, but really works well to clean under my tight fitting bridges.</li>
            <li>The key is to make sure the pressure isn&#x27;t set too high.</li>
            <li>Such a great alternative to conventional string flossing.  </li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s pretty cheaply made.</li>
            <li>far as the unit itself, the quality is adequate considering the price.  </li>
            <li>Came quickly in a no hassle box which was nice and setup was a breeze.  </li>
            <li>Flosser; I have been using waterpik for the past 8 years; I am 78 years of age and just had my annual dental hygiene procedure with excellent gum health and minimal plaque.</li>
            <li>Easy set up and makes dental care simple.  </li>
            <li>is also good on cats for cleaning their bottoms where those little KlingONs live around their An</li>
            <li>Easy to use settings and convenient large opening for refilling makes for further ease of use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had gums too sensitive for regular flossing, but this makes it fun and easy.  </li>
            <li>It takes a little time to develop a technique that doesn&#x27;t wash the vanity - and me - but it is amazing what residual debris flushes out after everything I described before use.</li>
            <li>so I guess I&#x27;ll learn to hold it upside down &amp; enjoy my clean gums.</li>
            <li>solid product I use it everyday works great</li>
            <li>It really is helping and it works well.</li>
            <li>Much easier than flossing.  </li>
            <li>I spend so much on floss in the pass 30 years.</li>
            <li>and this really helps in flushing the food out.</li>
            <li>it is quiet and runs smooth.</li>
            <li>Better than expected.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I really like the newer design</li>
            <li>I really like the ability to set the water pressure.</li>
            <li>It really messages the gums and gives you the just came from&lt;br /&gt;the dentist feeling.</li>
            <li>but there ya go if it matters (it really doesn&#x27;t to me).</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take up to much space,</li>
            <li>The pressure is very adjustable (altho I always keep it on 10 since I&#x27;ve been using these for years), and it even has a &amp;#34;massage&amp;#34; function which pulses the spray on and off.  </li>
            <li>This does the job very well.  </li>
            <li>Really works well.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>Very eye pleasing design.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue to brush my teeth every morning and night, but I doubt that this water flosser will get used very often.</li>
            <li>highly recommend!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update: shortly after I posted this review it made a pop sound and the power button stopped working.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really feel like I get any benefit from using this.  </li>
            <li>Works well, just very noisy.</li>
            <li>IT SEEMS TO DO EVERYTHING I EXPECTED AND MORE.  </li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>Beware that it does not have as much pressure as the Ultra.  </li>
            <li>She recommended this as an alternative to straight floss torture</li>
            <li>The motor is quiet and the machine is light weight</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think much can be done since it does have to pressurize the water into micro bursts.</li>
            <li>but the off/on switch on the wand is really realy</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>when I&#x27;ve paid this much.</li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>I know how much water I want to use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had one before and really like it.  </li>
            <li>Having used a handheld rechargable Water-Flosser, I much prefer this model.</li>
            <li>not that good,i wasn&#x27;t expect what is really this item,i don&#x27;t recommend</li>
            <li>He really seems to like the unit.  </li>
            <li>Do people really switch through 7 of them?</li>
            <li>so much I bought another for my partner</li>
            <li>I was in the market for a flosser because I have teeth that are very close together.  </li>
            <li>You can also use the various brush tips to polish your teeth, and my teeth felt smooth afterwards, just like after a trip to the dentist.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel much cleaner.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say much about the &amp;#34;massage&amp;#34; function because there is no strength or power to the water that comes out in with no sensation on the gums.  </li>
            <li>I recommend using a few ounces of Listerine and hydrogen peroxide with 10 oz of warm water to kill the bacteria that make up plaque.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful (except the $11 price decrease).</li>
            <li>Far easier and more effective than trying to get floss around the permanent retainer behind my bottom teeth.</li>
            <li>I lock it in, give it a little tug to make sure it&#x27;s locked, but when I start the device the water pops the tip right out.  </li>
            <li>I like the flosser a lot because it is pretty in my new ultra bath</li>
            <li>These minor criticisms are easily ignored when weighed against my improved dental health.</li>
            <li>This model does the same good job as other models in blowing out the debris between your teeth, which is the hallmark of these devices.</li>
            <li>In some cases, the water has actually caused significant pain when it slips and directs the jet into the underside of your tongue or the side of your cheek.  </li>
            <li>Convenient slide on the handle is much improved from the older model (this one you slide</li>
            <li>Much more powerful than my old one, not crazy about the design, hard to get to water container..</li>
            <li>I like the feel and action of this waterpik very much.</li>
            <li>Live and learn!</li>
            <li>Seriously, my new addiction!  </li>
            <li>Really loud and on and off switch is so hard to use on the wand but does good job with flossing.</li>
            <li>and I like it better then the previous models.  </li>
            <li>I had this one a couple months, my previous one worked much better.</li>
            <li>My gums are better and it seems that plaque builds up less.</li>
            <li>This model has a lot of bells and whistles, most of which I could not care any less.</li>
            <li>and I like the two shut offs  one on the handle and one on the main mechanism,  </li>
            <li>So far I see no real reason that one is substantially better than the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is also a clever storage to put 2 heads.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s no less noisy in the higher pressure modes.</li>
            <li>Fantastic flosser, i had the larger bulkier version made by waterpik, it was old and needed replacing.</li>
            <li>When I first started using this, I did not know exactly how I was supposed to use it, and I simply opened my mouth, aimed the tip at my teeth, and turned it on.</li>
            <li>But just because I don&#x27;t particularly care for the &amp;#34;massage&amp;#34; function does&#x27;t</li>
            <li>A couple of things that could be improved as I had an older model that broke.  </li>
            <li>That said it only draws 13W according to the label, so you should be ok to run it off most &#x27;shaver only&#x27; sockets found in a lot of bathrooms (I claim no responsibility for anything going wrong of course &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>works better than floss for tight spaces between teeth.</li>
            <li>the pressure is not supper high.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these machines.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The last Wateerpik Flosser I had was ten years old, and I knew there had to be something out there that was more modern and efficient.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>which was too high causing my gums to bleed.</li>
            <li>This one cost about $15 more than the previous model, and I don&#x27;t think the extra $$ are worth it.</li>
            <li>Wow!!</li>
            <li>WE ALL THREE USE THIS ITEM IN ADDITION TO REGULAR DENTAL PROTOCOL AND BEING AVID FLOSSER&#x27;S!</li>
            <li>It does the job, and is MUCH quieter than my old original one which sounds like its trying to achieve lift-off, but I wonder how long it&#x27;s going to hold up.</li>
            <li>Works very well so far.</li>
            <li>It was expensive, but works great and is portable.</li>
            <li>The Waterpik Aquarius Professional Water Flosser works very well.</li>
            <li>We use this everyday and are pleased with the results and quality.</li>
            <li>It feels so good, however, that I often go past the 30 second mark.</li>
            <li>Pretty noisy, but apparently they all are.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally post reviews here, but this water flosser thing deserves some review.</li>
            <li>Great only the turn off is very hard to turn off and on.</li>
            <li>KINDA NEW TO THE WATER PIC WORLD..</li>
            <li>This new unit is nicer and simpler all around.</li>
            <li>Called Waterpic and they sent out a new one immediately.</li>
            <li>Plugged into 230v electrical outlet in New Zealand and damaged the unit.</li>
            <li>I had a Shazaam water flosser before that I would have to clean and empty after each use</li>
            <li>Better than I expected, provides a flosser in addition to the standard massage function.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very loud and vibrates a lot.  </li>
            <li>I use it at least twice a day at the lowest pressure setting, and it really helps keep my teeth very clean.</li>
            <li>Overall construction seems very flimsy for a product at this price point!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m able to add to the water a small amount of mouth wash as an antiseptic.</li>
            <li>Works well.&lt;br /&gt;Better design model to previous version.&lt;br /&gt;Seems to be working fine after 3 months.</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews I bought this knowing the build wouldn&#x27;t be quite as sturdy, but liking the more streamlined size and look for my small bathroom.</li>
            <li>in.&lt;br /&gt;The first couple of times I used it, then placed it back on the shelf, water ran out of the handle onto the shelf.</li>
            <li>I recommend that before using for the first time , you fill up the reservoir and run it through the system numerous times.  </li>
            <li>wow what a difference!  </li>
            <li>Would also be better if electric was swivel ( or on opposite side) due to plug in on my bathroom counter.</li>
            <li>The machine is pretty quiet comparedcto others, I have used.  </li>
            <li>My last teeth cleaning at the dentist was better than average as my gums did not bleed.  </li>
            <li>Works well, but seems a little cheap.</li>
            <li>The old had a compartment incorporated into the lid to hold extra attachments which  was very  convenient.</li>
            <li>I really like the fact that the reservoir is not only clear but also removable.  </li>
            <li>The device itself is somewhat loud.</li>
            <li>I do not think it is too loud.  </li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t missed a day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s loud.  </li>
            <li>Like really loud.  </li>
            <li>My goal was to use this water flosser once a day, but my usage has fallen off considerably since I began using it a couple months ago.  </li>
            <li>Bought this to replace my old Ultra.</li>
            <li>But I do see food particles flushed out from the action after brushing teeth and using this.</li>
            <li>THE OLD ONE&#x27;S</li>
            <li>I also think I preferred the old power switch (rocker type) over this push button.</li>
            <li>It lasted 6 months before it developed a fault.</li>
            <li>I purchased this to replace my old Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser.  </li>
            <li>Too loud.</li>
            <li>The device is a bit loud</li>
            <li>90 days old and cannot return.</li>
            <li>Before you know it it will start to feel natural.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lot quieter than the old one we used to have.</li>
            <li>it really cleans deep</li>
            <li>I still use floss at least once a week to make sure everything is getting properly flossed, but I&#x27;ve found this Waterpik to do a very thorough job.  ,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just thought it was.too loud a vibration.  </li>
            <li>It works really well, and I&#x27;ve been using it occasionally.</li>
            <li>Well, there are both good and lousy things about it.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;anyone interested in keeping their teeth and gums healthy and avoiding expensive dentist bills.</li>
            <li>I use it every day and it is rather gross to see what my high dollar vibrating tooth brush does not remove.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t attempted to use anything beyond the flosser attachment, so I&#x27;m not sure how effective the other products are.</li>
            <li>My new year&#x27;s intentions included using it regularly</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s scary how much comes out from between your teeth after brushing; way more than with floss.</li>
            <li>Only a few attachments fit in the well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smaller than the older model, but the water chamber seems the same size, so I cant complain.</li>
            <li>This water flosser fixes that problem entirely, and after a few uses, my teeth were as clean or cleaner than the last time I went to get my teeth professionally cleaned.</li>
            <li>When I first turned it on, it squirted so hard and fast that it escaped my hand and squirted all over me an my sink mirror.</li>
            <li>For me this product ( I add a little mouthwash and hydrogen peroxide to the water), with flossing and brushing keeps my gums healthy and my dentist bills way down.</li>
            <li>but I think I will probably give it five stars in the near future.  </li>
            <li>So, apparently for some of us</li>
            <li>In the end, it seems to operate as well as my old one, which only lasted a year.</li>
            <li>nearly too short to be usable.  </li>
            <li>My dentist says that since I have been using a &amp;#34;Waterpik&amp;#34; as part of my oral daily cleansing that I have completely eliminating the gum disease that I had when I firstcame to see her after retiring to Mesa, AZ 14 years ago.  </li>
            <li>it has a 120V DC motor, which is driven almost directly off the full-bridge rectifier, so it is definitely not compatible with 240V power sources (for those wondering).</li>
            <li>Can be a bit messy but worth it.</li>
            <li>The other switch that releases the little spray tip is in a position where it is easy to accidently switch and release the tip while using it..</li>
            <li>works very well but a little loud</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because of the lack of a travel case, the reservoir needs to be bigger or a new design is required (a universal hose to plug in directly to generic water faucets would be nice).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also experienced fewer instances of bad breath since starting with the Waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>construction was not good for smooth operation.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used the general use tip.  </li>
            <li>Many others have complained about the hidden water markings on the side of the plastic bowl.  </li>
            <li>I have used the previous model from Waterpik for several years and it lasted very well.</li>
            <li>I add a little hydrogen peroxide to the water chamber of my Water Pik and this has a large chamber that is roomy enough to accommodate water and peroxide.  </li>

            <li> I have never been great at dental hygiene in the past-hence the gum disease, so</li>
            <li> I find the &amp;#34;flosser&amp;#34; function to be just great at doing it job.  </li>
            <li> I have found that the &amp;#34;flossing&amp;#34; function does a great &amp;#34;massage&amp;#34; and finish using what remains on my gums.  </li>
            <li> This Waterpik does a great job of removing stubborn food particles.  </li>
            <li> Response was great</li>
            <li> It works great, like it.</li>

            <li> Pump seems to hesitate making me wonder how good the pump is.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a good after Waterpik removes matters on my tooth.</li>
            <li> I think this thing might be good for someone who has braces.</li>
            <li> Particularly good if you like popcorn.</li>
            <li> My beloved Ultra started leaking after 2 years</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t think of what to compare it to in order to give you a fair idea of the level of noise.  </li>
            <li> It does a good job.  </li>

            <li> LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Phenomenal!</li>
            <li> Love this updated Waterpik!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> Great product at a great price plus free shipping, doesn&#x27;t get any better than that.</li>
            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> It removes all food debris between our teeth which keeps gums healthy!</li>
            <li> Works great, easy to use.</li>
            <li> the Waterpik Aquarius Water Flosser makes the world a more pleasant place to breathe, as well.  </li>
            <li> its been one month now and no complaints Easy to use and dos a great job</li>
            <li> Amazing cleaner.</li>
            <li> This thing is amazing.</li>
            <li> the pressure is amazing though.</li>
            <li> A trick my dentist told me is to run warm salt water through, it works wonders for the gums.</li>
            <li> nice design  </li>
            <li> This is a concept that Waterpik has used for a great many years and has become more versatile and improved.</li>
            <li> I still use dental floss at night, brush with an electric toothbrush then use the Waterpik with slightly warm water.</li>
            <li> A littlr noisy but effective</li>
            <li> I have been using WaterPiks for years and have always liked them.  </li>
            <li> Nice quality,good product.</li>
            <li> Flawless, no problems and lots of different attachments which makes it a great deal.</li>
            <li> It does not seem to be that effective to remove my plaque as claimed.</li>
            <li> Nice design with the lid.</li>
            <li> I use an eight and it is a nice forceful power level.  </li>
            <li> I have this sitting on a  six inch shelf over my sink where it fits nicely .  </li>
            <li> The device looks nice sitting on mybathroom sink.</li>
            <li> effective-</li>
            <li> I own a Waterpik for a while now</li>
            <li> She is also loving it.</li>
            <li> Nicely packaged, arrived as promised.  </li>
            <li> I use warm water and Listerine</li>
            <li> and it is effective as my dentist said.</li>
            <li> This water flosser/massager came with a variety of tips to use, and the &#x27;pick pocket&#x27; does the job of flossing nicely.  </li>
            <li> Nice and compact.</li>
            <li> Most importantly, it does a good job at what it was designed to do!</li>
            <li> What a great smile she has!</li>
            <li> This will be a great way to keep braces sparkling and clean.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended and yours was the best price too.</li>
            <li> This new model is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> Meets my expectations, works good, easy to use</li>
            <li> The waterpik is perfect to keep teeth super clean.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and adjustments</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Way easier and more effective than using floss.  </li>
            <li> Putting it on one made it more effective and practical to work with.</li>
            <li> Cleaning teeth has never been so easy!</li>
            <li> The unit is very light.  </li>
            <li> nice quite and easy to move around</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s easy to become adept at working it.</li>
            <li> It appears to be quite effective and is easy to use and one can take the tip off and pretend it&#x27;s a microphone while singing along with the radio and looking in the bathroom mirror.</li>
            <li> The unit is attractive and not too large.</li>
            <li> I used it for 6 months and my dental hygienist noticed a huge improvement in my gum health!</li>
            <li> Pleased with my order.  </li>
            <li> I AM HIGHLY PLEASED.</li>
            <li> I spend many money.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The original is better!  </li>
            <li> Product works well, and my teeth feel so much better.  </li>
            <li> Although if you look up on the internet (and even as per my dentist) flossing is still better but then using waterpik is better than not flossing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Love the variety of interchangable flosser heads.</li>
            <li> Surely would recommend this product to anyone and everyone.</li>
            <li> Much better at cleaning food particles from under my gums that caused irritation.  </li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t quite take the enamel off your teeth, but it&#x27;s noticeably stronger (and has more settings).</li>
            <li> a more forceful water flow?</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> what more could one want from floss???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> 10x better than flossing.</li>
            <li> one the counter top.</li>
            <li> I love the Waterpik company and their products.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> so I have to use the on/off switch on the unit and just make sure the wand is in my mouth</li>
            <li> Well, as it turns out, there&#x27;s some minimally convincing evidence that water flossing may be better than just brushing and string-flossing alone.  </li>
            <li> Despite our best efforts, this device is starting to accumulate mold.  </li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> After some months I started using it and love it too.  </li>
            <li> Definitely satisfied.</li>
            <li> The inconvenience of having to use a transformer, but it still satisfied.</li>
            <li> Love timer function</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> My gums and teeth are healthy :)</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the water flossed ...highly recommend</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Now I am more than pleased and like it even better than the Ultra.</li>
            <li> I have been using waterpik for many years.  </li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d like it better if it worked.</li>
            <li> I need to be able to use it.!!!&lt;br /&gt;Water OFF/ON button will not move.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the &amp;#34;just came from the dentist&amp;#34; feeling I get from using this pic.</li>
            <li> There are better ones, but for quite a bit more.  </li>
            <li> What can I say, I love this thing.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t even able to use it once</li>
            <li> This one is much more reliable and I noticed no reduction in efficiency.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a cavity since I started using a sonicare more than 10 years ago.</li>
            <li> My gums were in much better shape in just one week.</li>
            <li> My dentist was so pleased with the results</li>
            <li> I wish that was designed better.</li>
            <li> Love this thing.</li>
            <li> It does a better job than a toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Really enjoying the Waterpik.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually enjoyable and my gums don&#x27;t bleed anymore.</li>
            <li> Most of it has been discussed here, like the placement of the on/off on the handle too close to the water pic remover button.  </li>
            <li> I love the adjustability of the flow.</li>
            <li> fast shipping, great product</li>
            <li> Satisfied.  </li>
            <li> i love it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I ever lived without this, I love it.</li>
            <li> I love it and am using it twice a day.</li>
            <li> Found this one and LOVE it so much more.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, especially like to the options provided.</li>
            <li> And my dental hygentist reported that my gums have never looked better.</li>
            <li> the water flosser I&#x27;ve found more than once</li>
            <li> But most reviews voted against</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it has more power than the hand</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> include so many heads?</li>
            <li> My guess is that it was marginal cost to manufacture and makes people feel better about buying the product because they have more</li>
            <li> so she can enjoy it too!</li>
            <li> be sure to start at lower pressure or you will have burns on your gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this thing, works fantastic!</li>
            <li> So glad I got it.  </li>
            <li> Just brushing and flossing is OK</li>
            <li> My dentist says this is better than flossing.</li>
            <li> I love this water pick appliance.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I bought three more as presents for family members.</li>
            <li> Love this one--a newer model.  </li>
            <li> my teeth are very clean</li>
            <li> It keeps my familys teeth very clean along with brushing.</li>
            <li> Works good but the pump is really noisy!</li>
            <li> Love it, works great and no problems so far</li>
            <li> Easy to use and feels better than using piece of string.</li>
            <li> Easy to use .. Love it.</li>
            <li> The tips switch out easily, and the water reservoir is more than sufficient for 2-3 flossing sessions.  </li>
            <li> While this was cheap, I feel like there must be a more elegant water flosser out there than this.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive gums and tend to bleed when I floss, but this product is great.</li>
            <li> my clean teeth- Waterpik &amp; Oral B get all the credit!</li>
            <li> That said, it does leave a clean feeling in the mouth!</li>
            <li> I also believe good dentistry is heart smart.  </li>
            <li> this is a great upgrade to the 20 yr old</li>
            <li> This is a good thing if you really want to knock debris out of your teeth.  </li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s breath smells as fresh as a rose.</li>
            <li> Good price and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Very happy with my new Waterpik, went from rechargeable pik to this model, much happier with this one.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this simple operating model without all the super refinements.</li>
            <li> The product is very easy to use, very fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Better than my original Hydro-Floss unit.</li>
            <li> That you can dial up the water pressure is a great feature, just make sure you read the manual since some tips should only be used at the lowest pressure settings.  </li>
            <li> Makes easy work of oral hygiene.  </li>
            <li> Easy to fill up and floss.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> easy work around with power button.</li>
            <li> So easy to use</li>
            <li> This flosser makes flossing so easy.  </li>
            <li> There was a strong chemical taste in the water the 1st 4  or 5  times</li>
            <li> This mouth health gadget is quite effective and pretty easy to use.</li>
            <li> but I am using an inexpensive 220 to 110 V step down and the waterpik is working perfectly with</li>
            <li> the fact that this flosser makes it so quick and easy to achieve the desired results is a huge deal!</li>
            <li> Smooth and easy to use.</li>
            <li> but mine goes in just fine.</li>
            <li> works fine, kinda noisy tho.</li>
            <li> It works fine.</li>
            <li> Cleans just fine</li>
            <li> For me the weight is fine.  </li>
            <li> and you will do fine.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this unit for about a month now, and it seems to work fine.</li>
            <li> It runs fine on that.</li>
            <li> this is a huge improvement over the WP-100.  </li>
            <li> It is more powerful than the Ultra if that matters to anyone (it does to me).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how much stuff gets lodged in your teeth during the day.</li>
            <li> It is so light that you have to hold it with one hand to turn it on.  </li>
            <li> The on/off switch is now loosening up, and I discovered that the led light goes off by itself, it just has a delayed reaction sometimes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve come accustom to and enjoy using the machine.</li>
            <li> The Waterpik does a fantastic job removing food particles between the teeth, and earns 5 stars for its primary function.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know what to compare it to, but it works great and is not as big and bulky as it appears in the picture.  </li>
            <li> The next check up was great</li>
            <li> So, I figured this would be a really great present</li>
            <li> Sounds gross but this thing is great.</li>
            <li> This flosser does a fantastic job of the unenviable task of dislodging food from my grill.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does take a week or two to get comfortable with this product.  </li>
            <li> After using it for a few  months, I had my best checkup ever.</li>
            <li> I use the strong power, but still can&#x27;t clean my gum line.</li>
            <li> He says it is easy to use and makes his mouth feel really clean.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember my old Waterpik failing, so I think the outlook for this one is good in terms of longevity.</li>
            <li> Working good so far.</li>
            <li> Works as good as the old version</li>
            <li> Using for a few days good cleaning and good design.</li>
            <li> It is the original and works fine</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with my new Waterpik Flosser.</li>
            <li> Over the years my experience with  Water Piks has been positive so I expect that I and this Pik will live happily ever after.</li>
            <li> I think there is no other Water Flosser in the market that is more cost effective</li>
            <li> Quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I should&#x27;ve stayed with the original.</li>
            <li> It is not user friendly.  </li>
            <li> I would have rated it higher if it had better storage.</li>
            <li> Easy for first time waterpik users, easy instructions</li>
            <li> Although it works as advertised and leaves your mouth feeling very clean, it takes up a fair amount of limited bathroom vanity space and requires an electrical outlet to operate (in my case, I need an extension cord to reach the nearest outlet).  </li>
            <li> We have used water flossers for an extended time, and have tried different brands of flossers, but this one is the best so far.  </li>
            <li> Hey, keep them clean.</li>
            <li> I liked the basic one better</li>
            <li> Verry nice but yhe sound is loud</li>
            <li> Blasts your mouth clean.</li>
            <li> of keeping your teeth clean.</li>
            <li> Easier to clean.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t clean the holes that food went into I</li>
            <li> I like the color and design of the unit...simple with clean lines.  </li>
            <li> and mouth has never felt this clean</li>
            <li> teeth are a lifelong investment, this costs a fraction the cost of a cavity, and makes me feel good too. :)</li>
            <li> Use my oldie but goldie twice a day and am happy to say this new model has the same output, but is more compact.</li>
            <li> I could never really get into the habit of flossing and hence waterpik turned out to be a great alternative.</li>
            <li> Works great, as expected.  </li>
            <li> Works great, but be careful.</li>
            <li> Nice selection of tools and clear instructions for use of each.  </li>
            <li> As far as being effective, I do feel the difference in my teeth after using the waterpik.</li>
            <li> i FINALLY had a good dental check up.</li>
            <li> and I left the dentist feeling good for once.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s much quicker and easier than string floss with better results.</li>
            <li> As good as my former waterpik flosser</li>
            <li> On the whole, I&#x27;ve enjoyed using this waterpik.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about the Aquarius.  </li>
            <li> Once I realized that you need to close your mouth at least partway around the tip, it worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> Other than that problem it has been great.</li>
            <li> Its kinda of noisy but for the clean feeling its worth it.</li>
            <li> Makes my teeth feel fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels so clean and fresh after I am done</li>
            <li> , it does not take up so much room, and is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> ,so i plug it in our 220v,and the machine dead now,it&#x27;s my own fault,and the waterpik looks nice, and i already buy the WP-100EC  in china now, cause china has no wp-660, and</li>
            <li> Works very well as all Water Piks and is easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li> The pressure is OK but loud since the unit again is so light.  </li>
            <li> More features than my older model.  </li>
            <li> Quick delivery in south America.</li>
            <li> Really works well and easy to keep clean</li>
            <li> received quickly.</li>
            <li> All it does is quickly switch the pump on and off, and since the pump already pulses, there is no need for that.</li>
            <li> If you did want to massage your gums, the main flossing mode would work better.</li>
            <li> and I have to say I like it very much!  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t say I love it, but it&#x27;s much easier to use than the old &#x27;tank&#x27; I had and looks a heckuva lot better too.</li>
            <li> The new one is even better.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love mine and feel I cannot live without it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy maintenance and the noise of the motor is very tolerable.</li>
            <li> The whole family is actually using it and loving it!</li>
            <li> We had an old waterpik and loved it, but it was time for a new one.</li>
            <li> Love the different water settings and easy to change tips.</li>
            <li> I also found that, if you are not careful with your hand when using it, it is very easy to mistakenly release the tip and become unintentionally sprayed with water.</li>
            <li> Its loud and drips a little but its great for a healthy mouth</li>
            <li> This is a great product and don&#x27;t know what I would do without it because it really keeps your gums cleaned and implants clean under the gum line and plaque down under my dental Implants.  </li>
            <li> One nice new feature is the choice between pulsing and steady flow of water.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s always that feeling that you might not be cleaning your teeth well enough, and then you fear that one day you&#x27;ll have to go to the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s actually amazing how this cleans well.</li>
            <li> Very portable and comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li> Just remember to run fresh water through it</li>
            <li> Cleaner teeth, healthier gums, fresh air and happier friends and acquaintances...</li>
            <li> The changes were well thought out and useful.  </li>
            <li> Compact, powerful, works well for my wife.  </li>
            <li> Pleased that it is all white and more compact in design, also really like the attached hinged lid.  </li>
            <li> Downgrading to two stars, you are better off with the old model.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> It was more cumbersome and took up more space than I expected.</li>
            <li> Powerful settings, too.</li>
            <li> so it was worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> and I feel it was well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> I do agree with the many other reviewers who commented that it feels as if it is made with very cheap materials.</li>
            <li> if a Waterpik was used daily, it makes my mouth feel so clean and healthy.</li>
            <li> It was working great and now exactly 90 days later it has stopped working completely.</li>
            <li> Downside of course is water around so needs a sink right there</li>
            <li> My teeth really feel clean after using the product.</li>
            <li> It has various setting and very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> But other than that, it works great at cleaning your teeth, and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Previous machine finally gave out after 14 years and this was one of the best rated and I can see why.</li>
            <li> We actually maintain a wicked clean bathroom, thanks in-part, to our wonderful maid, but this device is used constantly and always near water.  </li>
            <li> Small footprint is great; just a bit noisey.</li>
            <li> So much better than the large, unruly old one I had.</li>
            <li> The design of the &amp;#34;pik&amp;#34; with the &amp;#34;off/on&amp;#34; button is great and the other release button for separating the &amp;#34;pik&amp;#34; form the handle is great also because on just the normal &#x27;Waterpiks&amp;#34; it was more difficult release the &amp;#34;pik&amp;#34; from the handle.  </li>
            <li> It has superior controls, and runs more quietly than other models we&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> and I sent it for repair they sent me new one for free.  </li>
            <li> Will know for sure in a few more months when I visit the dental hygienist who recommended it to me.</li>
            <li> Light to powerful pulses clean deep.</li>
            <li> it is useful~~~~,to be short, Waterpik Aquarius Water Flosser is useful to me :)</li>
            <li> works great and has several different levels to use.</li>
            <li> Delivery was super fast.</li>
            <li> While I can&#x27;t argue that the Waterpik is easy to use and will/has improved my dental hygiene I find it loud and it rattles my sink counter.  </li>
            <li> There is also a wide range of water pressure settings, so you can try them out to find out which is most comfortable for you.  </li>
            <li> Over the months we&#x27;ve had this thing, it&#x27;s clear that it&#x27;s doing a pretty good job grabbing at stuff that we might have otherwise missed, but I&#x27;ve got three big gripes with this device:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very fast and convenient.</li>
            <li> This model comes with several different tips for more thorough action on gums, something i need&lt;br /&gt;In summary; a good appliance for home use</li>
            <li> It came with a host of attachments, that I am yet to use, I have used the standard flosser, and my teeth feel clean and fantastic.</li>
            <li> Use them daily or even weekly and ward off huge dental bills!</li>
            <li> love it and might have kept some of my back teeth lost a while ago</li>
            <li> Better tan the last one.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re planning to keep your significant other asleep when you floss, well, you&#x27;d better be flossing in another building.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> It really works!  </li>
            <li> Fast shipment!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> SOOOO much better than traditional flossing.</li>
            <li> On/Off switch broke in the first two weeks of usage.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would change would be to have the ability to store more pick heads.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Dental tech was amazed and commented how much healthier my gums where!</li>
            <li> The Waterpik Aquarius performs exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> I recommend you start at a lower setting and work your way up to the higher setting and use war water.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using a water flosser.</li>
            <li> First impressions.</li>
            <li> My first waterpik</li>
            <li> It does exactly what its suppose to do.</li>
            <li> My first try it was at 2</li>
            <li> Powerful water spray cleans very well.</li>
            <li> I would use the flosser to get out any food debris and then take the Waterpik and run it between all my teeth and there was always so many food particles still left in there -</li>
            <li> This is my first Waterpik.  </li>
            <li> This product provides more than enough pressure to do the job.  </li>
            <li> I use it on full power and seems to do at least as good a job as flossing.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> It also has a 30 second timer (it pulses) if you are trying to make sure you do the minimum of brushing/flossing.  </li>
            <li> From a personal perspective though, it was love at first sight.  </li>
            <li> Whole family now flosses twice a day!</li>
            <li> In the old case, all the attachments fit into the lid.  </li>
            <li> The new water pic is more compact than the old.</li>
            <li> My son got new braces and this really helps keep the hardware clean.  </li>
            <li> Nice compact design, more solidly built than the one I previously owned.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised - clean and petite design</li>
            <li> I have settled on the standard one for about one full minute, which means filling the water reservoir about 1/4 or 1/3 full.</li>
            <li> Love it so much that I bought a second one for my wife.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only 4 stars as the Waterpik is bigger than I had anticipated, so that it takes up a good deal of counter space in the bathroom.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, it does a good job but given the choice I would go back to the basic model</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space and works as good as our last one that was twice as big.</li>
            <li> Use a good whitening pre-brush, then brush with a sonic tooth brush, floss to scrape the stuff out and then use this water pick with a little Listerine in the water (to kill gems under the gums and between) and you are set!</li>
            <li> Seems to work ok and achieves the desired outcome, I just hope it lasts long than it&#x27;s predeccessor.</li>
            <li> Item work really well, but pretty noisy</li>
            <li> Good size for small spaces, we don&#x27;t have a lot of room</li>
            <li> I had some areas where my gum tissue wasn&#x27;t tight enough around my teeth, and using this tightened things up beautifully within 3 months between visits.</li>
            <li> Noisy, but really works well to clean under my tight fitting bridges.</li>
            <li> The key is to make sure the pressure isn&#x27;t set too high.</li>
            <li> Such a great alternative to conventional string flossing.  </li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s pretty cheaply made.</li>
            <li> far as the unit itself, the quality is adequate considering the price.  </li>
            <li> Came quickly in a no hassle box which was nice and setup was a breeze.  </li>
            <li> Flosser; I have been using waterpik for the past 8 years; I am 78 years of age and just had my annual dental hygiene procedure with excellent gum health and minimal plaque.</li>
            <li> Easy set up and makes dental care simple.  </li>
            <li> is also good on cats for cleaning their bottoms where those little KlingONs live around their An</li>
            <li> Easy to use settings and convenient large opening for refilling makes for further ease of use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had gums too sensitive for regular flossing, but this makes it fun and easy.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little time to develop a technique that doesn&#x27;t wash the vanity - and me - but it is amazing what residual debris flushes out after everything I described before use.</li>
            <li> so I guess I&#x27;ll learn to hold it upside down &amp; enjoy my clean gums.</li>
            <li> solid product I use it everyday works great</li>
            <li> It really is helping and it works well.</li>
            <li> Much easier than flossing.  </li>
            <li> I spend so much on floss in the pass 30 years.</li>
            <li> and this really helps in flushing the food out.</li>
            <li> it is quiet and runs smooth.</li>
            <li> Better than expected.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I really like the newer design</li>
            <li> I really like the ability to set the water pressure.</li>
            <li> It really messages the gums and gives you the just came from&lt;br /&gt;the dentist feeling.</li>
            <li> but there ya go if it matters (it really doesn&#x27;t to me).</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take up to much space,</li>
            <li> The pressure is very adjustable (altho I always keep it on 10 since I&#x27;ve been using these for years), and it even has a &amp;#34;massage&amp;#34; function which pulses the spray on and off.  </li>
            <li> This does the job very well.  </li>
            <li> Really works well.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> Very eye pleasing design.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to brush my teeth every morning and night, but I doubt that this water flosser will get used very often.</li>
            <li> highly recommend!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: shortly after I posted this review it made a pop sound and the power button stopped working.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really feel like I get any benefit from using this.  </li>
            <li> Works well, just very noisy.</li>
            <li> IT SEEMS TO DO EVERYTHING I EXPECTED AND MORE.  </li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> Beware that it does not have as much pressure as the Ultra.  </li>
            <li> She recommended this as an alternative to straight floss torture</li>
            <li> The motor is quiet and the machine is light weight</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think much can be done since it does have to pressurize the water into micro bursts.</li>
            <li> but the off/on switch on the wand is really realy</li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> when I&#x27;ve paid this much.</li>
            <li> Really?</li>
            <li> I know how much water I want to use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one before and really like it.  </li>
            <li> Having used a handheld rechargable Water-Flosser, I much prefer this model.</li>
            <li> not that good,i wasn&#x27;t expect what is really this item,i don&#x27;t recommend</li>
            <li> He really seems to like the unit.  </li>
            <li> Do people really switch through 7 of them?</li>
            <li> so much I bought another for my partner</li>
            <li> I was in the market for a flosser because I have teeth that are very close together.  </li>
            <li> You can also use the various brush tips to polish your teeth, and my teeth felt smooth afterwards, just like after a trip to the dentist.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel much cleaner.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say much about the &amp;#34;massage&amp;#34; function because there is no strength or power to the water that comes out in with no sensation on the gums.  </li>
            <li> I recommend using a few ounces of Listerine and hydrogen peroxide with 10 oz of warm water to kill the bacteria that make up plaque.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful (except the $11 price decrease).</li>
            <li> Far easier and more effective than trying to get floss around the permanent retainer behind my bottom teeth.</li>
            <li> I lock it in, give it a little tug to make sure it&#x27;s locked, but when I start the device the water pops the tip right out.  </li>
            <li> I like the flosser a lot because it is pretty in my new ultra bath</li>
            <li> These minor criticisms are easily ignored when weighed against my improved dental health.</li>
            <li> This model does the same good job as other models in blowing out the debris between your teeth, which is the hallmark of these devices.</li>
            <li> In some cases, the water has actually caused significant pain when it slips and directs the jet into the underside of your tongue or the side of your cheek.  </li>
            <li> Convenient slide on the handle is much improved from the older model (this one you slide</li>
            <li> Much more powerful than my old one, not crazy about the design, hard to get to water container..</li>
            <li> I like the feel and action of this waterpik very much.</li>
            <li> Live and learn!</li>
            <li> Seriously, my new addiction!  </li>
            <li> Really loud and on and off switch is so hard to use on the wand but does good job with flossing.</li>
            <li> and I like it better then the previous models.  </li>
            <li> I had this one a couple months, my previous one worked much better.</li>
            <li> My gums are better and it seems that plaque builds up less.</li>
            <li> This model has a lot of bells and whistles, most of which I could not care any less.</li>
            <li> and I like the two shut offs  one on the handle and one on the main mechanism,  </li>
            <li> So far I see no real reason that one is substantially better than the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is also a clever storage to put 2 heads.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no less noisy in the higher pressure modes.</li>
            <li> Fantastic flosser, i had the larger bulkier version made by waterpik, it was old and needed replacing.</li>
            <li> When I first started using this, I did not know exactly how I was supposed to use it, and I simply opened my mouth, aimed the tip at my teeth, and turned it on.</li>
            <li> But just because I don&#x27;t particularly care for the &amp;#34;massage&amp;#34; function does&#x27;t</li>
            <li> A couple of things that could be improved as I had an older model that broke.  </li>
            <li> That said it only draws 13W according to the label, so you should be ok to run it off most &#x27;shaver only&#x27; sockets found in a lot of bathrooms (I claim no responsibility for anything going wrong of course &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> works better than floss for tight spaces between teeth.</li>
            <li> the pressure is not supper high.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these machines.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The last Wateerpik Flosser I had was ten years old, and I knew there had to be something out there that was more modern and efficient.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> which was too high causing my gums to bleed.</li>
            <li> This one cost about $15 more than the previous model, and I don&#x27;t think the extra $$ are worth it.</li>
            <li> Wow!!</li>
            <li> WE ALL THREE USE THIS ITEM IN ADDITION TO REGULAR DENTAL PROTOCOL AND BEING AVID FLOSSER&#x27;S!</li>
            <li> It does the job, and is MUCH quieter than my old original one which sounds like its trying to achieve lift-off, but I wonder how long it&#x27;s going to hold up.</li>
            <li> Works very well so far.</li>
            <li> It was expensive, but works great and is portable.</li>
            <li> The Waterpik Aquarius Professional Water Flosser works very well.</li>
            <li> We use this everyday and are pleased with the results and quality.</li>
            <li> It feels so good, however, that I often go past the 30 second mark.</li>
            <li> Pretty noisy, but apparently they all are.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally post reviews here, but this water flosser thing deserves some review.</li>
            <li> Great only the turn off is very hard to turn off and on.</li>
            <li> KINDA NEW TO THE WATER PIC WORLD..</li>
            <li> This new unit is nicer and simpler all around.</li>
            <li> Called Waterpic and they sent out a new one immediately.</li>
            <li> Plugged into 230v electrical outlet in New Zealand and damaged the unit.</li>
            <li> I had a Shazaam water flosser before that I would have to clean and empty after each use</li>
            <li> Better than I expected, provides a flosser in addition to the standard massage function.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very loud and vibrates a lot.  </li>
            <li> I use it at least twice a day at the lowest pressure setting, and it really helps keep my teeth very clean.</li>
            <li> Overall construction seems very flimsy for a product at this price point!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m able to add to the water a small amount of mouth wash as an antiseptic.</li>
            <li> Works well.&lt;br /&gt;Better design model to previous version.&lt;br /&gt;Seems to be working fine after 3 months.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I bought this knowing the build wouldn&#x27;t be quite as sturdy, but liking the more streamlined size and look for my small bathroom.</li>
            <li> in.&lt;br /&gt;The first couple of times I used it, then placed it back on the shelf, water ran out of the handle onto the shelf.</li>
            <li> I recommend that before using for the first time , you fill up the reservoir and run it through the system numerous times.  </li>
            <li> wow what a difference!  </li>
            <li> Would also be better if electric was swivel ( or on opposite side) due to plug in on my bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> The machine is pretty quiet comparedcto others, I have used.  </li>
            <li> My last teeth cleaning at the dentist was better than average as my gums did not bleed.  </li>
            <li> Works well, but seems a little cheap.</li>
            <li> The old had a compartment incorporated into the lid to hold extra attachments which  was very  convenient.</li>
            <li> I really like the fact that the reservoir is not only clear but also removable.  </li>
            <li> The device itself is somewhat loud.</li>
            <li> I do not think it is too loud.  </li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t missed a day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s loud.  </li>
            <li> Like really loud.  </li>
            <li> My goal was to use this water flosser once a day, but my usage has fallen off considerably since I began using it a couple months ago.  </li>
            <li> Bought this to replace my old Ultra.</li>
            <li> But I do see food particles flushed out from the action after brushing teeth and using this.</li>
            <li> THE OLD ONE&#x27;S</li>
            <li> I also think I preferred the old power switch (rocker type) over this push button.</li>
            <li> It lasted 6 months before it developed a fault.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace my old Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser.  </li>
            <li> Too loud.</li>
            <li> The device is a bit loud</li>
            <li> 90 days old and cannot return.</li>
            <li> Before you know it it will start to feel natural.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot quieter than the old one we used to have.</li>
            <li> it really cleans deep</li>
            <li> I still use floss at least once a week to make sure everything is getting properly flossed, but I&#x27;ve found this Waterpik to do a very thorough job.  ,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just thought it was.too loud a vibration.  </li>
            <li> It works really well, and I&#x27;ve been using it occasionally.</li>
            <li> Well, there are both good and lousy things about it.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;anyone interested in keeping their teeth and gums healthy and avoiding expensive dentist bills.</li>
            <li> I use it every day and it is rather gross to see what my high dollar vibrating tooth brush does not remove.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t attempted to use anything beyond the flosser attachment, so I&#x27;m not sure how effective the other products are.</li>
            <li> My new year&#x27;s intentions included using it regularly</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s scary how much comes out from between your teeth after brushing; way more than with floss.</li>
            <li> Only a few attachments fit in the well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smaller than the older model, but the water chamber seems the same size, so I cant complain.</li>
            <li> This water flosser fixes that problem entirely, and after a few uses, my teeth were as clean or cleaner than the last time I went to get my teeth professionally cleaned.</li>
            <li> When I first turned it on, it squirted so hard and fast that it escaped my hand and squirted all over me an my sink mirror.</li>
            <li> For me this product ( I add a little mouthwash and hydrogen peroxide to the water), with flossing and brushing keeps my gums healthy and my dentist bills way down.</li>
            <li> but I think I will probably give it five stars in the near future.  </li>
            <li> So, apparently for some of us</li>
            <li> In the end, it seems to operate as well as my old one, which only lasted a year.</li>
            <li> nearly too short to be usable.  </li>
            <li> My dentist says that since I have been using a &amp;#34;Waterpik&amp;#34; as part of my oral daily cleansing that I have completely eliminating the gum disease that I had when I firstcame to see her after retiring to Mesa, AZ 14 years ago.  </li>
            <li> it has a 120V DC motor, which is driven almost directly off the full-bridge rectifier, so it is definitely not compatible with 240V power sources (for those wondering).</li>
            <li> Can be a bit messy but worth it.</li>
            <li> The other switch that releases the little spray tip is in a position where it is easy to accidently switch and release the tip while using it..</li>
            <li> works very well but a little loud</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because of the lack of a travel case, the reservoir needs to be bigger or a new design is required (a universal hose to plug in directly to generic water faucets would be nice).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also experienced fewer instances of bad breath since starting with the Waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> construction was not good for smooth operation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the general use tip.  </li>
            <li> Many others have complained about the hidden water markings on the side of the plastic bowl.  </li>
            <li> I have used the previous model from Waterpik for several years and it lasted very well.</li>
            <li> I add a little hydrogen peroxide to the water chamber of my Water Pik and this has a large chamber that is roomy enough to accommodate water and peroxide.  </li>
            <li> and it was very hard to drain all the water out and clean it.  </li>
            <li> the sounds are quite loud.. can&#x27;t use it later at night when other family member is sleeping..</li>
            <li> compared to  2 year old  other</li>
            <li> The water container is larger than the previous one that I had and much easier to empty.</li>
            <li> I would give it five stars but the button on the part you hold is pretty hard to turn on and off.</li>
            <li> I like the new features on the Aquarius but the various tips do not fit well - pop out while in use and water stops flowing.</li>
            <li> The only drawback that I could note is that the reservoir seems a little bit clumsy to get a grip on when filled with water.</li>
            <li> It is much smaller than the old version, so takes up less space on the vanity.</li>
            <li> Also, the water on a recommend setting doesn&#x27;t last long at all.  </li>
            <li> , where on the old one you had to hold the button down when you wanted to stop the flow of water).</li>
            <li> It would be hard to describe all the positive features but it works as advertised.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great if you have braces or had your braces taken off and have that little wire behind your teeth that makes it really annoying to use string floss to clean your teeth.</li>
            <li> very noisy and on/off switch hard to move</li>
            <li> , the silly thing doesn&#x27;t light up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The instructions are clear, and there are instructional videos galore, although I guarantee you will get your counter messy, unlike those video users.</li>
            <li> loud motor makes me feel hesitant to use it late at night because of house mates - this is totally understandable but my expectation was a silent stream of water.</li>
            <li> Have not had this long</li>
            <li> Should have gotten this long ago.  </li>
            <li> Wish I would have gotten one a long time ago.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ve got this jet of high powered water blipping away at your teeth and pulling the button from the on to the off position is actually quite hard -- the button is already depressed into the handle, the thing is very hard to move, and the handle is already likely very wet.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> I have tried the other tips that come with it, but the standard tip is what I choose to use every time.</li>
            <li> The on-off switch on the handle is way to hard to move from the hand that you hold it in, so I have to turn that on, put the device in my mouth, and then turn on the main switch.</li>
            <li> I let it dry out every night</li>
            <li> My only real complaint is the tip doesn&#x27;t want to stay in at first.  </li>
            <li> If you have braces do not live without this</li>
            <li> My 1st flosser, so limited knowledge.</li>
            <li> typical product - they don&#x27;t last long as they should for what you pay</li>
            <li> Average product could bought the same thing at Target and saved the shipping costs</li>
            <li> : tip eject button is too loose.  </li>
            <li> Floss can push food down deep in your gums while remove 60% of it.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t help but think that there has to be a design that could cut further down on spatter and water usage.</li>
            <li> One minor issue that I could add is that it is a little loud under high pressure, but that&#x27;s not really a bother, although if you&#x27;re living with someone who is asleep and the walls are thin, it could wake them up.</li>
            <li> Not so different from previous version.</li>
            <li> usually floss daily and can find a bit of tartar buildup even after brushing, especially when I feel it on my teeth and tongue.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, packaging had been disposed of prior to first use.</li>
            <li> The hose is very stiff and tightly coiled, which makes the device a bit cumbersome to use, particularly when it&#x27;s positioned on the left-hand side of a right-handed person and has to be stretched out a bit.</li>
            <li> The dental hygienist said it was probably because I&#x27;m using this, as prior to the Waterpik my gums would bleed (ranging from a little to a lot) on every single cleaning.  </li>
            <li> My experience has been that it is not a true substitute for traditional flossing, even when set in the &amp;#34;floss&amp;#34; mode.</li>
            <li> Just wish the reservoir was a little bigger.</li>
            <li> And, although it is hard to admit... I seem to be getting fewer offers of, &amp;#34;Would</li>
            <li> on off switch on the handle because your hand gets wet</li>
            <li> All that I expected</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a dentist, but before I bought this device, I spent a bit of time trying to see if water flossing was quack-science.  </li>
            <li> Performing as expected</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels substantially cleaner after using it only for a few days.</li>
            <li> partially closed.  </li>
            <li> mean I can&#x27;t give the &amp;#34;Waterpik Aquarius Professional Water Flosser&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I find the cord easily goes back into its base (just point the cord end of the hand held unit at the cord storage area),</li>
            <li> That is probably caused the &amp;#34;mold&amp;#34; complaints in some of the other reviews.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok but doesn&#x27;t replace flossing :(</li>
            <li> contrary to other reviews.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely no complaints about it!</li>
            <li> although smaller it is not  better.</li>
            <li> It gets all of the small food particles left after brushing.  </li>
            <li> It also comes with a lot of other attachments, but I haven&#x27;t tried those yet.</li>
            <li> One prob is it cannot be used in Asia due to the voltage</li>
            <li> would be 5 stars if something provided to keep the other tips sanitary and out of the way.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> and my mom was very curious about getting one herself.</li>
            <li> , just the thought makes you want to avoid using it, but here&#x27;s where the water flosser shines: you can put mild temperature water (I don&#x27;t like it cold) and just go over without pain and</li>
            <li> My last one was of the basic model and was accidentally broken.</li>
            <li> The handle retains a little water, and that was resolved by letting it dangle down into the sink while I dry the tip and water reservoir.  </li>
            <li> Tips store in a bin in the tank, Comes with 2 plain tips and pack of single specialty tips.</li>
            <li> I have large hands which make flossing difficult.  </li>
            <li> And someone said the tube is hard to put back</li>
            <li> try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The waterpik was a little uncomfortable at first, but you get used to it</li>
            <li> and also I really have a difficult time with the on and off switch on the handle.  </li>
            <li> Product is a bit noisy, especially when trying to use late night, but works well.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it takes a few tries to get it to stay</li>
            <li> It took a few tries to get used to operating the machine -</li>
            <li> Where the Ultra required the user to hold down a button to STOP the water flow, the Aquarius requires the user to hold horn a button to START it.</li>
            <li> I think everyone should use a Waterpik to keep your bacteria levels down to a manageable level so plaque stays down.</li>
            <li> I turned the flow way down after I had to have oral surgery</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t hold the pick upside down water runs all over my hand &amp; arm.  </li>
            <li> , so I run it on a 240V to 120V step down transformer.</li>
            <li> Slight difference</li>
            <li> Less dental scraping....</li>
            <li> My previous one was Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I wish it was less clunky to operate.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Waterpik WP-660 on the recommendation of my dental hygienist after she expressed some concerns with my gum health during my previous dental checkup.  </li>
            <li> So I cannot complain about the weight difference between this and previous products.  </li>
            <li> I typically use 9 or 10.  </li>
            <li> This is what I use to do with previous Waterpiks that I have used.  </li>
            <li> then the on/off switch on the handle of the water tip holder has to be turned on, but as the on/off switch is very stiff this is almost impossible to do and while you are trying to do this it is quite easy to press the eject button for the water tip by mistake.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is the the on/off switch on the wand is way to stiff</li>
            <li> Water tank is small have to empty alot.</li>
            <li> and they all leak an make a mess</li>
            <li> NOT TRUE.</li>
            <li> I guess it is a little louder than a typical refrigerator.</li>
            <li> If you use on #9-10 &amp; don&#x27;t hold the wand tightly</li>
            <li> Even flossing did not clean between my teeth like this waterpik does.  </li>
            <li> The on/off switch on the handle was very stiff and almost impossible for my arthritic fingers, and was having trouble trying to turn off the led &#x27;floss&#x27; light.  </li>
            <li> A little noisy but works well for implants.</li>
            <li> Takes a little getting used to if you never used a water pick before.</li>
            <li> A little on the noisy side.</li>
            <li> However it cost a little more.&lt;br</li>
            <li> What it knocks out of your teeth is both disgusting and amazing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s nothing to its operation, you&#x27;ll have this thing going in a few minutes</li>
            <li> The actual flossing tool&#x27;s handle is quite frustrating to use.  </li>
            <li> It seems that I am always too rushed for time in the morning and too tired at night to use this device on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for 2 months everyday and have no tartar buildup.</li>
            <li> It does the job so far but not impressed.  </li>
            <li> We are addicted to using the Waterpik daily now.</li>
            <li> Has two on off switches ( one on the handle), so I thought it was broken, but it was just extra efficient.</li>
            <li> I even did a few tests to see the difference between taditional flossers and the pik.</li>
            <li> a few times a month i shoot the nozzle into the basin by accidentally hitting it.  </li>
            <li> I was reading quite a few reviews before I decided to go with this model.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Water gets in between teeth, clearing out any trapped food.</li>
            <li> the water hose is inflexible and short.</li>
            <li> Just missing a case or covered holder on the unit to store them till needed.</li>
            <li> Maybe I received a unit with a missing part???</li>
            <li> The water switch to control flow is way too stiff and hard to use when the handle is wet.  </li>
            <li> the hose usually cracks after a few years.  </li>
            <li> Small unit.</li>
            <li> It does make some noise when in use, but it is pumping water through a small opening.  </li>
            <li> Small water container.  </li>
            <li> Call me weird, but I like my products to last longer than that</li>
            <li> the massage option is relatively pointless but the floss option works well.</li>
            <li> No more after-leaks.</li>
            <li> No more bleeding gums or plaque since I started using this.</li>
            <li> Was necessitated by a dental bridge, but makes flossing pointless once you are using this.  </li>
            <li> I have struggled with periodontal disease in the past, so I chose the Aquarius over the others because it is specifically designed to focus on gum issues and it has a gum massage setting as well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why it needed to be lighter unless for travel.</li>
            <li> not sure if intrinsic problem or just switch on my unit.  </li>
            <li> Not very good for me.</li>
            <li> The reason I did not give it five stars is because it is hard to keep the handle on the stand</li>
            <li> Just wish the &#x27;on/off&#x27; switch on the handheld part wasn&#x27;t so hard to use.</li>
            <li> I found that the slide switch located on the wand which controls the water flow is hard to operate with one hand.</li>
            <li> Gets between the hard to reach area.</li>
            <li> realy hard to switch.</li>
            <li> That should be the one that&#x27;s hard to switch.</li>
            <li> excellant except for hand held on/off switch hard to operate.</li>
            <li> Hard to turn on and off...</li>
            <li> Also the on/off switch is so hard to turn on, I have to turn it on before I start.  </li>
            <li> I use it at least once a day.  </li>
            <li> It has an &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; button to push after you plug it in, which feels unnecessarily clumsy.</li>
            <li> I hate to floss so this process is much easier for me.</li>
            <li> Also, I find it difficult to turn on the hand nozzle with just one hand--the button is tight turning on, but one hand does turn it off.  </li>
            <li> Water pressure was too weak even at the highest setting</li>
            <li> It is very, very disappointing to me and this is the third Waterpik product I have had in fifteen years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to this thing.</li>
            <li> , maybe the thing has a very short lifespan with the mold growth, but while it was around, it seemed to do an alright job despite some annoying design flaws.</li>
            <li> Poor design of the product.  </li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m addicted</li>
            <li> Shocking how much &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; comes out of my gums.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars is becauses I find the button to turn on and off the water really annoying to press up/down.</li>
            <li> This has been a game changer for me.  </li>
            <li> This is already broken, will not power on.</li>
            <li> My hygienist explained that teeth cleaning would be less painful</li>
            <li> Bulky and difficult to operate.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unfortunate, but this fact by itself might force us to give up on using the thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The pick&#x27;s switch is difficult but I just keep it in the on position and just turn the power switch on and off.</li>
            <li> Somewhat difficult to slide the on/off switch</li>
            <li> Once in the spaces it&#x27;s difficult to get them out.</li>
            <li> Expensive for this to happen</li>
            <li> The on/off  switch on the wand is a bit difficult to move</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that a water jet could do as well as dental floss.  </li>
            <li> Also, the &amp;#34;massage&amp;#34; function is completely useless.</li>
            <li> The on/off switches (2 of them) are awkward, sp.</li>
            <li> This model is not designed well, from the water well to the controls-BAD DESIGN, awkward to use.</li>
            <li> The wand is placed in a slightly awkward position when trying to remove and replace the container for filling.</li>
            <li> disappointing purchase</li>
            <li> It is very difficult to push the off/on switch on the flosser.</li>
            <li> The on/off switch is very difficult to operate.</li>
            <li> THe on-off switch is very difficult to turn.</li>
            <li> the on/off button on the handle is very difficult to move.  </li>
            <li> After my husbands bad dental check up, I bought this for him for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Would have gotten 4 stars if not for the bad unit</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> it has never leaked when filling the reservoir, an annoying problem with the WP-100.  </li>
            <li> I hate flossing because I always tear up my gums with the floss.</li>
            <li> Ive always suffered from gum issues and hate flossing</li>
            <li> I would prefer to have about another 5 inches or so on the hose between the base and the nozzle, and I would prefer an option for a tip with a sharper angle.  </li>
            <li> so I just leave it in the on position, and use the on/off botton on the base to turn unit off and on.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s always quite annoying to use a toothpick</li>
            <li> but it is the worst Waterpik product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> **, is that considered a nasty word?&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It really is helping and it works well.</li>
            <li> Much easier than flossing.  I use it every day and it is rather gross to see what my high dollar vibrating tooth brush does not remove.</li>
            <li> Really loud and on and off switch is so hard to use on the wand but does good job with flossing.</li>
            <li> Small unit. Water tank is small have to empty alot. Dont like the on off switch on the handle because your hand gets wet and you can turn off. Pump seems to hesitate making me wonder how good the pump is.</li>
            <li> This is the best way to clean between my teeth after brushing.  And it&#x27;s easier than standard flossing.</li>
            <li> Works great and size is good for leaving out on bathroom counter.  Nice selection of tools and clear instructions for use of each.  Much better than flossing!</li>
            <li> Pleased with my order.  Product was as described and delivered in timely manner -- packaged well.</li>
            <li> Just what my dentist ordered.</li>
            <li> PERFORMS AS ADVERTISED. I AM HIGHLY PLEASED.</li>
            <li> I have a experience that  I sicked  my tooth, then i should go to a dentist.&lt;br /&gt;Also I spend many money.&lt;br /&gt;So, I decide to prevent my tooth.&lt;br /&gt;I am searching that my tooth is prevented some.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I found this product.&lt;br /&gt;It is a good after Waterpik removes matters on my tooth.</li>
            <li> Wow!! I spend so much on floss in the pass 30 years. I&#x27;ve floss, brush, rinse with peroxide or mouth wash for years, but I felt the difference after just the 2nd time using the waterpik flosser (WP-660). Floss can push food down deep in your gums while remove 60% of it. The Waterpik Aquarius Water Flosser was flushing and cleaning to the point I asked myself where did some of those particles come from. Lol&lt;br /&gt;I love it and might have kept some of my back teeth lost a while ago if I had of bought this thing years before. I brag about it as if I invented.</li>
            <li> the pressure is not supper high. You still need to brush your teeth to get plaque off the teeth. I think this thing might be good for someone who has braces.</li>
            <li> I should&#x27;ve stayed with the original. The original is better!  Live and learn!</li>
            <li> Love this Waterpik Flosser! I had one back in the 80&#x27;s which was a chore to use. I actually look forward to using my Waterpik. I have crooked/crowded teeth and this really helps in flushing the food out. Easy to use and works great!</li>
            <li> If you have crowns, this is a MUST BUY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s nothing to its operation, you&#x27;ll have this thing going in a few minutes and yes, your teeth and gums will feel great. The instructions are clear, and there are instructional videos galore, although I guarantee you will get your counter messy, unlike those video users. Changing the piks themselves is also a very simple process. A trick my dentist told me is to run warm salt water through, it works wonders for the gums. Just remember to run fresh water through it afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be fooled by the flimsy-looking wand and connector. It&#x27;s not, use with confidence.</li>
            <li> nice design  works well and I like the two shut offs  one on the handle and one on the main mechanism,  it is quiet and runs smooth.</li>
            <li> Seriously, my new addiction!  Even flossing did not clean between my teeth like this waterpik does.  I use it at least once a day.  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> We have used water flossers for an extended time, and have tried different brands of flossers, but this one is the best so far.  It&#x27;s quieter than others but has plenty of power.  The only drawback that I could note is that the reservoir seems a little bit clumsy to get a grip on when filled with water.</li>
            <li> Have not had this long but I think I will probably give it five stars in the near future.  Will know for sure in a few more months when I visit the dental hygienist who recommended it to me.</li>
            <li> Excellent product worked well beyond expectations</li>
            <li> Awesome! Very satisfied.  Product works well, and my teeth feel so much better.  I was experiencing some graying around the edge of a rather recent crown, and it seems to be minimizing it.</li>
            <li> it is a very good product</li>
            <li> Meets my expectations, works good, easy to use and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Just like advertised.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my waterpik. I could never really get into the habit of flossing and hence waterpik turned out to be a great alternative. Although if you look up on the internet (and even as per my dentist) flossing is still better but then using waterpik is better than not flossing.&lt;br /&gt;I currently based in India where the power supply is 220V but I am using an inexpensive 220 to 110 V step down and the waterpik is working perfectly with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the link for 220 to 110 V that I am using.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.in/Maxcon-Voltage-Converter-110V-Watt/dp/B00MO8303K/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1420355223&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;220+to+110</li>
            <li> I am happy with the purchase. Love the variety of interchangable flosser heads. The device itself is somewhat loud.</li>
            <li> I bought it from Spain and it can&#x27;t work properly if plugged to a 220V / 50Hz network.</li>
            <li> Works. Better than expected.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Bought one got my goddaughter too. My mouth feels wonderful. It&#x27;s scary how much comes out from between your teeth after brushing; way more than with floss.</li>
            <li> I think there is no other Water Flosser in the market that is more cost effective and it does what it is supposed to. Surely would recommend this product to anyone and everyone.</li>
            <li> Better tan the last one.</li>
            <li> This flosser works great.  I really like the newer design, it does not take up so much room, and is easy to clean.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Should have gotten this long ago.  Much better at cleaning food particles from under my gums that caused irritation.  Particularly good if you like popcorn.</li>
            <li> Bulky and difficult to operate. I sprayed water everywhere!</li>
            <li> Works great, easy to use. Love the different water settings and easy to change tips. Does not take up a lot of room on the counter either.</li>
            <li> Is very effective in flossing teeth. I really like the ability to set the water pressure. The water reservoir&lt;br /&gt;is big enough that I don&#x27;t have to refill it. It really messages the gums and gives you the just came from&lt;br /&gt;the dentist feeling. I hope that my dentist notices the difference on my next cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the flosser came very quickly in the mail, which really impressed me. I would definitely recommend it to&lt;br /&gt;anyone interested in keeping their teeth and gums healthy and avoiding expensive dentist bills.</li>
            <li> My beloved Ultra started leaking after 2 years and I replaced it via warranty with the Aquarius. Here are my initial impressions and comparisons between the two:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  It&#x27;s smaller, especially the reservoir. Grrrrrr! I think they intentionally hide that fact. Instead of listing the actual ounce capacity, they list &amp;#34;90 seconds of usage.&amp;#34; Disingenuous. Regardless, it&#x27;s smaller than the Ultra reservoir if that matters to anyone (it does to me). Point Ultra&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It is more powerful than the Ultra if that matters to anyone (it does to me). This is a good thing if you really want to knock debris out of your teeth.  It won&#x27;t quite take the enamel off your teeth, but it&#x27;s noticeably stronger (and has more settings). One of the heads actually carries a warning label! Point Aquarius.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. There are two mechanisms for turning the Aquarius on/off; one on the unit&#x27;s body and one on the handle. Where the Ultra required the user to hold down a button to STOP the water flow, the Aquarius requires the user to hold horn a button to START it. Slight difference but there ya go if it matters (it really doesn&#x27;t to me). Point neither.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both are aesthetically pleasing. So far I see no real reason that one is substantially better than the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Want a bigger reservoir? Choose the Ultra.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Want a more forceful water flow? Choose the Aquarius.</li>
            <li> I love it. Previous machine finally gave out after 14 years and this was one of the best rated and I can see why. Smooth and easy to use. Light to powerful pulses clean deep.</li>
            <li> great. All that I expected</li>
            <li> Great Product!!! A+++</li>
            <li> This  is great flos mouth. It doesn&#x27;t take up to much space,</li>
            <li> since china use 220v, and i didn&#x27;t know that,so i plug it in our 220v,and the machine dead now,it&#x27;s my own fault,and the waterpik looks nice, and i already buy the WP-100EC  in china now, cause china has no wp-660, and it is useful~~~~,to be short, Waterpik Aquarius Water Flosser is useful to me :)</li>
            <li> Been using this about a month now and I have to say I like it very much!  It has a nice assortment of tips and a good size reservoir. It does make some noise when in use, but it is pumping water through a small opening.  I do not think it is too loud.  I can&#x27;t think of what to compare it to in order to give you a fair idea of the level of noise.  I guess it is a little louder than a typical refrigerator. That you can dial up the water pressure is a great feature, just make sure you read the manual since some tips should only be used at the lowest pressure settings.  And, although it is hard to admit... I seem to be getting fewer offers of, &amp;#34;Would you like a piece of gum?&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Care for a mint?&amp;#34;  So, apparently for some of us the Waterpik Aquarius Water Flosser makes the world a more pleasant place to breathe, as well.  Hmmm.  Cleaner teeth, healthier gums, fresh air and happier friends and acquaintances... what more could one want from floss???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though you have probably never been asked, &amp;#34;Care for a mint?&amp;#34;  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> waterpik. save your face.</li>
            <li> Works great for me. 10x better than flossing. I&#x27;m addicted to this thing. I let it dry out every night and I never keep water sitting in it..ew. That is probably caused the &amp;#34;mold&amp;#34; complaints in some of the other reviews. Just keep it sanitary and you won&#x27;t have a problem.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how much stuff gets lodged in your teeth during the day. My dentist has been trying to get me to floss daily for years. She mentioned a Waterpik. So far I haven&#x27;t missed a day.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok but doesn&#x27;t replace flossing :(</li>
            <li> Works very well as all Water Piks and is easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li> Very effective for removing particles from between the teeth.</li>
            <li> I have one and purchased this one for my son.  He said it is one of the best Christmas gifts!  I will never be without one again!</li>
            <li> I am so glad I purchased this Waterpik Aquarius Water Flosser!!  I&#x27;ve been using it now for several weeks and it seems to have helped my gums appear healthier.  Now, I can&#x27;t imagine being without it!</li>
            <li> this is a huge improvement over the WP-100.  I have been using this for 2 months now and it has never leaked when filling the reservoir, an annoying problem with the WP-100.  The pressure is very adjustable (altho I always keep it on 10 since I&#x27;ve been using these for years), and it even has a &amp;#34;massage&amp;#34; function which pulses the spray on and off.  I find the cord easily goes back into its base (just point the cord end of the hand held unit at the cord storage area), contrary to other reviews.  The shut off on the handle works perfectly so you don&#x27;t spray all over when inserting or removing the handle from your mouth.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Seem like they all leak this is my 3 rd one. and they all leak an make a mess one the counter top.</li>
            <li> I love the Waterpik company and their products.  I had one for about 10 years and when it finally stopped working and I sent it for repair they sent me new one for free.  That was 10 years ago.  I just bought this one and I like it better then the previous models.  For me this product ( I add a little mouthwash and hydrogen peroxide to the water), with flossing and brushing keeps my gums healthy and my dentist bills way down.</li>
            <li> I like the way this waterpik works. The reason I did not give it five stars is because it is hard to keep the handle on the stand and also I really have a difficult time with the on and off switch on the handle.  It is not user friendly.  As far as being effective, I do feel the difference in my teeth after using the waterpik.</li>
            <li> This does the job very well.  My dentist likes seeing the good results!  Hey, keep them clean.</li>
            <li> Makes easy work of oral hygiene.  Really works well.</li>
            <li> I like the new features on the Aquarius but the various tips do not fit well - pop out while in use and water stops flowing. I had this one a couple months, my previous one worked much better. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great product, it does what is advertised. I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because of the lack of a travel case, the reservoir needs to be bigger or a new design is required (a universal hose to plug in directly to generic water faucets would be nice).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a concept that Waterpik has used for a great many years and has become more versatile and improved. I am a twice a day flosser and a three times a day brusher, but still have a couple of pocket where food gets impacted and the gums are intermittently sore. I started using the Waterpik again after many years and it is great! I still use dental floss at night, brush with an electric toothbrush then use the Waterpik with slightly warm water. The pressure is adjustable and there is a variety of tips. I have settled on the standard one for about one full minute, which means filling the water reservoir about 1/4 or 1/3 full. It takes a little time to develop a technique that doesn&#x27;t wash the vanity - and me - but it is amazing what residual debris flushes out after everything I described before use. My gums are better and it seems that plaque builds up less. The unit is attractive and not too large. I don&#x27;t remember my old Waterpik failing, so I think the outlook for this one is good in terms of longevity. I enthusiastically endorse this product and this model.</li>
            <li> Great machine. Love it.</li>
            <li> It does a good job.  The only complaint I have is the the on/off switch on the wand is way to stiff and I can&#x27;t move it so I have to use the on/off switch on the unit and just make sure the wand is in my mouth my I push the on button.  Other than that problem it has been great.</li>
            <li> The on off switch doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a dentist, but before I bought this device, I spent a bit of time trying to see if water flossing was quack-science.  Well, as it turns out, there&#x27;s some minimally convincing evidence that water flossing may be better than just brushing and string-flossing alone.  Over the months we&#x27;ve had this thing, it&#x27;s clear that it&#x27;s doing a pretty good job grabbing at stuff that we might have otherwise missed, but I&#x27;ve got three big gripes with this device:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It&#x27;s loud.  Like really loud.  If you&#x27;re planning to keep your significant other asleep when you floss, well, you&#x27;d better be flossing in another building.&lt;br /&gt;2. The actual flossing tool&#x27;s handle is quite frustrating to use.  You&#x27;ve got this jet of high powered water blipping away at your teeth and pulling the button from the on to the off position is actually quite hard -- the button is already depressed into the handle, the thing is very hard to move, and the handle is already likely very wet.&lt;br /&gt;3. In some cases, the water has actually caused significant pain when it slips and directs the jet into the underside of your tongue or the side of your cheek.  A part of me wonders if there can even be a fix to a problem like that.&lt;br /&gt;4. Despite our best efforts, this device is starting to accumulate mold.  We actually maintain a wicked clean bathroom, thanks in-part, to our wonderful maid, but this device is used constantly and always near water.  It&#x27;s unfortunate, but this fact by itself might force us to give up on using the thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, maybe the thing has a very short lifespan with the mold growth, but while it was around, it seemed to do an alright job despite some annoying design flaws.</li>
            <li> It really works!  A littlr noisy but effective</li>
            <li> works great I love it</li>
            <li> This works great! I love it. And someone said the tube is hard to put back but mine goes in just fine.</li>
            <li> Indispensible dental cleaning tool. Works very well. Very eye pleasing design.</li>
            <li> Works very well so far. I have been using its predecessor for years.</li>
            <li> My husband bought this at our dentist&#x27;s suggestion.  After some months I started using it and love it too.  Way easier and more effective than using floss.  Highly recommended and yours was the best price too.</li>
            <li> works great and has several different levels to use. i would recommend this product</li>
            <li> works great,you can set it to the level of pressure that you need.comes with a number of tips for different applactions.</li>
            <li> We had an old waterpik and loved it, but it was time for a new one. This one makes you want to floss. Easy to use settings and convenient large opening for refilling makes for further ease of use. Convenient slide on the handle is much improved from the older model (this one you slide and it self locks until you slide it back, where on the old one you had to hold the button down when you wanted to stop the flow of water). A great product with many lovely attachments!</li>
            <li> A good product, with one flaw.  It is very difficult to push the off/on switch on the flosser.</li>
            <li> I like this unit works well for me</li>
            <li> I hate to floss so this process is much easier for me. The pick&#x27;s switch is difficult but I just keep it in the on position and just turn the power switch on and off.</li>
            <li> I have been using WaterPiks for years and have always liked them.  The new one is even better.  The changes were well thought out and useful.  Quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li> The on/off switch is very difficult to operate. and the unit is quite noisy,  It does the job and that is what I asked of it..</li>
            <li> Somewhat difficult to slide the on/off switch</li>
            <li> I bought this device on the advice of my dentist.  Although it works as advertised and leaves your mouth feeling very clean, it takes up a fair amount of limited bathroom vanity space and requires an electrical outlet to operate (in my case, I need an extension cord to reach the nearest outlet).  My goal was to use this water flosser once a day, but my usage has fallen off considerably since I began using it a couple months ago.  It seems that I am always too rushed for time in the morning and too tired at night to use this device on a daily basis.  One must have the time, energy and discipline to use it every day.  I&#x27;ll continue to brush my teeth every morning and night, but I doubt that this water flosser will get used very often.</li>
            <li> Bought this product from glowing reviews so took a shot at it. Once received, plug it in, doesn&#x27;t work - see attached photos.&lt;br /&gt;No matter how i press the ON/OFF button, the silly thing doesn&#x27;t light up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be asking for my money or exchange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waste of time and money!!!</li>
            <li> Very happy with my new Waterpik, went from rechargeable pik to this model, much happier with this one.</li>
            <li> Definitely satisfied.</li>
            <li> nice quite and easy to move around</li>
            <li> The inconvenience of having to use a transformer, but it still satisfied.</li>
            <li> works fine, kinda noisy tho.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had several Waterpiks over the years...the hose usually cracks after a few years.  This model is great.  It has superior controls, and runs more quietly than other models we&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> Great product. Does the job perfectly. Absolutely no complaints about it!</li>
            <li> Compact, powerful, works well for my wife.  Delivery was super fast.</li>
            <li> Plenty of water in the tank.  Good pressure.  Tips store in a bin in the tank, Comes with 2 plain tips and pack of single specialty tips.</li>
            <li> Great pressure. Does a very good job of getting items that brushing misses. Removed a piece of a popcorn kernel popcorn that caused some swelling from a day prior after I had already brushed twice.</li>
            <li> The on/off switches (2 of them) are awkward, sp. the one on the hand unit.</li>
            <li> My 1st flosser, so limited knowledge. But I think it works great. Love timer function</li>
            <li> Performing as expected</li>
            <li> This is what I&#x27;ve been looking for. Fast shipment!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> great product , but u have to deal with this product</li>
            <li> Nice quality,good product.It&#x27;s suit for me.</li>
            <li> thank you very much it&#x27;s excellent , I am asking if there is 220 volt from this product?</li>
            <li> Great product! Helps keep tartar from building up on your teeth. I&#x27;ve used it for 2 months everyday and have no tartar buildup.</li>
            <li> Phenomenal! SOOOO much better than traditional flossing. Just wish that the water tank was perhaps 50% larger.</li>
            <li> Love this. The water container is larger than the previous one that I had and much easier to empty. It works as it should and I&#x27;ve had no problems with it. My gums and teeth are healthy :)</li>
            <li> the sounds are quite loud.. can&#x27;t use it later at night when other family member is sleeping..</li>
            <li> its been one month now and no complaints Easy to use and dos a great job</li>
            <li> My teeth really feel clean after using the product. Its kinda of noisy but for the clean feeling its worth it.</li>
            <li> Flawless, no problems and lots of different attachments which makes it a great deal.</li>
            <li> On/Off switch broke in the first two weeks of usage. The only way to turn it on and off is by unplugging it now.</li>
            <li> Well it works.  The unit is very light.  It is so light that you have to hold it with one hand to turn it on.  They give you extra attachments but no where to store them except two slots inside.  The pressure is OK but loud since the unit again is so light.  It does the job so far but not impressed.  This is another example of a company trying to squeeze every penny to save on a unit instead of concentrating on make a good customer unit.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the water flossed ...highly recommend</li>
            <li> Very good product, works as it&#x27;s supposed to work</li>
            <li> I love it. I would give it five stars but the button on the part you hold is pretty hard to turn on and off. I just use the button on the base and it works great.</li>
            <li> It was working great and now exactly 90 days later it has stopped working completely.</li>
            <li> Love this updated Waterpik! Actually bought 3! Use my oldie but goldie twice a day and am happy to say this new model has the same output, but is more compact. Like the on off switches as well. My dentist &amp; hygienist always rave about my clean teeth- Waterpik &amp; Oral B get all the credit! highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Recommended by my ENT for tonsil cleaning.  But it works wonders on my teeth.  Love it so much that I bought a second one for my wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy this model again (in fact - I did).</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace my old Ultra. Pleased that it is all white and more compact in design, also really like the attached hinged lid.  Would have rated it 5 stars but initially wanted to return it (except that I had inadvertently thrown away the box before using it!).  The on/off switch on the handle was very stiff and almost impossible for my arthritic fingers, and was having trouble trying to turn off the led &#x27;floss&#x27; light.  The on/off switch is now loosening up, and I discovered that the led light goes off by itself, it just has a delayed reaction sometimes.  Now I am more than pleased and like it even better than the Ultra.</li>
            <li> It is a bit tricky to learn how to use.  When I first turned it on, it squirted so hard and fast that it escaped my hand and squirted all over me an my sink mirror.</li>
            <li> Works well! I like it gas a lid to cover the water so no accidental spilling.  There is also a clever storage to put 2 heads. The only thing I would change would be to have the ability to store more pick heads.</li>
            <li> This is a big step from my Interplak I used for over 20 years. I like the feel and action of this waterpik very much. Even my dentist mentioned it by name. Easy to fill up and floss. It does not seem to be that effective to remove my plaque as claimed. My dentist told me to brush 3 times a week. But I do see food particles flushed out from the action after brushing teeth and using this.</li>
            <li> A little noisy but works well for implants.</li>
            <li> Working good so far. I like the no frills. Nice design with the lid.</li>
            <li> Not so different from previous version. It&#x27;s not so messy and I really like the change from push button to switch to control the water flow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: shortly after I posted this review it made a pop sound and the power button stopped working. The unit works now by plugging and unplugging. Customer support from Waterpik has not responded yet. Downgrading to two stars, you are better off with the old model.</li>
            <li> life safer. my teeth are very clean</li>
            <li> Works well, but seems a little cheap.</li>
            <li> I PURCHASED TWO TO REPLACE THE OLD ONE&#x27;S WHICH WHERE ON THERE LAST IRRIGATION. WE ALL THREE USE THIS ITEM IN ADDITION TO REGULAR DENTAL PROTOCOL AND BEING AVID FLOSSER&#x27;S!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really feel like I get any benefit from using this.  It seems to work as described, I just don&#x27;t see any results.</li>
            <li> great weapon against plaque</li>
            <li> It works fine. Just wish the &#x27;on/off&#x27; switch on the handheld part wasn&#x27;t so hard to use.</li>
            <li> Awesome service very happy :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Waterpiks for years. This one cost about $15 more than the previous model, and I don&#x27;t think the extra $$ are worth it. I like the fact that it is white rather than blue, which doesn&#x27;t match anything in my bathroom. It has an &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; button to push after you plug it in, which feels unnecessarily clumsy. On earlier models, you simply put the wand in your mouth and then plug it in. A no-brainer. This model does the same good job as other models in blowing out the debris between your teeth, which is the hallmark of these devices. I will say that for the 20-some years I&#x27;ve been using Waterpiks, I&#x27;ve come to expect that they have to be replaced or repaired every 18 months to 2 years, but they have continued to keep my gums beautiful. I highly recommend these machines. Use them daily or even weekly and ward off huge dental bills!</li>
            <li> Love it! Mouth never felt cleaner! We are addicted to using the Waterpik daily now. GET ONE!</li>
            <li> The new water pic is more compact than the old. The old had a compartment incorporated into the lid to hold extra attachments which  was very  convenient. although smaller it is not  better. It ads led you to believe it was not as noisy. NOT TRUE.</li>
            <li> Poor design of the product.  I have been using waterpik for many years.  This was a replacement for my last one.  This model is not designed well, from the water well to the controls-BAD DESIGN, awkward to use.</li>
            <li> my tooth are shining after using this</li>
            <li> I liked the basic one better</li>
            <li> Verry nice but yhe sound is loud</li>
            <li> Such a great alternative to conventional string flossing.  I have very sensitive gums and tend to bleed when I floss, but this product is great. You can adjust the pressure to your liking. It&#x27;s very fast and convenient. It comes with a variety of tips, for regular teeth, replacements, and braces. I actually look forward to using this after brushing! Would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Good product, great dental exams</li>
            <li> I love it.  It gets all of the small food particles left after brushing.  Can&#x27;t wait to see my dentist!</li>
            <li> Arrived well packaged.&lt;br /&gt;Looks good and I&#x27;d like it better if it worked. I need to be able to use it.!!!&lt;br /&gt;Water OFF/ON button will not move.&lt;br /&gt;UNUSABLE  Company has been notified, and I await a reply!.</li>
            <li> I love the &amp;#34;just came from the dentist&amp;#34; feeling I get from using this pic. I think I&#x27;m addicted</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s breath smells as fresh as a rose.</li>
            <li> I found that the slide switch located on the wand which controls the water flow is hard to operate with one hand.</li>
            <li> I add a little hydrogen peroxide to the water chamber of my Water Pik and this has a large chamber that is roomy enough to accommodate water and peroxide.  The pressure of the pick is determined by a dial that goes from one to ten.  I use an eight and it is a nice forceful power level.  No whimppy dribbles here. It comes with plenty of picks and attachments.  I have this sitting on a  six inch shelf over my sink where it fits nicely .  Over the years my experience with  Water Piks has been positive so I expect that I and this Pik will live happily ever after.</li>
            <li> Works good but the pump is really noisy!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably one of the best waterpic unit on the market.</li>
            <li> My last teeth cleaning at the dentist was better than average as my gums did not bleed.  The dental hygienist said it was probably because I&#x27;m using this, as prior to the Waterpik my gums would bleed (ranging from a little to a lot) on every single cleaning.  I&#x27;ve come accustom to and enjoy using the machine. It&#x27;s easy maintenance and the noise of the motor is very tolerable.</li>
            <li> Great only the turn off is very hard to turn off and on.</li>
            <li> Better than I expected, provides a flosser in addition to the standard massage function. Also has smaller footprint than the WaterPic I&#x27;m replacing..&lt;br /&gt;I like the cover which fits over the ressevoir</li>
            <li> Wish there was a place for all of the piks.</li>
            <li> Excellent device. Works exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Love it!  What a difference.  My dentiste said it made the world of difference and I no longer have Gum issues.  If you don&#x27;t have a water pick, go get one!</li>
            <li> It works well and if you Dump the water out and follow the instructions. It works great for us.</li>
            <li> It works great and my mouth feels better since I started using it.</li>
            <li> good for the money.  There are better ones, but for quite a bit more.  This one serves the purpose.</li>
            <li> very noisy and on/off switch hard to move</li>
            <li> Works well, just very noisy.</li>
            <li> Great  does what it supposed to do</li>
            <li> Shocking how much &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; comes out of my gums.  Dental tech was amazed and commented how much healthier my gums where!</li>
            <li> What can I say, I love this thing. It gets in between the teeth and gums and pulls out pieces of stuff stuck in your gums you had no idea where there and even the tooth brush missed. Use a good whitening pre-brush, then brush with a sonic tooth brush, floss to scrape the stuff out and then use this water pick with a little Listerine in the water (to kill gems under the gums and between) and you are set!</li>
            <li> ON/OFF switch is permanently stuck on OFF. Wasn&#x27;t even able to use it once so I&#x27;m shipping it back. Overall construction seems very flimsy for a product at this price point!</li>
            <li> GREAT WATER PIC.  KINDA NEW TO THE WATER PIC WORLD.. SO STILL GETTING USED TO USING IT PROPERLY.  BUT THAT SAID, IT SEEMS TO DO EVERYTHING I EXPECTED AND MORE.  I HAVE HAD A MULTITUDE OF DENTAL AND GUM PROBLEMS AND MY HYGIENIST AND DENTIST RECOMMENDED THIS UNIT. GOOD CALL!  FEELS SO GOOD WHEN DONE!</li>
            <li> Works as good as the old version (WP100 I believe). It&#x27;s no less noisy in the higher pressure modes. The wand is placed in a slightly awkward position when trying to remove and replace the container for filling. I also think I preferred the old power switch (rocker type) over this push button. In the end, it seems to operate as well as my old one, which only lasted a year.</li>
            <li> This works great! I used it for 6 months and my dental hygienist noticed a huge improvement in my gum health! Less dental scraping....yes please!</li>
            <li> Wish I had this years ago. Well worth the money. Amazing cleaner. Beats the heck out of just flossing.</li>
            <li> always like using waterpik. this is a great upgrade to the 20 yr old i had...quieter too!</li>
            <li> I had this waterpik now for over a year and it is really great. Very effective reliable and I&#x27;m able to add to the water a small amount of mouth wash as an antiseptic. My previous one was Panasonic. It lasted 6 months before it developed a fault. Was replaced under warranty and the replacement also stopped working 8 months later. This one is much more reliable and I noticed no reduction in efficiency. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Works great, as expected.  It is much smaller than the old version, so takes up less space on the vanity.</li>
            <li> Almost as good as the one I had for 20 years,  it too was a waterpik brand. No complaints.  Very easy to use and adjustments ar simple.  Maybe it will last for 20 years.</li>
            <li> works very good. i like it.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use. Works really well. I would recommend this to a friend</li>
            <li> Where has  this been all my life ? I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve been flossing with dental floss all these years. After  using is product,  I can&#x27;t just brush after meals.  My mouth feels cleaner and it gets rid of tiny food particles below the gum line, in pockets etc.  I even  took it on my  overnight trip as I can&#x27;t see how I&#x27;d do without it. This device has changed my life !</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace my old Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser.  Beware that it does not have as much pressure as the Ultra.  Pressure setting 10 on the Aquarius is equivalent to 5 on the Ultra.  I recommend the Ultra over the Aquarius.  I have had the Ultra for about 6 years now and decided to get the Aquarius instead of replacing a leaking hose.  I am returning the Aquarius and replacing the hose on the Ultra.</li>
            <li> Too loud. But does the job</li>
            <li> This thing is amazing. I hate flossing because I always tear up my gums with the floss. I use a sonicare and my dentist always tells my I&#x27;m doing a good job when he sees me. I haven&#x27;t had a cavity since I started using a sonicare more than 10 years ago. However, my hygienist that cleans my teeth is always telling me to floss. She recommended this as an alternative to straight floss torture so I thought I would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The waterpik was a little uncomfortable at first, but you get used to it and then you start turning the pressure up. I have it at about a six. I know it sounds gross, but this thing gets food stuff out from between my teeth that I didn&#x27;t even realize was there. I look forward to using this every night and wish I had it with me when I go on trips. Sometimes I even wish I had it at my office when I get something obviously stuck in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model has a spot for two piks so it works great for me and my wife. It also comes with a lot of other attachments, but I haven&#x27;t tried those yet.</li>
            <li> The Waterpik Aquarius performs exactly as described.  My gums were in much better shape in just one week.</li>
            <li> Only 4 stars as the Waterpik is bigger than I had anticipated, so that it takes up a good deal of counter space in the bathroom.  Also, I find it difficult to turn on the hand nozzle with just one hand--the button is tight turning on, but one hand does turn it off.  The Waterpik does a fantastic job removing food particles between the teeth, and earns 5 stars for its primary function.  It does not help removing coffee or red wine stains as I had so hoped it would.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price plus free shipping, doesn&#x27;t get any better than that.</li>
            <li> It works well using all settings.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. Worked as advertised.</li>
            <li> Only problem is the design fir placing the two &amp;#34;spigots&amp;#34; into the spaces at the back of the water container. Once in the spaces it&#x27;s difficult to get them out. One nice new feature is the choice between pulsing and steady flow of water.</li>
            <li> typical product - they don&#x27;t last long as they should for what you pay but they do work</li>
            <li> More features than my older model.  Some improvements too.</li>
            <li> Makes my teeth feel fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> The motor is quiet and the machine is light weight but it is the worst Waterpik product I have ever used. The unit itself has to be turned on and the water tip has to be in your mouth and then the on/off switch on the handle of the water tip holder has to be turned on, but as the on/off switch is very stiff this is almost impossible to do and while you are trying to do this it is quite easy to press the eject button for the water tip by mistake. It is very, very disappointing to me and this is the third Waterpik product I have had in fifteen years. Based on my experience with this product I would not recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with my new Waterpik Flosser. The last Wateerpik Flosser I had was ten years old, and I knew there had to be something out there that was more modern and efficient. This new model is perfect for me. It was a wise decision for replacement.</li>
            <li> Very good product and price. Quick delivery in south America.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and don&#x27;t know what I would do without it because it really keeps your gums cleaned and implants clean under the gum line and plaque down under my dental Implants.  My hygienist explained that teeth cleaning would be less painful if a Waterpik was used daily, it makes my mouth feel so clean and healthy. I think everyone should use a Waterpik to keep your bacteria levels down to a manageable level so plaque stays down. I use this twice a day once in the morning and once before bedtime. My Waterpik has several water pressure settings.I recommend you start at a lower setting and work your way up to the higher setting and use war water.</li>
            <li> Compact and works great!</li>
            <li> big improvement over earlier models</li>
            <li> Great product. Blasts your mouth clean.</li>
            <li> This water Flosser gets the job done. I can actually say that after 6 months of using it i FINALLY had a good dental check up. Ive always suffered from gum issues and hate flossing so I thought id give this a try. My dentist was so pleased with the results and I left the dentist feeling good for once. The only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars is becauses I find the button to turn on and off the water really annoying to press up/down. I wish that was designed better.</li>
            <li> Much more powerful than my old one, not crazy about the design, hard to get to water container..</li>
            <li> My dentist told me to get a Waterpik, so I did. The on-off switch on the handle is way to hard to move from the hand that you hold it in, so I have to turn that on, put the device in my mouth, and then turn on the main switch. The product is designed to be switch in the reverse sequence. Overall, it&#x27;s pretty cheaply made. But I guess it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Very good! I almost use it after every meal.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say how well it works because it only functioned for about 30 seconds before it stopped.  It was more cumbersome and took up more space than I expected. I sent it back for a refund.</li>
            <li> construction was not good for smooth operation.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using a water flosser. I wish I had owned this years ago. It was recommended by my hygienist. It was expensive, but works great and is portable. I am going to purchase one for a family member for Christmas.</li>
            <li> this is a replacement for the bigger boxy Waterpik I used some years back. My dental hygienist bawled me out and I raced to purchase. Used it yesterday. First impressions. Neat footprint! The device looks nice sitting on mybathroom sink. Powerful settings, too.Even the low end settings send a noticeable stream of water and loosened, removed food particles. This model comes with several different tips for more thorough action on gums, something i need&lt;br /&gt;In summary; a good appliance for home use</li>
            <li> Has two on off switches ( one on the handle), so I thought it was broken, but it was just extra efficient. Love this thing. Cleaning teeth has never been so easy!</li>
            <li> What it knocks out of your teeth is both disgusting and amazing. Even after flossing. It still knocks out food for me.</li>
            <li> It does a better job than a toothbrush.  The  button on the hand piece is diffacult to turn it on.</li>
            <li> Love it. Good purchase</li>
            <li> Really enjoying the Waterpik. I am so happy I followed my sister&#x27;s recommendation!</li>
            <li> My first waterpik so I don&#x27;t know what to compare it to, but it works great and is not as big and bulky as it appears in the picture.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This product works great. It does exactly what its suppose to do.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Really works well and easy to keep clean</li>
            <li> Great product does all that it promises. The key is to make sure the pressure isn&#x27;t set too high. Setting one is enough for me to get the job done. My first try it was at 2 which was too high causing my gums to bleed. Putting it on one made it more effective and practical to work with.</li>
            <li> The product is very easy to use, very fast delivery!</li>
            <li> works just great.  attractive looking and  effective- teeth never felt cleaner!  a must buy.</li>
            <li> Powerful water spray cleans very well. Takes a little getting used to if you never used a water pick before. If you use on #9-10 &amp; don&#x27;t hold the wand tightly it will spray all over your bathroom.</li>
            <li> Works well lots of attachments</li>
            <li> received quickly. Love it, works great and no problems so far</li>
            <li> Faulty, shipping costs are prohibitive to return to Amazon.</li>
            <li> After my husbands bad dental check up, I bought this for him for Christmas. The next check up was great so it was worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> works very well but a little loud</li>
            <li> Works well.&lt;br /&gt;Better design model to previous version.&lt;br /&gt;Seems to be working fine after 3 months.</li>
            <li> A little on the noisy side. I wish it was less clunky to operate.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend it</li>
            <li> This has been a game changer for me.  I&#x27;ve always had gums too sensitive for regular flossing, but this makes it fun and easy.  It&#x27;s actually enjoyable and my gums don&#x27;t bleed anymore.</li>
            <li> The waterpik works great instead of flossing.  I think it does a better&lt;br /&gt;job of keeping your teeth clean.</li>
            <li> The best thing I have ever done for my dental hygiene. The delivery time was great!</li>
            <li> We use this everyday and are pleased with the results and quality.</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected. Easy to use. Easier to clean.</li>
            <li> Gets between the hard to reach area.Great product to own.</li>
            <li> One prob is it cannot be used in Asia due to the voltage</li>
            <li> Well, there are both good and lousy things about it.  Most of it has been discussed here, like the placement of the on/off on the handle too close to the water pic remover button.  Small water container.  I&#x27;ll keep trying to get used to it.</li>
            <li> I own a Waterpik for a while now and my mom was very curious about getting one herself. I absolutely love mine and feel I cannot live without it. So, I figured this would be a really great present and it was. She loves this Waterpik and also feels that she could never be without one ever again. Hers and my teeth feel cleaner than they ever have before. I even did a few tests to see the difference between taditional flossers and the pik. I would use the flosser to get out any food debris and then take the Waterpik and run it between all my teeth and there was always so many food particles still left in there - I just couldn&#x27;t beleive it. I love the adjustability of the flow. I turned the flow way down after I had to have oral surgery and boy did it help!!</li>
            <li> I purchased the Waterpik WP-660 on the recommendation of my dental hygienist after she expressed some concerns with my gum health during my previous dental checkup.  I&#x27;ve been using it about 3 times per week for the last 6 months and just returned from another check-up today.  The hygienist and dentist both agreed that my gum health is substantially improved.  I&#x27;ve also experienced fewer instances of bad breath since starting with the Waterpik.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the unit itself, the quality is adequate considering the price.  I would prefer to have about another 5 inches or so on the hose between the base and the nozzle, and I would prefer an option for a tip with a sharper angle.  These minor criticisms are easily ignored when weighed against my improved dental health.</li>
            <li> fast shipping, great product</li>
            <li> THe on-off switch is very difficult to turn. I have to use a towel to help push. sometimes that does not work</li>
            <li> I had some areas where my gum tissue wasn&#x27;t tight enough around my teeth, and using this tightened things up beautifully within 3 months between visits. No need for treatment because I have great maintenance with Waterpik.</li>
            <li> The device is a bit loud but I don&#x27;t think much can be done since it does have to pressurize the water into micro bursts. I&#x27;m very impressed with the cleaning ability of the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually floss daily and can find a bit of tartar buildup even after brushing, especially when I feel it on my teeth and tongue. I used the waterpik this afternoon after receiving the device and then brushed my teeth afterwards. I then used string floss to check my teeth. Nothing; no smells, no debris.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really impressed with the device and it&#x27;s much quicker and easier than string floss with better results. Recommended.</li>
            <li> Love this! Got my wisdom&#x27;s removed (pain) and I couldn&#x27;t clean the holes that food went into I used this and everything came out! Sounds gross but this thing is great. Its loud and drips a little but its great for a healthy mouth</li>
            <li> Cleans just fine but the off/on switch on the wand is really realy realy hard to switch. The other switch that releases the little spray tip is in a position where it is easy to accidently switch and release the tip while using it.. That should be the one that&#x27;s hard to switch.</li>
            <li> Satisfied.  Met my expectations.</li>
            <li> It was time to replace my Waterpik from 1997. I don&#x27;t see the need for all the different tips.</li>
            <li> Seems to work ok and achieves the desired outcome, I just hope it lasts long than it&#x27;s predeccessor.</li>
            <li> Average product could bought the same thing at Target and saved the shipping costs</li>
            <li> Small footprint is great; just a bit noisey.</li>
            <li> Works really well. Wish I would have gotten one a long time ago.</li>
            <li> just what dentist recommended</li>
            <li> Everyone needs a water flosser!</li>
            <li> It does the job.  Would get five stars if the reservoir were bigger.</li>
            <li> It worked great---for about 20 times. Call me weird, but I like my products to last longer than that when I&#x27;ve paid this much. Really? 20 flosses?</li>
            <li> Good size for small spaces, we don&#x27;t have a lot of room and I was concerned when ordering it. I was pleasantly surprised - clean and petite design It works great a bit noisy but I don&#x27;t have prior reference using another water floser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the following for my cousin. She is also loving it. However it cost a little more.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00H28S5GE?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;camp&#x3D;213733&amp;creative&#x3D;393185&amp;creativeASIN&#x3D;B00H28S5GE&amp;linkCode&#x3D;shr&amp;tag&#x3D;civcikdx-20</li>
            <li> This will be a great way to keep braces sparkling and clean.</li>
            <li> very  quiet  compared to  2 year old  other</li>
            <li> I have regular damon orthodontic braces.  This flosser does a fantastic job of the unenviable task of dislodging food from my grill. I use it at least twice a day at the lowest pressure setting, and it really helps keep my teeth very clean. Probably cleaner than before I had the braces! Life saver, 100% recommended.</li>
            <li> Ideal.  Having several  power settings  makes it for me.</li>
            <li> This is already broken, will not power on. 90 days old and cannot return. Expensive for this to happen</li>
            <li> This is my first Waterpik.  So I cannot complain about the weight difference between this and previous products.  For me the weight is fine.  Many others have complained about the hidden water markings on the side of the plastic bowl.  I know how much water I want to use.  It is not an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does take a week or two to get comfortable with this product.  I say stay with it and you will do fine.  Before you know it it will start to feel natural.  This product provides more than enough pressure to do the job.  It doesn&#x27;t prevent all plaque from forming and you should definitely not stop flossing.  This product supports existing good preventative maintenance.  I goto the dentist four times a year because I have a plaque factory in my mouth.  I also believe good dentistry is heart smart.  Having said that I always do a great job flossing.  With this product I will now go to the dentist three times a year.  That is a great return on my investment.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Seems to do the job, even after brushing.</li>
            <li> Works great!  I think it saved a tooth from gum disease.</li>
            <li> Great machine for cleaning teeth</li>
            <li> i love it. my mouth feel rejuvanated every time i use it</li>
            <li> The Waterpik Aquarius Professional Water Flosser works very well. It would be hard to describe all the positive features but it works as advertised.</li>
            <li> This is a great tool for good cleaning.  It has various setting and very easy to use.  It is also a good size to just keep on your bathroom sink.  Works as expected.</li>
            <li> As good as my former waterpik flosser and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I ever lived without this, I love it.</li>
            <li> It is amazing! After using it for a few  months, I had my best checkup ever. I even stopped flossing and beating up my gums. I recommend using a few ounces of Listerine and hydrogen peroxide with 10 oz of warm water to kill the bacteria that make up plaque.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful (except the $11 price decrease).</li>
            <li> On/0ff switch hasn&#x27;t worked since delivery.  Unfortunately, packaging had been disposed of prior to first use.</li>
            <li> Item work really well, but pretty noisy</li>
            <li> solid product I use it everyday works great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one before and really like it.  Works great.</li>
            <li> the on/off button on the handle is very difficult to move.  the massage option is relatively pointless but the floss option works well.</li>
            <li> it works well.  I use it on full power and seems to do at least as good a job as flossing.  I have tried the other tips that come with it, but the standard tip is what I choose to use every time.</li>
            <li> If you have braces do not live without this</li>
            <li> It is the original and works fine</li>
            <li> this I give a 5 star rating</li>
            <li> Perfect for our needs.  Nicely packaged, arrived as promised.  Good experience</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I bought this knowing the build wouldn&#x27;t be quite as sturdy, but liking the more streamlined size and look for my small bathroom. It does the job, and is MUCH quieter than my old original one which sounds like its trying to achieve lift-off, but I wonder how long it&#x27;s going to hold up. My only real complaint is the tip doesn&#x27;t want to stay in at first.  I lock it in, give it a little tug to make sure it&#x27;s locked, but when I start the device the water pops the tip right out.  Sometimes it takes a few tries to get it to stay in.&lt;br /&gt;The first couple of times I used it, then placed it back on the shelf, water ran out of the handle onto the shelf. The handle retains a little water, and that was resolved by letting it dangle down into the sink while I dry the tip and water reservoir.  No more after-leaks. I won&#x27;t say I love it, but it&#x27;s much easier to use than the old &#x27;tank&#x27; I had and looks a heckuva lot better too.</li>
            <li> I use the strong power, but still can&#x27;t clean my gum line. Not very good for me.</li>
            <li> I like the sleek container and all the different piks that went with it.</li>
            <li> Having used a handheld rechargable Water-Flosser, I much prefer this model.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several Waterpiks over the years, and they all worked as advertised.  This version is no exception.  I&#x27;ve had this one for over 6 months with no problem.  The WP-660 has seven interchangeable nozzles which i guess is a benefit.  I&#x27;ve only used the general use tip.  and if that should wear out, there&#x27;s a replacement included.  There&#x27;s also a tongue cleaner, some brushers, a tip for braces, etc.  I&#x27;ve never used any of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Features that I appreciate: 10-setting pressure control.  I typically use 9 or 10.  Reservoir is for 1min+.  I use warm water and Listerine mix 2 times daily.&lt;br /&gt;Weaknesses: tip eject button is too loose.  a few times a month i shoot the nozzle into the basin by accidentally hitting it.  The water switch to control flow is way too stiff and hard to use when the handle is wet.  They should have reversed the stiffness on these 2 buttons.  This cost 1 star on my rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this does what it claims.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> After my dental implant my dentist recommend this.  Came quickly in a no hassle box which was nice and setup was a breeze.  While I can&#x27;t argue that the Waterpik is easy to use and will/has improved my dental hygiene I find it loud and it rattles my sink counter.  Also, the water on a recommend setting doesn&#x27;t last long at all.  While this was cheap, I feel like there must be a more elegant water flosser out there than this.</li>
            <li> I bought this to avoid any form of gum disease. I love it and am using it twice a day. Good price and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Great machine. Removes food particles from between the teeth and the gums are massaged at the same time. Definitely exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> very good quality and help to keep the tooth clean and smell good!</li>
            <li> Everyone should have one! No more bleeding gums or plaque since I started using this.</li>
            <li> Just as described. Works great! I can&#x27;t just only brush my teeth now I must use the waterpik after.</li>
            <li> Fantastic flosser, i had the larger bulkier version made by waterpik, it was old and needed replacing. Found this one and LOVE it so much more. It&#x27;s smaller than the older model, but the water chamber seems the same size, so I cant complain. It came with a host of attachments, that I am yet to use, I have used the standard flosser, and my teeth feel clean and fantastic. I recommend cleaning out the water chamber every so often with some hydrogen peroxide to avoid mold growing inside the pipe and chamber.</li>
            <li> So much better than the large, unruly old one I had. Nice compact design, more solidly built than the one I previously owned. I also like the choice of two settings. Very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> This mouth health gadget is quite effective and pretty easy to use. We were urged by hygienists to get one of these and have two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still fumble with the switch on the handle and I can&#x27;t help but think that there has to be a design that could cut further down on spatter and water usage.</li>
            <li> I use it every night. Just wish the reservoir was a little bigger.</li>
            <li> I like the flosser a lot because it is pretty in my new ultra bath and it is effective as my dentist said. Downside of course is water around so needs a sink right there but it&#x27;s easy to become adept at working it. My new year&#x27;s intentions included using it regularly so I feel virtuous too.</li>
            <li> The best, from my mouth!</li>
            <li> excellant except for hand held on/off switch hard to operate. easy work around with power button.</li>
            <li> Great unit, great price. Better than my original Hydro-Floss unit.</li>
            <li> I use it for years with the result that, at my age, I still have all my teeth!</li>
            <li> Works great, just what I needed.</li>
            <li> This is awesome! I bought it for my son to use on his braces.  The whole family is actually using it and loving it!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, especially like to the options provided.</li>
            <li> I recommend that before using for the first time , you fill up the reservoir and run it through the system numerous times.  There was a strong chemical taste in the water the 1st 4  or 5  times I used it.  The on/off  switch on the wand is a bit difficult to move so I just leave it in the on position, and use the on/off botton on the base to turn unit off and on.  On the whole, I&#x27;ve enjoyed using this waterpik.  I really like the fact that the reservoir is not only clear but also removable.  I like the color and design of the unit...simple with clean lines.  It doesn&#x27;t standout like a sore thumb if left sitting out on the bathroom counter.  Most importantly, it does a good job at what it was designed to do!</li>
            <li> I have used the previous model from Waterpik for several years and it lasted very well. This new unit is nicer and simpler all around. It keeps my familys teeth very clean along with brushing. It removes all food debris between our teeth which keeps gums healthy!</li>
            <li> There isnt but two spaces to store the waterpiks and a bunch of extras attachments with no place to store them. the pressure is amazing though. I would have rated it higher if it had better storage.</li>
            <li> Works darn good, gets all that junk out from between your teeth and easier than using dental floss but my dentist said you should use both.&lt;br /&gt;This is also good on cats for cleaning their bottoms where those little KlingONs live around their An**, is that considered a nasty word?&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just kidding but it could, heck what else can you say about a tooth squirting thing?&lt;br /&gt;Works really good, just don&#x27;t squirt yourself in the eye,</li>
            <li> not that good,i wasn&#x27;t expect what is really this item,i don&#x27;t recommend</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband.  He really seems to like the unit.  It&#x27;s a lot quieter than the old one we used to have. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> A month in and this thing works.  Was necessitated by a dental bridge, but makes flossing pointless once you are using this.  You are going to feel like Aqualung when you see the things that are falling out of your mouth when you use this.</li>
            <li> Easy for first time waterpik users, easy instructions</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift from my wife and was somewhat apprehensive when I initially used it, but product works well and I prefer this over traditional floss. It took a few tries to get used to operating the machine - I prefer to fill product with room temperature  to lukewarm water when using it. I haven&#x27;t attempted to use anything beyond the flosser attachment, so I&#x27;m not sure how effective the other products are. Product is a bit noisy, especially when trying to use late night, but works well.</li>
            <li> All good and delivered well. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and feels better than using piece of string.</li>
            <li> Will change your life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this unit for about a month now, and it seems to work fine. My experience has been that it is not a true substitute for traditional flossing, even when set in the &amp;#34;floss&amp;#34; mode. That said, it does leave a clean feeling in the mouth! The hose is very stiff and tightly coiled, which makes the device a bit cumbersome to use, particularly when it&#x27;s positioned on the left-hand side of a right-handed person and has to be stretched out a bit. I do agree with the many other reviewers who commented that it feels as if it is made with very cheap materials.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that a water jet could do as well as dental floss.  But this flosser is very good at removing particles from between teeth.  And my dental hygentist reported that my gums have never looked better.</li>
            <li> I was reading quite a few reviews before I decided to go with this model.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had a water flosser before, so I didn&#x27;t know what to expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s always that feeling that you might not be cleaning your teeth well enough, and then you fear that one day you&#x27;ll have to go to the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s actually amazing how this cleans well. I always brush my teeth well, and believe that I&#x27;ve done a good job.&lt;br /&gt;Using the water flosser I&#x27;ve found more than once that I&#x27;ve missed on parts, that I&#x27;m guessing only something like this tool would help with!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s always quite annoying to use a toothpick, just the thought makes you want to avoid using it, but here&#x27;s where the water flosser shines: you can put mild temperature water (I don&#x27;t like it cold) and just go over without pain and almost no effort.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I also use it when I&#x27;ve eaten something that gets stuck between my teeth and refuses to get out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At some point I was thinking of purchasing the hand held one (on batteries). But most reviews voted against it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really not as big as it seems, and I&#x27;m sure it has more power than the hand held.&lt;br /&gt;In short: Great purchase</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very loud and vibrates a lot.  If I don&#x27;t hold the pick upside down water runs all over my hand &amp; arm.  That said, it seems to do a good job so I guess I&#x27;ll learn to hold it upside down &amp; enjoy my clean gums.</li>
            <li> I have just upgraded to the &amp;#34;Professional&amp;#34; Flosser; I have been using waterpik for the past 8 years; I am 78 years of age and just had my annual dental hygiene procedure with excellent gum health and minimal plaque. Ken V.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m &amp;#34;pikkin&#x27; and grinnin.&amp;#34;  My dental hygenist wept when I told her I purchased this product. She&#x27;s an emotional person, I suppose. It appears to be quite effective and is easy to use and one can take the tip off and pretend it&#x27;s a microphone while singing along with the radio and looking in the bathroom mirror.</li>
            <li> I love it. it really cleans deep</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this simple operating model without all the super refinements. I would buy this product again üòä</li>
            <li> The waterpik is perfect to keep teeth super clean.</li>
            <li> Does an excellent job of cleaning and mouth feels so good after using it. Easy to use .. Love it. I needed this to keep plaque in check and it does.</li>
            <li> Got this for my son.  He loves it.  He says it is easy to use and makes his mouth feel really clean.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Teeth and mouth has never felt this clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;somewhat loud motor makes me feel hesitant to use it late at night because of house mates - this is totally understandable but my expectation was a silent stream of water. Maybe just make it clearer in the copy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mixed:&lt;br /&gt;Why include so many heads? Do people really switch through 7 of them? My guess is that it was marginal cost to manufacture and makes people feel better about buying the product because they have more choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your teeth are a lifelong investment, this costs a fraction the cost of a cavity, and makes me feel good too. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it so much I bought another for my partner so she can enjoy it too!</li>
            <li> Water gets in between teeth, clearing out any trapped food. Excellent.</li>
            <li> build is flimsy. the power cord is way short for something that need to keep electricity from water..  the water hose is inflexible and short. nearly too short to be usable.  be sure to start at lower pressure or you will have burns on your gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A disappointing purchase</li>
            <li> This is fantastic. I have wanted one ever since I heard it mentioned in Seinfield! Do not hesitate to buy this (or another waterpik).  My mouth feels substantially cleaner after using it only for a few days.</li>
            <li> It work great for nowüëçüëçüëç</li>
            <li> I love this thing, works fantastic!</li>
            <li> I was in the market for a flosser because I have teeth that are very close together.  I have used every type of floss on the market and have shredded it every time.  This water flosser/massager came with a variety of tips to use, and the &#x27;pick pocket&#x27; does the job of flossing nicely.  You can also use the various brush tips to polish your teeth, and my teeth felt smooth afterwards, just like after a trip to the dentist. I still use floss at least once a week to make sure everything is getting properly flossed, but I&#x27;ve found this Waterpik to do a very thorough job.  ,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This flosser has two settings - floss and massage.  There is also a wide range of water pressure settings, so you can try them out to find out which is most comfortable for you.  The tips switch out easily, and the water reservoir is more than sufficient for 2-3 flossing sessions.  It also has a 30 second timer (it pulses) if you are trying to make sure you do the minimum of brushing/flossing.  It feels so good, however, that I often go past the 30 second mark.</li>
            <li> works better than floss for tight spaces between teeth.</li>
            <li> I have only had this flosser for a couple of days, so I can&#x27;t attest to how well it does its job from a dentist&#x27;s perspective.  From a personal perspective though, it was love at first sight.  So easy to use and it had several different tips so that my husband and daughter can use it as well.  I have struggled with periodontal disease in the past, so I chose the Aquarius over the others because it is specifically designed to focus on gum issues and it has a gum massage setting as well.  I had a Shazaam water flosser before that I would have to clean and empty after each use and it was very hard to drain all the water out and clean it.  It only had one setting as well.  This flosser makes flossing so easy.  I have never been great at dental hygiene in the past-hence the gum disease, so the fact that this flosser makes it so quick and easy to achieve the desired results is a huge deal! It also has a tool for use with braces, getting plaque off if you have crowns and implants, a tool for going deep into the gum pockets, and a regular toothbrush as well.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about the Aquarius.  So glad I got it.  My mouth feels so clean and fresh after I am done and I feel it was well worth the money.  Again, the added gum features are what steered me in this direction.  I will update at my next dental checkup on the progress I am making!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful tool.  My teeth feel much cleaner. My hygienist recommended I get a water pic for my gums and teeth and wow what a difference!  Just brushing and flossing is OK but this is superior oral care.</li>
            <li> works great switch on handle handy</li>
            <li> Water pressure was too weak even at the highest setting</li>
            <li> My dentist says this is better than flossing.</li>
            <li> Easy set up and makes dental care simple.  My son got new braces and this really helps keep the hardware clean.  Whole family now flosses twice a day!</li>
            <li> Works great, but be careful. When I first started using this, I did not know exactly how I was supposed to use it, and I simply opened my mouth, aimed the tip at my teeth, and turned it on. The resulting spray covered the entire bathroom counter, mirror, and even part of the ceiling. Once I realized that you need to close your mouth at least partway around the tip, it worked perfectly. Far easier and more effective than trying to get floss around the permanent retainer behind my bottom teeth. Also, the &amp;#34;massage&amp;#34; function is completely useless. All it does is quickly switch the pump on and off, and since the pump already pulses, there is no need for that. If you did want to massage your gums, the main flossing mode would work better.</li>
            <li> I just thought it was.too loud a vibration.  I called waterpik they claim people wanted it lighter thus the louder vibration.  I&#x27;m not sure why it needed to be lighter unless for travel.</li>
            <li> Hard to turn on and off...not sure if intrinsic problem or just switch on my unit.  Would also be better if electric was swivel ( or on opposite side) due to plug in on my bathroom counter. Overall works well and seems to make my gum line cleaner, which was my reason for buying.</li>
            <li> Noisy, but really works well to clean under my tight fitting bridges.</li>
            <li> I find the &amp;#34;flosser&amp;#34; function to be just great at doing it job.  I can&#x27;t say much about the &amp;#34;massage&amp;#34; function because there is no strength or power to the water that comes out in with no sensation on the gums.  I have found that the &amp;#34;flossing&amp;#34; function does a great &amp;#34;massage&amp;#34; and finish using what remains on my gums.  This is what I use to do with previous Waterpiks that I have used.  But just because I don&#x27;t particularly care for the &amp;#34;massage&amp;#34; function does&#x27;t mean I can&#x27;t give the &amp;#34;Waterpik Aquarius Professional Water Flosser&amp;#34; a 5 star rating.  The design of the &amp;#34;pik&amp;#34; with the &amp;#34;off/on&amp;#34; button is great and the other release button for separating the &amp;#34;pik&amp;#34; form the handle is great also because on just the normal &#x27;Waterpiks&amp;#34; it was more difficult release the &amp;#34;pik&amp;#34; from the handle.  My dentist says that since I have been using a &amp;#34;Waterpik&amp;#34; as part of my oral daily cleansing that I have completely eliminating the gum disease that I had when I firstcame to see her after retiring to Mesa, AZ 14 years ago.  Good Job &amp;#34;WATERPIK&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Works well, good options in attachments and speed.  It has a good power stream.  A couple of things that could be improved as I had an older model that broke.  Only a few attachments fit in the well.  In the old case, all the attachments fit into the lid.  Also the on/off switch is so hard to turn on, I have to turn it on before I start.  I recently had to have a tooth extracted and a bridge put in.  All kinds of food gets stuck in there and this gets it all out and massages the gum.</li>
            <li> Pretty noisy, but apparently they all are. On max setting if you slide it to off it labours the motor to the extent that it sounds like it&#x27;s going to stall... but supposedly that&#x27;s what it was designed to do..! Good otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;We have 240V/50Hz power, so I run it on a 240V to 120V step down transformer. It runs fine on that. I opened up the bottom and checked inside - it has a 120V DC motor, which is driven almost directly off the full-bridge rectifier, so it is definitely not compatible with 240V power sources (for those wondering). That said it only draws 13W according to the label, so you should be ok to run it off most &#x27;shaver only&#x27; sockets found in a lot of bathrooms (I claim no responsibility for anything going wrong of course &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally post reviews here, but this water flosser thing deserves some review. It works really well, and I&#x27;ve been using it occasionally. It&#x27;s great if you have braces or had your braces taken off and have that little wire behind your teeth that makes it really annoying to use string floss to clean your teeth. This water flosser fixes that problem entirely, and after a few uses, my teeth were as clean or cleaner than the last time I went to get my teeth professionally cleaned. One minor issue that I could add is that it is a little loud under high pressure, but that&#x27;s not really a bother, although if you&#x27;re living with someone who is asleep and the walls are thin, it could wake them up. But other than that, it works great at cleaning your teeth, and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this water pick appliance. Lots of tips for various purposes. Just missing a case or covered holder on the unit to store them till needed. Maybe I received a unit with a missing part??? would be 5 stars if something provided to keep the other tips sanitary and out of the way.</li>
            <li> A gift for my wife! She loves it! She uses it 4 to 5 times a day. What a great smile she has!</li>
            <li> Love it.  I have large hands which make flossing difficult.  This Waterpik does a great job of removing stubborn food particles.  I bought three more as presents for family members.</li>
            <li> My second Waterpik.  Love this one--a newer model.  Keeps my mouth healthier and breath fresher!</li>
            <li> Using for a few days good cleaning and good design.</li>
            <li> 1st one I received stop working after 1st use. Called Waterpic and they sent out a new one immediately. Response was great but they do not work on weekends.&lt;br /&gt;Since getting the replacement it has worked well. Would have gotten 4 stars if not for the bad unit</li>
            <li> Very good .is helping  my dental health.!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is my fourth Waterpik, so obviously I like the concept. My last one was of the basic model and was accidentally broken. This model has a lot of bells and whistles, most of which I could not care any less. I also found that, if you are not careful with your hand when using it, it is very easy to mistakenly release the tip and become unintentionally sprayed with water. Otherwise, it does a good job but given the choice I would go back to the basic model</li>
            <li> Works as advertised.  I have an issue that I can&#x27;t look at where I want the water stream, because it will splash all over the place.  You have to feel where you want to spray with your mouth partially closed.  Other than that, it does a good job.</li>
            <li> Nice and compact. Doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space and works as good as our last one that was twice as big.</li>
            <li> It works great, like it.</li>
            <li> Very portable and comfortable to use.  The machine is pretty quiet comparedcto others, I have used.  Very satisfied</li>
            <li> Great for its purpose. Can be a bit messy but worth it.</li>
            <li> Plugged into 230v electrical outlet in New Zealand and damaged the unit. Notification should be at a visible place of the item when sold to a overseas customer.</li>
            <li> Purchased for daughter. Good product</li>
            <li> Use it all the time. Does the job.</li>
            <li> Just like getting my teeth cleaned at the dentist every time I use it.  VERY satisfied with my purchase.</li>
