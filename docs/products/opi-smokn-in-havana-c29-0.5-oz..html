            <li> Best color opi ever made.&lt;br /&gt;To bad they don&#x27;t make it any more.&lt;br /&gt;Goes with anything...not to dark but not light. Soft red copper with shine</li>
            <li> and expected OPI quality. I had a pedicure done and immediately ordered this online so I could refresh my toes in between the salon.</li>
            <li> This is not the original color</li>
            <li> My nail tech started using it several years ago and I started purchasing it to take with me if I was out of town.  It is a color I can wear with any color of clothing.  I receive compliments and I am told they had not seen this color before.  I am very sad to learn that it has been discontinued.</li>
            <li> A great color. I love it.</li>
            <li> Very pretty color..especially on darker skin tones! Perfect for the summer..you cant go wrong with OPI! Professional, high quality polish. Fast shipping with this company..arrived 1 day earlier than estimated..impressed!</li>
            <li> Order arrived in a timely manner and color was exactly as I remember it.  I have looked for this color before and was always told it was no longer available.  The shipping charge for the product was a bit outrageous but I assume that comes with the territory when you find something you thought was not obtainable.</li>
