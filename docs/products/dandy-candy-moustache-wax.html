    <ol>
            <li>this is the best mustache wax I have ever used......</li>
            <li>I had been using Clubman and for me Clubman is the best of the two.</li>

            <li>Keep up the good work</li>

            <li>I works great, it smells great, and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>It smells good, but as soon as you reheat it to make the wax all super awesome and usable again the smell dies.</li>

            <li>This wax comes in an awesome sliding tin designed to fit nicely into your pocket, which will also allow for the product to be warm and pliable.</li>

            <li>Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>Works awesome, it&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>This product is great, it holds all day and is easy to shape.</li>
            <li>But the hold is amazing.</li>
            <li>Some how the mustache league sensed my amazingly curled mustache.</li>
            <li>(yes, I know you have to warm it up)</li>
            <li>but you just warm it up in your fingers after scraping it out with your fingernail.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice not putting chemicals on your face</li>
            <li>I have to use a paper clip or something else handy to scoop the wax out.</li>
            <li>It has a nice scent.</li>
            <li>the smell is nice and it will do the job....</li>
            <li>He keeps it in his pocket for a bit to warm the wax up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve hit up the expencive, popular and hipster brands.</li>
            <li>Product has nice aroma and does not have the stiffness of some waxes.  </li>
            <li>nice bay rum fragrance.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>After being in my pocket for awhile it is easier to use because when warm, it is softer.</li>
            <li>Kids love a moustache good curl</li>
            <li>Need to warm it with blow dryer.  </li>
            <li>This wax smells great and holds pretty good.</li>
            <li>Great clean ingredients.</li>
            <li>But the hold is good and it is easy to work with</li>
            <li>Price is good, easy to slip in your pocket.</li>
            <li>Best mustache wax we&#x27;ve found so far in our 2 yrs&#x27; search!</li>
            <li>husband used this with great success on his &#x27;tach</li>
            <li>The more you warm it up the easier</li>
            <li>Delivers a good quality all day hold, smells good, and is very pliable and workable when applying.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>ALSO, make sure you get VERY FINE shavings.</li>
            <li>smells very light, no odor that lasts longer than an hour.</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s nice and easy.</li>
            <li>Dandy Candy people I contacted by email where quite pleasant, answered my questions fast and courteously and were quite helpful.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant odor that will stick around right under your nose.</li>
            <li>I love the smell</li>
            <li>and I love the product.</li>
            <li>This is not my favorite.</li>
            <li>By then, more is worked into my skin than in my &#x27;stache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>but for me i need more tack ...</li>
            <li>I have received many compliments on the stache since I have been using the wax.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>(though I am a relative newcomer)  It is, however, the best I&#x27;ve tried yet.  </li>
            <li>I used Bounders and firehouse and seemed to like those product more so.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll buy more as soon as I need it.</li>
            <li>best possible product for the price.</li>
            <li>It takes quite a while to be able to work it into your stache.</li>
            <li>too excellent customer service all kept up to date from the moment it left the U.S of to landing on my door step in England..</li>
            <li>But also love how they don&#x27;t just sell you the products they sell you the life style of a bearded or moustached gentleman..</li>
            <li>I love the smell of the dandy candy</li>
            <li>Lacks the holding power of Firehouse Wacky Tacky or Clubman and the smell may be offputting to some (not me).  </li>
            <li>Simply the best and the slider tin rules!</li>
            <li>Then it goes on better and works OK.</li>
            <li>Holds better than Clubman, but still is pliable to work into hair.</li>
            <li>It takes a bit more doing to get it worked in.</li>
            <li>Ok, I did curl it when It arrived just to see if it held</li>
            <li>Most reviews on the wax were spot on and I will continue using it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It provides a more workable and malleable hold than Clubman&#x27;s Moustache Wax.</li>
            <li>I would not have been able to get in if it weren&#x27;t for the help of Dandy Candy Mustache Wax.</li>
            <li>but better than what I bought at the drug store.</li>
            <li>Satin - All of these products were great, but this stuff really surpasses them.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like that, but it is OK.</li>
            <li>I am sure it is more an issue of operator error than product malfunction.</li>
            <li>most waxes have some sort of conditioning agents in them but since using this with their remover and conditioner</li>
            <li>Applying more to a point gets a bit better hold.</li>
            <li>so thats why I top it with Culbmans wax.</li>
            <li>I use this for shaping it because this handles better then clubmans.</li>
            <li>&quot; If you&#x27;re smearing something right under your nose, it should smell good.</li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant and comforting, and it goes on super smooth.</li>
            <li>Pretty good product over all.</li>
            <li>Pretty good stache wax.</li>
            <li>This product smells great, has a decent hold, and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>My lovely wife was honoring my fantastic handlebar moustache by getting me some of my favorite Colonel Ichabod Conk Mini Moustache Combs.</li>
            <li>Liked that fact that the ingredients were all natural however, the product does not do much of a good job at holding.</li>
            <li>to conclude this is a very cool company making quality stuff.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t pinpoint exactly what it is, but it sure is nice.</li>
            <li>I contacted Petal Pusher Fancies about my experience they were very apologetic, courteous, sincere and helpful.</li>
            <li>and it goes on easy.</li>
            <li>It washes out easily with soap and water.</li>
            <li>Also the slide case makes it easy to use.</li>
            <li>consider myself somewhat of a beginner, and this stuff is easy to work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smell goes away very quickly.</li>
            <li>Wax is easy to work with and forgiving for those novice users.</li>
            <li>they also have a hefty variety of waxes they offer (including vegan and soy free varieties) and if you contact them with concerns, questions, or even ideas they are very receptive, charming, and informative.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like those strong hold mustache wax.</li>
            <li>After using it for a day, I Changed my mind and didn&#x27;t mind the strong smell anymore.</li>
            <li>The smell is strong, and it feels like candle wax.  </li>
            <li>Was worried the scent would be too strong but its not noticiable.</li>
            <li>All organic, smells super masculine, and most importantly it works great.</li>
            <li>so you have to warm it up a bit, but once it&#x27;s applied it stays pretty well.</li>
            <li>Turns out to be not as cool as I had hoped, but that might be more my lack of skill at mustache wrangling than any defiency in this product.  </li>
            <li>Plus the tin is pretty handy.</li>
            <li>The smell is excellent, however application was still a mess.</li>
            <li>easy application, easy to clean off.</li>
            <li>but it certainly keeps the hairs out of my mouth and gives a nice, relaxed swoop shape.  </li>
            <li>Stuff is amazing; not too firm, smells great</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference compared to the combos i tried before it.</li>
            <li>so you know you&#x27;re getting a chemical free product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>And finally, Petal Pushers have really great customer service.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this wax came free with the purchase, or if she just got it on a whim, but it is fantastic.</li>
            <li>After using the cheap ol&#x27; Clubman in a tube, I thought I try something a bit fancier.</li>
            <li>I very much enjoy this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>Scent is light and unobtrusive.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The hold is great, I have 10 months growth virtually untrimmed on my mustache, I use this wax daily on my stache and on the patch under my bottom lip.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does warrant a couple of stars because it is great for keeping the occasional stray hair from curling up and tickling your nose.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have the patience to enjoy this.</li>
            <li>My fiance couldn&#x27;t be more pleased, and we will absolutely be re-ordering.</li>
            <li>Good Wax is hard to find, this is my absolute favorite wax, good texture and hold, excellent sent from the essential oils and very good price compared to other products i have used.</li>
            <li>It works wonderfully as a trainer, it&#x27;s not a strong hold though.</li>
            <li>The packaging is nice because it is relatively flat and fits in the pocket nicely.</li>
            <li>The actual wax is OK, not as good as the &#x27;Lucky Tiger&#x27; brand....</li>
            <li>Original review at 5 stars:  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m not disappointed that I bought it, but I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li>Wax - both the original and Foad</li>
            <li>Keeps the hair out of my food and maintains a clean and groomed appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Clean feel, doesn&#x27;t feel oily on your skin</li>
            <li>I left it on top of my cable box that stays pretty warm and warmed the wax just enought to make it easy to take out and apply.  </li>
            <li>I really like the scent it smells like chai tea and the smell lasts most of the day at that.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a good all day wax and mustache trainer, you should look no further</li>
            <li>To use on his moustache to help train it and so far it seems to be working pretty good.</li>
            <li>Holds well without being stiff, smells great, and is easy to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>they even have vegan ones and other great products.</li>
            <li>And that&#x27;s great, because the scent seems to hang around longer than that of the other waxes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty high up on my list because it smells amazing and is organic.</li>
            <li>Clean fresh scent that dissipates</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a lot of this kind of product and so far, this one wins the prize.</li>
            <li>This wax is very easy to remove from the container and pliable enough to easily work through your mustache.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the Dandy Candy Moustache Wax on a whim as it seemed like it was made with care, IE: organic beeswax, petrochemical free etc, and my fiance was very much into the &amp;#34;old timey&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>To be honest I&#x27;m brand new to mustache styling and this is my first attempt with waxing.</li>
            <li>, however I don&#x27;t see any reason to try anything else since I enjoy Dandy Candy so much!  </li>
            <li>i prefer this blend over the vegan soy free blend, but the soy free is currently in my travel kit :)</li>
            <li>Like sweet success.</li>
            <li>, then [hopefully, if I find the right stuff] reserve the stiffer wax for special occasions and such.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just not my new favorite.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m just not the right person for a cool mustachio look.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great and has a slight cinnamon smell to it.</li>
            <li>Wax blends in nicely, holds very nice, doesn&#x27;t change the color of my dark brown facial hair to a lighter, flakey nappy dread lookin thing.</li>
            <li>It has a nice clean smell which is in no way over powering which seems pretty essential</li>
            <li>My fiance started growing a fantastic handlebar moustache about a year ago, and when he was ready to start training his &#x27;stache</li>
            <li>There may be stiffer holds available, but I am very leary about putting anything petroleum based on my lip and under my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the hold was not as good as I expected.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll make our own next time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not unhappy.</li>
            <li>Dandy Candy gives you a more natural look that you can retwist into shape throughout the day</li>
            <li>I had a neatly folded envelope, with a nicely folded handkerchief with my initials on it, waiting outside of my door.</li>
            <li>Product came in super fast!</li>
            <li>fiance discovered that this wax has a bit harder consistency, which he greatly prefers because he is able to get it to an exact consistency that will hold in various ways.</li>
            <li>It is pretty much odorless, which is fine by me.  </li>
            <li>The hold is just right.</li>
            <li>Now, this is the stuff right here.</li>
            <li>but something wasn&#x27;t right.</li>
            <li>I wish they sold a larger tin, but this one fit great in my pocket, and after making the &amp;#34;lock&amp;#34; dimple in the lid a little deeper it didn&#x27;t want to open on its own in my pocket anymore.</li>
            <li>Stuff is all natural, which considering all the poisons 99% of &amp;#34;health and beauty&amp;#34; companies put in their product, its nice to know I am not huffing (after all, it is directly under my nose all day)  chemicals that are known to the state of California to cause whatever.  </li>
            <li>Took awhile to get comfortable using it correctly but really enjoy the product and use it daily.</li>
            <li>even  after following the advice to keep it stored in a pocket to warm it up, it still wasn&#x27;t very malleable.</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t like the feel very much as my mustache feels like it&#x27;s glued to itself.</li>
            <li>It was good, I just need a little stiffer wax.</li>
            <li>The product has great intentions, however my ordered wax was dry and hard, I softened by rubbing my fingers on it, I tried a warm room, a warm hair dryer, and on and on to no good result, eventually a melted down the wax in a steamed environment and added some Vaseline---not the best option, thought it was at hand, should have chosen different oil, one that may saponify or solidify appropriately--anyways, the final Frankensteined product was more workable and spreads easily, however, not the stiffness and hold I would hope for a growing mustachio.</li>
            <li>A little will go a long way and the hold is excellent, lasts all day.</li>
            <li>This does smell great and does a decent job for just before dinner or romance time with the wife but think I&#x27;m going with something more on the firm side for next turn.</li>
            <li>My fiance prefers it to be a bit thicker, as he&#x27;s got a very unruly whiskers!</li>
            <li>but I think that it would be okay for a short one.</li>
            <li>I fully  intend on getting more in the future.</li>
            <li>In fact, that&#x27;s why I first grew a beard; I kept getting ingrown hair from shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I just received my second tin of this stuff and am quite pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I made it too hot.</li>
            <li>This is a stiffer wax that you need to scrap out of the tin and soften in you fingers first</li>
            <li>First time I&#x27;ve ever purchased moist ache wax, I like the scent</li>
            <li>Mine is pretty unruly</li>
            <li>This works pretty well.</li>
            <li>It is not water soluble, and lasts pretty well.</li>
            <li>It is also better than the various hair-care products I tried before.</li>
            <li>Most of the waxes out there have some type of fragrance in them; this one has rum (actual rum).</li>
            <li>this is my first purchase of mustache wax.</li>
            <li>is my first type of wax</li>
            <li>This was the first wax I tried.  </li>
            <li>This wax is pretty Dank.</li>
            <li>Clubman&#x27;s is oily at first until it dries</li>
            <li>I liked that they used rum instead of sandalwood or some other wood (allergies) as a fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then a friend suggested a handlebar mustache and how when you grow one a league of very mustacheie gentlemen with top hats invite you to secrete private parties if you too have a fancy mustache.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway back to the moustache wax honestly this stuff is great not only do I have a mean long lasting handlebar that would intimidate any a man without one this stuff smells great too.&lt;br /&gt;Put</li>
            <li>First real mustache wax I tried</li>
            <li>When I opened the container, the first thing I thought was that the wax smelled too much like cloves.</li>
            <li>It pretty much behaves as you would expect</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a long mustache for many years.</li>
            <li>Warming/softening it up between my fingers and rubbing it into my mustache is easy enough and a dryer</li>
            <li>Classic tin is nice but impractical: if you keep it in your pocket it collects lint and other grunge on the wax</li>
            <li>It wont hold up very long, especially in the heat, but is good for those stray hairs.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say too much as I&#x27;ve yet to try any other brands, but I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with the Dandy Candy Moustache Wax.  </li>
            <li>but it did not change its texture much.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>Very portable too.</li>
            <li>If I move my mouth around smiling, talking, or chewing (as you can imagine I spend much of my day doing)</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t work very well, unpliable and grippy.</li>
            <li>I really associate with the subtitle of Moustache Trainer as my hair tends toward the shape i intend even on days that I don&#x27;t apply the product.  </li>
            <li>It seems to keep the style you set it to very well, even in the 110 degree heat I&#x27;ve be working in.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t need to use much, I dont do fancy styles or curl the tips.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m still learning how much to use.  </li>
            <li>It holds well, but the effort that goes into making it work with my mustache made me feel like a girl getting ready for prom.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;m just going to stick with straight up gel and get on my way smoking my pipe on my fixie.</li>
            <li>The smell is subtle and pleasant, with an nice lemony aroma that actually goes away after a short while.</li>
            <li>And you can really tell from the texture of the product.</li>
            <li>fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Bought it for my boyfriend, he really likes it, no color added and works well.</li>
            <li>I am still kind of getting the knack for using it, but it is way better than the common one you can get at your local beauty supply store.</li>
            <li>The smell takes getting used to and it doesn&#x27;t dissipate much.</li>
            <li>but it is strong on the verge of off-putting for quite a long time after applying it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does a fair enough job of keeping the occassional rogue in line and my mustache out of my mouth, but fails to keep the ends of my mustache even slightly turned up for more than a couple minutes even after applying a fair amount of wax directly to the ends.</li>
            <li>mid &#x27;13, my original review for that is below.  </li>
            <li>(also, I did have a bit left in my original tin, I scrapped some out and worked it up without issue)   </li>
            <li>The smell is nice and lasts for about three hours, while the hold lasts at least twice that long before I even think about touching it</li>
            <li>good hold, not strong but decent and soft.</li>
            <li>Works well, good hold and subtle scent.</li>
            <li>My criteria were simple: Easy to use, holds well, and natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>It might be a good mustache conditioner, but it&#x27;s not good for mustache sculpting.</li>
            <li>Of the waxes I&#x27;ve tried thus far on my stache journey, this is the first one I&#x27;ve tried that is petroleum jelly-free.</li>
            <li>Natural, no weird chemicals&lt;</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s a little tricky to actually get on your whiskers, it does a good job of keeping hairs put.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried added less, more, tons, etc.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, just a slight hint.</li>
            <li>After ten days of daily use I can say confidently that Dandy Candy doesn&#x27;t work for me at all.</li>
            <li>no seriously it is.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t particularly care for the smell.</li>
            <li>Very soft when going on but didn&#x27;t harden so it doesn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li>To that end, I will be purchasing a tin of their Vegan Soy Free Dandy Candy which is purportedly firmer, in hopes that it will work for me, while also considering other recommended waxes from other companies that may be more suited to my needs.</li>
            <li>So just leaving the military and being able to grow facial hair for the first time without getting yelled at I couldn&#x27;t decide what to grow.</li>
            <li>This wax is very stiff, so you have to warm it up a lot between your fingers before using it.</li>
            <li>Is it a little more work than the softer waxes?</li>
            <li>but Beardbrand Tree Ranger  is a little better.</li>
            <li>You really have to warm it between your fingers and it stays pliable for only a few seconds.</li>
            <li>I really like that it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few others that I believe to just all around work better and smell nicer.</li>
            <li>but the way it sets is much better than the waxes that firm up and are unworkable after.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t hold what I got for more than a few hours</li>
            <li>More cost effective than some of the other products but very hard.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend for those who are new to using mustache wax</li>
            <li>My mustache just hangs over my upper lip right now, and the hair is quite course.</li>
            <li>That being said, this wax seems like it has a pretty decent hold to it, but for my purposes it isn&#x27;t enough.</li>
            <li>after buying my first tin and going through it in a matter of weeks with everyday use, I&#x27;m buying several more to have on hand.</li>
            <li>wax just to tame the unruly hairs and keep them out of my food/drinks/mouth, especially since it&#x27;s so quick and easy to apply</li>
            <li>Not very user friendly, but it is a quality product.</li>
            <li>I purchased my first tin back</li>
            <li>I pulled out my old tin from 2013, and would ya look at that!..</li>
            <li>will be definitely buying more and their other products.</li>
            <li>Overall its great stuff only complaint is the smell</li>
            <li>Dandy Candy is traditional wax that has to be softened first.</li>
            <li>The one major thing missing from most reviews is the type of hair you&#x27;re trying to control.</li>
            <li>like I said, the only reason I&#x27;m not re-ordering right now is I&#x27;m branching out to do more experimenting with a few different brands...</li>
            <li>I feel like I&#x27;d prefer a little bit of a stiffer wax as this can be a bit too soft to really hold that true curl</li>
            <li>It smells ok, but it&#x27;s hard for him to get any of it out to use it.</li>
            <li>Scraping some up yields little strips rather than globs, but once you rub it &#x27;twixt your thumb and forefinger, it softens up enough to spread through your pride and joy without too much trouble.</li>
            <li>only problem is that I keep losing it haha</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really take ten days to figure it out, but I kept wanting to give it the benefit of the doubt.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My stache stays quite soft using.</li>
            <li>Even if this wax didn&#x27;t wow me, I&#x27;m bumping up the stars because of how responsive and helpful the customer service rep was.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s wild and wooly nature.</li>
            <li>If i forget to remove it at the end of the day, the conditioning properties in the wax keep it soft and not gummy like the drug store brands.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking to keep your handlebars fixed for the day, this will do the trick.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s something about the conditioning element in this stuff, so while it holds and shapes, it seems to promote a natural flow to the stache...</li>
            <li>Smells natural.</li>
            <li>folks at Petal Pushers have changed (as of 5-13-13) to a much whiter beeswax which actually disappears when applied to my moustache, not betraying itself to my beard.&lt;br /&gt;Putting</li>
            <li>The wax can easily be scraped out with the back of a fingernail and rubbed down to whatever thick/thinness you&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li>Well made, all natural wax , less expensive than many of the other good waxes.</li>
            <li>It has a subtle scent that is enjoyable.</li>
            <li>The first few times I used it, the smell really bothered me, but I&#x27;ve become accustomed to it now.</li>
            <li>No less then 30 min</li>
            <li>Also, if you are having one of those days where your hair or beard just don&#x27;t want to look tidy, you can pop the bar out of the tin and just slide it across the problem area a few times, then you can just pat it down into place.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Mostly the new batch is missing some oils and other types of wax.  </li>
            <li>BUT...recently the ingredients list on the back of my new tin of wax changed.. and the rum is no longer listed.</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t mind that it doesn&#x27;t hold very well for very long.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anything above about 95 degrees F outside and the hold is gone, but that is pretty standard with all brands I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The hold is moderate to firm and not stiff, and seems to condition the hair more than other brands.</li>
            <li>scent is subtle enough to not be offencive, the scent is does have is refreshing and smells</li>
            <li>It requires some warming before use, but generally I just scrape some off with my fingernails and let it soften in between my thumb and index finger.</li>
            <li>It must be worked with the fingers quite a bit to get it soft enough to put in my mustache.</li>
            <li>only waxes I have tried so far are this and Clubman&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d pay double what they ask, most other similar products cost at least twice as much</li>
            <li>use a wax warmer or something less hot.</li>
            <li>Packaging is cool in the little slide tin and a lot goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Both weaken after a couple hours and will only keep the whiskers in a general shape of what you started with.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I&#x27;m nearing the end of my first tin, I&#x27;ve decided to branch out and try some other wax products that are said to be a bit stiffer, but I expect I&#x27;ll likely be coming back to the Dandy Candy wax in the future.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty firm</li>
            <li>overall softening and smoothing of facial hair in general.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really not stiff enough to hold your moustache in place for very long (especially if it&#x27;s even moderately</li>
    </ol>

            <li> husband used this with great success on his &#x27;tach</li>
            <li> The more you warm it up the easier</li>
            <li> Delivers a good quality all day hold, smells good, and is very pliable and workable when applying.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> ALSO, make sure you get VERY FINE shavings.</li>
            <li> smells very light, no odor that lasts longer than an hour.</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s nice and easy.</li>
            <li> Dandy Candy people I contacted by email where quite pleasant, answered my questions fast and courteously and were quite helpful.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant odor that will stick around right under your nose.</li>
            <li> I love the smell</li>
            <li> and I love the product.</li>
            <li> This is not my favorite.</li>
            <li> By then, more is worked into my skin than in my &#x27;stache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> but for me i need more tack ...</li>
            <li> I have received many compliments on the stache since I have been using the wax.</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> (though I am a relative newcomer)  It is, however, the best I&#x27;ve tried yet.  </li>
            <li> I used Bounders and firehouse and seemed to like those product more so.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll buy more as soon as I need it.</li>
            <li> best possible product for the price.</li>
            <li> It takes quite a while to be able to work it into your stache.</li>
            <li> too excellent customer service all kept up to date from the moment it left the U.S of to landing on my door step in England..</li>
            <li> But also love how they don&#x27;t just sell you the products they sell you the life style of a bearded or moustached gentleman..</li>
            <li> I love the smell of the dandy candy</li>
            <li> Lacks the holding power of Firehouse Wacky Tacky or Clubman and the smell may be offputting to some (not me).  </li>
            <li> Simply the best and the slider tin rules!</li>
            <li> Then it goes on better and works OK.</li>
            <li> Holds better than Clubman, but still is pliable to work into hair.</li>
            <li> It takes a bit more doing to get it worked in.</li>
            <li> Ok, I did curl it when It arrived just to see if it held</li>
            <li> Most reviews on the wax were spot on and I will continue using it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It provides a more workable and malleable hold than Clubman&#x27;s Moustache Wax.</li>
            <li> I would not have been able to get in if it weren&#x27;t for the help of Dandy Candy Mustache Wax.</li>
            <li> but better than what I bought at the drug store.</li>
            <li> Satin - All of these products were great, but this stuff really surpasses them.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like that, but it is OK.</li>
            <li> I am sure it is more an issue of operator error than product malfunction.</li>
            <li> most waxes have some sort of conditioning agents in them but since using this with their remover and conditioner</li>
            <li> Applying more to a point gets a bit better hold.</li>
            <li> so thats why I top it with Culbmans wax.</li>
            <li> I use this for shaping it because this handles better then clubmans.</li>
            <li> &quot; If you&#x27;re smearing something right under your nose, it should smell good.</li>
            <li> The scent is pleasant and comforting, and it goes on super smooth.</li>
            <li> Pretty good product over all.</li>
            <li> Pretty good stache wax.</li>
            <li> This product smells great, has a decent hold, and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> My lovely wife was honoring my fantastic handlebar moustache by getting me some of my favorite Colonel Ichabod Conk Mini Moustache Combs.</li>
            <li> Liked that fact that the ingredients were all natural however, the product does not do much of a good job at holding.</li>
            <li> to conclude this is a very cool company making quality stuff.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t pinpoint exactly what it is, but it sure is nice.</li>
            <li> I contacted Petal Pusher Fancies about my experience they were very apologetic, courteous, sincere and helpful.</li>
            <li> and it goes on easy.</li>
            <li> It washes out easily with soap and water.</li>
            <li> Also the slide case makes it easy to use.</li>
            <li> consider myself somewhat of a beginner, and this stuff is easy to work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smell goes away very quickly.</li>
            <li> Wax is easy to work with and forgiving for those novice users.</li>
            <li> they also have a hefty variety of waxes they offer (including vegan and soy free varieties) and if you contact them with concerns, questions, or even ideas they are very receptive, charming, and informative.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like those strong hold mustache wax.</li>
            <li> After using it for a day, I Changed my mind and didn&#x27;t mind the strong smell anymore.</li>
            <li> The smell is strong, and it feels like candle wax.  </li>
            <li> Was worried the scent would be too strong but its not noticiable.</li>
            <li> All organic, smells super masculine, and most importantly it works great.</li>
            <li> so you have to warm it up a bit, but once it&#x27;s applied it stays pretty well.</li>
            <li> Turns out to be not as cool as I had hoped, but that might be more my lack of skill at mustache wrangling than any defiency in this product.  </li>
            <li> Plus the tin is pretty handy.</li>
            <li> The smell is excellent, however application was still a mess.</li>
            <li> easy application, easy to clean off.</li>
            <li> but it certainly keeps the hairs out of my mouth and gives a nice, relaxed swoop shape.  </li>
            <li> Stuff is amazing; not too firm, smells great</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference compared to the combos i tried before it.</li>
            <li> so you know you&#x27;re getting a chemical free product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> And finally, Petal Pushers have really great customer service.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this wax came free with the purchase, or if she just got it on a whim, but it is fantastic.</li>
            <li> After using the cheap ol&#x27; Clubman in a tube, I thought I try something a bit fancier.</li>
            <li> I very much enjoy this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Scent is light and unobtrusive.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The hold is great, I have 10 months growth virtually untrimmed on my mustache, I use this wax daily on my stache and on the patch under my bottom lip.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does warrant a couple of stars because it is great for keeping the occasional stray hair from curling up and tickling your nose.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the patience to enjoy this.</li>
            <li> My fiance couldn&#x27;t be more pleased, and we will absolutely be re-ordering.</li>
            <li> Good Wax is hard to find, this is my absolute favorite wax, good texture and hold, excellent sent from the essential oils and very good price compared to other products i have used.</li>
            <li> It works wonderfully as a trainer, it&#x27;s not a strong hold though.</li>
            <li> The packaging is nice because it is relatively flat and fits in the pocket nicely.</li>
            <li> The actual wax is OK, not as good as the &#x27;Lucky Tiger&#x27; brand....</li>
            <li> Original review at 5 stars:  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m not disappointed that I bought it, but I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Wax - both the original and Foad</li>
            <li> Keeps the hair out of my food and maintains a clean and groomed appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Clean feel, doesn&#x27;t feel oily on your skin</li>
            <li> I left it on top of my cable box that stays pretty warm and warmed the wax just enought to make it easy to take out and apply.  </li>
            <li> I really like the scent it smells like chai tea and the smell lasts most of the day at that.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a good all day wax and mustache trainer, you should look no further</li>
            <li> To use on his moustache to help train it and so far it seems to be working pretty good.</li>
            <li> Holds well without being stiff, smells great, and is easy to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> they even have vegan ones and other great products.</li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s great, because the scent seems to hang around longer than that of the other waxes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty high up on my list because it smells amazing and is organic.</li>
            <li> Clean fresh scent that dissipates</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a lot of this kind of product and so far, this one wins the prize.</li>
            <li> This wax is very easy to remove from the container and pliable enough to easily work through your mustache.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the Dandy Candy Moustache Wax on a whim as it seemed like it was made with care, IE: organic beeswax, petrochemical free etc, and my fiance was very much into the &amp;#34;old timey&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> To be honest I&#x27;m brand new to mustache styling and this is my first attempt with waxing.</li>
            <li> , however I don&#x27;t see any reason to try anything else since I enjoy Dandy Candy so much!  </li>
            <li> i prefer this blend over the vegan soy free blend, but the soy free is currently in my travel kit :)</li>
            <li> Like sweet success.</li>
            <li> , then [hopefully, if I find the right stuff] reserve the stiffer wax for special occasions and such.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just not my new favorite.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m just not the right person for a cool mustachio look.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great and has a slight cinnamon smell to it.</li>
            <li> Wax blends in nicely, holds very nice, doesn&#x27;t change the color of my dark brown facial hair to a lighter, flakey nappy dread lookin thing.</li>
            <li> It has a nice clean smell which is in no way over powering which seems pretty essential</li>
            <li> My fiance started growing a fantastic handlebar moustache about a year ago, and when he was ready to start training his &#x27;stache</li>
            <li> There may be stiffer holds available, but I am very leary about putting anything petroleum based on my lip and under my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the hold was not as good as I expected.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll make our own next time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not unhappy.</li>
            <li> Dandy Candy gives you a more natural look that you can retwist into shape throughout the day</li>
            <li> I had a neatly folded envelope, with a nicely folded handkerchief with my initials on it, waiting outside of my door.</li>
            <li> Product came in super fast!</li>
            <li> fiance discovered that this wax has a bit harder consistency, which he greatly prefers because he is able to get it to an exact consistency that will hold in various ways.</li>
            <li> It is pretty much odorless, which is fine by me.  </li>
            <li> The hold is just right.</li>
            <li> Now, this is the stuff right here.</li>
            <li> but something wasn&#x27;t right.</li>
            <li> I wish they sold a larger tin, but this one fit great in my pocket, and after making the &amp;#34;lock&amp;#34; dimple in the lid a little deeper it didn&#x27;t want to open on its own in my pocket anymore.</li>
            <li> Stuff is all natural, which considering all the poisons 99% of &amp;#34;health and beauty&amp;#34; companies put in their product, its nice to know I am not huffing (after all, it is directly under my nose all day)  chemicals that are known to the state of California to cause whatever.  </li>
            <li> Took awhile to get comfortable using it correctly but really enjoy the product and use it daily.</li>
            <li> even  after following the advice to keep it stored in a pocket to warm it up, it still wasn&#x27;t very malleable.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t like the feel very much as my mustache feels like it&#x27;s glued to itself.</li>
            <li> It was good, I just need a little stiffer wax.</li>
            <li> The product has great intentions, however my ordered wax was dry and hard, I softened by rubbing my fingers on it, I tried a warm room, a warm hair dryer, and on and on to no good result, eventually a melted down the wax in a steamed environment and added some Vaseline---not the best option, thought it was at hand, should have chosen different oil, one that may saponify or solidify appropriately--anyways, the final Frankensteined product was more workable and spreads easily, however, not the stiffness and hold I would hope for a growing mustachio.</li>
            <li> A little will go a long way and the hold is excellent, lasts all day.</li>
            <li> This does smell great and does a decent job for just before dinner or romance time with the wife but think I&#x27;m going with something more on the firm side for next turn.</li>
            <li> My fiance prefers it to be a bit thicker, as he&#x27;s got a very unruly whiskers!</li>
            <li> but I think that it would be okay for a short one.</li>
            <li> I fully  intend on getting more in the future.</li>
            <li> In fact, that&#x27;s why I first grew a beard; I kept getting ingrown hair from shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I just received my second tin of this stuff and am quite pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I made it too hot.</li>
            <li> This is a stiffer wax that you need to scrap out of the tin and soften in you fingers first</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve ever purchased moist ache wax, I like the scent</li>
            <li> Mine is pretty unruly</li>
            <li> This works pretty well.</li>
            <li> It is not water soluble, and lasts pretty well.</li>
            <li> It is also better than the various hair-care products I tried before.</li>
            <li> Most of the waxes out there have some type of fragrance in them; this one has rum (actual rum).</li>
            <li> this is my first purchase of mustache wax.</li>
            <li> is my first type of wax</li>
            <li> This was the first wax I tried.  </li>
            <li> This wax is pretty Dank.</li>
            <li> Clubman&#x27;s is oily at first until it dries</li>
            <li> I liked that they used rum instead of sandalwood or some other wood (allergies) as a fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then a friend suggested a handlebar mustache and how when you grow one a league of very mustacheie gentlemen with top hats invite you to secrete private parties if you too have a fancy mustache.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway back to the moustache wax honestly this stuff is great not only do I have a mean long lasting handlebar that would intimidate any a man without one this stuff smells great too.&lt;br /&gt;Put</li>
            <li> First real mustache wax I tried</li>
            <li> When I opened the container, the first thing I thought was that the wax smelled too much like cloves.</li>
            <li> It pretty much behaves as you would expect</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a long mustache for many years.</li>
            <li> Warming/softening it up between my fingers and rubbing it into my mustache is easy enough and a dryer</li>
            <li> Classic tin is nice but impractical: if you keep it in your pocket it collects lint and other grunge on the wax</li>
            <li> It wont hold up very long, especially in the heat, but is good for those stray hairs.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say too much as I&#x27;ve yet to try any other brands, but I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with the Dandy Candy Moustache Wax.  </li>
            <li> but it did not change its texture much.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> Very portable too.</li>
            <li> If I move my mouth around smiling, talking, or chewing (as you can imagine I spend much of my day doing)</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work very well, unpliable and grippy.</li>
            <li> I really associate with the subtitle of Moustache Trainer as my hair tends toward the shape i intend even on days that I don&#x27;t apply the product.  </li>
            <li> It seems to keep the style you set it to very well, even in the 110 degree heat I&#x27;ve be working in.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t need to use much, I dont do fancy styles or curl the tips.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m still learning how much to use.  </li>
            <li> It holds well, but the effort that goes into making it work with my mustache made me feel like a girl getting ready for prom.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m just going to stick with straight up gel and get on my way smoking my pipe on my fixie.</li>
            <li> The smell is subtle and pleasant, with an nice lemony aroma that actually goes away after a short while.</li>
            <li> And you can really tell from the texture of the product.</li>
            <li> fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my boyfriend, he really likes it, no color added and works well.</li>
            <li> I am still kind of getting the knack for using it, but it is way better than the common one you can get at your local beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> The smell takes getting used to and it doesn&#x27;t dissipate much.</li>
            <li> but it is strong on the verge of off-putting for quite a long time after applying it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does a fair enough job of keeping the occassional rogue in line and my mustache out of my mouth, but fails to keep the ends of my mustache even slightly turned up for more than a couple minutes even after applying a fair amount of wax directly to the ends.</li>
            <li> mid &#x27;13, my original review for that is below.  </li>
            <li> (also, I did have a bit left in my original tin, I scrapped some out and worked it up without issue)   </li>
            <li> The smell is nice and lasts for about three hours, while the hold lasts at least twice that long before I even think about touching it</li>
            <li> good hold, not strong but decent and soft.</li>
            <li> Works well, good hold and subtle scent.</li>
            <li> My criteria were simple: Easy to use, holds well, and natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> It might be a good mustache conditioner, but it&#x27;s not good for mustache sculpting.</li>
            <li> Of the waxes I&#x27;ve tried thus far on my stache journey, this is the first one I&#x27;ve tried that is petroleum jelly-free.</li>
            <li> Natural, no weird chemicals&lt;</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s a little tricky to actually get on your whiskers, it does a good job of keeping hairs put.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried added less, more, tons, etc.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, just a slight hint.</li>
            <li> After ten days of daily use I can say confidently that Dandy Candy doesn&#x27;t work for me at all.</li>
            <li> no seriously it is.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t particularly care for the smell.</li>
            <li> Very soft when going on but didn&#x27;t harden so it doesn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li> To that end, I will be purchasing a tin of their Vegan Soy Free Dandy Candy which is purportedly firmer, in hopes that it will work for me, while also considering other recommended waxes from other companies that may be more suited to my needs.</li>
            <li> So just leaving the military and being able to grow facial hair for the first time without getting yelled at I couldn&#x27;t decide what to grow.</li>
            <li> This wax is very stiff, so you have to warm it up a lot between your fingers before using it.</li>
            <li> Is it a little more work than the softer waxes?</li>
            <li> but Beardbrand Tree Ranger  is a little better.</li>
            <li> You really have to warm it between your fingers and it stays pliable for only a few seconds.</li>
            <li> I really like that it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few others that I believe to just all around work better and smell nicer.</li>
            <li> but the way it sets is much better than the waxes that firm up and are unworkable after.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t hold what I got for more than a few hours</li>
            <li> More cost effective than some of the other products but very hard.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend for those who are new to using mustache wax</li>
            <li> My mustache just hangs over my upper lip right now, and the hair is quite course.</li>
            <li> That being said, this wax seems like it has a pretty decent hold to it, but for my purposes it isn&#x27;t enough.</li>
            <li> after buying my first tin and going through it in a matter of weeks with everyday use, I&#x27;m buying several more to have on hand.</li>
            <li> wax just to tame the unruly hairs and keep them out of my food/drinks/mouth, especially since it&#x27;s so quick and easy to apply</li>
            <li> Not very user friendly, but it is a quality product.</li>
            <li> I purchased my first tin back</li>
            <li> I pulled out my old tin from 2013, and would ya look at that!..</li>
            <li> will be definitely buying more and their other products.</li>
            <li> Overall its great stuff only complaint is the smell</li>
            <li> Dandy Candy is traditional wax that has to be softened first.</li>
            <li> The one major thing missing from most reviews is the type of hair you&#x27;re trying to control.</li>
            <li> like I said, the only reason I&#x27;m not re-ordering right now is I&#x27;m branching out to do more experimenting with a few different brands...</li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;d prefer a little bit of a stiffer wax as this can be a bit too soft to really hold that true curl</li>
            <li> It smells ok, but it&#x27;s hard for him to get any of it out to use it.</li>
            <li> Scraping some up yields little strips rather than globs, but once you rub it &#x27;twixt your thumb and forefinger, it softens up enough to spread through your pride and joy without too much trouble.</li>
            <li> only problem is that I keep losing it haha</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really take ten days to figure it out, but I kept wanting to give it the benefit of the doubt.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My stache stays quite soft using.</li>
            <li> Even if this wax didn&#x27;t wow me, I&#x27;m bumping up the stars because of how responsive and helpful the customer service rep was.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s wild and wooly nature.</li>
            <li> If i forget to remove it at the end of the day, the conditioning properties in the wax keep it soft and not gummy like the drug store brands.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking to keep your handlebars fixed for the day, this will do the trick.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s something about the conditioning element in this stuff, so while it holds and shapes, it seems to promote a natural flow to the stache...</li>
            <li> Smells natural.</li>
            <li> folks at Petal Pushers have changed (as of 5-13-13) to a much whiter beeswax which actually disappears when applied to my moustache, not betraying itself to my beard.&lt;br /&gt;Putting</li>
            <li> The wax can easily be scraped out with the back of a fingernail and rubbed down to whatever thick/thinness you&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> Well made, all natural wax , less expensive than many of the other good waxes.</li>
            <li> It has a subtle scent that is enjoyable.</li>
            <li> The first few times I used it, the smell really bothered me, but I&#x27;ve become accustomed to it now.</li>
            <li> No less then 30 min</li>
            <li> Also, if you are having one of those days where your hair or beard just don&#x27;t want to look tidy, you can pop the bar out of the tin and just slide it across the problem area a few times, then you can just pat it down into place.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Mostly the new batch is missing some oils and other types of wax.  </li>
            <li> BUT...recently the ingredients list on the back of my new tin of wax changed.. and the rum is no longer listed.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t mind that it doesn&#x27;t hold very well for very long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anything above about 95 degrees F outside and the hold is gone, but that is pretty standard with all brands I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The hold is moderate to firm and not stiff, and seems to condition the hair more than other brands.</li>
            <li> scent is subtle enough to not be offencive, the scent is does have is refreshing and smells</li>
            <li> It requires some warming before use, but generally I just scrape some off with my fingernails and let it soften in between my thumb and index finger.</li>
            <li> It must be worked with the fingers quite a bit to get it soft enough to put in my mustache.</li>
            <li> only waxes I have tried so far are this and Clubman&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d pay double what they ask, most other similar products cost at least twice as much</li>
            <li> use a wax warmer or something less hot.</li>
            <li> Packaging is cool in the little slide tin and a lot goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Both weaken after a couple hours and will only keep the whiskers in a general shape of what you started with.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I&#x27;m nearing the end of my first tin, I&#x27;ve decided to branch out and try some other wax products that are said to be a bit stiffer, but I expect I&#x27;ll likely be coming back to the Dandy Candy wax in the future.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty firm</li>
            <li> overall softening and smoothing of facial hair in general.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really not stiff enough to hold your moustache in place for very long (especially if it&#x27;s even moderately</li>
            <li> Wax is very hard and not user friendly.</li>
            <li> which mean it is not so useful for us, hence the 4 stars</li>
            <li> Even after soaking the tin under hot water, still too hard.  </li>
            <li> A bit hard at first</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Takes practice to figure out how to apply it and is finicky to apply, I have a hard time applying it in consistent amount and distribution from day to day.</li>
            <li> I am an amateur, so I cannot say much to it&#x27;s effectiveness.</li>
            <li> if all you&#x27;ve tried is the clubman wax you really are missing out!</li>
            <li> Will continue to buy as long as possible.</li>
            <li> There is only one way to tame a wild mustache- and its by using Dandy Candy wax/conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to use this as long as I still find it.....</li>
            <li> so long it needs wax.</li>
            <li> The tin also stays closed well until you want to open it.</li>
            <li> Careful with over applying as it will make your moustache white.</li>
            <li> we had a tough time finding the right wax to hold it in place.</li>
            <li> (Clubman goes on very wet and dries to a hard crisp hold)  </li>
            <li> This is like you rubbing your fingers all over your dry hands and maybe some oil is there</li>
            <li> Dries to a dry look and feel (</li>
            <li> wax that can even slightly color a white moustache, as any yellow beeswax base can do, is made even more unwelcome by having a white beard which shows that yellow for everyone to see in quite noticeable</li>
            <li> I like it, but just not strong enough to handle my coarse handlebar.</li>
            <li> Not bad, but expensive.</li>
            <li> If you schmear it on your fingers then schmear enough of it onto your mustache, it will schtick it down.  </li>
            <li> I ended up using it for about a month before writing this review and still have about half a container left.</li>
            <li> but it isnt as strong a hold as i need for my crazy errant hairs...</li>
            <li> (Yea, I tried it) to get that last little bit to even out...</li>
            <li> I would also recommend picking up a Kent 20T 100 mm beard comb or the little tiny Kent mustache comb.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff for a bad shache day.  </li>
            <li> Has an expected medium hold as advertised.</li>
            <li> I would make the the product would be to put it in a round tin instead of a rectangle, and to double or triple the size.</li>
            <li> Not really what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> If control is needed this wax does not really do it for me.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t want a wet looking mustache, either.&lt;br /&gt;Pros;&lt;br</li>
            <li> aside color, the tin is rectangular which I find easier to get the wax from than the round (typically smaller) form.</li>
            <li> Weak hold, can only &amp;#34;guide&amp;#34; your whiskers in a general direction&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I tried curling it different ways and using a few other products to help.</li>
            <li> It worked so abysmally at such a minor task that I find it hard to believe that it could be used by anyone to sculpt a handlebar that lasts any amount of time at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Too sharp.</li>
            <li> This size container of wax usually lasts about 2 months of daily use.</li>
            <li> It not as sticky as other waxes after it sets up.  </li>
            <li> , I doubt you could curl a long heavy stache</li>
            <li> It is not greasy, nor does it crumble in my mustache, like some of the other competing products I tried.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have stated, it does make my mustache appear lighter/more blond.</li>
            <li> but unlike some other products it did not work as well on his beard</li>
            <li> I bought this just to try something other than clubman.</li>
            <li> Also, my whiskers grow out mostly straight and are not particularly course although I have some that insist on growing in the wrong</li>
            <li> Disappointing to say the least, as it was my favorite brand of &#x27;stache wax.   </li>
            <li> Dandy Candy&#x27;s defense, I&#x27;m surprised by complaints about it&#x27;s hardness in the tin as I do not find it at all difficult to scrape out the wax on the back of my thumbnail.</li>
            <li> and it wouldn&#x27;t let you down in a force 10 gale.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t break down as the day progresses.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not going to claim to have tried them all, but after using this one i don&#x27;t use any of the other waxes in my cabinet (there are a few nowadays).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m less than a year into my experiences with a mustache</li>
            <li> I purchased from Petal&#x27;s website because it was slightly cheaper</li>
            <li> It smells slightly of pine or something to that regard.</li>
            <li> lasts about half the day.</li>
            <li> Has a manly musky smell that may get some taking usto for the less manly men.</li>
            <li> Like Ulysses Everett McGill said, \\&quot;The pleasing odor is half the point.\\</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, I prefer Dandy Candy over Clubman&#x27;s because it has a cleaner, less oily feel to it.  </li>
            <li> The cold weather tends to make it act a bit funny</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy or sticky, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to clump up or become a mess of build up in your whiskers.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not a full on walrus-y handlebar, yet.  </li>
            <li> The wax is a bit dry me hard to use.</li>
            <li> This seems annoying at first but actually works out when curling the mustache upwards.</li>
            <li> I recommend it for anyone looking for a little lift in their curls.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1CS3INBN3N14E]]A little video of me reviewing the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> and I can curl up the tips a little</li>
            <li> Very dry and hard.</li>
            <li> So much so, that I wanted to find a way to support them in their efforts despite my disappointing experience.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;DO NOT warm a nearly empty tin on the stove</li>

            <li> I have trouble keeping the lower hairs of my stache in place.</li>
            <li> The hold isn&#x27;t the firmest, I&#x27;d put it at medium to medium firm.</li>
            <li> it dries firm without being stiff.</li>
            <li> No problems other than the product is hard.</li>
            <li> The smell is not easy to get used to.</li>
            <li> The wax is not easy to work.</li>
            <li> the curls slowly fell down.  </li>
            <li> This wax is very hard when its cold, but as soon as you scrape some out and apply it, it has just the right amount of hold.</li>
            <li> It stands up in the heat and with my heavy sweating, but it&#x27;s still difficult to work with initially.  </li>
            <li> I usually curl the end of my mustache up with some gel to hold it in place</li>
            <li> Flavored mustache wax seems weird to me, but I&#x27;m a lady that doesn&#x27;t have facial hair, so what do I know.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I would call this a medium/firm hold.</li>
            <li> I have used both the methods of rolling a small amount between my figures and of using a hairdryer to soften it.</li>
            <li> I suppose I could layer it on very heavily</li>

            <li> After not using the tin for about a month, I pulled it out to find it was hard and cracked.  </li>

            <li> Way too hard, couldn&#x27;t even get it out of the can.</li>
            <li> but it was hard to use.</li>

            <li> it&#x27;s a bit hard.  </li>
            <li> I found this wax to be a bit hard.</li>
            <li> Definately hard.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a hard wax.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a rock hard wax that needs some body heat or hair dryer to soften up.</li>
            <li> the tips begin to droop immediately--and what&#x27;s worse, unevenly.</li>
            <li> This stuff is thick.</li>

            <li> and you won&#x27;t be disappointed old bean..</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not overwhelming, I&#x27;ve had some that I gets irritating after a while.</li>
            <li> The tin case is very small and the pictures describing it are misleading.</li>
            <li> By mid-day, they fall down, making eating difficult.</li>
            <li> The product was very thick, which makes it hard to apply.</li>
            <li> very hard to work with.  </li>
            <li> When its cold, its VERY hard to scrape off, almost like bath soap.</li>
            <li> Maybe I got a bad tin, but this stuff is too hard to get out.  </li>
            <li> thought I&#x27;d give it a shot, sadly I can&#x27;t imagine who this would work for, maybe someone without a moustache???</li>
            <li> even when heated, it&#x27;s difficult to get the wax out of the metal container.</li>
            <li> ill be using this for a while.</li>
            <li> So I knew something had to be wrong with  my stache.</li>
            <li> The wax is difficult to remove from the tin, and does not soften on the fingers when rubbed together</li>
            <li> And if you have hairs that want to grow in the wrong direction neither wax will keep them under control.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid it would lose some of its hold, but it never did.</li>
            <li> This holds the curl in his moustache all day, even in bad weather:</li>
            <li> I like spice muffins, so for me this isn&#x27;t a bad thing except when it clashes with whatever else</li>
            <li> Not that this product does not work or smell bad.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m not at all disappointed and,</li>
            <li> My husband hates it, I hate it.  </li>
            <li> Smells absolutely horrible.  </li>
            <li> The smell is horrible now.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> 1/26/16-  I purchased my first tin back mid &#x27;13, my original review for that is below.  This most recent tin, is about useless.  It has the consistency of candle wax.  (yes, I know you have to warm it up) After not using the tin for about a month, I pulled it out to find it was hard and cracked.  I tried to use it, but it was not happening.  I pulled out my old tin from 2013, and would ya look at that!.. they changed the ingredients.  Mostly the new batch is missing some oils and other types of wax.  Disappointing to say the least, as it was my favorite brand of &#x27;stache wax.   (also, I did have a bit left in my original tin, I scrapped some out and worked it up without issue)   Original review at 5 stars:  Read the title, it says it all.  Stuff is all natural, which considering all the poisons 99% of &amp;#34;health and beauty&amp;#34; companies put in their product, its nice to know I am not huffing (after all, it is directly under my nose all day)  chemicals that are known to the state of California to cause whatever.  Wax blends in nicely, holds very nice, doesn&#x27;t change the color of my dark brown facial hair to a lighter, flakey nappy dread lookin thing. Did I mention it smells great?  Like sweet success.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and I love the product. Packaging is cool in the little slide tin and a lot goes a long way. It&#x27;s pretty firm but you just warm it up in your fingers after scraping it out with your fingernail. It&#x27;s nice not putting chemicals on your face either because it is all organic. Check out the company online... they even have vegan ones and other great products.</li>
            <li> Could not be happier with this product, it works wonders and smells awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only problem is that I keep losing it haha</li>
            <li> Hard as a rock; it was nothing like a wax</li>
            <li> this is the best mustache wax I have ever used...... I&#x27;ll continue to use this as long as I still find it.....</li>
            <li> The wax (Dandy Candy) is too hard. I tried warming it up but it did not change its texture much. I had been using Clubman and for me Clubman is the best of the two. Hope I helped.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m less than a year into my experiences with a mustache so long it needs wax. This is not my favorite. The smell is not easy to get used to. Too medicinal. Too sharp. The wax is not easy to work. Very dry and hard. Can not scoop any off with thumbnail. I have to use a paper clip or something else handy to scoop the wax out. It must be worked with the fingers quite a bit to get it soft enough to put in my mustache. By then, more is worked into my skin than in my &#x27;stache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For now, I&#x27;ll stick with the softer waxes. Stache Bomb is my current favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m not disappointed that I bought it, but I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> My fiance started growing a fantastic handlebar moustache about a year ago, and when he was ready to start training his &#x27;stache we had a tough time finding the right wax to hold it in place. I purchased the Dandy Candy Moustache Wax on a whim as it seemed like it was made with care, IE: organic beeswax, petrochemical free etc, and my fiance was very much into the &amp;#34;old timey&amp;#34; vibe of the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My fiance discovered that this wax has a bit harder consistency, which he greatly prefers because he is able to get it to an exact consistency that will hold in various ways. The wax can easily be scraped out with the back of a fingernail and rubbed down to whatever thick/thinness you&#x27;d like. My fiance prefers it to be a bit thicker, as he&#x27;s got a very unruly whiskers! This holds the curl in his moustache all day, even in bad weather: humidity, wind etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is wonderful, and that&#x27;s important when I&#x27;m the one kissing him! :) It&#x27;s a very light orange/rum scent that is absolutely awesome. This size container of wax usually lasts about 2 months of daily use. I also think it&#x27;s one of the best priced waxes out there for it&#x27;s quality. My fiance couldn&#x27;t be more pleased, and we will absolutely be re-ordering. He&#x27;s already on his 3rd container!</li>
            <li> Works very well. It has a nice scent. It not as sticky as other waxes after it sets up.  Very portable too.</li>
            <li> this is a good product and i dont dislike it...but it isnt as strong a hold as i need for my crazy errant hairs...the smell is nice and it will do the job....but for me i need more tack ...but this is a great product</li>
            <li> Works as intended.  The hold will usually last me a couple hours before needing to be applied again but not a big deal.  I don&#x27;t like those strong hold mustache wax.</li>
            <li> After ten days of daily use I can say confidently that Dandy Candy doesn&#x27;t work for me at all. It didn&#x27;t really take ten days to figure it out, but I kept wanting to give it the benefit of the doubt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does a fair enough job of keeping the occassional rogue in line and my mustache out of my mouth, but fails to keep the ends of my mustache even slightly turned up for more than a couple minutes even after applying a fair amount of wax directly to the ends. If I move my mouth around smiling, talking, or chewing (as you can imagine I spend much of my day doing) the tips begin to droop immediately--and what&#x27;s worse, unevenly. It worked so abysmally at such a minor task that I find it hard to believe that it could be used by anyone to sculpt a handlebar that lasts any amount of time at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Dandy Candy&#x27;s defense, I&#x27;m surprised by complaints about it&#x27;s hardness in the tin as I do not find it at all difficult to scrape out the wax on the back of my thumbnail. Warming/softening it up between my fingers and rubbing it into my mustache is easy enough and a dryer totally unnecessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is a bit of a mixed bag. The smell itself I rather like, but it is strong on the verge of off-putting for quite a long time after applying it. There are no cloves or cinnamon in the wax, but whatever the reason, I would say it smells something like spice muffins. I like spice muffins, so for me this isn&#x27;t a bad thing except when it clashes with whatever else I&#x27;m trying to smell/eat/drink (often).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I contacted Petal Pusher Fancies about my experience they were very apologetic, courteous, sincere and helpful. So much so, that I wanted to find a way to support them in their efforts despite my disappointing experience. To that end, I will be purchasing a tin of their Vegan Soy Free Dandy Candy which is purportedly firmer, in hopes that it will work for me, while also considering other recommended waxes from other companies that may be more suited to my needs.</li>
            <li> This is the first wax Ive tried its wonderful it has a great scent and holds well for my purposes, I doubt you could curl a long heavy stache but I think that it would be okay for a short one. I really like the scent it smells like chai tea and the smell lasts most of the day at that. I also like the fact that they use organic/vegan ingredients so you know you&#x27;re getting a chemical free product.</li>
            <li> Very nice smell, I used it for my mustache.  I left it on top of my cable box that stays pretty warm and warmed the wax just enought to make it easy to take out and apply.  Keeps my stray hairs out of my mouth and my nose.  I usually curl the end of my mustache up with some gel to hold it in place so i decided to try it with the wax.  It worked for about a minute then the curls slowly fell down.  It wont hold up very long, especially in the heat, but is good for those stray hairs.  Pretty good product over all.</li>
            <li> Way too hard, couldn&#x27;t even get it out of the can. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Got this for a pal.  He likes it.  Got it in &amp;#34;chai&amp;#34;, too.  I don&#x27;t know what that does for him.  Flavored mustache wax seems weird to me, but I&#x27;m a lady that doesn&#x27;t have facial hair, so what do I know.</li>
            <li> I just started waxing my mustache.  This product was a great introduction to the process.  This product smells great, has a decent hold, and is easy to use.  I highly recommend for those who are new to using mustache wax and/or for those who are not looking for a ultra-firm hold.</li>
            <li> Recently I began growing and grooming a handlebar stache, so I began looking at wax. My criteria were simple: Easy to use, holds well, and natural ingredients. I settled on Dandy Candy and it totally fits the bill! The scent is pleasant and comforting, and it goes on super smooth. It is not greasy, nor does it crumble in my mustache, like some of the other competing products I tried. The hold is just right. I like it! Great work Petal Pusher Fancies!</li>
            <li> First real mustache wax I tried, I like it a lot. It does it&#x27;s job well and smells good doing it. I have received many compliments on the stache since I have been using the wax. The cold weather tends to make it act a bit funny but in sub-zero temps I don&#x27;t know if any wax would hold up well. I would definately recomend the dandy candy wax.</li>
            <li> awesome stuff. smells awesome! BTW its made with excellence..... no seriously it is. good hold, not strong but decent and soft. love it</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband as a gift. It smells ok, but it&#x27;s hard for him to get any of it out to use it. He has to scrape it out to get any. But overall it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> For me, the hold lasts about an hour. I&#x27;ve tried added less, more, tons, etc. I don&#x27;t particularly care for the smell. The first few times I used it, the smell really bothered me, but I&#x27;ve become accustomed to it now. It&#x27;s not greasy or sticky, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to clump up or become a mess of build up in your whiskers. So there&#x27;s that plus. My stache stays quite soft using. As other reviewers have stated, it does make my mustache appear lighter/more blond. I&#x27;m only recommending this if you don&#x27;t want to deal with build-up and you don&#x27;t mind that it doesn&#x27;t hold very well for very long. I purchased from Petal&#x27;s website because it was slightly cheaper shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: The tin the product comes in is great and fits well in your pocket.  I should mention that I also tried their wicked cookie duster mustache conditioner and quite like it. I left a review for that if you want to search. It&#x27;s fantastic. And finally, Petal Pushers have really great customer service. Even if this wax didn&#x27;t wow me, I&#x27;m bumping up the stars because of how responsive and helpful the customer service rep was.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff for a bad shache day.  Wrangles those unruly hairs into place.  I fully  intend on getting more in the future.</li>
            <li> The one major thing missing from most reviews is the type of hair you&#x27;re trying to control. The best I&#x27;ve seen is &amp;#34;unruly&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My facial hair is very,very curly; it&#x27;s been described as steel wool because it&#x27;s so curly. In fact, that&#x27;s why I first grew a beard; I kept getting ingrown hair from shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently decided to grow the moustache and was hesitant about waxes. I have a lot of allergies; airborne and contact. One of the common complaints about some of the more popular products was the smell and petroleum base. When I found Dandy Candy I visited their website and read up on it. I liked that they used rum instead of sandalwood or some other wood (allergies) as a fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I&#x27;ve said, I have wool for facial hair so this doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;train&amp;#34; my &#x27;Stacey. No sweeping handlebars with curlycues. But it does help to moderate it&#x27;s wild and wooly nature. There may be stiffer holds available, but I am very leary about putting anything petroleum based on my lip and under my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all, a very good product.</li>
            <li> Great product, makes my husbands mustache stick to his desired shape. He keeps it in his pocket for a bit to warm the wax up.</li>
            <li> This wax comes in an awesome sliding tin designed to fit nicely into your pocket, which will also allow for the product to be warm and pliable. It has a nice clean smell which is in no way over powering which seems pretty essential considering it will be under the wearers nose all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband used this with great success on his &#x27;tach but unlike some other products it did not work as well on his beard which mean it is not so useful for us, hence the 4 stars</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work very well, unpliable and grippy.</li>
            <li> My lovely wife was honoring my fantastic handlebar moustache by getting me some of my favorite Colonel Ichabod Conk Mini Moustache Combs. I don&#x27;t know if this wax came free with the purchase, or if she just got it on a whim, but it is fantastic. Holds well without being stiff, smells great, and is easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product I recommend it for anyone looking for a little lift in their curls.</li>
            <li> This wax is very stiff, so you have to warm it up a lot between your fingers before using it. But the hold is good and it is easy to work with and it doesn&#x27;t seem to melt or get tacky like some.</li>
            <li> I use the urban decay eyebrow kit but always run out of the wax before the powder . I ordered this and use it for my eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;It works great !</li>
            <li> It works great, you just warm it up with a hair dryer and it goes on easy. Has no odor or color, just good ole bees wax!</li>
            <li> Liked that fact that the ingredients were all natural however, the product does not do much of a good job at holding. Might just be my hairs.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say this was the longest lasting product on the market. (though I am a relative newcomer)  It is, however, the best I&#x27;ve tried yet.  pleasant minty/herbal odor...low/no flake if worked properly...overall softening and smoothing of facial hair in general.  I really associate with the subtitle of Moustache Trainer as my hair tends toward the shape i intend even on days that I don&#x27;t apply the product.  I recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li> This wax is very easy to remove from the container and pliable enough to easily work through your mustache.  It has a subtle scent that is enjoyable.</li>
            <li> After using the cheap ol&#x27; Clubman in a tube, I thought I try something a bit fancier. Maybe I got a bad tin, but this stuff is too hard to get out.  Can&#x27;t use a finger, I dig it out with my mustache comb.  It is not pliable at all.  Even after soaking the tin under hot water, still too hard.  I&#x27;m sticking to Clubman, that&#x27;s nice and easy.</li>
            <li> Smells like awesomeness!</li>
            <li> This stuff is thick. You really have to warm it between your fingers and it stays pliable for only a few seconds. This seems annoying at first but actually works out when curling the mustache upwards. It smells slightly of pine or something to that regard. I very much enjoy this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Well made, all natural wax , less expensive than many of the other good waxes. Pleasant non obtrusive smell , which fades quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the hold was not as good as I expected.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this wax, like the packaging, but didn&#x27;t seem to hold for me. I used Bounders and firehouse and seemed to like those product more so.</li>
            <li> Smells absolutely horrible.  My husband hates it, I hate it.  He tried it out anyhow and the hold was subpar.  We&#x27;ll make our own next time.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Used as a trainer wax. Has an expected medium hold as advertised. Does not have the dandruff effect. Scent is light and unobtrusive. Good product.</li>
            <li> A bit hard at first so you have to warm it up a bit, but once it&#x27;s applied it stays pretty well.</li>
            <li> Good Wax is hard to find, this is my absolute favorite wax, good texture and hold, excellent sent from the essential oils and very good price compared to other products i have used.</li>
            <li> Stuff is amazing; not too firm, smells great</li>
            <li> I just received my second tin of this stuff and am quite pleased with it. A little will go a long way and the hold is excellent, lasts all day. The smell of the wax is  pleasant , a good smell and not overpowering. If you are looking for a good all day wax and mustache trainer, you should look no further</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1CS3INBN3N14E]]A little video of me reviewing the [[ASIN:B00AZR5IGE Dandy Candy Moustache Wax]] whilst applying it to my moustache, I&#x27;ll give a short lesson in how to apply the wax to your moustache as well as comment on the fragrance and size.</li>
            <li> thought I&#x27;d give it a shot, sadly I can&#x27;t imagine who this would work for, maybe someone without a moustache???</li>
            <li> When I opened the container, the first thing I thought was that the wax smelled too much like cloves. After using it for a day, I Changed my mind and didn&#x27;t mind the strong smell anymore. This wax is very hard when its cold, but as soon as you scrape some out and apply it, it has just the right amount of hold. It seems to keep the style you set it to very well, even in the 110 degree heat I&#x27;ve be working in. I was afraid it would lose some of its hold, but it never did. I&#x27;ll buy more as soon as I need it. I ended up using it for about a month before writing this review and still have about half a container left.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t soften even with the use of a blow drier.  The smell is strong, and it feels like candle wax.  It might be a good mustache conditioner, but it&#x27;s not good for mustache sculpting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve hit up the expencive, popular and hipster brands. I&#x27;ve tried the ones all over instagram and tumblr.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep coming back to the Dandy Candy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is subtle enough to not be offencive, the scent is does have is refreshing and smells clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hold is great, I have 10 months growth virtually untrimmed on my mustache, I use this wax daily on my stache and on the patch under my bottom lip. Keeps the hair out of my food and maintains a clean and groomed appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t need to use much, I dont do fancy styles or curl the tips. Just enough to keep it all tamed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only cons I have had in using this is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anything above about 95 degrees F outside and the hold is gone, but that is pretty standard with all brands I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT warm a nearly empty tin on the stove (Yea, I tried it) to get that last little bit to even out... use a wax warmer or something less hot. I actually managed to &#x27;burn&#x27; the wax and it totally changed the scent cause I made it too hot. Operator error.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my wax of choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ONLY improvment I would make the the product would be to put it in a round tin instead of a rectangle, and to double or triple the size.</li>
            <li> This is a stiffer wax that you need to scrap out of the tin and soften in you fingers first but it hardens and hold all day and is NOT greasy. It washes out easily with soap and water.</li>
            <li> It was good, I just need a little stiffer wax.</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve ever purchased moist ache wax, I like the scent, hold could be a bit stiffer but I&#x27;m still learning how much to use.  Over all I&#x27;m very satisfied with product and service.</li>
            <li> best possible product for the price. I&#x27;d pay double what they ask, most other similar products cost at least twice as much and this stuff is a pleasure to use. smells very light, no odor that lasts longer than an hour. easy application, easy to clean off. lasts about half the day.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great but it was hard to use. It takes quite a while to be able to work it into your stache. It holds well, but the effort that goes into making it work with my mustache made me feel like a girl getting ready for prom. I think I&#x27;m just going to stick with straight up gel and get on my way smoking my pipe on my fixie.</li>
            <li> Want an handlebar? Get a dandy handlebar! Honestly everything about this wax is brilliant but also the company too excellent customer service all kept up to date from the moment it left the U.S of to landing on my door step in England.. But also love how they don&#x27;t just sell you the products they sell you the life style of a bearded or moustached gentleman.. This is if you happen to have gone on their website..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway back to the moustache wax honestly this stuff is great not only do I have a mean long lasting handlebar that would intimidate any a man without one this stuff smells great too.&lt;br /&gt;Put this stuff in your tasche and it wouldn&#x27;t let you down in a force 10 gale. Also you will notice how contitioned your facial hair will feel. i happen to use this on my beard too and yep it feels dandy..Can&#x27;t praise this stuff enough will be definitely buying more and their other products. I&#x27;VE LOOKED NO FURTHER SO SHOULD THE NEXT GENT! Go on wave your gentlemanly cursor on the buy button and you won&#x27;t be disappointed old bean.. COME JOIN THE PROPER GENTS..</li>
            <li> No problems with the delivery etc. the tin arrived on time etc.&lt;br /&gt;I just found the wax too hard to use, almost as hard as a candle. Not really what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> It does a great job holding my stache in place.  If i forget to remove it at the end of the day, the conditioning properties in the wax keep it soft and not gummy like the drug store brands.  I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> It works wonderfully as a trainer, it&#x27;s not a strong hold though. It has a clove scent to it but it&#x27;s not overwhelming, I&#x27;ve had some that I gets irritating after a while. Will definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> This wax is firm.  It worked well in the California heat, but back on the cooler east coast it&#x27;s a bit hard.  It also is white, so it lightens my mustache when applied.  Not tacky like Firehouse brand, this one is closer to paraffin than beeswax.  I love the smell of the dandy candy, it&#x27;s the best smelling wax I&#x27;ve used.  It stands up in the heat and with my heavy sweating, but it&#x27;s still difficult to work with initially.  If I didn&#x27;t need to heat it up to use, it&#x27;d be 5 stars.  It&#x27;s pretty high up on my list because it smells amazing and is organic.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great and has a slight cinnamon smell to it. Also the slide case makes it easy to use.</li>
            <li> Lacks the holding power of Firehouse Wacky Tacky or Clubman and the smell may be offputting to some (not me).  I like it, but just not strong enough to handle my coarse handlebar.</li>
            <li> Love this wax!  Holds my stach great!  Will continue to buy as long as possible.</li>
            <li> Simply the best and the slider tin rules! Smells awesome, earth and spices as opposed to minty or chemical-y (not a word... but you know what I mean)</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time.  Product has nice aroma and does not have the stiffness of some waxes.  If control is needed this wax does not really do it for me.</li>
            <li> It does not roll up in a ball as the video on line shows, you have to scrape it out with a finger nail and rub it between your finger tips to soften it up. Then it goes on better and works OK. The tin case is very small and the pictures describing it are misleading. It does work to style the mustache. It has a pleasant odor that will stick around right under your nose.</li>
            <li> The actual wax is OK, not as good as the &#x27;Lucky Tiger&#x27; brand....the biggest fault of this product is the container/applicator. This area needs to be re-thought...even when heated, it&#x27;s difficult to get the wax out of the metal container. I think another type of applicator would help ....nice bay rum fragrance.</li>
            <li> It is pretty much odorless, which is fine by me.  It pretty much behaves as you would expect, i.e., it is waxy.  If you schmear it on your fingers then schmear enough of it onto your mustache, it will schtick it down.  Turns out to be not as cool as I had hoped, but that might be more my lack of skill at mustache wrangling than any defiency in this product.  I&#x27;m not unhappy.</li>
            <li> I have tried lots of different moustache waxes over the years. This one is great if you just want to sort of feel like you have a sticky moustache. It&#x27;s really not stiff enough to hold your moustache in place for very long (especially if it&#x27;s even moderately warm).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does warrant a couple of stars because it is great for keeping the occasional stray hair from curling up and tickling your nose. Also, if you are having one of those days where your hair or beard just don&#x27;t want to look tidy, you can pop the bar out of the tin and just slide it across the problem area a few times, then you can just pat it down into place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would try this brand again if they came out with a stiffer formula. The smell is nice and not overpowering. Plus the tin is pretty handy.</li>
            <li> I love this wax it works great!!  BUT...recently the ingredients list on the back of my new tin of wax changed.. and the rum is no longer listed. The smell is horrible now. I loved the original smell it was great. Overall its great stuff only complaint is the smell and..why did they just change the ingredients without warning? Sketchy.</li>
            <li> This wax smells great and holds pretty good. ill be using this for a while.</li>
            <li> I found this wax to be a bit hard. I&#x27;ve tried a few others that I believe to just all around work better and smell nicer. Not that this product does not work or smell bad. I will eventually use it up it&#x27;s just not my new favorite.</li>
            <li> Holds better than Clubman, but still is pliable to work into hair. Has a manly musky smell that may get some taking usto for the less manly men.</li>
            <li> smells great, looks great easy to use and is in my opinion way better than anything else I have tried. the hold could be firmer- but the way it sets is much better than the waxes that firm up and are unworkable after. after buying my first tin and going through it in a matter of weeks with everyday use, I&#x27;m buying several more to have on hand. I wish they sold a larger tin, but this one fit great in my pocket, and after making the &amp;#34;lock&amp;#34; dimple in the lid a little deeper it didn&#x27;t want to open on its own in my pocket anymore. 5stars because they have something great here!</li>
            <li> Definately hard. More cost effective than some of the other products but very hard. No problems other than the product is hard.</li>
            <li> To be honest I&#x27;m brand new to mustache styling and this is my first attempt with waxing. My mustache just hangs over my upper lip right now, and the hair is quite course. That being said, this wax seems like it has a pretty decent hold to it, but for my purposes it isn&#x27;t enough. The smell is subtle and pleasant, with an nice lemony aroma that actually goes away after a short while. It won&#x27;t hold what I got for more than a few hours and I used a bunch. I also don&#x27;t like the feel very much as my mustache feels like it&#x27;s glued to itself. Maybe I&#x27;m just not the right person for a cool mustachio look.</li>
            <li> Now, this is the stuff right here. Of the waxes I&#x27;ve tried thus far on my stache journey, this is the first one I&#x27;ve tried that is petroleum jelly-free. And you can really tell from the texture of the product. It&#x27;s stiffer, \\&quot;drier\\&quot; than the others. Scraping some up yields little strips rather than globs, but once you rub it &#x27;twixt your thumb and forefinger, it softens up enough to spread through your pride and joy without too much trouble. Is it a little more work than the softer waxes? Yes. It takes a bit more doing to get it worked in. But the hold is amazing. If you&#x27;re looking to keep your handlebars fixed for the day, this will do the trick. Almost as awesome as the hold is the scent. Like Ulysses Everett McGill said, \\&quot;The pleasing odor is half the point.\\&quot; If you&#x27;re smearing something right under your nose, it should smell good. This has a scent that is sort of like bay rum, but softer. I can&#x27;t pinpoint exactly what it is, but it sure is nice. And that&#x27;s great, because the scent seems to hang around longer than that of the other waxes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> The product has great intentions, however my ordered wax was dry and hard, I softened by rubbing my fingers on it, I tried a warm room, a warm hair dryer, and on and on to no good result, eventually a melted down the wax in a steamed environment and added some Vaseline---not the best option, thought it was at hand, should have chosen different oil, one that may saponify or solidify appropriately--anyways, the final Frankensteined product was more workable and spreads easily, however, not the stiffness and hold I would hope for a growing mustachio.</li>
            <li> fast shipping. good product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this last year, I think.  Wax is very hard and not user friendly.</li>
            <li> I bought this just to try something other than clubman. I thought I wouldn&#x27;t like the tin but its great. It is tackier and easier to get to than the before mentioned. I wax to keep my &amp;#34;Western foo- man-choo&amp;#34; under control, not to curl it. Ok, I did curl it when It arrived just to see if it held and it does. Also has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a hard wax. I didn&#x27;t know! Smells great and works well!!</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Delivers a good quality all day hold, smells good, and is very pliable and workable when applying.&lt;br /&gt;I consider myself somewhat of a beginner, and this stuff is easy to work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: let it sit in your pocket before applying. When its cold, its VERY hard to scrape off, almost like bath soap. ALSO, make sure you get VERY FINE shavings. If you dig too deep and get a clump, it will not disappear.</li>
            <li> Great clean ingredients. Great smell. You cannot put it in your pocket or it will slide open and get pocket lint all over the goo. Very soft when going on but didn&#x27;t harden so it doesn&#x27;t do much. All the writing will come off shortly after purchase.</li>
            <li> Took awhile to get comfortable using it correctly but really enjoy the product and use it daily. Was worried the scent would be too strong but its not noticiable. Most reviews on the wax were spot on and I will continue using it.</li>
            <li> Hope you like the scent of cloves, because this has it in droves! It&#x27;s a rock hard wax that needs some body heat or hair dryer to soften up. While it&#x27;s a little tricky to actually get on your whiskers, it does a good job of keeping hairs put. I scape off a bit with the back of my thumbnail, then work it between my thumb and index finger. I then blast my fingertips with a hair dryer to liquify. Then I work the molten wax into my mustache, working into place as it congeals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It provides a more workable and malleable hold than Clubman&#x27;s Moustache Wax. (Clubman goes on very wet and dries to a hard crisp hold)  Dandy Candy gives you a more natural look that you can retwist into shape throughout the day (something you can&#x27;t do with Clubman). And it also leaves my mustache feeling cleaner and softer than Clubman.</li>
            <li> So just leaving the military and being able to grow facial hair for the first time without getting yelled at I couldn&#x27;t decide what to grow. Then a friend suggested a handlebar mustache and how when you grow one a league of very mustacheie gentlemen with top hats invite you to secrete private parties if you too have a fancy mustache. So of course I had to grow one. Well I finally got the Lon enough mustache to curl and started curling it but something wasn&#x27;t right. It would hold its shape for a few hours but I wasn&#x27;t getting any fancy invitation to anything. So I knew something had to be wrong with  my stache. I tried curling it different ways and using a few other products to help. Then finally one day I got fed up and almost shaved it off when my girlfriend came bursting in to my manly bathroom in the nick of time with a tin of Dandy Candy Mustache Wax. I decided to give it a shot and if it didn&#x27;t work then I would shave. No less then 30 min I had a neatly folded envelope, with a nicely folded handkerchief with my initials on it, waiting outside of my door. Some how the mustache league sensed my amazingly curled mustache. I would not have been able to get in if it weren&#x27;t for the help of Dandy Candy Mustache Wax.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I would call this a medium/firm hold. Maybe if you don&#x27;t talk a lot or have a smaller mustache but in my case I would apply and be required to reapply within an hour of constant talking. This does smell great and does a decent job for just before dinner or romance time with the wife but think I&#x27;m going with something more on the firm side for next turn.</li>
            <li> Keeps the Stache in place.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my boyfriend, he really likes it, no color added and works well. I love the smell, just a slight hint. Smell goes away very quickly.</li>
            <li> good stuff. pine smell. but not as all day lasting as I had hoped. doesnn&#x27;t add color ot the stache. but better than what I bought at the drug store.</li>
            <li> There is only one way to tame a wild mustache- and its by using Dandy Candy wax/conditioner. I works great, it smells great, and is easy to use.I would also recommend picking up a Kent 20T 100 mm beard comb or the little tiny Kent mustache comb.</li>
            <li> This is a superior product. Just received it yesterday. Now, I&#x27;ve used both the Mustache Wrestler brand and also Foad Wax - both the original and Foad Satin - All of these products were great, but this stuff really surpasses them.  There&#x27;s something about the conditioning element in this stuff, so while it holds and shapes, it seems to promote a natural flow to the stache... Really happy with this Dandy Candy! Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll need to look elsewhere for a while - and YES GREAT PRICING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Petal Pusher Fancies!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ve done a great community service with this one!</li>
            <li> You know how hair wax you can put your finger on it and some comes with you?  Not this.  This is like you rubbing your fingers all over your dry hands and maybe some oil is there but you can&#x27;t see/feel it.  I like the scent though.  I don&#x27;t have the patience to enjoy this. My mustache will forever look like a brillo pad.</li>
            <li> Very Good but Beardbrand Tree Ranger  is a little better.</li>
            <li> All organic, smells super masculine, and most importantly it works great.</li>
            <li> very hard to work with.  The wax is difficult to remove from the tin, and does not soften on the fingers when rubbed together</li>
            <li> I got this wax as a gift for my boyfriend as the reviews were good. The fact that it&#x27;s made from organic products is great but it gets a bit clumpy and even  after following the advice to keep it stored in a pocket to warm it up, it still wasn&#x27;t very malleable. That said, it smells great and with more practice may be a great product - perhaps he just needs more practice!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a long mustache for many years. Mine is pretty unruly so I needed something to control it. This works pretty well. It is not water soluble, and lasts pretty well. I am still kind of getting the knack for using it, but it is way better than the common one you can get at your local beauty supply store. It is also better than the various hair-care products I tried before. Most of the waxes out there have some type of fragrance in them; this one has rum (actual rum). I wasn&#x27;t sure I would like that, but it is OK. The packaging is nice because it is relatively flat and fits in the pocket nicely. After being in my pocket for awhile it is easier to use because when warm, it is softer. The tin also stays closed well until you want to open it. Some good thought went into this.</li>
            <li> This product is great, it holds all day and is easy to shape. It requires some warming before use, but generally I just scrape some off with my fingernails and let it soften in between my thumb and index finger. I&#x27;ve used it for about a year, trying others but always coming back to Dandy Candy</li>
            <li> Best mustache wax we&#x27;ve found so far in our 2 yrs&#x27; search! We keep re-buying it.</li>
            <li> this is my first purchase of mustache wax. I am an amateur, so I cannot say much to it&#x27;s effectiveness. I have trouble keeping the lower hairs of my stache in place. By mid-day, they fall down, making eating difficult. I am sure it is more an issue of operator error than product malfunction. I like the smell, reminiscent of cloves.</li>
            <li> Great scent.  Wish tin was bigger and hold was firmer. Wax is easy to work with and forgiving for those novice users.</li>
            <li> Works well, good hold and subtle scent. The wax is a bit dry me hard to use. Not bad, but expensive.</li>
            <li> Smells good, feels good, looks good!  I like it!!!</li>
            <li> Kids love a moustache good curl</li>
            <li> Product came in super fast! Ordered on June 11 and it came in the next day!! My boyfriend tried it out today and loves it. Would recommend. Great price, fast shipping, and great product!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say too much as I&#x27;ve yet to try any other brands, but I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with the Dandy Candy Moustache Wax.  I feel like I&#x27;d prefer a little bit of a stiffer wax as this can be a bit too soft to really hold that true curl you see the pros wear but it certainly keeps the hairs out of my mouth and gives a nice, relaxed swoop shape.  I&#x27;ve found myself using this stuff over the lip and then sort of supplementing the hold on the suspended curls with some Got2B Glued hair glue improve the upward curl a bit and that works decently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;m nearing the end of my first tin, I&#x27;ve decided to branch out and try some other wax products that are said to be a bit stiffer, but I expect I&#x27;ll likely be coming back to the Dandy Candy wax in the future.  Since this wax is softer, I think I would consider it somewhat of an &amp;#34;everyday&amp;#34; wax just to tame the unruly hairs and keep them out of my food/drinks/mouth, especially since it&#x27;s so quick and easy to apply, then [hopefully, if I find the right stuff] reserve the stiffer wax for special occasions and such.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m not at all disappointed and, like I said, the only reason I&#x27;m not re-ordering right now is I&#x27;m branching out to do more experimenting with a few different brands...gotta see what&#x27;s out there!</li>
            <li> To use on his moustache to help train it and so far it seems to be working pretty good. Would recommend  product!</li>
            <li> A must buy for anyone who wishes to have an excellent wax for an amazing handlebar moustache. It holds all day.</li>
            <li> Does a stache good. No scent and not tacky.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  Smells terrific, I keep it in my pocket everywhere I go to keep it malleable. Doesn&#x27;t take up any space and I get lots of compliments on my stache.&lt;br /&gt;This is my first type of wax do I don&#x27;t have anything to compare to, I picked it since it was the cheapest, however I don&#x27;t see any reason to try anything else since I enjoy Dandy Candy so much!  Keep up the good work</li>
            <li> Pleasant aroma. I don&#x27;t quite like the way it makes my mustache feel. The more you warm it up the easier it is to use.</li>
            <li> This was the first wax I tried.  Very nice aroma.  Need to warm it with blow dryer.  Not very user friendly, but it is a quality product.</li>
            <li> if all you&#x27;ve tried is the clubman wax you really are missing out! there are a lot of moustache waxes out there. i&#x27;m not going to claim to have tried them all, but after using this one i don&#x27;t use any of the other waxes in my cabinet (there are a few nowadays). this stuff smells great. i don&#x27;t feel like my hair is glued to my face. it doesn&#x27;t break down as the day progresses. it dries firm without being stiff. most waxes have some sort of conditioning agents in them but since using this with their remover and conditioner i&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference compared to the combos i tried before it. they also have a hefty variety of waxes they offer (including vegan and soy free varieties) and if you contact them with concerns, questions, or even ideas they are very receptive, charming, and informative. i prefer this blend over the vegan soy free blend, but the soy free is currently in my travel kit :)&lt;br /&gt; so to conclude this is a very cool company making quality stuff. if you&#x27;re considering giving them a shot, i say please do!</li>
            <li> Pretty good stache wax. Provides a great hold and the smell is okay. Smells natural.</li>
            <li> This moustache wax is good at making my moustache feel softer and keep neat. I really like that it&#x27;s all natural. The hold isn&#x27;t the firmest, I&#x27;d put it at medium to medium firm. The smell takes getting used to and it doesn&#x27;t dissipate much. It smell like beeswax and herbs, but I wouldn&#x27;t called it pleasant. Applying more to a point gets a bit better hold. Careful with over applying as it will make your moustache white.</li>
            <li> The product was very thick, which makes it hard to apply.</li>
            <li> The smell is excellent, however application was still a mess.</li>
            <li> This wax is pretty Dank. It smells good, but as soon as you reheat it to make the wax all super awesome and usable again the smell dies. Also I wish this was was stronger. This doesn&#x27;t hold up well in humidity so thats why I top it with Culbmans wax. I use this for shaping it because this handles better then clubmans. Just wish it was stronger hold.</li>
            <li> This is the second tin I&#x27;ve bought, and definitely like both how it holds and smells compared to others.</li>
            <li> What can you say about mustache wax?  It works!  None of the local stores carry it around here. Price is good, easy to slip in your pocket.</li>
            <li> (Note: I am using this as I grow out what will eventually be a handlebar. My mustache comes just to the middle of my lower lip and I can curl up the tips a little but it&#x27;s not a full on walrus-y handlebar, yet.  Also, my whiskers grow out mostly straight and are not particularly course although I have some that insist on growing in the wrong direction)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only waxes I have tried so far are this and Clubman&#x27;s.  Clubman&#x27;s is easier to apply because it comes in a tube and is already pliable.  Dandy Candy is traditional wax that has to be softened first. I have used both the methods of rolling a small amount between my figures and of using a hairdryer to soften it. I prefer using my fingers.  Either way it is still more difficult to distribute the wax evenly throughout my mustache than with the Clubman&#x27;s.  HOWEVER, I prefer Dandy Candy over Clubman&#x27;s because it has a cleaner, less oily feel to it.  Clubman&#x27;s is oily at first until it dries but I don&#x27;t like the feel of it if I get it on my skin under my nose.  Both seem to have about the same amount of hold, which is not enough in my opinion.  Both weaken after a couple hours and will only keep the whiskers in a general shape of what you started with.  And if you have hairs that want to grow in the wrong direction neither wax will keep them under control.  I suppose I could layer it on very heavily but I don&#x27;t want a wet looking mustache, either.&lt;br /&gt;Pros;&lt;br /&gt;- Dries to a dry look and feel (Pro or con depending on your desire)&lt;br /&gt;- Clean fresh scent that dissipates quickly&lt;br /&gt;- Clean feel, doesn&#x27;t feel oily on your skin&lt;br /&gt;- Natural, no weird chemicals&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Weak hold, can only &amp;#34;guide&amp;#34; your whiskers in a general direction&lt;br /&gt;- Classic tin is nice but impractical: if you keep it in your pocket it collects lint and other grunge on the wax&lt;br /&gt;- Takes practice to figure out how to apply it and is finicky to apply, I have a hard time applying it in consistent amount and distribution from day to day.</li>
            <li> very stiff and hard to apply</li>
            <li> Works awesome, it&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for. Couldn&#x27;t be happier. Use it every day.</li>
            <li> ...for my face at least.&lt;br /&gt;A wax that can even slightly color a white moustache, as any yellow beeswax base can do, is made even more unwelcome by having a white beard which shows that yellow for everyone to see in quite noticeable contrast.&lt;br /&gt;The folks at Petal Pushers have changed (as of 5-13-13) to a much whiter beeswax which actually disappears when applied to my moustache, not betraying itself to my beard.&lt;br /&gt;Putting aside color, the tin is rectangular which I find easier to get the wax from than the round (typically smaller) form. The hold is moderate to firm and not stiff, and seems to condition the hair more than other brands. The smell is nice and lasts for about three hours, while the hold lasts at least twice that long before I even think about touching it up.&lt;br /&gt;The Dandy Candy people I contacted by email where quite pleasant, answered my questions fast and courteously and were quite helpful. I hope they&#x27;re quite successful.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a lot of this kind of product and so far, this one wins the prize.</li>
