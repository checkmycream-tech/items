            <li>I for sure recommend this amazing product, I am a huge fan</li>
            <li>Love this Vitam C Serum</li>
            <li>The serum is very light, absorbs almost immediately and has made a huge difference in the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li>com and not on PETA&#x27;s company list of cruelty free beauty products.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>It feels great on my skin and after a few uses I can tell that it is making a difference in the fine lines on my face.</li>
            <li>love this serum because it makes my skin looks soft!</li>

            <li>I use this under my daily moisturizer and my skin feels smooth and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li>Being an extreme skeptic, I was pretty sure it wouldn&#x27;t have any real effect on my skin, since there are so many products out there promising rejuvenation and few</li>
            <li>This is a huge surprise, because my skin is quite sensitive and usually freaks out a bit at anything other than the most gentle of products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin looks smoother, spots are less noticeable, overall skin just looks better and brighter!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I tried this around my eyes where you get wrinkles at the sides and I definitely like the tightening feeling and it didn&#x27;t take that much product to cover the area. So far so good.</li>
            <li> The great beauty supplies.&lt;br /&gt;I can feel that the skin is healing.</li>
            <li> great quality! good price!!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased to let you know that this product is amazing. I ordered two of them, couple weeks ago. (One was for a birthday gift and the birthday girl is AMAZED with the results, as well as me). I started right away to use it, after 3 weeks of usage I tried another day-night cream combo pack (Optimera or Nerium). which I did not like it. So, I am writing the review after I used this, and tried another ¨miracle¨¨ combo pack creams which by the way are way more expensive. So don&#x27;t waste your money or your time, this is the real deal. I for sure recommend this amazing product, I am a huge fan and I bet you will agree with me, this product will not disappoint you.</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot. It feels great on my skin and after a few uses I can tell that it is making a difference in the fine lines on my face. InstaNatural uses natural ingredients so you don&#x27;t have to worry about the nasty chemicals that a lot of other competitors put in their products. I use this under my daily moisturizer and my skin feels smooth and isn&#x27;t greasy. Give it a try.</li>
            <li> I use the serum all over my face and neck in the morning, under moisturizer with sunscreen. I also apply it to my eyelids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has drastically improved the texture around my eyes, making them feel softer and firmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum has also helped diminish quite a sun damage line on my neck. I do love this product and will continue to use it daily.</li>
            <li> so good.&lt;br /&gt;really recommend itm</li>
            <li> I bought this items and does work in my skin. I working a least 8 hours exposure directly to the sun and i have some dark spot caused for the sun in my face, this product doesn&#x27;t help at all..</li>
            <li> Great product. Have been using it for 2 weeks and my skin doesn&#x27;t look tired and it looks brighter. I also have not had a breakout since I started using it...</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe this product is 100% vegan.  It is not listed as not tested on animals on Goodguide. com and not on PETA&#x27;s company list of cruelty free beauty products.</li>
            <li> Very happy and nice and easy to use pump.</li>
            <li> Love this Vitam C Serum I will reorder soon.</li>
            <li> I received this product as a gift. Being an extreme skeptic, I was pretty sure it wouldn&#x27;t have any real effect on my skin, since there are so many products out there promising rejuvenation and few that deliver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised to discover my skin looked firmer after just a few applications. Used in conjunction with an exfoliation regimen, I am anxious to see what long term use will bring about!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I have now used the product for a number of weeks and can truly say it has made a huge difference in my skin, especially around my eyes! I will be buying this regularly!</li>
            <li> I received this serum as a gift, and since I had been hearing amazing things about it, was very excited to give it a try. The product definitely did not disappoint. The serum is very light, absorbs almost immediately and has made a huge difference in the texture of my skin. My skin looks smoother, spots are less noticeable, overall skin just looks better and brighter!&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit concerned about stinging or irritation, but this serum is very gentle on my skin and I haven&#x27;t had any irritation at all. This is a huge surprise, because my skin is quite sensitive and usually freaks out a bit at anything other than the most gentle of products.&lt;br /&gt;My bottle is about ¾ of the way empty, and I already know I will definitely be ordering another bottle of this stuff!</li>
            <li> Great serum.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using several branded and unbranded serums such as hyaluronic acid one, anti-aging one, anti wrinkile one, etc...&lt;br /&gt;This serum is one of the best one for me.&lt;br /&gt;Light and non-sticky is one of my favorites point of this serum.&lt;br /&gt;I love this serum because it makes my skin looks soft!</li>
            <li> Leaked cosmetics. Disappointed</li>
            <li> When I was got this serum, I can see smudge of serum leaks on the bottle outside.&lt;br /&gt;It looks like some chemical change inside the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;So, I could not use this product at all.</li>
            <li> its thicker than serum, but lighter than cream&lt;br /&gt;nice one to replace my lotion if you have oily skin</li>
            <li> This is awesome because of its convenience.</li>
