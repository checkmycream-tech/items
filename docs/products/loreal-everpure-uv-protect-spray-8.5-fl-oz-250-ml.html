    <ol>
            <li>My hair looks great!  </li>
            <li>This is an awesome product.</li>
            <li>Works great!</li>
            <li>This is the product to use and the price was so incredible that I purchased three bottles.  </li>
            <li>but if it does it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>Great UV hair and scalp protector.</li>
            <li>It smells great.</li>
            <li>this works just great and smells good to boot.</li>
            <li>This product is the most awesome ever made for moisturizing and protecting color treated hair!</li>
            <li>It keeps your hair safe from the sun (which we need here in Texas)&lt;br /&gt;and adds a great scent!</li>
            <li>It also smells so good</li>
            <li>so all is good</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll stick with a good conditioner rather than UV protectant.</li>
            <li>Friends are always asking for a spray because it smells so good.  </li>
            <li>Good price, considering what a lot of companies charge for UV spray for hair.</li>
            <li>It seems to be a fairly unisex smell.</li>
            <li>And not in a good way.  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>I genuinely love this product!  </li>
            <li>Received the above item in great conditions, I am very happy</li>
            <li>Smells nice too.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice too.</li>
            <li>The Rosemary smell is light and pleasant.</li>
            <li>my hair feels soft and smells awesome.</li>
            <li>A nice light sprat to protect hair and scalp in the sun.</li>
            <li>Love the scent.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say for sure it does what it says it does</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I looked on-line and was able to find it that way.</li>
            <li>so I bought 4 more bottles.</li>
            <li>Not at all fair, but worth the price.  </li>
            <li>After having radiation treatments to my scalp, my hair is thinner on top.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a sunscreen since I love spending time outdoors and don&#x27;t always want to wear a hat.  </li>
            <li>Also has healthy ingredients for your hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love the smell but others may not.  </li>
            <li>The spray doesn&#x27;t leave sticky residue and calms flyaway hair for many hours (not truly all day).</li>
            <li>More like a lite hold hairspray.</li>
            <li>I have tried a dozen different UV protectants, and this is the best one.  </li>
            <li>Will continue and perhaps can rate it better in a couple of weeks</li>
            <li>Love love love</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I have started to spray it in my palms and then work it into my hair and that seems to work better for me.</li>
            <li>I will purchase more.</li>
            <li>Moreover, this spray sure doesn&#x27;t smell like any Rosemary or Mint</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny!!  </li>
            <li>A different scent would be nice, but it works and I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li>It seems to work fine with my hair</li>
            <li>Purchased this for Coachella, worked great and smelled even better all day long.</li>
            <li>It makes my color hold on so much longer, and it smells super good.</li>
            <li>Fortunately the smell fades after a while.</li>
            <li>Coats hair in a light mist to control frizz and protect from the elements.</li>
            <li>But if you love this line as much as I do, you will notice that the scarcer it becomes, the more you will be paying for it.  </li>
            <li>So far so good at protecting hair from sun but does NOT smell like rosemary or mint.  </li>
            <li>scent is ok-more the impression of clean not something feminine or perfume like.</li>
            <li>I have used and liked the EverPure shampoo and conditioner and was surprised to find this smell</li>
            <li>The smells is so distinct and unique.</li>
            <li>Love this UV spray, not greasy, and the price is amazing compared to other products!</li>
            <li>I love the smell of it and how soft if makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>More like a combo of old spice and hospital disinfectant.  </li>
            <li>Smells good and doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li>The shine it imparts is amazing and the smell is light and fades after a few minutes, but not the effect of the product itself.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good hairspray compared to previous ones I&#x27;ve used (Redken, Dove, etc.).</li>
            <li>It smells nice; although, it is different from the shampoo/conditioner in this line and perhaps may be objectionable to some as it is fairly strong; not overpowering, but definitely lingers.</li>
            <li>This is a really great product that is hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li>Very dissatisfied!</li>
            <li>This is one of my absolute favorites, and now I can&#x27;t find it anywhere!</li>
            <li>Why L&#x27;Oreal had to go mess with and stop making such a great product line is beyond me.  </li>
            <li>but I have purple hair, and it fades extremely fast..</li>
            <li>Very nourishing..</li>
            <li>Thanks again.</li>
            <li>Do not use on the bangs because it makes them look really oily.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is really overpowering and doesn&#x27;t smell like rosemary mint at all.</li>
            <li>It really helps keep hair color from fading in the sun.</li>
            <li>I have had this spray for a while now, and I really like it.</li>
            <li>This spray is very lightweight and it doesn&#x27;t feel like you have any product build up in your hair.</li>
            <li>I have used it for years and get so many compliments on my hair, especially when it&#x27;s freshly washed, but it really helps to maintain that &amp;#34;salon fresh&amp;#34; look long afterwards.</li>
            <li>I dye my hair red, which is known for fading super fast.</li>
            <li>I like the UV protection spray from Aveda better, but this product does seem to keep my scalp from getting burned and it costs a lot less than the Aveda sunscreen.</li>
            <li>It has a slight odor when first sprayed but that disappears quickly, so that is not a problem as far as I can see.</li>
            <li>I used this spray a few times but the scent is so overpowering, like cheap hairspray (think Aquanet), that I could still smell it wafting around me later in the day - and I was sure other people could too.</li>
            <li>Not exactly a stiff hairspray though.</li>
            <li>You have to be careful how much you spray, because it can make your hair look oily if too much is used.</li>
            <li>If you are sensitive to perfumes, dyes, etc.</li>
            <li>would recommend this product to every woman in the world who wants their haircolor to last!!</li>
            <li>My only complaint is I wish it was more of a &#x27;mist&#x27; than a &#x27;spray&#x27;.</li>
            <li>and I thank you very much the above company that sent the above tool  that I could repair what I needed to do as soon as possible.</li>
            <li>I work outside every summer and even though I don&#x27;t dye my hair  it was getting really dry and very faded from the UV rays.</li>
            <li>I bought this, based on the other reviews, because I spend a lot of time outside in the summer and my hair, particularly on the crown, really bleaches out and ends up dry &amp; damaged.  </li>
            <li>Since I color my hair every four weeks these days due to getting older,  I never go without something to protect the color from fading.  </li>

            <li> I purchased this item to go along with my other L&#x27;Oreal products and I use it frequently.</li>
            <li> My husband says it isn&#x27;t awful (that isn&#x27;t much of an endorsement, but better than him saying it &amp;#34;stinks&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li> Have not been using it long enough to know if it will help me retain my hair color longer.</li>
            <li> My hair is colored with lots of grey, but the sun zaps it white.  </li>
            <li> I have white-silver grey hair and need the UV protection if going without a hat.</li>
            <li> But with this stuff my color lasts twice as long.</li>
            <li> I was in a Big Lots store the other day and found it there</li>
            <li> The spray also seems to have a moisturized because my hair isn&#x27;t dry.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I am back to the drawing board-my 7year old with thin hair continues to get sunburn on her hair</li>
            <li> Does have a strong smell, but not an unpleasant one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s impossible to see the difference , using it or not using it, without doing a controlled study like only spraying the right half of my hair for several months.  </li>
            <li> not sure how this product does to protect the hair from the sun, but it has an unpleasant and very strong smell that just hangs on the hair.</li>
            <li> I feel like it also makes my hair look shinier, though I&#x27;m not positive that is an effect of the spray.</li>
            <li> that both Rosemary &amp; Mint are listed well past the generic term \\&quot;Perfum/Fragrance\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if this is working - maybe because I have dark, dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> Actually, I&#x27;ve only used this a few times so am not sure how well it works at this time.  </li>
            <li> It may or may not block the UVA/UVB sun&#x27;s rays, but when I have to wash my hair every day to get that mess out of my hair, it&#x27;s just not worth it.  </li>
            <li> In the meantime girls, stock up; because this particular product line will sadly soon be &amp;#34;herstory...</li>
            <li> Goes on a little heavy.</li>
            <li> The formula is a little oily though not too heavy.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it is not available at any of the stores I shop at.</li>
            <li> I used this product everyday this summer, and it did wonders.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s truly working to protect my color,</li>
            <li> Not sure if the spf is working or not.</li>
            <li> My cheaply color-treated hair looks a lot less awful than it does after a week of sun with this product.</li>
            <li> works well on hair- was hard to find a sunscreen to protect against fading hair color-</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t too thick, and the smell is addicting.</li>
            <li> Still, not sure I could go without this one!</li>
            <li> The smell is definitely not rosemary-mint as the bottle says, but the bad odor seems to dissipate after 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> Other than an unpleasant smell,the product works quite well,prolonging my color especiallyin the summer sun.</li>
            <li> but I was woefully tired of that.  </li>
            <li> It failed to detangle, and it has an odd, unpleasant, and persistent odor.</li>
            <li> I hope this product is protecting my hair from the sun, but it smells awful.  </li>

            <li> I like the UV protection spray from Aveda better, but this product does seem to keep my scalp from getting burned and it costs a lot less than the Aveda sunscreen.

            <li> Stop me for being crazy, but when I wash my hair and put product in it, I still want that clean, soft, natural feeling for my hair.  Not possible with this product.  It may or may not block the UVA/UVB sun&#x27;s rays, but when I have to wash my hair every day to get that mess out of my hair, it&#x27;s just not worth it.  Very dissatisfied!</li>
            <li> A nice light sprat to protect hair and scalp in the sun. It adds moisture and shine.</li>
            <li> Love the scent. Not sure if it&#x27;s truly working to protect my color, but I have purple hair, and it fades extremely fast.. I can&#x27;t blade the product for that, it&#x27;s the nature of the beast. Very nourishing.. my hair feels soft and smells awesome.</li>
            <li> I bought this yesterday &amp; used it last night.  My hair looks great!  I love it!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say for sure it does what it says it does but if it does it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> works well on hair- was hard to find a sunscreen to protect against fading hair color- this works just great and smells good to boot.</li>
            <li> I bought this product on clearance at Walmart not knowing what this product was all about. I absolutely love this product. I love the smell of it and how soft if makes my hair feel. Unfortunately it is not available at any of the stores I shop at. I looked on-line and was able to find it that way. I was in a Big Lots store the other day and found it there so I bought 4 more bottles. Hopefully that will last me awhile. I don&#x27;t know why you discontinued it in the stores.</li>
            <li> I work outside every summer and even though I don&#x27;t dye my hair  it was getting really dry and very faded from the UV rays. I used this product everyday this summer, and it did wonders.</li>
            <li> Received the above item in great conditions, I am very happy and I thank you very much the above company that sent the above tool  that I could repair what I needed to do as soon as possible. Thanks again.</li>
            <li> This product is the most awesome ever made for moisturizing and protecting color treated hair! I have used it for years and get so many compliments on my hair, especially when it&#x27;s freshly washed, but it really helps to maintain that &amp;#34;salon fresh&amp;#34; look long afterwards. The shine it imparts is amazing and the smell is light and fades after a few minutes, but not the effect of the product itself.  It has shampoo/ conditioner/ hair masque and rejuvenating smoother companion products, none of which are made anymore. Why L&#x27;Oreal had to go mess with and stop making such a great product line is beyond me.  But if you love this line as much as I do, you will notice that the scarcer it becomes, the more you will be paying for it.  Not at all fair, but worth the price.  I&#x27;m just wondering what L&#x27;Oreal has created if anything) to replace it.  In the meantime girls, stock up; because this particular product line will sadly soon be &amp;#34;herstory...&amp;#34;  ;-(.</li>
            <li> After having radiation treatments to my scalp, my hair is thinner on top.  I was looking for a sunscreen since I love spending time outdoors and don&#x27;t always want to wear a hat.  This fits the bill!  A different scent would be nice, but it works and I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> I like the scent of this. My only complaint is I wish it was more of a &#x27;mist&#x27; than a &#x27;spray&#x27;. Goes on a little heavy.</li>
            <li> Great UV hair and scalp protector. Smells good and doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down. Also has healthy ingredients for your hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have bought another bottle and will buy again in the future.</li>
            <li> I love the smell but others may not.  Seems to hold my color longer when in the sun</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good hairspray compared to previous ones I&#x27;ve used (Redken, Dove, etc.). The spray doesn&#x27;t leave sticky residue and calms flyaway hair for many hours (not truly all day). The Rosemary smell is light and pleasant. I would purchase this item again.</li>
            <li> Having my scalp tattooed (micropigmentation) requires sunscreen at all times to prevent fading!  Love this UV spray, not greasy, and the price is amazing compared to other products!</li>
            <li> this is not what I use to buy..this product was sticky and shiny on my hair... made my hair look wet.&lt;br /&gt;I will not purchase from this buyer again.</li>
            <li> I dye my hair red, which is known for fading super fast. But with this stuff my color lasts twice as long. It also smells so good I don&#x27;t have to wear perfume!</li>
            <li> It does not, under any circumstance, smell like rosemary and mint. It smells like cleaner. But I think it does it&#x27;s job so all is good</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this protected my hair from the sun or not. I couldn&#x27;t make myself to continue to use it. It failed to detangle, and it has an odd, unpleasant, and persistent odor.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to help maintain my color but also I need a scalp sun screen for my daughter.  The product description gave me the impression that there would be some SPH benefits.  Unfortunately I am back to the drawing board-my 7year old with thin hair continues to get sunburn on her hair part.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is ok-more the impression of clean not something feminine or perfume like.</li>
            <li> I use this a lot outside.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product. The smells is so distinct and unique. It keeps your hair safe from the sun (which we need here in Texas)&lt;br /&gt;and adds a great scent! I try to use the every morning after i style my air as a final step. Love this product!</li>
            <li> not sure how this product does to protect the hair from the sun, but it has an unpleasant and very strong smell that just hangs on the hair. Do not use on the bangs because it makes them look really oily.</li>
            <li> Not sure if the spf is working or not. Seemed like my scalp was not getting burned while out all day in the sun without a hat. The formula is a little oily though not too heavy. Not exactly a stiff hairspray though. More like a lite hold hairspray.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if this is working - maybe because I have dark, dark brown hair. The fragrance is really overpowering and doesn&#x27;t smell like rosemary mint at all. If you are sensitive to perfumes, dyes, etc. this is not the product for you. I think I&#x27;ll stick with a good conditioner rather than UV protectant.</li>
            <li> I have tried a dozen different UV protectants, and this is the best one.  It makes my color hold on so much longer, and it smells super good.</li>
            <li> Have not been using it long enough to know if it will help me retain my hair color longer. It&#x27;s impossible to see the difference , using it or not using it, without doing a controlled study like only spraying the right half of my hair for several months.  (which I&#x27;m not going to do).  Hopefully, it is doing what it is supposed to do.  It has a slight odor when first sprayed but that disappears quickly, so that is not a problem as far as I can see.</li>
            <li> This is one of my absolute favorites, and now I can&#x27;t find it anywhere! It isn&#x27;t too thick, and the smell is addicting.</li>
            <li> Actually, I&#x27;ve only used this a few times so am not sure how well it works at this time.  Will continue and perhaps can rate it better in a couple of weeks</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  Hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> So far so good at protecting hair from sun but does NOT smell like rosemary or mint.  More like a combo of old spice and hospital disinfectant.  Fortunately the smell fades after a while.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item to go along with my other L&#x27;Oreal products and I use it frequently. It seems to work fine with my hair and I would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I genuinely love this product!  None of the stores within walking distance  ( I don&#x27;t drive )  carry this product any longer.  Since I color my hair every four weeks these days due to getting older,  I never go without something to protect the color from fading.  This is the product to use and the price was so incredible that I purchased three bottles.  It&#x27;s worth every penny!!  Love love love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to every woman in the world who wants their haircolor to last!!</li>
            <li> ordered this to keep in the pool/beach bag.  I spray my hair every time I come out of the water.  I have colored/bleached hi-lites and I am always concerned about the salt water and the sun.  Friends are always asking for a spray because it smells so good.  I am a big fan of the shampoo and conditioner as well.</li>
            <li> I hope this product is protecting my hair from the sun, but it smells awful.  I have used and liked the EverPure shampoo and conditioner and was surprised to find this smell so repelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am using it bc I need to protect my color from the sun, but I will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Good price, considering what a lot of companies charge for UV spray for hair. It smells nice; although, it is different from the shampoo/conditioner in this line and perhaps may be objectionable to some as it is fairly strong; not overpowering, but definitely lingers. It seems to be a fairly unisex smell. I feel like it also makes my hair look shinier, though I&#x27;m not positive that is an effect of the spray. Still, not sure I could go without this one!</li>
            <li> This is a really great product that is hard to find in stores. It really helps keep hair color from fading in the sun. Smells nice too.</li>
            <li> I have had this spray for a while now, and I really like it. You have to be careful how much you spray, because it can make your hair look oily if too much is used. I have started to spray it in my palms and then work it into my hair and that seems to work better for me. The smell is nice too. I was worried about it, but I ended up liking it.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for Coachella, worked great and smelled even better all day long. I will definitely be using this all summer.</li>
            <li> I need to protect my hair from the sun.  My hair is colored with lots of grey, but the sun zaps it white.  I do wear a hat, but it still gets zapped.  L&#x27;Oreal spray does seem to protect my hair - I don&#x27;t seem to have white hair this summer.  The spray also seems to have a moisturized because my hair isn&#x27;t dry.  I will purchase more.</li>
            <li> Other than an unpleasant smell,the product works quite well,prolonging my color especiallyin the summer sun.</li>
            <li> My cheaply color-treated hair looks a lot less awful than it does after a week of sun with this product. Totally works.</li>
            <li> Works great! Coats hair in a light mist to control frizz and protect from the elements. Does have a strong smell, but not an unpleasant one.</li>
            <li> This spray is very lightweight and it doesn&#x27;t feel like you have any product build up in your hair. It smells great. I recommend it for going into the tanning bed, or just for regular outdoor protection.</li>
            <li> I bought this, based on the other reviews, because I spend a lot of time outside in the summer and my hair, particularly on the crown, really bleaches out and ends up dry &amp; damaged.  For several years I&#x27;ve faithfully worn hats &amp; scarves in summertime but I was woefully tired of that.  I used this spray a few times but the scent is so overpowering, like cheap hairspray (think Aquanet), that I could still smell it wafting around me later in the day - and I was sure other people could too. And not in a good way.  I&#x27;d rather have my hair bleached out than walk around smelling like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Aqua/water/eau, Peg-14 Dimethicone, Propylene Glycol, Peg-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Phenoxyethanol, Perfum/fragrance, Camphor Benzalkonium Methosulfate, Cetrimonium Chloride, Methylparaben, Benzophenone-4, Disodium, Edta, Tocopherol, Triethanolamine, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Leaf extract*, Linalool, Rosmarinus Officinalis Oil/Rosemary Leaf Oil*, Butylphenyl Methyl-Propional, Citronellol, Coumarin, Limonene, Geraniol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Note that both Rosemary &amp; Mint are listed well past the generic term \\&quot;Perfum/Fragrance\\&quot;. Moreover, this spray sure doesn&#x27;t smell like any Rosemary or Mint I&#x27;ve ever grown.</li>
