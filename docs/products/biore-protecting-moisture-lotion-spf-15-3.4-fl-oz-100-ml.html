            <li>On the plus side if you don&#x27;t have combination skin this would probably be a great light weight moisturizer.</li>
            <li>lotion is amazing.</li>
            <li>love that it has sunscreen in it too.</li>
            <li>I love Biore Protecting Moisture Lotion SPF 15 3.4 fl oz (100 ml).</li>
            <li>This is my favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Its better to switch to another moisturizer like aveeno, for a couple more bucks</li>
            <li>so i can buy a better product</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s great for sensitive skin like mine!</li>
            <li>This brand doesn&#x27;t even advertise that it&#x27;s alcohol free, but I think it&#x27;s a gigantic selling</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m going to pay more money,  I should NOT be having to take the whole top off and get into my moisturizer that way.</li>
            <li>But Its worth the price!</li>
            <li>cream doesn&#x27;t moisturize well, and I often have to put on two layers for my skin to feel its full affects.</li>
            <li>it is my favorite light weight formula that i wear daily.</li>
            <li>none were ever the equal of this light, clean moisturizer.</li>
            <li>this is my first time I bought something from this seller.</li>
            <li>which is why I paid the much higher price than when it was sold in stores...</li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite moisturizer and obviously it&#x27;s been discontinued</li>
            <li>I have tried many others and they would burn, dry, and irritate my skin where it creases like around my nose and chin, but this one just makes my skin feel soft and cool.</li>
            <li>Gentle and has the spf 15.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the only moisturizers I can find that is both oil and alcohol free.</li>
            <li>I have dry, mildly sensitive skin prone to some eczema and over the years have tried many over the counter and prescription products...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight, gives me enough moisture to keep my skin soft and smooth, and doesn&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>This product makes my face soft.</li>
            <li>It is better than any expensive facial product available.</li>
            <li>, that offers extra benefits</li>
            <li>In the winter my skin gets a little drier, so I have to exfoliate really well for this lotion to</li>

            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve actually seen some moisturizers (like neutrogenas oil-free line) that falsely advertise themselves as oil and alcohol free.</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy up this product as long as I can.</li>
            <li> This product still leaves my skin feeling dry, and then oily in some spots.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve tried looking for a comparable product with no oil or alcohol, but it seems everything has either one or the other.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products but none are satisfactory compared to this.</li>
            <li> Compared to other competing products, this product is not worth it.</li>

            <li> Not a good advertisement for brand loyalty or customer satisfaction, furthermore they offered no substitute in their line of current products to replace this one.</li>
            <li> Oil causes me to break out like crazy, and alcohol really irritates and dries out my skin-</li>
            <li> I use it everyday, and my skin doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
            <li> I would like to see at least at 20.</li>
            <li> I use this product daily, and was very sad to discover it&#x27;s no longer in production.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried Neutrogena as a replacement, but it has a weird feel to it, and the spout gets a hard plug of lotion every few days that has to be removed.</li>
            <li> Sadly, Bior√© has redesigned their product line, and is now exclusively in the cleanser business.</li>
            <li> so sad its been discontinued</li>
            <li> I was very sad to learn this product is out of production.</li>
            <li> So disappointed.</li>
            <li> So disappointed Biore discontinued this product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Could find this product in the retail stores. It&#x27;s one of our favoirte face lotions. Gentle and has the spf 15.  Highly recommend</li>
            <li> i wish this didn&#x27;t go off of the market. it is my favorite light weight formula that i wear daily. love that it has sunscreen in it too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I love Biore Protecting Moisture Lotion SPF 15 3.4 fl oz (100 ml). This product is the best for my face. this is my first time I bought something from this seller. Everything got here on time. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this lotion to anyone, it is wonderful to use all year around, and it keeps my skin looking amazing!</li>
            <li> Biore is the best face cream I have used. I couldn&#x27;t find this product in any local stores, so off to Amazon! I tried Neutrogena as a replacement, but it has a weird feel to it, and the spout gets a hard plug of lotion every few days that has to be removed.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite moisturizer. Since it was discontinued, I have had no luck in finding anything similar to replace it. I finally gave in and ordered one of the few remaining bottles. My only complaint is that the product was shipped without the box, so I have no way of knowing if the product is expired (I suspect that it is). Either way, the moisturizer works like a dream. Absorbs quickly, does a great job, and smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> I use this product daily, and was very sad to discover it&#x27;s no longer in production.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has always left my face feeling moisturized without feeling at all greasy, or causing any skin irritation or breakouts.  It also works well underneath my makeup.</li>
            <li> This product still leaves my skin feeling dry, and then oily in some spots.  On the plus side if you don&#x27;t have combination skin this would probably be a great light weight moisturizer.</li>
            <li> They stopped selling this in stores so I had to resort to the internet to find it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion is amazing. It moisturizes your skin without making it feel greasy. Plus it&#x27;s great for sensitive skin like mine!</li>
            <li> So disappointed. The pump doesn&#x27;t work. This is my absolute favorite moisturizer and obviously it&#x27;s been discontinued which is why I paid the much higher price than when it was sold in stores... If I&#x27;m going to pay more money,  I should NOT be having to take the whole top off and get into my moisturizer that way. I&#x27;ve tried everything to get the pump to squirt ANYTHING out... but no avail.</li>
            <li> I buy this for my daughter and she lives this product.</li>
            <li> I have dry, mildly sensitive skin prone to some eczema and over the years have tried many over the counter and prescription products...none were ever the equal of this light, clean moisturizer. Sadly, Bior√© has redesigned their product line, and is now exclusively in the cleanser business. They have discontinued all moisturizer products. It is a pity they did not license this cream out to another label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone comes across a good substitute, post and let us all know!!</li>
            <li> This is one of the only moisturizers I can find that is both oil and alcohol free. Oil causes me to break out like crazy, and alcohol really irritates and dries out my skin- which also causes it to break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve actually seen some moisturizers (like neutrogenas oil-free line) that falsely advertise themselves as oil and alcohol free. I used one of those for a week before I finally read the ingredients and saw alcohol on there. This brand doesn&#x27;t even advertise that it&#x27;s alcohol free, but I think it&#x27;s a gigantic selling point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is perfect. It&#x27;s lightweight, gives me enough moisture to keep my skin soft and smooth, and doesn&#x27;t break me out. In the winter my skin gets a little drier, so I have to exfoliate really well for this lotion to work- but that&#x27;s just part of living with problem skin- and this is literally the ONLY moisturizer I&#x27;ve found that works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one downside to this product is that it keeps getting harder and harder to find. A lot of the stores I used to get it from have stopped carrying it, so I&#x27;m reeaaaaalllly hoping it doesn&#x27;t get discontinued. I&#x27;ve tried looking for a comparable product with no oil or alcohol, but it seems everything has either one or the other. Here&#x27;s to hoping.</li>
            <li> I was very sad to learn this product is out of production. I wrote the company and was told to try to find it at one of several sites they mentioned. I have tried other products but none are satisfactory compared to this. Not a good advertisement for brand loyalty or customer satisfaction, furthermore they offered no substitute in their line of current products to replace this one. bummer!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product that I wish Biore would start manufacturing again.  It is a great moisturizer with sunscreen protection build in.  The texture of the product does wonders for my skin, giving it a moist dewy look without being greasy at all.  You can wear it alone or under makeup.  It is the perfect product for my skin.</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion I have EVER used in my face!! I have combination skin.I have tried many others and they would burn, dry, and irritate my skin where it creases like around my nose and chin, but this one just makes my skin feel soft and cool. and it has SPF 15! Im so sad its been discontinued becuse I love it, I might just have to pay the $17 instead of the $7 I used to pay for it! But Its worth the price!</li>
            <li> Compared to other competing products, this product is not worth it. Its better to switch to another moisturizer like aveeno, for a couple more bucks, that offers extra benefits&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream doesn&#x27;t moisturize well, and I often have to put on two layers for my skin to feel its full affects. For me the SPF15 doesnt cut it. I would like to see at least at 20. Can&#x27;t wait for my bottle to finish so i can buy a better product</li>
            <li> When I use Biore protecting Moisture lotion, I feel revitalized. This product makes my face soft. I use it everyday, and my skin doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
            <li> it is great if you need some SPF for your face. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a lotion for out in the sun.</li>
            <li> Biore you have lost you mind discontinuing this product!  It is better than any expensive facial product available. So disappointed Biore discontinued this product. I will continue to buy up this product as long as I can.</li>
