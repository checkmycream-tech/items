            <li>/&gt;Is there some reason it is not being carried in the drug stores any more?</li>

            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed using this product for years.  </li>
            <li>My order was filled and delivered in a very timely fashion,  Amazon has always been a splendid way for me to shop.</li>
            <li>If I put it on over another moisturizer, the effect is delayed and it looks good at first -</li>
            <li>Perfect Pro-Calcium Radiance Perfector Sheer Tint Moisturizer, Light - 1.7 oz.]</li>
            <li>I use instead of makeup and feels great on your face, not heavy at all.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin moist, healthy, and smooth.</li>
            <li>My daughter is also thrilled that she can buy it on Amazon, especially at such a good price.</li>
            <li>The tint is perfect - not too dark, and easy to blend.  </li>
            <li>It provides good moisturizing, even in the desert clime in which I live.</li>
            <li>Applies to face smoothly and easily.  </li>
            <li>but it was fine.</li>
            <li>The quality was what I expected -- very good.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and light.</li>
            <li>I also read some reviews that stated this product is no longer available.</li>
            <li>I was upset when i couldn&#x27;t find it anymore in my local stores, and was so happy to discover that Amazon still had it.</li>
            <li>I have found no satisfactory replacement and the order was filled promptly with no hassle.  </li>
            <li>Will purchase again if available.</li>
            <li>I ordered the medium tint and received the light tint.</li>
            <li>,this is definely the same and i will buy again, great moisturizer, i dont use anything else</li>
            <li>It makes your skin appear healthy with just the right amount of tint.  </li>
            <li>Leaves a nice glow which gives older skin a dewy look.</li>
            <li>It comes in two tints, light and medium, and the light is perfect for me, because my skin is very pale.  </li>
            <li>I am pretty tan in the summer, and so I dont see a tint to my face, but the complexion and texture are better already.</li>
            <li>I tried Olay Definity and many other tinted moisturizers, but this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>Com--it gives your face a nice glow and it is not heavy like some makeup.  </li>
            <li>I have fair skin with freckles, and a bit of a yellow undertone.</li>
            <li>My daughter uses the light tint in the winter time and the medium during summer months, because she spends more time out of doors, and the medium appears very natural for her.  </li>
            <li>This product simply moistens and gives a gentle color to a face that has seen 80 years of happy life.</li>
            <li>I hope I can keep purchasing this cream from you because it came quickly and effortlessly.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Love the product, very natural!  </li>
            <li>and I am so glad she gave me the tip because I can&#x27;t live without this product now.</li>
            <li>It does a great job of evening out skin tone and giving you a slight glow.  </li>
            <li>For some strange reason I can&#x27;t find this product in my stores for several weeks, so happy to be able to buy online.</li>
            <li>I like the product very much, however, it appeared as though the container wasn&#x27;t as completely full as it used to be when I could purchase it over the counter.  </li>
            <li>This looked promising in the bottle - light and glowy - but it turns orange as I spread it on my skin.</li>
            <li>Thanks for having it available.</li>
            <li>One day, I checked Amazon, and was so thrilled to see that not only did they have it in stock, but the price was a fraction of what I had been paying.  </li>
            <li>It has just the right amount of tint.</li>
            <li>I notified the vendor and they replaced it right away.</li>
            <li>Well she was right</li>
            <li>A bit too dark for me but being summer time that was ok, But it was too shiny and made my face look oily even with powder on top.</li>
            <li>and this does absolutely nothing as far as giving very light coverage or glow.</li>
            <li>Certainly a 5 star service!</li>
            <li>I just wanted something I could easily apply and then remove completely with a wash cloth.  </li>
            <li>I did a lot of research on tinted moisturizers and this one seemed to be a great alternative to the more expensive Laura Mercier product.</li>
            <li>This stuff felt silky smooth going on, looked light coming out of the bottle, but left my face two-three orange tones darker.</li>
            <li>I then use bronzer by sheer cover on my face and chest and I look like I have a healthy tan.</li>
            <li>My daughter told me about it a couple of years ago, and I was able to buy it at a local drug store.</li>
            <li>So I bought two of them, and I just hope that I&#x27;ll be able to buy it on Amazon again when I run low.  </li>
            <li>which I first purchased in a drug store two years ago.  </li>
            <li>I use it instead of make-up for a light natural look.</li>
            <li>I paid more than double the price at the Pharmacy.</li>
            <li>She bought me my first bottle of it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know that it makes me look younger, but sure like the way it goes on.  </li>
            <li>I love it its hard to find and I was able to find it here</li>
            <li>It is so light and fresh that your skin can breathe and glow at the same time</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 72 years old, but I think this would be appropriate for any age woman who wants a natural look.  </li>
            <li>but it is not as good as it usually is.</li>
            <li>i purchase these product thinking was a copy of the original, i think l&#x27;oreal discontinue this product on major store.</li>
            <li>it lasted very long time to love the product.</li>
            <li>The price was absolutely amazing - much less than I would find in the stores.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my sixties, pretty fit for my age - I&#x27;m slim and work out regularly.</li>
            <li>It is slightly hydrating however the color doesn&#x27;t look nice at all.  </li>
            <li>a certain age\\&quot; will understand.  </li>
            <li>The light, vs. the medium tint is a little light, so in the winter I mix it with the medium.  </li>
            <li>I hope this product continues to be available through Amazon because I will definitely be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and has just enough of a tint to make a difference.  </li>
            <li>I do really like this product</li>
            <li>While product was very moisturizing, it seem to peel  .I  </li>
            <li>I intend to order another very soon.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Amazon.</li>
            <li>As soon as I used this product my skin felt hydrated and really radiant.</li>
            <li>Really hope this doesn&#x27;t get discontinued.  </li>
            <li>I love this product because not only does it moisturize but it has a natural tint of colour which makes your face glow.  </li>
            <li>I live in S. Calif. &amp; very much exposed to sun just by walking out my door.</li>
            <li>It is a more expensive product than I would usually use (got my first one with a great coupon), but it is well worth the cost.  </li>
            <li>Think some folks complained about an orange tint...if the product gets old or exposed to light while in the container it will turn more orange on your skin.</li>
            <li>Smoothes my skin with just enough coverage without full make up.  </li>
            <li>I Love this product -- had purchased previously in stores and then could not find it in any stores</li>
            <li>I just love the way my skin looks and the slight tint it gives my skin.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>When I look as if I am not awake yet, I put a little of this under my eyes and on my cheeks--like magic, it brightens up my face.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately L&#x27;oreal had decided to discontinue this particular item and replace it with &amp;#34;BB Cream!&amp;#34;  I am always so happy to find it on Amazon....</li>
            <li>But, I haven&#x27;t been happy with lots of make-up products because they seem to give the skin a dry, dull look rather than a radiance.</li>
            <li>Might not buy anymore online as the product not being made and the stash that folks have, even new, will just age out...</li>
            <li>A truly new product, like nothing else I have seen.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin come alive without the heavy look of most foundations.</li>
            <li>The color gives a really tan or yellow cast, looking very unnatural.</li>
            <li>Very natural no make up look.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other products, and this one wins hands down.</li>
            <li>Spring for the Mercier product if you want a real tinted moisturizer that gives you a little glow, its worth the money!</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal describes it as a \\&quot;Radiance Perfector, Sheer Tint Moisturizer,\\&quot; and that is exactly what it is.  </li>
            <li>Gifted this to my mother as she has used in the past as well..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really light and just gives me a slight bit of color.</li>
            <li>The moisture has a slight tint which I like and a smooth feeling on my skin.</li>
            <li>I get a lot of compliments now on the way my face looks, pretty good at the age of 57, and now I don&#x27;t have to wear heavy make-up and have that thick make-up look.</li>
            <li>Great for traveling when you stay up too late and need that little pick up in the am.</li>
            <li>I use L&#x27;Oreal skin products frequently (moisturizers, etc), but not their color cosmetics and decided to try this makeup because it was a combo of the two.</li>
            <li>I have no trouble blending in tho.</li>
            <li>a bit tanner, softly glowing, not \\&quot;made up.\\</li>
            <li>As L&#x27;Oreal says, it is \\&quot;for mature</li>
            <li>Does not look natural on the skin at all.</li>
            <li>I now use it on my 87 year old mom.  </li>
            <li>old...looks so natural...</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect miracles, just something with very sheer, light coverage that gave my skin a little glow that I could throw on in the summer.</li>
            <li>I have found a product that gives me a glow that no other product does.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and was unable to find it in the area where I live.  </li>
            <li>Was exactly as shown on website and rec&#x27;d in less time than indicated.</li>
            <li>but it looks really odd when you first put it on.</li>
            <li>It is a lightly tinted moisturizer that adds a subtle glow to my complexion.  </li>
            <li>Yes it looks orange a little when you first put it on.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> My order was filled and delivered in a very timely fashion,  Amazon has always been a splendid way for me to shop.</li>
            <li> If I put it on over another moisturizer, the effect is delayed and it looks good at first -</li>
            <li> Perfect Pro-Calcium Radiance Perfector Sheer Tint Moisturizer, Light - 1.7 oz.]</li>
            <li> I use instead of makeup and feels great on your face, not heavy at all.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin moist, healthy, and smooth.</li>
            <li> My daughter is also thrilled that she can buy it on Amazon, especially at such a good price.</li>
            <li> The tint is perfect - not too dark, and easy to blend.  </li>
            <li> It provides good moisturizing, even in the desert clime in which I live.</li>
            <li> Applies to face smoothly and easily.  </li>
            <li> but it was fine.</li>
            <li> The quality was what I expected -- very good.  </li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and light.</li>
            <li> I also read some reviews that stated this product is no longer available.</li>
            <li> I was upset when i couldn&#x27;t find it anymore in my local stores, and was so happy to discover that Amazon still had it.</li>
            <li> I have found no satisfactory replacement and the order was filled promptly with no hassle.  </li>
            <li> Will purchase again if available.</li>
            <li> I ordered the medium tint and received the light tint.</li>
            <li> ,this is definely the same and i will buy again, great moisturizer, i dont use anything else</li>
            <li> It makes your skin appear healthy with just the right amount of tint.  </li>
            <li> Leaves a nice glow which gives older skin a dewy look.</li>
            <li> It comes in two tints, light and medium, and the light is perfect for me, because my skin is very pale.  </li>
            <li> I am pretty tan in the summer, and so I dont see a tint to my face, but the complexion and texture are better already.</li>
            <li> I tried Olay Definity and many other tinted moisturizers, but this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> Com--it gives your face a nice glow and it is not heavy like some makeup.  </li>
            <li> I have fair skin with freckles, and a bit of a yellow undertone.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses the light tint in the winter time and the medium during summer months, because she spends more time out of doors, and the medium appears very natural for her.  </li>
            <li> This product simply moistens and gives a gentle color to a face that has seen 80 years of happy life.</li>
            <li> I hope I can keep purchasing this cream from you because it came quickly and effortlessly.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Love the product, very natural!  </li>
            <li> and I am so glad she gave me the tip because I can&#x27;t live without this product now.</li>
            <li> It does a great job of evening out skin tone and giving you a slight glow.  </li>
            <li> For some strange reason I can&#x27;t find this product in my stores for several weeks, so happy to be able to buy online.</li>
            <li> I like the product very much, however, it appeared as though the container wasn&#x27;t as completely full as it used to be when I could purchase it over the counter.  </li>
            <li> This looked promising in the bottle - light and glowy - but it turns orange as I spread it on my skin.</li>
            <li> Thanks for having it available.</li>
            <li> One day, I checked Amazon, and was so thrilled to see that not only did they have it in stock, but the price was a fraction of what I had been paying.  </li>
            <li> It has just the right amount of tint.</li>
            <li> I notified the vendor and they replaced it right away.</li>
            <li> Well she was right</li>
            <li> A bit too dark for me but being summer time that was ok, But it was too shiny and made my face look oily even with powder on top.</li>
            <li> and this does absolutely nothing as far as giving very light coverage or glow.</li>
            <li> Certainly a 5 star service!</li>
            <li> I just wanted something I could easily apply and then remove completely with a wash cloth.  </li>
            <li> I did a lot of research on tinted moisturizers and this one seemed to be a great alternative to the more expensive Laura Mercier product.</li>
            <li> This stuff felt silky smooth going on, looked light coming out of the bottle, but left my face two-three orange tones darker.</li>
            <li> I then use bronzer by sheer cover on my face and chest and I look like I have a healthy tan.</li>
            <li> My daughter told me about it a couple of years ago, and I was able to buy it at a local drug store.</li>
            <li> So I bought two of them, and I just hope that I&#x27;ll be able to buy it on Amazon again when I run low.  </li>
            <li> which I first purchased in a drug store two years ago.  </li>
            <li> I use it instead of make-up for a light natural look.</li>
            <li> I paid more than double the price at the Pharmacy.</li>
            <li> She bought me my first bottle of it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that it makes me look younger, but sure like the way it goes on.  </li>
            <li> I love it its hard to find and I was able to find it here</li>
            <li> It is so light and fresh that your skin can breathe and glow at the same time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 72 years old, but I think this would be appropriate for any age woman who wants a natural look.  </li>
            <li> but it is not as good as it usually is.</li>
            <li> i purchase these product thinking was a copy of the original, i think l&#x27;oreal discontinue this product on major store.</li>
            <li> it lasted very long time to love the product.</li>
            <li> The price was absolutely amazing - much less than I would find in the stores.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my sixties, pretty fit for my age - I&#x27;m slim and work out regularly.</li>
            <li> It is slightly hydrating however the color doesn&#x27;t look nice at all.  </li>
            <li> a certain age\\&quot; will understand.  </li>
            <li> The light, vs. the medium tint is a little light, so in the winter I mix it with the medium.  </li>
            <li> I hope this product continues to be available through Amazon because I will definitely be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and has just enough of a tint to make a difference.  </li>
            <li> I do really like this product</li>
            <li> While product was very moisturizing, it seem to peel  .I  </li>
            <li> I intend to order another very soon.</li>
            <li> Thanks, Amazon.</li>
            <li> As soon as I used this product my skin felt hydrated and really radiant.</li>
            <li> Really hope this doesn&#x27;t get discontinued.  </li>
            <li> I love this product because not only does it moisturize but it has a natural tint of colour which makes your face glow.  </li>
            <li> I live in S. Calif. &amp; very much exposed to sun just by walking out my door.</li>
            <li> It is a more expensive product than I would usually use (got my first one with a great coupon), but it is well worth the cost.  </li>
            <li> Think some folks complained about an orange tint...if the product gets old or exposed to light while in the container it will turn more orange on your skin.</li>
            <li> Smoothes my skin with just enough coverage without full make up.  </li>
            <li> I Love this product -- had purchased previously in stores and then could not find it in any stores</li>
            <li> I just love the way my skin looks and the slight tint it gives my skin.</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> When I look as if I am not awake yet, I put a little of this under my eyes and on my cheeks--like magic, it brightens up my face.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately L&#x27;oreal had decided to discontinue this particular item and replace it with &amp;#34;BB Cream!&amp;#34;  I am always so happy to find it on Amazon....</li>
            <li> But, I haven&#x27;t been happy with lots of make-up products because they seem to give the skin a dry, dull look rather than a radiance.</li>
            <li> Might not buy anymore online as the product not being made and the stash that folks have, even new, will just age out...</li>
            <li> A truly new product, like nothing else I have seen.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin come alive without the heavy look of most foundations.</li>
            <li> The color gives a really tan or yellow cast, looking very unnatural.</li>
            <li> Very natural no make up look.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other products, and this one wins hands down.</li>
            <li> Spring for the Mercier product if you want a real tinted moisturizer that gives you a little glow, its worth the money!</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal describes it as a \\&quot;Radiance Perfector, Sheer Tint Moisturizer,\\&quot; and that is exactly what it is.  </li>
            <li> Gifted this to my mother as she has used in the past as well..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really light and just gives me a slight bit of color.</li>
            <li> The moisture has a slight tint which I like and a smooth feeling on my skin.</li>
            <li> I get a lot of compliments now on the way my face looks, pretty good at the age of 57, and now I don&#x27;t have to wear heavy make-up and have that thick make-up look.</li>
            <li> Great for traveling when you stay up too late and need that little pick up in the am.</li>
            <li> I use L&#x27;Oreal skin products frequently (moisturizers, etc), but not their color cosmetics and decided to try this makeup because it was a combo of the two.</li>
            <li> I have no trouble blending in tho.</li>
            <li> a bit tanner, softly glowing, not \\&quot;made up.\\</li>
            <li> As L&#x27;Oreal says, it is \\&quot;for mature</li>
            <li> Does not look natural on the skin at all.</li>
            <li> I now use it on my 87 year old mom.  </li>
            <li> old...looks so natural...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect miracles, just something with very sheer, light coverage that gave my skin a little glow that I could throw on in the summer.</li>
            <li> I have found a product that gives me a glow that no other product does.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and was unable to find it in the area where I live.  </li>
            <li> Was exactly as shown on website and rec&#x27;d in less time than indicated.</li>
            <li> but it looks really odd when you first put it on.</li>
            <li> It is a lightly tinted moisturizer that adds a subtle glow to my complexion.  </li>
            <li> Yes it looks orange a little when you first put it on.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin super shiny and leaves behind a greasy feeling film.  </li>
            <li> l have been using this tinned moisturizer for a long time and do not need to wear foundation covers up the small&lt;br /&gt;marks of the skin</li>
            <li> I prefer it to makeup, because I&#x27;ve always had trouble finding the right color for my skin, and I don&#x27;t like anything that appears thick or that accentuates the lines in my face.  </li>
            <li> I like this product so much that I order a few at a time, just in case i run out quicker than usual.</li>
            <li> This product provides the color and glow that I need for my very dry skin.  </li>
            <li> there&#x27;s a little left at the opening, it also turns orange at the edges, so this may have to do with exposure to the air.</li>
            <li> It is extremely hard to find in a drug store, and works wonders with my 74 year old skin.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, I put a dab on each of 2 fingers, and spread it over my cheeks and forehead.</li>
            <li> However, my drug store no longer carries it in stock, although they seem well stocked in other Loreal products.</li>
            <li> I have tried all the other products out there including Lancome and nothing comes close to what this tint provides.</li>
            <li> Does not sink into wrinkles in a way that highlights them like some other tinted moisturizers.</li>
            <li> I like the product and have been buying it on ebay and other places for Years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy, and it adds just enough color to my skin to improve my very pale complexion .</li>
            <li> This product is hard to find in local CVS and Walgreens, so I order it through Amazon, which is often cheaper anyway.  </li>
            <li> It also comes in medium and dark shades.</li>
            <li> May be down the road</li>
            <li> an odd separated oily mixture of both.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel moist while it produces a slight tint to my face.</li>
            <li> I have Rosacea &amp; find the slight tint is just what is needed.  </li>
            <li> something a little \\&quot;fresher\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face soft with a faint shimmer.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like wearing heavy foundation and with this I don&#x27;t have to.</li>
            <li> Used everyday for 2 months and saw no improvement.  </li>
            <li> Try something else, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my everyday go to.</li>
            <li> dull skin.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> This stuff is hard to find anymore &amp; when you do find it,  </li>
            <li> It is working slowly.</li>
            <li> If I spread it very thin, the effect is less noticeable, but still not appealing.</li>
            <li> and I think it&#x27;s sad that I have search around the internet trying to find it for myself and other people since I started that trend.</li>
            <li> I tried other makeup and was so disappointed in how it felt - so heavy.</li>
            <li> Had been unable to locate this moisturizer elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Even wearing alone, it seemed to fake and peel.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s expensive.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed, and looking through other products, I couldn&#x27;t find anything else like it, so I didn&#x27;t know where to turn.  </li>
            <li> Truly Sorry!</li>
            <li> bad it&#x27;s discontinued.</li>
            <li> it might work 100% at least that is the hope!!!!</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed when a well known company can&#x27;t listen to it&#x27;s clients.</li>
            <li> I used it as a base under my powder blush.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It is a wonderful product for wrinkles and covering light blemishes .  Hydrates my facial skin .</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful!  It is a more expensive product than I would usually use (got my first one with a great coupon), but it is well worth the cost.  Applies to face smoothly and easily.  Leaves my face soft with a faint shimmer.  Can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore, so I bought more than one.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for 1.5 yrs and like the way it moisturizes but does NOT CLOG pores and does NOT look like I have makeup on.  It is non-greasy, stays on all day without reapplication, and looks great!</li>
            <li> I love this product and it can&#x27;t be found in the stores any more so its great that I found it on your site.  Hopefully it will be there in the future when I need it again.</li>
            <li> I love it. I don&#x27;t understand why you can&#x27;t buy it in the stores. Goes on smooth and light. Wonderful product</li>
            <li> I love this product...I don&#x27;t like wearing heavy foundation and with this I don&#x27;t have to. It&#x27;s really light and just gives me a slight bit of color. I then use bronzer by sheer cover on my face and chest and I look like I have a healthy tan. I hope this product continues to be available through Amazon because I will definitely be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I use instead of makeup and feels great on your face, not heavy at all.  For some strange reason I can&#x27;t find this product in my stores for several weeks, so happy to be able to buy online.</li>
            <li> This product is great.  Just as I fell in love with it, the stores no longer carried it, but I found it on Amazon.com for a great price.  It is so light and has a glow that makes my skin look and feel great.  No need for a foundation.  I&#x27;m 56 and would, and have, recommend this product to anyone of any age.    Jerri</li>
            <li> Had been unable to locate this moisturizer elsewhere. Was exactly as shown on website and rec&#x27;d in less time than indicated.</li>

            <li> I LOVE this moisturizer...It looks beautiful alone on your skin, also under foundation. I think it is being discontinued? Truly Sorry!</li>
            <li> I have used this product since it came out. I have so many friends that use it as well and I found out L&#x27;Oreal stop making this line. I have tried all the other products out there including Lancome and nothing comes close to what this tint provides. It gives my skin a healthy glow and if I am in a rush this is all I put on. It makes my skin moist, healthy, and smooth. I am so disappointed when a well known company can&#x27;t listen to it&#x27;s clients. I just bought 8 of the medium tint for my friends at $18 a shot and I think it&#x27;s sad that I have search around the internet trying to find it for myself and other people since I started that trend. I will be contacting L&#x27;Oreal to find out if they are just repackaging...I love this!![[ASIN:B002LJ2948 Loreal Age Perfect Pro-Calcium Radiance Perfector Sheer Tint Moisturizer, Medium - 1.7 Oz]]</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research on tinted moisturizers and this one seemed to be a great alternative to the more expensive Laura Mercier product. I was looking forward to getting this based on the reviews and my good experiences with L&#x27;Oreal skin products.I use L&#x27;Oreal skin products frequently (moisturizers, etc), but not their color cosmetics and decided to try this makeup because it was a combo of the two. I have very fair skin and this does absolutely nothing as far as giving very light coverage or glow. I also read some reviews that stated this product is no longer available. I wonder is that is why mine appears to have separated- some pumps I get only lotion, some only tint. some- an odd separated oily mixture of both. I didn&#x27;t expect miracles, just something with very sheer, light coverage that gave my skin a little glow that I could throw on in the summer.For the price I guess its alright as a moisturizer alone, just don&#x27;t bank on the tint or any radiance. Spring for the Mercier product if you want a real tinted moisturizer that gives you a little glow, its worth the money!</li>
            <li> I really like this product. A little goes a long way, I put a dab on each of 2 fingers, and spread it over my cheeks and forehead. It&#x27;s not greasy, and it adds just enough color to my skin to improve my very pale complexion . I used it as a base under my powder blush. I was upset when i couldn&#x27;t find it anymore in my local stores, and was so happy to discover that Amazon still had it. I was worried that loreal had discontinued it.</li>
            <li> I love this product [ASIN:B001E5EKM4 Loreal Age Perfect Pro-Calcium Radiance Perfector Sheer Tint Moisturizer, Light - 1.7 oz.] which I first purchased in a drug store two years ago.  I could no longer find it in stores so I went to Amazon and there it was--at a great price.  It is a lightly tinted moisturizer that adds a subtle glow to my complexion.  I&#x27;m 72 years old, but I think this would be appropriate for any age woman who wants a natural look.  It also comes in medium and dark shades.</li>
            <li> I personally don&#x27;t like this moisturizer at all. It leaves my skin super shiny and leaves behind a greasy feeling film.  The only thing I like about it is the smell. I think you&#x27;d get the same effect by using a couple of drops of olive oil.</li>
            <li> Used everyday for 2 months and saw no improvement.  Also the tint is almost non existent.  Try something else, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> LOVE  to use this....  nothing more  to say except I use it every day..and  absolutely love how it feels and looks.</li>
            <li> This product is hard to find in local CVS and Walgreens, so I order it through Amazon, which is often cheaper anyway.  It provides good moisturizing, even in the desert clime in which I live. The light, vs. the medium tint is a little light, so in the winter I mix it with the medium.  I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product.  It&#x27;s light and has just enough of a tint to make a difference.  I&#x27;ve tried many other products, and this one wins hands down.</li>
            <li> Said you cannot find in the store anymore. Think some folks complained about an orange tint...if the product gets old or exposed to light while in the container it will turn more orange on your skin. I have no trouble blending in tho. Might not buy anymore online as the product not being made and the stash that folks have, even new, will just age out...could not find a \\&quot;best by\\&quot; date on mine but it was fine. My next purchase might have to be the Aveeno tinted moisturizer or Neutrogena...something a little \\&quot;fresher\\&quot;. Sure did/do love the way this stuff makes my skin feel. Did not even need foundation with this!</li>
            <li> I Love this product -- had purchased previously in stores and then could not find it in any stores and I was so bummed out, I was so glad when I found it at Amazon.Com--it gives your face a nice glow and it is not heavy like some makeup.  I also gave some to my friend and she loves it also.  Until I found this at Amazon I tried other makeup and was so disappointed in how it felt - so heavy.</li>
            <li> I use this product every day for its moisturizing benefits.  The tint is perfect - not too dark, and easy to blend.  I don&#x27;t know why L&#x27;Oreal stopped making it.  I bought a bunch so that I don&#x27;t run out any time soon.</li>
            <li> Ive just started using these products in the line and love them all. I am seeing changes a week in so at 4 weeks in as they advertise I cant wait to see the difference. I am pretty tan in the summer, and so I dont see a tint to my face, but the complexion and texture are better already.</li>
            <li> I was very happy to find this item through Amazon since I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore. I have been using it for years and like it much better than foundation.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It moisturizes while giving just a tint of color. It makes my skin come alive without the heavy look of most foundations. I tried Olay Definity and many other tinted moisturizers, but this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It has just the right amount of tint. Does not sink into wrinkles in a way that highlights them like some other tinted moisturizers. Leaves a nice glow which gives older skin a dewy look. I don&#x27;t know why L&#x27;Oreal discontinued it! I called them and was told that comments are passed on to marketing. It was discontinued in 2010. The shelf life, unopened is 3 years so if you like this product, call them! Time is running out.</li>
            <li> The quality was what I expected -- very good.  Why did Loreal ever discontinue this product?  I will definitely order this again.  Better price?</li>
            <li> Yes it looks orange a little when you first put it on. After it dries though it seems to go away. I do really like this product , it hasn&#x27;t made me break out like most creams and my skin does seem healthier.</li>
            <li> A truly new product, like nothing else I have seen. I think some Amazon reviewers had different expectations for this product than I did.  L&#x27;Oreal describes it as a \\&quot;Radiance Perfector, Sheer Tint Moisturizer,\\&quot; and that is exactly what it is.  Think of it as a radiance enhancer, moisturizer and sunscreen in one. I put this on, and I just look healthier--a bit tanner, softly glowing, not \\&quot;made up.\\&quot; The benefits are immediate.      The SPF12 sunscreen makes it great for day use. I use it instead of make-up for a light natural look. Just add blush and eye make-up, and I&#x27;m done--so easy!      Note: younger women who already have youthful glowing skin will not need (nor likely benefit from) this product.  As L&#x27;Oreal says, it is \\&quot;for mature dull skin.\\&quot;  Ladies \\&quot;of a certain age\\&quot; will understand.  I am so glad this product is on the market!</li>
            <li> I have found a product that gives me a glow that no other product does.  It provides a hint of cover-up with protection from the sun at the same time.  It has a glow to it that is amazing.  Wonderful product...recomened to co-workers after they kept commenting on how I looked and now they are using as well.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t call this a sheer tint, I looked like an OOmpa Loompa cousin. I have fair skin with freckles, and a bit of a yellow undertone. This stuff felt silky smooth going on, looked light coming out of the bottle, but left my face two-three orange tones darker. I had to wash it off.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel moist while it produces a slight tint to my face. Doesn&#x27;t have that caked on feeling. Love it!</li>
            <li> While product was very moisturizing, it seem to peel  .I  couldn&#x27;t wear under make-up.  Even wearing alone, it seemed to fake and peel.</li>
            <li> i love this product because it combines mositurizei with color - and&lt;br /&gt;i don&#x27;t have to start with foundation and then apply color -&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t know how i would do without it - also the delivery and service was top notch  ethel</li>
            <li> l have been using this tinned moisturizer for a long time and do not need to wear foundation covers up the small&lt;br /&gt;marks of the skin</li>
            <li> The pump is not working.  I have to slam it many times to get a squirt out.  I&#x27;ve never had this problem before and I have used it for years.</li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t use this product&lt;br /&gt;made my eyes burn and swell&lt;br /&gt;would not recommend to anyone&lt;br /&gt;did not like product at all</li>
            <li> I ordered two and one of the moisturizers was watery.  I still use it but it is not as good as it usually is.</li>
            <li> My only criticism is that this product seems to be unavailable ! It is my favorite tinted moisturizer . Have not found a better product !</li>
            <li> I love it its hard to find and I was able to find it here it lasted very long time to love the product.</li>
            <li> Gives your skin a glow without greasy leftovers.  This is my third container and I consider  it  must have before putting  on foundation.  When I don&#x27;t wear foundation I still wear this!</li>
            <li> Smoothes my skin with just enough coverage without full make up.  I have Rosacea &amp; find the slight tint is just what is needed.  The illunimation brightens skin!</li>
            <li> I like the product and have been buying it on ebay and other places for Years. When I purchased this product, one container was damaged and had a leak. I notified the vendor and they replaced it right away. Certainly a 5 star service! Thank you.</li>
            <li> Just started using it so my expectation  is not met 100%. It is working slowly. May be down the road it might work 100% at least that is the hope!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before. I purchased  it at the pharmacy I deal with. The price at Amazon can&#x27;t be beat and the product is great. I paid more than double the price at the Pharmacy. I intend to order another very soon.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best tinted moisturizers I&#x27;ve ever used!  It does a great job of evening out skin tone and giving you a slight glow.  Perfect for winter skin and price is great online.</li>
            <li> My boss told me about this product because I asked her what she uses on her skin to make it glow the way it did. She bought me my first bottle of it. I bought several myself after that and then I couldn&#x27;t find it in any store where I use to get it. The cosmetic lady at Walgreens told me to go online to Amazon.com and I could probably find it there. Well she was right and I am so glad she gave me the tip because I can&#x27;t live without this product now. I just love the way my skin looks and the slight tint it gives my skin. I get a lot of compliments now on the way my face looks, pretty good at the age of 57, and now I don&#x27;t have to wear heavy make-up and have that thick make-up look. I just love it and I hope Amazon will keep it on their list! Thanks, Amazon. Sincerly yours, Carol Poulsen</li>
            <li> I am so pleased I found Loreal Age Perfect Pro-Calcium Radiance Perfector on Amazon.  I have had problems finding this in the stores so I sought out the internet.  The price was absolutely amazing - much less than I would find in the stores.  This product provides the color and glow that I need for my very dry skin.  It makes your skin appear healthy with just the right amount of tint.  You can add additional makeup if you like but unless I am going out for an evening, it is not needed.  Great product but even greater price on Amazon!</li>
            <li> This looked promising in the bottle - light and glowy - but it turns orange as I spread it on my skin. If I spread it very thin, the effect is less noticeable, but still not appealing. If I put it on over another moisturizer, the effect is delayed and it looks good at first - but after ten minutes, it&#x27;s oompa loompa time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When there&#x27;s a little left at the opening, it also turns orange at the edges, so this may have to do with exposure to the air.</li>
            <li> El producto me llego en buen estado, estoy satisfecho con la compra lo recomiendo 100% no tengo quejas,&lt;br /&gt;Muchas gracias por el servicio.</li>
            <li> All I know is that for some reason my wife could not locate this product in the locale market, so perhaps it is no longer marketed. That didn&#x27;t stop my wife from adding it to her gift list, so the hunt was on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased two in fear that supplies would soon disappear. She was delighted. &#x27;nuff said</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have purchased this product.  It is extremely hard to find in a drug store, and works wonders with my 74 year old skin.  I will continue to order it over time.  I have found no satisfactory replacement and the order was filled promptly with no hassle.  Thanks for having it available.</li>
            <li> I have always used this product..Unfortunately L&#x27;oreal had decided to discontinue this particular item and replace it with &amp;#34;BB Cream!&amp;#34;  I am always so happy to find it on Amazon....I should buy up everything in sight before it completly disappears from the market...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jackie</li>
            <li> I like the product very much, however, it appeared as though the container wasn&#x27;t as completely full as it used to be when I could purchase it over the counter.  Also, it is much more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is there some reason it is not being carried in the drug stores any more?</li>
            <li> The moisture has a slight tint which I like and a smooth feeling on my skin. I would recommend the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my sixties, pretty fit for my age - I&#x27;m slim and work out regularly. But, I haven&#x27;t been happy with lots of make-up products because they seem to give the skin a dry, dull look rather than a radiance. As soon as I used this product my skin felt hydrated and really radiant. I&#x27;m very fair skinned and it does not look orange on me. I use this and then dab a very tiny bit of foundation over it. I live in S. Calif. &amp; very much exposed to sun just by walking out my door. My skin feels hydrated all day. Just applying the product gives me a cooling, refreshing feeling.</li>
            <li> In the &amp;#34;golden years&amp;#34;, flaws cannot be lightened, smoothed or wished away,no matter what THEY  say.  This product simply moistens and gives a gentle color to a face that has seen 80 years of happy life. I can only get the &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; shade however, since it was discontinued.  Any &amp;#34;mediums&amp;#34; out there?</li>
            <li> I love this product because not only does it moisturize but it has a natural tint of colour which makes your face glow.  Everytime I wear it, I am asked if I just came back from a holiday.</li>
            <li> I think this is great, I use it all the time, It makes my skin feel awesome, I just love useing it</li>
            <li> I hope I can keep purchasing this cream from you because it came quickly and effortlessly.&lt;br /&gt;The product is perfect tone for my skin and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Does not look natural on the skin at all. The color gives a really tan or yellow cast, looking very unnatural. After a couple hours does the color fade to the color of your skin but it looks really odd when you first put it on. It is slightly hydrating however the color doesn&#x27;t look nice at all.  Recommend a different tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li> When I look as if I am not awake yet, I put a little of this under my eyes and on my cheeks--like magic, it brightens up my face.  I do not like using it over my entire face, however, as it is a bit shiny.  Great for traveling when you stay up too late and need that little pick up in the am.</li>
            <li> This stuff is hard to find anymore &amp; when you do find it,  it&#x27;s expensive.  I love it,  great product.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews for this product and many others, and that&#x27;s what I went by for my purchase.  I, however, found this one to be a bit on the greasy side and orange looking on my skin.  It may just be that my chemistry doesn&#x27;t mix well with it.  I&#x27;ve been using BB creams for years, and that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ll stick with.</li>
            <li> Gifted this to my mother as she has used in the past as well..Just make sure the color u is acceptable and matches of actual user.&lt;br /&gt;Nice product.&lt;br /&gt;Cheers</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and love it.  I now use it on my 87 year old mom.  It adds luster to her skin and does not embed itself in the wisdom lines.  I have no idea why they have discontinued so a great product.</li>
            <li> This is a staple in my makeup collection.  I love this product and have used it for years.  Try it and you&#x27;ll see!  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I like this product so much that I order a few at a time, just in case i run out quicker than usual. It is so light and fresh that your skin can breathe and glow at the same time</li>
            <li> I used this for years... drug store not slling anymore... happy to find..perfect make up for a 70 yr. old...looks so natural...love it.</li>
            <li> Love the product, very natural!  Really hope this doesn&#x27;t get discontinued.  I use it all winter, makes me look more healthy!</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed using this product for years.  It&#x27;s my everyday go to. Very natural no make up look.&lt;br /&gt;Too bad it&#x27;s discontinued.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that it makes me look younger, but sure like the way it goes on.  Will purchase again if available.</li>
            <li> I just used up my Loreal medium tint and loved it.  I ordered the medium tint and received the light tint. It&#x27;s still a great product, but I&#x27;d prefer the medium for my complexion.</li>
            <li> Now I have them and I don&#x27;t like but I have to keep them for while I whisk I can exchange</li>
            <li> i purchase these product thinking was a copy of the original, i think l&#x27;oreal discontinue this product on major store.,this is definely the same and i will buy again, great moisturizer, i dont use anything else</li>
    </ol>
