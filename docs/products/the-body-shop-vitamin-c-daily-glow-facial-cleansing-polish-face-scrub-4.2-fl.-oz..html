            <li>It needs special way to get it lather on the face to get the good cleaning</li>
            <li>I would like to see better pricing deals</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really experienced much of the brightening effects that a vitamin C cleanser should have.  </li>
            <li>It may be okay for most people, but for those who have skin that is prone to dryness, I would skip this cleanser.</li>
            <li>Gives a healthy glow to your skin</li>
            <li>Love this microdermabrasion cleanser.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell of orange.</li>
            <li>Topped off with the vitamin C moisturizer, and my skin is looking pretty good these days.</li>
            <li>My skin gets very dried out with most products but this stuff is perfect!</li>
            <li>Have been using it for over a year and it makes my skin super smooth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had really good luck with this line of facial products.</li>
            <li>Good product for deep cleansing.  </li>
            <li>I have experienced a little dryness since I&#x27;ve been using it.  </li>
            <li>This is the only product I love to use on my face for cleansing.&lt;br /&gt;It is gentle, mild, good for sensitive skins.</li>
            <li>Works beautifully, doesnt further dry the skin</li>
            <li>My favorite facial cleanser, I have been using it for years.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I cleanse my face 2-3 times a day and it is perfect for that much times to use per day (specially for mixed skin).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been given free cleaner samples and used them, all gave a dry, tight, or/and irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>There are not many exfoliating particles in this &amp;#34;polish&amp;#34;, making it less effective than other products that have more exfoliating particles than this.</li>
            <li>Freeman&#x27;s Charcoal and Black Sugar Scrub exfoliates much more thoroughly at a fraction of the price, and Ren&#x27;s Glycol Lactic Radiance Renewal Mask actually reveals radiant skin after use.</li>
            <li>Keeps my face clear of blemishes.</li>
            <li>The grains are soft and fine-not scratchy or abrasive at all.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve had really good luck with this line of facial products. I have mature skin with sun damage and this has really helped.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend although a family member thought it somewhat harsh. Not sure if this is for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have seborrhea, and this does the trick to get rid of flaky skin.  Topped off with the vitamin C moisturizer, and my skin is looking pretty good these days.</li>
            <li> Works beautifully, doesnt further dry the skin</li>
            <li> Excellent product for my type of skin. I highly recommend it . I would like to see better pricing deals</li>

            <li> This product claims to brighten the skin, but the only brightening effect obtained is through the basic exfoliation it provides that could be achieved with a much less expensive basic exfoliant. Not only is it incredibly basic, there are much better face exfoliants out there. There are not many exfoliating particles in this &amp;#34;polish&amp;#34;, making it less effective than other products that have more exfoliating particles than this. I had high hopes for this product. I bought it to brighten and aid in the fading of post acne marks, but I could have bought a three dollar scrub and gotten the same results. I&#x27;ve used it for several months and noticed no brightening from all the vitamin C that this product supposedly has. Freeman&#x27;s Charcoal and Black Sugar Scrub exfoliates much more thoroughly at a fraction of the price, and Ren&#x27;s Glycol Lactic Radiance Renewal Mask actually reveals radiant skin after use. Save your money and try something else!</li>

            <li> The product arrived in plenty of time for the holidays and the gift was well received! I recommend this product to everyone.</li>

            <li> My favorite facial cleanser, I have been using it for years. I am always being complimented on my skin.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I love to use on my face for cleansing.&lt;br /&gt;It is gentle, mild, good for sensitive skins. It needs special way to get it lather on the face to get the good cleaning feeling.&lt;br /&gt;I use sometimes my hands and sometimes a cleansing rubber brush.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is mixed and this product allow me to get clean feeling for along time before it get oily and it never dries it.&lt;br /&gt;I cleanse my face 2-3 times a day and it is perfect for that much times to use per day (specially for mixed skin).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been given free cleaner samples and used them, all gave a dry, tight, or/and irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this product is gentle on skin and suitable for combine, sensitive skin (from my personal experience).</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this stuff, makes my face feel very refreshed! My skin gets very dried out with most products but this stuff is perfect! Shipping is always on time, and I also use the skin clearing tea tree products.  Also love those!</li>
            <li> Gives a healthy glow to your skin</li>
            <li> Love the smell and works great and gets my skin squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> Love this microdermabrasion cleanser.  Have been using it for over a year and it makes my skin super smooth.  Cheaper on here than in the store!</li>
            <li> Cleans well. Love the smell of orange. Face feels slightly tingly after use.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this cleanser is perfect-very gentle exfoliation without bothering or irritating my skin. I use it every night without any skin irritation.  The grains are soft and fine-not scratchy or abrasive at all.</li>
