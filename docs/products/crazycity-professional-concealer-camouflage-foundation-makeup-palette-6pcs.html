            <li> This is a powder. It stays on well, and for a novice at contouring it works great. I have fair skin but I use basically every shade. This is definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Not very much coverage. I wish it were cream. My mistake.</li>

            <li> I knew when I purchased this that it was powder and not cream based on the reviews and because a friend of mine had bought it and shared the link with me. I&#x27;m new to contouring and highlighting and I believe this is the perfect purchase for beginners like me. It has good pigmentation in all the colors and neither of the darker colors are too dark for my pale skin. I love this and I&#x27;m glad I purchased it!</li>
