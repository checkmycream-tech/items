            <li>Great price!</li>
            <li>I saw the quickest and best result</li>
            <li>Shipping was great.</li>
            <li>Now he is happy because he has almost $30 dollars, and we are happy because the fungus has disappear a lot.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I think it is doing a great job.</li>
            <li>, I use it now 2 times a week just in case and my feet look great.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>The nails are not 100% perfect, but they are considerably better than when I started  using it.  </li>
            <li>Good luck.  </li>
            <li>I have my nails done fairly often at a salon</li>
            <li>Recommended by a someone who runs a salon it seems to be working fairly well.  </li>
            <li>To be fair</li>
            <li>Good luck.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why Dr. G&#x27;s product is a good choice.</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply, perfect consistency - my nail is growing out nice and healthy...</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied.</li>
            <li>It is very safe in our experience, and when I googled it, there are no health warnings associated with its use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have recommended this product to friends, and they too have been pleased with the results!</li>
            <li>I hope it stays healthy once I do paint them again!</li>
            <li>The best part is seeing results fast!  </li>
            <li>I wish the Amazon ad was honest - it is not.  </li>
            <li>Yes it has been keeping nail looking nice</li>
            <li>Tolnaftate can be effective in some cases for fungus, so not a 1-star review, although the product description is misleading.</li>
            <li>What a nice side effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Soak your nails in epsom salts and warm water to soften nail area.&lt;br</li>
            <li>a nice pleasent product to use, but i wasnt to impressed with the results, i didnt see where it did much for the nails</li>
            <li>i think this is the best product out there by far.</li>
            <li>Will have to see how the nail grows out, but I am very happy so far.</li>
            <li>I have seen incredible results, but  I have also applied it twice a day for over a year, and then it really started to manifest results.  </li>
            <li>It also showed results very quickly!</li>
            <li>I found this product at a discount store and bought it very cheap</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait for summer to show off my \\&quot;new\\&quot; cute toes.  </li>
            <li>There is one sure and inexpensive remedy for toe nail fungus.</li>
            <li>It appears to be working, of course it takes 6 to 12 months for a nail to grow out to know for sure.</li>
            <li>But, Dr. G&#x27;s Nails is much better than those products I had before.</li>
            <li>how many times he forgot to place the treatment over his feet.</li>
            <li>I am an award winning manicurist and we used to tell any client who came in with a fungus to use this twice a day for 3 months and the fungus would be gone.  </li>
            <li>and I needed more</li>
            <li>After just a couple of weeks of use, most of my toe nail fungus was gone.</li>
            <li>Im pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update 061013:  Been using this on and off since February - mostly on.  </li>
            <li>I used the oil after every hand washing and on top of the Dr. G&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll just take more time.</li>
            <li>The more you can remove, the better your results.</li>
            <li>and I cut my nail, and put the stuff on the top of my nail and tried to put it underneath the nail.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>My nails did not get any better or look any better.</li>
            <li>I may keep using this more faithfully and see if it gets better.</li>
            <li>but it is perfectly OK for use on fingernails.</li>
            <li>My nails almost immediately begin to look better and get close to being healed, and then I forget to use Dr. G&#x27;s, and soon afterward, the nail begins to separate from the nailbed.  </li>
            <li>Dr. G&#x27;s will make your nail healthy again if you give it time.  </li>
            <li>It was affordable and had pretty good reviews.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s available online.</li>
            <li>And be able to go get a manicure (at a clean salon) without feeling embarrassed.    </li>
            <li>This is an easy way to treat fungal on nails whether it&#x27;s your feet or hands that need to have treatment</li>
            <li>Not greasy, easy to use and carry with you.  </li>
            <li>However, if you use it on you toenails only, it appears to work great.  </li>
            <li>please sell products that work...not looking for a miracle just real and honest results.  </li>
            <li>Seems to be a cheap product.</li>
            <li>Important: refrain from using nail polish or having mani/</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important you put the solution around your cuticle/nailbed area.</li>
            <li>Initially, the formula for Dr G was benzalkonium chloride, which worked great on my yucky toenails and allowed me to wear polish.</li>
            <li>It has been a month and so far, so good.  </li>
            <li>I always like to share products on the market that really work and this one did for me!!!</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s unique to nails.</li>
            <li>She bought another bottle and we are excited to track the results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>just kept them clean  </li>
            <li>My nail fungus is pretty mild, just more of a raised nail (not attached to my nail bed) problem.</li>
            <li>she are unwilling to offer their full name - I wouldn&#x27;t either</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day for about 2 weeks now and my toenail is clear and growing out nicely.</li>
            <li>This product worked great for me after having a right foot great toe fungus problem for several years (may have been caused by tripping on coral on Maui, but most likely was from the pedicure I got prior to the trip).</li>
            <li>This clears it up fairly quickly, in just a couple of months.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect quick results with this or any nail fungus treatment.  </li>
            <li>The product shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>Finally, Use the Dr. G treatment solution on the nail, pushing it deep into the cuticles, and around and under the nail as best you can.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>I got 2 products - Dr G Clear nail and The Original Fungi Nail but Dr G happened to be the most used treatment</li>
            <li>So, after four months of using Dr. G&#x27;s, I&#x27;m looking at normal, healthy looking nails</li>
            <li>New nails have grown out to be healthy.</li>
            <li>In fact, I don&#x27;t think there is any more live fungus there</li>
            <li>and when I looked at her big toe nails, she has healthy nail growing out!</li>
            <li>works a little, don&#x27;t expect great things to happen tho.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really looking forward to fungus free nails in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li>All are far better than Dr. G&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I do not know more yet so far.</li>
            <li>and I was not crazy about taking a prescription medication to see if it would help (an option suggested by my doctor), so I decided to give this product a try</li>
            <li>As my nails continued to grow out, they cleared up considerably until completely clear and looked much more healthy.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products without results till a nail tech suggested CLEAR NAIL.</li>
            <li>I can say that the new nail growth looks very healthy and doesn&#x27;t show any of the peeling patches that the old growth shows.  </li>
            <li>I wish someone would come up with something that works extremely well, at a good price</li>
            <li>Nails cleared up right away.</li>
            <li>Soak the nail again, making sure everything&#x27;s clean, then dry off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I was first given Dr. G&#x27;s I didn&#x27;t use it faithfully.</li>
            <li>Push the gel into the nail, starting at the top and continue to apply around the cuticle area.</li>
            <li>This is the first time we are finishing with this fungus after almost 9 years!&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>my nail technician suggested it and gave me the first bottle</li>
            <li>Very dismaying!</li>
            <li>first trial.  </li>
            <li>Buy it if you want clear nails free from darken colors &amp; thickness.</li>
            <li>The Sally Hansen was working pretty well..</li>
            <li>I purchased two more bottles and will continue to use once every day until I&#x27;ve used the last one up then see how things go from there.  </li>
            <li>You do have to be consistent for any treatment to work well.  </li>
            <li>day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product does work but you do have to be patient as well as consistent.  </li>
            <li>; She was pretty diligent about using it twice a day</li>
            <li>First of all it took two months to get it.  </li>
            <li>Again, you must use it daily, more than once.  </li>
            <li>A regular manicure is OK, my manicurist said.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve got enough for about 2-3 more applications.  </li>
            <li>I first noticed discoloration getting lighter.  </li>
            <li>And a much larger band of healthy nail growing out from the nailbed.</li>
            <li>I saw results within the first week.  </li>
            <li>I had nail fungus for years and when I finally was rid of it for good after taking the internal medication, I wanted to make sure it never came back.  </li>
            <li>Not only has the fungus been stopped from growing but new growth is looking more hydrated and is a very healthy pink color</li>
            <li>I am still waiting for some positive results, hopefully I will reap some benefits from it use.</li>
            <li>Hopefully, it just needs a little more time!</li>
            <li>Oh, it says Clear Nail boldly and even pictures</li>
            <li>and is easy enough to use.</li>
            <li>I only used one bottle and it was easy to use</li>
            <li>It certainly isn&#x27;t a \\&quot;must have\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I just ordered a large bottle of Dr. G&#x27;s Antimicrobial Callus &amp; Cuticle Remover, and a bottle of Antimicrobial Spa Soak, both of which contain Benzalkonium Chloride.  </li>
            <li>Still using, but I don&#x27;t really see a difference.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this before and it really cleared up an infection I had.</li>
            <li>Feeling very deceived</li>
            <li>I started using it again in mid-December just to see if it would really work.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it to see clear nails.</li>
            <li>and it burned my skin very severely.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>After hand washing, the dryness is very noticeable.  </li>
            <li>this has helped so much.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see much difference.</li>
            <li>Then it didn&#x27;t seem to have any real effect on the problem.  </li>
            <li>I really like to know what else I can use for my mum to make clearer her nails.</li>
            <li>My nails are looking much healthier - although I wouldn&#x27;t say that I&#x27;m cured yet.</li>
            <li>It seems to be working very slowly, or not at all.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the product twice a day as suggested and a nice, new toenail is about half grown out.  </li>
            <li>not worth the money...there are othjer products that you can use that are so much better</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more when I get low!</li>
            <li>decided to start using a more expensive item and can already see more improvement.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>i filed a little off the top of my nails every day or 2.</li>
            <li>and I actually have a clear nail on my big toe and rest are looking 100% better.</li>
            <li>Whatever i cut was the green stuff that wasn&#x27;t even attached to the finger any more.</li>
            <li>Within 2 weeks the infection cleared and my nail is normal.</li>
            <li>It took about 3 months, but my toenail is finally normal again.</li>
            <li>patient, diligent and before you know it, your nail will be normal again.</li>
            <li>You absolutely have to use it on dry nails, and use it every every every single day for many months.</li>
            <li>If you buy this for a nail infection be ready to cut as much of the infected area off as possible.</li>
            <li>When I received this product, I was very surprised to see that the instructions say &amp;#34;not to be used for nails.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>once I cut my nails super short - down practically to the quick - stopped polishing and started putting on the product four times a day.  </li>
            <li>Some days I&#x27;m sure I forgot to use it at all, and other days I would apply it several times.</li>
            <li>It is not perfectly healthy yet, but i am not embarrassed any more.</li>
            <li>Be sure to disinfect any files or instruments you use every time you use them or you take the likely risk of it spreading to other nails.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Fabulous product so far!</li>
            <li>With this after three weeks it looked exactly the same as before I started using it.</li>
            <li>If the product has the name \\&quot;Clear</li>
            <li>Nail\\&quot;, one would assume that it is made to clear up nail fungus.  </li>
            <li>I have used Dr. G&#x27;s clear nail faithfully for 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>It will take about 2 months to clear up.</li>
            <li>I keep applying and will do it until the nail is completely clear.</li>
            <li>boy used DR.G clear Nail Antifungal since November 2013, three times a day.</li>
            <li>G Clear Nail.  </li>
            <li>G Clear Nail Antifungal Treatment&amp;#34; to treat my nail fungus.  </li>
            <li>I talked my Mom into buying Dr G&#x27;s Clear Nail Antifungal when we were at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply.</li>
            <li>At such a reasonable price, it is just what we needed.</li>
            <li>I have used this product twice and both times it completely healed the area.  </li>
            <li>My fingernail which had separated halfway up from the end of my nail has now grown out completely in one month.</li>
            <li>Considering how few options are available for treating nail fungus, I recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>The fungus had completely taken over the nail(s).</li>
            <li>So far, I can&#x27;t tell if it is working or not.</li>
            <li>it really does what it suppose  to do in a short time.</li>
            <li>but since i was so busy i decided to try something else before i do it.</li>
            <li>My boy had fungus since 4 years old.</li>
            <li>He also uses the treatment early in the morning and before going to bed.</li>
            <li>All of my adult life my toe nails progressively yellowed and darkened.</li>
            <li>I used neosporin and it fixed the problem.</li>
            <li>also use tea tree oil on my nails - straight out of the bottle and mixed into a home made cuticle oil using Bio Oil, tea tree oil and some of the Sally Hansen fungus treatment.  </li>
            <li>Using clippers, remove as much of the affected area as you possibly can.</li>
            <li>I will update you all when the project is complete.</li>
            <li>This product is not for nails at all - and it actually says right on the back of the tube - not to be used for nails!  </li>
            <li>This product worked on our familiy&#x27;s nail fungus when no other product would, including prescription medications!</li>
            <li>Lastly the raised nail started flattening out and returning to normal.</li>
            <li>My new nail is just now growing and I must continue the topical Lamicil.</li>
            <li>I am on day 3 of using this product and wanted to share my personal experience so far!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve added Dr. G&#x27;s to the regimen and apparently that was the final ingredient necessary to really kick some fungus butt.  </li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says it does!&lt;br /&gt;Better than any of the other fungus products on the market.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s important to continue using it even after the infection is gone because fungus can be aggressive and creep back if only a little of it remains.</li>
            <li>Over the course of 6-8 weeks, the majority of the nail became clear on both of my big toes</li>
            <li>Fungus can come back if it does not fully clear up.  </li>
            <li>My nail fungus will take several weeks to clear up, but...</li>
            <li>I have been using this product on and off for about two years on my big toenails which were injured and then developed a fungal infection.  </li>
            <li>Within a couple of weeks, the fungus started getting smaller, and within about 2 months it was completely gone.</li>
            <li>Push back cuticle as far as you can.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>The key is PERSISTENCE, don&#x27;t quit using it until the nail is completely attached.  </li>
            <li>They show a healthy and an unhealthy nail.  </li>
            <li>A few months ago, one of my fingernails developed a fungus that was growing really fast.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for the last 6 months on the advice of my manicurist &amp; it has completely cleared up the fungus &amp; unattached nail bed problems I have had for several</li>
            <li>I think the only way to really get rid of toenail fungus is by prescription, which is a drag.</li>
            <li>We have to clean the nails as much as possible at least one time every two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>The new formula is tolnaftate which, when I switched, because my old bottle was very old, and I thought this had to work at least as good, the fungus-like yuck came back worse than ever!!</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s how this whole mess started.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Good luck.  </li>
            <li> I have my nails done fairly often at a salon</li>
            <li> Recommended by a someone who runs a salon it seems to be working fairly well.  </li>
            <li> To be fair</li>
            <li> Good luck.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why Dr. G&#x27;s product is a good choice.</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply, perfect consistency - my nail is growing out nice and healthy...</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> It is very safe in our experience, and when I googled it, there are no health warnings associated with its use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have recommended this product to friends, and they too have been pleased with the results!</li>
            <li> I hope it stays healthy once I do paint them again!</li>
            <li> The best part is seeing results fast!  </li>
            <li> I wish the Amazon ad was honest - it is not.  </li>
            <li> Yes it has been keeping nail looking nice</li>
            <li> Tolnaftate can be effective in some cases for fungus, so not a 1-star review, although the product description is misleading.</li>
            <li> What a nice side effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Soak your nails in epsom salts and warm water to soften nail area.&lt;br</li>
            <li> a nice pleasent product to use, but i wasnt to impressed with the results, i didnt see where it did much for the nails</li>
            <li> i think this is the best product out there by far.</li>
            <li> Will have to see how the nail grows out, but I am very happy so far.</li>
            <li> I have seen incredible results, but  I have also applied it twice a day for over a year, and then it really started to manifest results.  </li>
            <li> It also showed results very quickly!</li>
            <li> I found this product at a discount store and bought it very cheap</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait for summer to show off my \\&quot;new\\&quot; cute toes.  </li>
            <li> There is one sure and inexpensive remedy for toe nail fungus.</li>
            <li> It appears to be working, of course it takes 6 to 12 months for a nail to grow out to know for sure.</li>
            <li> But, Dr. G&#x27;s Nails is much better than those products I had before.</li>
            <li> how many times he forgot to place the treatment over his feet.</li>
            <li> I am an award winning manicurist and we used to tell any client who came in with a fungus to use this twice a day for 3 months and the fungus would be gone.  </li>
            <li> and I needed more</li>
            <li> After just a couple of weeks of use, most of my toe nail fungus was gone.</li>
            <li> Im pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update 061013:  Been using this on and off since February - mostly on.  </li>
            <li> I used the oil after every hand washing and on top of the Dr. G&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll just take more time.</li>
            <li> The more you can remove, the better your results.</li>
            <li> and I cut my nail, and put the stuff on the top of my nail and tried to put it underneath the nail.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> My nails did not get any better or look any better.</li>
            <li> I may keep using this more faithfully and see if it gets better.</li>
            <li> but it is perfectly OK for use on fingernails.</li>
            <li> My nails almost immediately begin to look better and get close to being healed, and then I forget to use Dr. G&#x27;s, and soon afterward, the nail begins to separate from the nailbed.  </li>
            <li> Dr. G&#x27;s will make your nail healthy again if you give it time.  </li>
            <li> It was affordable and had pretty good reviews.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s available online.</li>
            <li> And be able to go get a manicure (at a clean salon) without feeling embarrassed.    </li>
            <li> This is an easy way to treat fungal on nails whether it&#x27;s your feet or hands that need to have treatment</li>
            <li> Not greasy, easy to use and carry with you.  </li>
            <li> However, if you use it on you toenails only, it appears to work great.  </li>
            <li> please sell products that work...not looking for a miracle just real and honest results.  </li>
            <li> Seems to be a cheap product.</li>
            <li> Important: refrain from using nail polish or having mani/</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important you put the solution around your cuticle/nailbed area.</li>
            <li> Initially, the formula for Dr G was benzalkonium chloride, which worked great on my yucky toenails and allowed me to wear polish.</li>
            <li> It has been a month and so far, so good.  </li>
            <li> I always like to share products on the market that really work and this one did for me!!!</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s unique to nails.</li>
            <li> She bought another bottle and we are excited to track the results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> just kept them clean  </li>
            <li> My nail fungus is pretty mild, just more of a raised nail (not attached to my nail bed) problem.</li>
            <li> she are unwilling to offer their full name - I wouldn&#x27;t either</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day for about 2 weeks now and my toenail is clear and growing out nicely.</li>
            <li> This product worked great for me after having a right foot great toe fungus problem for several years (may have been caused by tripping on coral on Maui, but most likely was from the pedicure I got prior to the trip).</li>
            <li> This clears it up fairly quickly, in just a couple of months.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect quick results with this or any nail fungus treatment.  </li>
            <li> The product shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Finally, Use the Dr. G treatment solution on the nail, pushing it deep into the cuticles, and around and under the nail as best you can.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I got 2 products - Dr G Clear nail and The Original Fungi Nail but Dr G happened to be the most used treatment</li>
            <li> So, after four months of using Dr. G&#x27;s, I&#x27;m looking at normal, healthy looking nails</li>
            <li> New nails have grown out to be healthy.</li>
            <li> In fact, I don&#x27;t think there is any more live fungus there</li>
            <li> and when I looked at her big toe nails, she has healthy nail growing out!</li>
            <li> works a little, don&#x27;t expect great things to happen tho.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really looking forward to fungus free nails in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li> All are far better than Dr. G&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I do not know more yet so far.</li>
            <li> and I was not crazy about taking a prescription medication to see if it would help (an option suggested by my doctor), so I decided to give this product a try</li>
            <li> As my nails continued to grow out, they cleared up considerably until completely clear and looked much more healthy.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products without results till a nail tech suggested CLEAR NAIL.</li>
            <li> I can say that the new nail growth looks very healthy and doesn&#x27;t show any of the peeling patches that the old growth shows.  </li>
            <li> I wish someone would come up with something that works extremely well, at a good price</li>
            <li> Nails cleared up right away.</li>
            <li> Soak the nail again, making sure everything&#x27;s clean, then dry off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I was first given Dr. G&#x27;s I didn&#x27;t use it faithfully.</li>
            <li> Push the gel into the nail, starting at the top and continue to apply around the cuticle area.</li>
            <li> This is the first time we are finishing with this fungus after almost 9 years!&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> my nail technician suggested it and gave me the first bottle</li>
            <li> Very dismaying!</li>
            <li> first trial.  </li>
            <li> Buy it if you want clear nails free from darken colors &amp; thickness.</li>
            <li> The Sally Hansen was working pretty well..</li>
            <li> I purchased two more bottles and will continue to use once every day until I&#x27;ve used the last one up then see how things go from there.  </li>
            <li> You do have to be consistent for any treatment to work well.  </li>
            <li> day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product does work but you do have to be patient as well as consistent.  </li>
            <li> ; She was pretty diligent about using it twice a day</li>
            <li> First of all it took two months to get it.  </li>
            <li> Again, you must use it daily, more than once.  </li>
            <li> A regular manicure is OK, my manicurist said.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve got enough for about 2-3 more applications.  </li>
            <li> I first noticed discoloration getting lighter.  </li>
            <li> And a much larger band of healthy nail growing out from the nailbed.</li>
            <li> I saw results within the first week.  </li>
            <li> I had nail fungus for years and when I finally was rid of it for good after taking the internal medication, I wanted to make sure it never came back.  </li>
            <li> Not only has the fungus been stopped from growing but new growth is looking more hydrated and is a very healthy pink color</li>
            <li> I am still waiting for some positive results, hopefully I will reap some benefits from it use.</li>
            <li> Hopefully, it just needs a little more time!</li>
            <li> Oh, it says Clear Nail boldly and even pictures</li>
            <li> and is easy enough to use.</li>
            <li> I only used one bottle and it was easy to use</li>
            <li> It certainly isn&#x27;t a \\&quot;must have\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I just ordered a large bottle of Dr. G&#x27;s Antimicrobial Callus &amp; Cuticle Remover, and a bottle of Antimicrobial Spa Soak, both of which contain Benzalkonium Chloride.  </li>
            <li> Still using, but I don&#x27;t really see a difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this before and it really cleared up an infection I had.</li>
            <li> Feeling very deceived</li>
            <li> I started using it again in mid-December just to see if it would really work.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it to see clear nails.</li>
            <li> and it burned my skin very severely.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> After hand washing, the dryness is very noticeable.  </li>
            <li> this has helped so much.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see much difference.</li>
            <li> Then it didn&#x27;t seem to have any real effect on the problem.  </li>
            <li> I really like to know what else I can use for my mum to make clearer her nails.</li>
            <li> My nails are looking much healthier - although I wouldn&#x27;t say that I&#x27;m cured yet.</li>
            <li> It seems to be working very slowly, or not at all.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the product twice a day as suggested and a nice, new toenail is about half grown out.  </li>
            <li> not worth the money...there are othjer products that you can use that are so much better</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy more when I get low!</li>
            <li> decided to start using a more expensive item and can already see more improvement.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> i filed a little off the top of my nails every day or 2.</li>
            <li> and I actually have a clear nail on my big toe and rest are looking 100% better.</li>
            <li> Whatever i cut was the green stuff that wasn&#x27;t even attached to the finger any more.</li>
            <li> Within 2 weeks the infection cleared and my nail is normal.</li>
            <li> It took about 3 months, but my toenail is finally normal again.</li>
            <li> patient, diligent and before you know it, your nail will be normal again.</li>
            <li> You absolutely have to use it on dry nails, and use it every every every single day for many months.</li>
            <li> If you buy this for a nail infection be ready to cut as much of the infected area off as possible.</li>
            <li> When I received this product, I was very surprised to see that the instructions say &amp;#34;not to be used for nails.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> once I cut my nails super short - down practically to the quick - stopped polishing and started putting on the product four times a day.  </li>
            <li> Some days I&#x27;m sure I forgot to use it at all, and other days I would apply it several times.</li>
            <li> It is not perfectly healthy yet, but i am not embarrassed any more.</li>
            <li> Be sure to disinfect any files or instruments you use every time you use them or you take the likely risk of it spreading to other nails.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Fabulous product so far!</li>
            <li> With this after three weeks it looked exactly the same as before I started using it.</li>
            <li> If the product has the name \\&quot;Clear</li>
            <li> Nail\\&quot;, one would assume that it is made to clear up nail fungus.  </li>
            <li> I have used Dr. G&#x27;s clear nail faithfully for 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> It will take about 2 months to clear up.</li>
            <li> I keep applying and will do it until the nail is completely clear.</li>
            <li> boy used DR.G clear Nail Antifungal since November 2013, three times a day.</li>
            <li> G Clear Nail.  </li>
            <li> G Clear Nail Antifungal Treatment&amp;#34; to treat my nail fungus.  </li>
            <li> I talked my Mom into buying Dr G&#x27;s Clear Nail Antifungal when we were at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply.</li>
            <li> At such a reasonable price, it is just what we needed.</li>
            <li> I have used this product twice and both times it completely healed the area.  </li>
            <li> My fingernail which had separated halfway up from the end of my nail has now grown out completely in one month.</li>
            <li> Considering how few options are available for treating nail fungus, I recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> The fungus had completely taken over the nail(s).</li>
            <li> So far, I can&#x27;t tell if it is working or not.</li>
            <li> it really does what it suppose  to do in a short time.</li>
            <li> but since i was so busy i decided to try something else before i do it.</li>
            <li> My boy had fungus since 4 years old.</li>
            <li> He also uses the treatment early in the morning and before going to bed.</li>
            <li> All of my adult life my toe nails progressively yellowed and darkened.</li>
            <li> I used neosporin and it fixed the problem.</li>
            <li> also use tea tree oil on my nails - straight out of the bottle and mixed into a home made cuticle oil using Bio Oil, tea tree oil and some of the Sally Hansen fungus treatment.  </li>
            <li> Using clippers, remove as much of the affected area as you possibly can.</li>
            <li> I will update you all when the project is complete.</li>
            <li> This product is not for nails at all - and it actually says right on the back of the tube - not to be used for nails!  </li>
            <li> This product worked on our familiy&#x27;s nail fungus when no other product would, including prescription medications!</li>
            <li> Lastly the raised nail started flattening out and returning to normal.</li>
            <li> My new nail is just now growing and I must continue the topical Lamicil.</li>
            <li> I am on day 3 of using this product and wanted to share my personal experience so far!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve added Dr. G&#x27;s to the regimen and apparently that was the final ingredient necessary to really kick some fungus butt.  </li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says it does!&lt;br /&gt;Better than any of the other fungus products on the market.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s important to continue using it even after the infection is gone because fungus can be aggressive and creep back if only a little of it remains.</li>
            <li> Over the course of 6-8 weeks, the majority of the nail became clear on both of my big toes</li>
            <li> Fungus can come back if it does not fully clear up.  </li>
            <li> My nail fungus will take several weeks to clear up, but...</li>
            <li> I have been using this product on and off for about two years on my big toenails which were injured and then developed a fungal infection.  </li>
            <li> Within a couple of weeks, the fungus started getting smaller, and within about 2 months it was completely gone.</li>
            <li> Push back cuticle as far as you can.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> The key is PERSISTENCE, don&#x27;t quit using it until the nail is completely attached.  </li>
            <li> They show a healthy and an unhealthy nail.  </li>
            <li> A few months ago, one of my fingernails developed a fungus that was growing really fast.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for the last 6 months on the advice of my manicurist &amp; it has completely cleared up the fungus &amp; unattached nail bed problems I have had for several</li>
            <li> I think the only way to really get rid of toenail fungus is by prescription, which is a drag.</li>
            <li> We have to clean the nails as much as possible at least one time every two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> The new formula is tolnaftate which, when I switched, because my old bottle was very old, and I thought this had to work at least as good, the fungus-like yuck came back worse than ever!!</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s how this whole mess started.  </li>
            <li> Based on other reviews, I thought that all it would do is stop the fungus from growing or spreading, and that my nail would have to grow all the way out in order to completely get rid of it.</li>
            <li> Even though it did clear up the some of the dark places it did not totally take care of the problem.</li>
            <li> anything to get rid of a green spot in otherwise decent nails.</li>
            <li> Remember, my fungus actually had the toenail growing strange, so it had been there for awhile.  </li>
            <li> manicure which is long lasting, I should&#x27;ve had it removed as soon as the nail got hurt but who knew.  </li>
            <li> This is the second time I have bought this product because of the packaging thinking it was for toenail fungus only to read down further where it says it is not for nails.</li>
            <li> I tend to (as I get older) get a fungus under my nails and in the past my toenails.</li>
            <li> Cheap, misleading product that doesn&#x27;t work at all vs. expensive product that works to some extent.  </li>
            <li> as long as I didn&#x27;t polish.  </li>
            <li> and if the product was opened could only get a partial return.</li>
            <li> so I can apply it if I&#x27;m gone long time.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a long haul to get rid of fungus but don&#x27;t stop trying.  </li>
            <li> Seems to be working but again, long haul with fungus.</li>
            <li> with any fungus treatment, it takes a long time to kill the infection.  </li>
            <li> The white lines were less visible and the yellow color was improved.  </li>
            <li> I dry under my nails with alcohol and then use it at night to let it sit under the acrylic.</li>
            <li> Why does it say directly on the back label, \\&quot;This product is not effective on scalp or nails\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> &quot; to be gone, continue for at least another month or until your toenails looks normal again.</li>
            <li> The infected part of the toe nails appears to be slowly growing out and is being replaced by normal looking toe nails.</li>
            <li> Active ingredient is different if you read carefully.</li>
            <li> It is only about half a cm at this point</li>
            <li> There was just a little left</li>
            <li> Next, use a little bit of rubbing alcohol on the affected area.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it treatment is not effective whit nail fungus why named clear nail?and</li>
            <li> G&#x27;s also makes a product under the Clear Nail name that has tolnaftate, which is an antifungal commonly used for athlete&#x27;s foot, jock itch and feminine yeast infections.  </li>
            <li> i got fungus toes in the military and</li>
            <li> I tried this for a few months, applying several times a day and there was no improvement.</li>
            <li> Within week I could see a big change in one of my nails that has been giving my trouble.</li>
            <li> I apparently am allergic to this and usually have no skin problems.</li>
            <li> The nail beds are pink, just like they should be.  </li>
            <li> I never really saw improvement in toenails.</li>
            <li> I waited after buying this product, and applying it everyday on my big toenail, for over a month.</li>
            <li> If I persistently use Dr. G&#x27;s three times daily, my fungus is killed and the nails begin to re-attach to the nailbed.  </li>
            <li> I have used other products that are in a Pen with a brush on the end</li>
            <li> and i notice about 70% improvement in two other toes.</li>
            <li> I have persistent nail fungus because my nails won&#x27;t stay connected to the nailbed due to nail psoriasis.  </li>
            <li> Local pharmacies and beauty supply stores used to carry this product, but now it&#x27;s hard to find.</li>
            <li> Small bottle lasts long time...</li>
            <li> The Dr. G&#x27;s really sinks in so that by the time I&#x27;ve rubbed it in and waited a few minutes before putting on lotion, all the dryness disappears.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want to cut your nails down and go without polish for the duration, the product will still work.  </li>
            <li> The dead space between the nail and nailbed tends to stay moist in the extreme Houston heat and humidity.  </li>
            <li> Went back to using the Xenna product which does work but is ridiculously expensive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take</li>
            <li> the thickness vanished less than 3 months.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how I got it unless it has sat dormant since the 80&#x27;s when I had acrylics and had to stop because of two nails going black underneath.  </li>
            <li> I took half my toenail off and clipped/filed the remaining nail bed.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> I read the previous reviews that it needs time to work, so I gave it time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> you must incorporate this ritual everyday for results.it does have proven results if ya work at it.</li>
            <li> For me it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday after shower and filing my nails.</li>
            <li> In the winter months I wear socks 24/7, thus causing moisture in the nail bed to turn green.</li>
            <li> It was just a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> waste of money</li>
            <li> After I use them a few times, I will post reviews on those products, also.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not clear in the description, but this product is just a thin formula Tolnaftate lotion.</li>
            <li> When using this product it should work at least a little.  </li>
            <li> As my toenail grows out, it has no more abnormal growth; looks just like it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s working or not</li>
            <li> Not sure if this worked or not</li>
            <li> I had been using Sally Hansen&#x27;s No More Fungus for quite some time to treat a fungus that just won&#x27;t go away on my finger nails.  </li>
            <li> so I got a small dose of tea tree oil every time I put on hand lotion.  </li>
            <li> She has tried a bunch of different &amp;#34;remedies&amp;#34; but unfortunately nothing has worked.</li>
            <li> I just ordered another bottle and it seems to be the least messy, easiest to use, no horrid odor like tea tree oil.  </li>
            <li> Keep the bottle in one spot where you will not lose it since it&#x27;s small and you will be reminded to use it.</li>
            <li> Its hard to get rid of since he just started using this product to stop his fungus.  </li>
            <li> So at least give it a try and see for yourself.</li>
            <li> but at least I can say that I&#x27;m trying something.  </li>
            <li> I use this at least three times a day, take it with me when I leave the house to run errands</li>
            <li> I suggest buying at least two bottles so you don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a slow process.</li>
            <li> UNBELIEVABLE!</li>
            <li> In other words, do not have a &amp;#34;shellac&amp;#34; manicure or fake nails on when you&#x27;re using this.</li>
            <li> The package says to use twice a day, but since my memory is so bad, I just set it on the counter next to my purse and applied it whenever I thought of it.</li>
            <li> The label just states \\&quot;not effective on nails\\&quot;!  </li>
            <li> and it seems tough to get rid of.  </li>
            <li> but this fungus is a tough nut to crack.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t want it get worse and fall off.</li>
            <li> but I did do it once a day faithfully for 2 years and all it did was keep the infection from getting worse.</li>
            <li> Fungus on my nail was so bad that when i cut off all the bad stuff only around 25% of the nail stayed on the finger.</li>
            <li> but the results is very slow!</li>
            <li> Sorry to say that I kept it going for about a month</li>
            <li> The latter may help you, as well, if you can stand the awful odor and greasiness.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product hasn&#x27;t cleared up the fungal</li>
            <li> This will not work for bad cases and/or severe cases.</li>
            <li> People with bad reviews just dont want to wait their nails to grow.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t painted my toenails since I started treating the bad one in order to let it heal &amp; see if it&#x27;s working...</li>
            <li> My nail got bad to the point where I had to get prescribed medication though</li>
            <li> and I can polish without the fungus reacting badly.  </li>
            <li> It was a bad choice by me.</li>
            <li> For the record fungus isn&#x27;t bad for you, just unsightly.</li>
            <li> but it was an extremely bad toe.</li>
            <li> I think you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> So disappointed.</li>
            <li> Her toenails have had very bad fungus for years!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was very pleased with the product. Shipping was great. Thank youChristna.</li>
            <li> My nail fungus is pretty mild, just more of a raised nail (not attached to my nail bed) problem. This clears it up fairly quickly, in just a couple of months.</li>
            <li> Still using, but I don&#x27;t really see a difference.</li>
            <li> This product worked on our familiy&#x27;s nail fungus when no other product would, including prescription medications! It also showed results very quickly! At such a reasonable price, it is just what we needed. I have recommended this product to friends, and they too have been pleased with the results!</li>
            <li> I wish the Amazon ad was honest - it is not.  This product is not for nails at all - and it actually says right on the back of the tube - not to be used for nails!  I appreciate their honesty.  However, you COULD say that the product name and the Amazon ad are just \\&quot;slightly\\&quot; misleading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only that.  I went ahead and tried the product anyway since it wasn&#x27;t a fortune.  And you know what - they are telling the truth.  It DOES NOT work for nails - just like it states on the back of the packaging.  I tried it for 4 days and it made my nails a wreck!  Went back to using the Xenna product which does work but is ridiculously expensive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take your pick - those are your options.  Cheap, misleading product that doesn&#x27;t work at all vs. expensive product that works to some extent.  Good luck.  You can also try vinegar and/or Tea Tree Oil with mixed results.  All are far better than Dr. G&#x27;s (no wonder he/she are unwilling to offer their full name - I wouldn&#x27;t either if I was misleading the public for money!)</li>
            <li> I found this product at a discount store and bought it very cheap so I decided to just try it.  I tend to (as I get older) get a fungus under my nails and in the past my toenails. I have my nails done fairly often at a salon and I recently had to remove the artifical nail for them to heal.    I have used this product twice and both times it completely healed the area.  My fingernail which had separated halfway up from the end of my nail has now grown out completely in one month. This is an amazing product.!!!  I searched online today to find this product again so I will always have an extra bottle on hand.   I always like to share products on the market that really work and this one did for me!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this before and it really cleared up an infection I had. It seems to be taking longer this time.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product on and off for about two years on my big toenails which were injured and then developed a fungal infection.  The nails are not 100% perfect, but they are considerably better than when I started  using it.  Considering how few options are available for treating nail fungus, I recommend this product.  It takes time, but you will see results.</li>
            <li> Great items! Great transaction!</li>
            <li> If the product has the name \\&quot;Clear Nail\\&quot;, one would assume that it is made to clear up nail fungus.  Why does it say directly on the back label, \\&quot;This product is not effective on scalp or nails\\&quot;.  Even the pictures of the nails are misleading. They show a healthy and an unhealthy nail.  No mention whether it&#x27;s of before and after.  You are made to assume it&#x27;s from the product, but it doesn&#x27;t say so. The label just states \\&quot;not effective on nails\\&quot;!  Feeling very deceived and I&#x27;m returning the product unopened.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have bought this product because of the packaging thinking it was for toenail fungus only to read down further where it says it is not for nails. Oh, it says Clear Nail boldly and even pictures what appears to be toenail fungus. Read on the back of the package where it says that it is not for nails. How does the FDA allow this? I just started to use the product just because I&#x27;ve bought it.</li>
            <li> When I was first given Dr. G&#x27;s I didn&#x27;t use it faithfully. I started using it again in mid-December just to see if it would really work.  YES IT HAS!!! The fungus is going away and I actually have a clear nail on my big toe and rest are looking 100% better. The fungus had completely taken over the nail(s). Can&#x27;t wait for summer to show off my \\&quot;new\\&quot; cute toes.  And be able to go get a manicure (at a clean salon) without feeling embarrassed.    You must be patient...the process can take awhile but it&#x27;s worth it to see clear nails.</li>
            <li> This product has helped the fungus on my toe. While it has taken time for healing to happen, I would recommend this product. My podiatrist also recommends it. So at least give it a try and see for yourself. I think you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have used Dr. G&#x27;s clear nail faithfully for 3 weeks. So far, I can&#x27;t tell if it is working or not. My nail looks about the same. Hopefully, it just needs a little more time! It certainly isn&#x27;t a \\&quot;must have\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> There is one sure and inexpensive remedy for toe nail fungus. Vicks Vaporub. Why? It contains Thymol a known anti-fungal herb. You need to apply it daily to the affected nail. Push the gel into the nail, starting at the top and continue to apply around the cuticle area. Next day, scrape out residue and start again. It will take about 2 months to clear up. But it works.</li>
            <li> A few months ago, one of my fingernails developed a fungus that was growing really fast. After lots of research, I was convinced that it would take months for me to get rid of it. I bought this product because it had the best reviews and was in my price range. The package says to use twice a day, but since my memory is so bad, I just set it on the counter next to my purse and applied it whenever I thought of it. Some days I&#x27;m sure I forgot to use it at all, and other days I would apply it several times. Based on other reviews, I thought that all it would do is stop the fungus from growing or spreading, and that my nail would have to grow all the way out in order to completely get rid of it. I didn&#x27;t find this to be the case. Within a couple of weeks, the fungus started getting smaller, and within about 2 months it was completely gone. I was worried that it wouldn&#x27;t work as well when applied over nail polish, but I didn&#x27;t have a problem. I just applied it as close to the nail bed as possible. I would definitely purchase this product again in the future!</li>
            <li> One side wont work.  The water drips constantly and if you wait awhile, the spout falls off.  Only one side works.  Plus when I got it it was all rusted, it looked like it had been used.</li>
            <li> Recommended by a someone who runs a salon it seems to be working fairly well.  Don&#x27;t expect quick results with this or any nail fungus treatment.  It&#x27;s a slow process.</li>
            <li> This a awesome product. it really does what it suppose  to do in a short time. I would recommend it</li>
            <li> Fungus on my nail was so bad that when i cut off all the bad stuff only around 25% of the nail stayed on the finger. Whatever i cut was the green stuff that wasn&#x27;t even attached to the finger any more. I was about to see the doctor but since i was so busy i decided to try something else before i do it. I got 2 products - Dr G Clear nail and The Original Fungi Nail but Dr G happened to be the most used treatment and it actually worked! In 3 months i have a finger covered with a nail. It is not perfectly healthy yet, but i am not embarrassed any more. I keep applying and will do it until the nail is completely clear. If fungus ever happens to me again this is the only treatment i would buy.</li>
            <li> works a little, don&#x27;t expect great things to happen tho. I&#x27;ve tried almost everything out there, and I don&#x27;t know what to try  anymore. (sigh...) I wish someone would come up with something that works extremely well, at a good price</li>
            <li> I have used this product for the last 6 months on the advice of my manicurist &amp; it has completely cleared up the fungus &amp; unattached nail bed problems I have had for several years.&lt;br /&gt;It is  the only product that has allowed my nails to grow out with the entire nail bed attached &amp; not pulled away from the skin underneath.&lt;br /&gt;Will never be without this product.</li>
            <li> It appears to be working, of course it takes 6 to 12 months for a nail to grow out to know for sure.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for only a couple of weeks, nails are under control. I do not know more yet so far. But, Dr. G&#x27;s Nails is much better than those products I had before.</li>
            <li> i think this is the best product out there by far. i got fungus toes in the military and nothing on the market worked didn&#x27;t want to take pills that damage the liver about 4 months ago i tried dr.G&#x27;s before going to bed and after my shower in the morning.the yellow the thickness vanished less than 3 months.  i filed a little off the top of my nails every day or 2. just kept them clean  applied 2 times daily.it takes about 7 months for toenails to grow out i still use it i don&#x27;t want it back it&#x27;s sandal season. i have tried everything on my toenails even used a dremel. you must incorporate this ritual everyday for results.it does have proven results if ya work at it. just wish they sold a larger bottle</li>
            <li> I had nail fungus for years and when I finally was rid of it for good after taking the internal medication, I wanted to make sure it never came back.  Everyone recommended Dr G and I have used it faithfully ever since.  Nail fungus has not returned!</li>
            <li> If you buy this for a nail infection be ready to cut as much of the infected area off as possible. Be sure to disinfect any files or instruments you use every time you use them or you take the likely risk of it spreading to other nails. This will not work for bad cases and/or severe cases. You have to be diligent and follow the directions or you will see no results.</li>
            <li> My boy had fungus since 4 years old. He is 12 now. I tried a lot of products. Nothing helped as we expected.&lt;br /&gt;My boy used DR.G clear Nail Antifungal since November 2013, three times a day. When he gets from school, he washes his feet, places the product and changes his socks. He also uses the treatment early in the morning and before going to bed. We have to clean the nails as much as possible at least one time every two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Now the fungus has disappear in some parts of the nail about 40%, and in others parts 60% and 80%. This is the first time we are finishing with this fungus after almost 9 years!&lt;br /&gt;At the beginning the problem was &amp;#34;how to remember to do that three times a day&amp;#34;, and we (my husband and me) do this:&lt;br /&gt;I gave to my boy $10 dollars at the beginning of the treatment. At the final of each day, we mark in a chart how many times he forgot to place the treatment over his feet. Every Sunday, we paid him 25 cents for each day he did not forget, and he paid us 25 cents for each mark in the chart (which means, the times he forgot to use the treatment). Now he is happy because he has almost $30 dollars, and we are happy because the fungus has disappear a lot.&lt;br /&gt;I tell you later how is it going on.</li>
            <li> This is the second bottle I have bought.  It appears to be working on a toe that I have dealt with for years.  I will update at a later time if I find it did not work.  To be fair I do not apply as instructed.  I only put it on after showering.</li>
            <li> I see the improvement after 2 months of using the product. People with bad reviews just dont want to wait their nails to grow.</li>
            <li> I am an award winning manicurist and we used to tell any client who came in with a fungus to use this twice a day for 3 months and the fungus would be gone.  It really works!</li>
            <li> I had been embarrassed by brown discoloration of both of my big-toe nails for the last several years and I was not crazy about taking a prescription medication to see if it would help (an option suggested by my doctor), so I decided to give this product a try instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to apply this treatment to the cuticle only (not the nail) twice daily, which I did in the morning (while dressing) and at night. You need to let the cream soak into the cuticle, which requires 15-20 minutes, so plan accordingly. As my nails continued to grow out, they cleared up considerably until completely clear and looked much more healthy. Over the course of 6-8 weeks, the majority of the nail became clear on both of my big toes (I kept trimming away the discolored nail as they grew out). I also had a couple cracked cuticles on my smaller toes and this product cleared those up as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I can wear sandals again during the summer without embarrassment, this is a terrific product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day for about 2 weeks now and my toenail is clear and growing out nicely. I haven&#x27;t painted my toenails since I started treating the bad one in order to let it heal &amp; see if it&#x27;s working... I hope it stays healthy once I do paint them again!</li>
            <li> my nail technician suggested it and gave me the first bottle and I needed more and I think it is doing a great job.</li>
            <li> This is the best product ever.  I swear by it.  It was recommended to me and it cleared my toenails up 100%.  Fungus can come back if it does not fully clear up.  So my recommendation is and what I do is, I use it now 2 times a week just in case and my feet look great.</li>
            <li> I recommend this for nails only.  I used it between my toes for athletes foot and it burned my skin very severely.  Took quite some time for the burnt skin to heal up.  However, if you use it on you toenails only, it appears to work great.  My nail fungus will take several weeks to clear up, but...this treatment seems to be working.</li>
            <li> please sell products that work...not looking for a miracle just real and honest results.  not worth the money...there are othjer products that you can use that are so much better</li>
            <li> I had fungus growing on my big toenail, and then it spread to the next toe. I decided it was time to do something about it, before it spread anymore. I read a lot of reviews on Amazon, before i decided on this one. I apply it every morning and evening. As my toenail grows out, it has no more abnormal growth; looks just like it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> All of my adult life my toe nails progressively yellowed and darkened. Very dismaying! I had resigned to my fate. But nay! DR G hooked me up! After two treatments my toe nails are shiny and pearl white! AWESOME! UNBELIEVABLE! A MIRACLE!!!</li>
            <li> Have been using for about a month, and the discoloration on my toenail is gone.  Will have to see how the nail grows out, but I am very happy so far.</li>
            <li> Sorry to say that I kept it going for about a month and there was no affect on my nails.  For me it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I tried this for a few months, applying several times a day and there was no improvement. Out of options.</li>
            <li> Great price! Have used it for over two weeks. I use it everyday after shower and filing my nails. New nails have grown out to be healthy. I would totally continue to use this.</li>
            <li> Nails cleared up right away. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Seems to be helping with toe nail fungus. The infected part of the toe nails appears to be slowly growing out and is being replaced by normal looking toe nails.</li>
            <li> On my second bottle.  This is working like a charm.  Nail fungus takes forever to get rid of and this is doing the trick.  My fungus is getting smaller.  Can&#x27;t wait till it&#x27;s all gone.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions to the letter but finished the bottle without seeing an improvement. Might work for someone else but didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Works! You just need to be religious about using it daily.</li>
            <li> first trial.  Let&#x27;s see how it goes.</li>
            <li> This stuff appears to have done the job.  After just a couple of weeks of use, most of my toe nail fungus was gone. There was just a little left and it seems tough to get rid of.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years.  My hubby has a nail fungus, and I guess I got it from him.  Its hard to get rid of since he just started using this product to stop his fungus.  Its working for him, and it worked for me.  It takes time, alot of time, especially if your fungus is severe.  I have seen incredible results, but  I have also applied it twice a day for over a year, and then it really started to manifest results.  Remember, my fungus actually had the toenail growing strange, so it had been there for awhile.  This products works, but you need to stay with it.  After the fungus \\&quot;appears\\&quot; to be gone, continue for at least another month or until your toenails looks normal again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s working or not but at least I can say that I&#x27;m trying something.  The product shipped quickly. and is easy enough to use. Good luck.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work very well. I scrubbed my nails with an antibacterial soap and applied. I did this every night. Even though it did clear up the some of the dark places it did not totally take care of the problem.</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply, perfect consistency - my nail is growing out nice and healthy...finally</li>
            <li> This is an easy way to treat fungal on nails whether it&#x27;s your feet or hands that need to have treatment</li>
            <li> Buy it if you want clear nails free from darken colors &amp; thickness. Yes it has been keeping nail looking nice</li>
            <li> I am still in the process of using it.  It seems to be working very slowly, or not at all.  I am still waiting for some positive results, hopefully I will reap some benefits from it use.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t the same product as what you buy at Sally&#x27;s.  The one at Sally&#x27;s is pricey, but it works.  The person didn&#x27;t know the difference though and gave me my money back.  Active ingredient is different if you read carefully.</li>
            <li> Im pleased with this purchase. Within week I could see a big change in one of my nails that has been giving my trouble. So yes Id recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It works!  Been using for about 5 weeks.  It takes a while but it works.</li>
            <li> I contracted a nail fungal infection during a pedicure at a local salon. My toe nail started to separate from the nail bed and I didn&#x27;t want it get worse and fall off. The earliest appointment for my podiatrist was 3 weeks away. I ordered a bottle of Dr G&#x27;s Antifungal Treatment and applied 2x daily for a week. Within 2 weeks the infection cleared and my nail is normal. I cancelled my podiatrist appointment. Local pharmacies and beauty supply stores used to carry this product, but now it&#x27;s hard to find. I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s available online.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if any product can cure fungus. It took me 9 months total, I had used every product recommended. In the end, I had to take an oral pill of Lamcil, and topical lamicil cream AFTER I had surgery to remove the finger nail. My new nail is just now growing and I must continue the topical Lamicil.</li>
            <li> I have acrylic nails and did not want to remove them to treat a fungus. This stuff actually works. You absolutely have to use it on dry nails, and use it every every every single day for many months. I dry under my nails with alcohol and then use it at night to let it sit under the acrylic. It took about 6 months to see results, but results indeed. I do not stop using it just because I am cured. I never want it to come back.</li>
            <li> I used this product for about four days, suddenly my skin around the two nails of which I applied it, became red and I had some places that looked like blood blisters. I stopped using it immediately and started applying an antibiotic. I apparently am allergic to this and usually have no skin problems.</li>
            <li> It worked just as described. Gentler than compounds I have used before..No complaints at all..</li>
            <li> I have been using it daily, have not seen improvement of my toe mail fungal..</li>
            <li> Did not work for my problem. Seems to be a cheap product. I used neosporin and it fixed the problem.</li>
            <li> SPECIFICALLY IF USED WITH MISS FUNGUSS&lt;br /&gt;DOES THE JOB WELL&lt;br /&gt;USE IT FOR 4 WEEKS,YOU WILL SEE RESULTS&lt;br /&gt;I LIKE IT</li>
            <li> Not sure if this worked or not but I did use it twice a day and reapplied when I washed my hands.  My nail got bad to the point where I had to get prescribed medication though so I can&#x27;t guarantee that this product did its job.  I don&#x27;t need to use anymore but have kept it in case.</li>
            <li> This is a product that does what it says it will. My horse stepped on my foot years ago causing damage to my nail bed. In the winter months I wear socks 24/7, thus causing moisture in the nail bed to turn green. I have tried many products without results till a nail tech suggested CLEAR NAIL. It really works.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not clear in the description, but this product is just a thin formula Tolnaftate lotion. There is nothing about it that&#x27;s unique to nails. I bought it thinking it was a formula that would adhere to nails or somehow be nail-specific, perhaps a brush-on formula.  It&#x27;s not - it&#x27;s a tiny .6oz squeezy bottle. For the same money, you can get a much larger tube of cream or lotion. Tolnaftate can be effective in some cases for fungus, so not a 1-star review, although the product description is misleading.</li>
            <li> After months of using Tea Tree oil and seeing no results, I decided to get something else.  I did a lot of research online and read a lot of reviews on amazon and finally decided to buy DR. G Clear Nail.  It was affordable and had pretty good reviews.  I didn&#x27;t want to wait on shipping so I found it at Sally Beauty Supply store priced at 18.99 but I got it for 10 with a beauty pro membership.  Put it on and around my toe nail that night and the next day saw immediate results.  The white lines were less visible and the yellow color was improved.  It says to use for 4 weeks, and you can still wear nail polish.  The best part is seeing results fast!  I&#x27;d tell everyone to get this, and I&#x27;d tell them to never get a pedicure again-that&#x27;s how this whole mess started.  I am on day 3 of using this product and wanted to share my personal experience so far!</li>
            <li> I had been using Sally Hansen&#x27;s No More Fungus for quite some time to treat a fungus that just won&#x27;t go away on my finger nails.  Don&#x27;t know how I got it unless it has sat dormant since the 80&#x27;s when I had acrylics and had to stop because of two nails going black underneath.  The Sally Hansen was working pretty well..as long as I didn&#x27;t polish.  Once I started polishing, the fungus would come back.  I&#x27;ve added Dr. G&#x27;s to the regimen and apparently that was the final ingredient necessary to really kick some fungus butt.  Not only has the fungus been stopped from growing but new growth is looking more hydrated and is a very healthy pink color and I can polish without the fungus reacting badly.  In fact, I don&#x27;t think there is any more live fungus there at all but I&#x27;m going to continue until I&#x27;ve used up both of the bottles I bought and may even just continue beyond that for prevention&#x27;s sake.  I don&#x27;t want this stuff to ever come back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is also the fact that there are moisturizers included as part of the \\&quot;inactive\\&quot; ingredients.  I use this after washing my hands and before I put on any lotion.  My nails have vertical ridges and will show dryness and peeling along those ridges.  After hand washing, the dryness is very noticeable.  The Dr. G&#x27;s really sinks in so that by the time I&#x27;ve rubbed it in and waited a few minutes before putting on lotion, all the dryness disappears.  What a nice side effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use tea tree oil on my nails - straight out of the bottle and mixed into a home made cuticle oil using Bio Oil, tea tree oil and some of the Sally Hansen fungus treatment.  But I do believe it&#x27;s the Dr. G&#x27;s that&#x27;s made all the difference for me.  I&#x27;m really looking forward to fungus free nails in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 040913:  I&#x27;m on my second bottle and from what I can tell, the fungus has lost the battle.  It&#x27;s just a matter of growing out the damage now.  I purchased two more bottles and will continue to use once every day until I&#x27;ve used the last one up then see how things go from there.  I can say that the new nail growth looks very healthy and doesn&#x27;t show any of the peeling patches that the old growth shows.  The nail beds are pink, just like they should be.  I&#x27;ve recommended Dr. G&#x27;s to a lot of people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 061013:  Been using this on and off since February - mostly on.  I did have a recurrence after my last update but that was my fault because I got lax in using the product.  You do have to be consistent for any treatment to work well.  I saw the quickest and best result once I cut my nails super short - down practically to the quick - stopped polishing and started putting on the product four times a day.  I also used a cuticle oil I made with jojoba oil, vitamin E oil, tea tree oil and avocado oil, equal parts of each.  I also doctored up my hand lotion with the cuticle oil so I got a small dose of tea tree oil every time I put on hand lotion.  I used the oil after every hand washing and on top of the Dr. G&#x27;s.  As of now, I do still have some visible damage at the tip of the nail bed but all of the lifting has grown out and there does not appear to be any further damage being done by the fungus.  So, after four months of using Dr. G&#x27;s, I&#x27;m looking at normal, healthy looking nails and I am polishing again.  Because I don&#x27;t want this fungus to return, I will continue to use the product daily but start reducing the number of times a day until all of the nail bed damage has grown out and I&#x27;m using it once a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product does work but you do have to be patient as well as consistent.  If you don&#x27;t want to cut your nails down and go without polish for the duration, the product will still work.  It&#x27;ll just take more time.</li>
            <li> This product worked great for me after having a right foot great toe fungus problem for several years (may have been caused by tripping on coral on Maui, but most likely was from the pedicure I got prior to the trip). It took about 3 months, but my toenail is finally normal again. Here are the steps to take when using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Soak your nails in epsom salts and warm water to soften nail area.&lt;br /&gt;2. Push back cuticle as far as you can.&lt;br /&gt;3. Using clippers, remove as much of the affected area as you possibly can. The more you can remove, the better your results. I took half my toenail off and clipped/filed the remaining nail bed.&lt;br /&gt;4. Soak the nail again, making sure everything&#x27;s clean, then dry off.&lt;br /&gt;5. Next, use a little bit of rubbing alcohol on the affected area.&lt;br /&gt;6. Finally, Use the Dr. G treatment solution on the nail, pushing it deep into the cuticles, and around and under the nail as best you can. i did this twice daily: in the AM before I put socks on (and it didn&#x27;t discolor my socks) and once before bed. Important: refrain from using nail polish or having mani/pedis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be patient, diligent and before you know it, your nail will be normal again. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I had a fungus on my toe that I couldn&#x27;t get rid of and I cut my nail, and put the stuff on the top of my nail and tried to put it underneath the nail. this has helped so much. I love this stuff. I will definitely buy more when I get low!</li>
            <li> I have had issues with my nails being a beautician and gave this a try. . My nails did not get any better or look any better. Tried to return it and was told there would be a restocking fee and if the product was opened could only get a partial return. They would return 2 dollars and I had to pay to ship it back.lol  Again I&#x27;m amazed that a seller would do this, you have to try it to see if you like it. It was a bad choice by me. there is  a product at target I just heard about, I will give that a try !</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see much difference. I think the only way to really get rid of toenail fungus is by prescription, which is a drag. For the record fungus isn&#x27;t bad for you, just unsightly. I may keep using this more faithfully and see if it gets better. It may improve things but I don&#x27;t know if it is a cure.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of buying &amp;#34;DR. G Clear Nail Antifungal Treatment&amp;#34; to treat my nail fungus.  When I received this product, I was very surprised to see that the instructions say &amp;#34;not to be used for nails.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t put this on twice a day but I did do it once a day faithfully for 2 years and all it did was keep the infection from getting worse. I never really saw improvement in toenails. I have since (2 weeks ago) decided to start using a more expensive item and can already see more improvement.</li>
            <li> I talked my Mom into buying Dr G&#x27;s Clear Nail Antifungal when we were at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply. Her toenails have had very bad fungus for years! She has tried a bunch of different &amp;#34;remedies&amp;#34; but unfortunately nothing has worked. She said, &amp;#34;Okay, why not.&amp;#34; She was pretty diligent about using it twice a day and when I looked at her big toe nails, she has healthy nail growing out! It is only about half a cm at this point but OMGosh! She bought another bottle and we are excited to track the results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fabulous product so far!</li>
            <li> I am not against trying it, but I would suggest two things:&lt;br /&gt; 1. Use a nail-file to remove 1 mil of nail before using the product every day.&lt;br /&gt; 2. Try to use a different product: \\&quot;fungi-cure\\&quot;. You will be amazed of results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000GCNBL2 FungiCure Antifungal Liquid, extra strength, anti fungus 1 fl oz (30 ml)]]</li>
            <li> First of all it took two months to get it.  Then it didn&#x27;t seem to have any real effect on the problem.  I have used other products that are in a Pen with a brush on the end and you could see a difference in the nail after about a week.  With this after three weeks it looked exactly the same as before I started using it.</li>
            <li> i have nail fungus.if it treatment is not effective whit nail fungus why named clear nail?and it picture on the box is delucion</li>
            <li> I waited after buying this product, and applying it everyday on my big toenail, for over a month. I read the previous reviews that it needs time to work, so I gave it time.&lt;br /&gt;The product does nothing to stop, or remove the fungus from my toenail. It was just a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions for applying this and after two months rhere were no changes in my toe nails. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I use this at least three times a day, take it with me when I leave the house to run errands so I can apply it if I&#x27;m gone long time.  It seems to be working but this fungus is a tough nut to crack. But it seems to be working.  You MUST use it regularly every day to see results. It&#x27;s a long haul to get rid of fungus but don&#x27;t stop trying.  I just ordered another bottle and it seems to be the least messy, easiest to use, no horrid odor like tea tree oil.  The latter may help you, as well, if you can stand the awful odor and greasiness.  That&#x27;s why Dr. G&#x27;s product is a good choice. Not greasy, easy to use and carry with you.  Again, you must use it daily, more than once.  It says on the box &amp;#34;not for fingernails&#x27; but I called them.  They said they have to put that on there but it is perfectly OK for use on fingernails. Small bottle lasts long time...you only need a drop...rub it into the SKIN around the nail is what the company told me.  I also try to smudge some under the nail anyway....anything to get rid of a green spot in otherwise decent nails. Do try this, do use it religiously, don&#x27;t give up. Keep the bottle in one spot where you will not lose it since it&#x27;s small and you will be reminded to use it. Seems to be working but again, long haul with fungus. I think I got it b/c I squished my finger in a door so it loosened the nail from nailbed.  Eeuuuu. Ouch.  Also, at the time, I had a &amp;#34;shellac&amp;#34; manicure which is long lasting, I should&#x27;ve had it removed as soon as the nail got hurt but who knew.  In other words, do not have a &amp;#34;shellac&amp;#34; manicure or fake nails on when you&#x27;re using this. A regular manicure is OK, my manicurist said.</li>
            <li> I was a sceptic but after 12+ yrs of battling nail fungus and treating it unsuccessfully, I figured I&#x27;d give it a try. I&#x27;ve been using it about 5 weeks now and I&#x27;ve got enough for about 2-3 more applications.  I had 5 infected toes. I noticed changes within 1 week. It has totally cleared up 2 of my toes and i notice about 70% improvement in two other toes. The last toe I&#x27;ve noticed maybe 20% improvement but it was an extremely bad toe. I only apply it once daily. It&#x27;s important you put the solution around your cuticle/nailbed area. I first noticed discoloration getting lighter.  And a much larger band of healthy nail growing out from the nailbed. Lastly the raised nail started flattening out and returning to normal. You have to be diligent and do it every day. I suggest buying at least two bottles so you don&#x27;t run out. I think it&#x27;s important to continue using it even after the infection is gone because fungus can be aggressive and creep back if only a little of it remains.</li>
            <li> It is beginning to work after 3 weeks use morning and bedtime. You have to be patient. Use it and see</li>
            <li> When using this product it should work at least a little.  After using. The product for two weeks it seemed that the fungus was growing not getting cured.</li>
            <li> recommend this product</li>
            <li> a nice pleasent product to use, but i wasnt to impressed with the results, i didnt see where it did much for the nails</li>
            <li> I feel like it is taking care of the problem!.  I have only been using it for 6 mos.and I see a difference.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says it does!&lt;br /&gt;Better than any of the other fungus products on the market. It arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Whenever I wear polish, even the stuff without the chemicals, my nails turn yellow and look like I have fungus. Initially, the formula for Dr G was benzalkonium chloride, which worked great on my yucky toenails and allowed me to wear polish. The new formula is tolnaftate which, when I switched, because my old bottle was very old, and I thought this had to work at least as good, the fungus-like yuck came back worse than ever!! So disappointed.</li>
            <li> I thought it would work faster! I been using it almost a month.Will continue to use but the results is very slow!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a month, but it appears to be working.</li>
            <li> did not work. waste of money</li>
            <li> I only used one bottle and it was easy to use but I got no results from it. I w ould not buy this product again. My foot doctor told me to put white vinegar on my toes twice a day and in time my fungus would go away. So that is what I am doin now--hope it works</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product hasn&#x27;t cleared up the fungal</li>
            <li> Souvent des réactions cutanées et l&#x27;ongle est devenu très obscur. I really like to know what else I can use for my mum to make clearer her nails. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I have persistent nail fungus because my nails won&#x27;t stay connected to the nailbed due to nail psoriasis.  The dead space between the nail and nailbed tends to stay moist in the extreme Houston heat and humidity.  As an artist, my hands get wet frequently when using paint, washing up from pastels and graphite, and working clay for ceramics.  If I persistently use Dr. G&#x27;s three times daily, my fungus is killed and the nails begin to re-attach to the nailbed.  I use it in the morning after showering, in the afternoon after a hand wash, and at night before I go to bed.  My nails almost immediately begin to look better and get close to being healed, and then I forget to use Dr. G&#x27;s, and soon afterward, the nail begins to separate from the nailbed.  The key is PERSISTENCE, don&#x27;t quit using it until the nail is completely attached.  Learn from my mistakes.  I keep a bottle on my bathroom vanity to use after my shower, I keep one bottle in my purse to use during the day on campus, and I keep one on my bedside table to use just before bedtime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with any fungus treatment, it takes a long time to kill the infection.  Dr. G&#x27;s will make your nail healthy again if you give it time.  I saw results within the first week.  Some reviewers noted that their bottles are printed \\&quot;Not for nail or scalp\\&quot;.  My bottle does not have that print.  Even if my bottle had that print, I would ignore it.  The chemical used is Benzalkonium Chloride, which is what I was given in 1974 to help keep infection out of my newly-pierced ears.  It is also the same chemical that my daughters were given when they got their ears pierced in the 1995.  It is very safe in our experience, and when I googled it, there are no health warnings associated with its use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. G&#x27;s also makes a product under the Clear Nail name that has tolnaftate, which is an antifungal commonly used for athlete&#x27;s foot, jock itch and feminine yeast infections.  I just ordered a large bottle of Dr. G&#x27;s Antimicrobial Callus &amp; Cuticle Remover, and a bottle of Antimicrobial Spa Soak, both of which contain Benzalkonium Chloride.  I will take them with me to the nail salon for use with my mani/pedicures.  After I use them a few times, I will post reviews on those products, also.</li>
            <li> It has been a month and so far, so good.  I have been using the product twice a day as suggested and a nice, new toenail is about half grown out.  I will update you all when the project is complete.</li>
            <li> Cleared up my problem in just a couple weeks. Be diligent about application. Great product.</li>
            <li> I was a doubter, but this product actually works! My nails are looking much healthier - although I wouldn&#x27;t say that I&#x27;m cured yet. I will continue buying and using this product.</li>
    </ol>
