            <li>Product arrived on time, but one of the bottles was leaking at the top.  </li>
            <li>I would purchase again for sure.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s most important for me!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite bodywash.</li>
            <li>Its one of the most refreshing scents out there.  </li>
            <li>This body wash works very well and smells great.</li>
            <li>always stock them to make sure I never run out of it</li>
            <li>Much better than using my wife&#x27;s girl stuff.  </li>
            <li>The wife thinks it smells great, which is really all that matters.</li>
            <li>Love the scent, love the brand, love the price.</li>
            <li>I smell awesome all day long.  </li>
            <li>Great job Old Spice!</li>
            <li>However, it did leave me feeling clean and refreshed!</li>
            <li>His chest smells amazing and he is pretty hairy!</li>
            <li>But do not worry, they made the opening at the top huge</li>
            <li>I love that this is available on Amazon.com&#x27;s Subscribe and Save program.</li>
            <li>I was really wondering if this would be a good idea to do or not.</li>
            <li>Women really like the scent too which is good.</li>
            <li>well it is made out of some kind of water-phobic gel that slides right off the sponge and into the drain.  </li>
            <li>My husband only uses old spice body wash and this was a great price and obviously great quality &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Love this stuff it gets you clean.</li>
            <li>strong fragances make me gag.</li>
            <li>I liked it the first time.</li>
            <li>It smells nice, but it&#x27;s also not over-the-top.</li>
            <li>I really love this body wash, the scent is really fresh.</li>
            <li>Hope you enjoy yours.</li>
            <li>The bottles&#x27; tops were all still securely closed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>This my signature scent and soap gets me extra clean and smells great</li>
            <li>Keeps me feeling and smelling fresh!</li>
            <li>It is fresh smelling - not too strong.</li>
            <li>I have tried other brands like the Gillette, and while it is good, I like this better.  </li>
            <li>Old spice users should already know what this smells like (amazing).</li>
            <li>My husband has always liked Old Spice products.</li>
            <li>My wife constantly says how good I smell after showers because of this product.</li>
            <li>These items were a good steal I actually bought them for family use.  </li>
            <li>I know that won&#x27;t be true of all women, but I would definitely rate this as a pleasant smell that can last nicely.</li>
            <li>IT has a fresh clean fragrance that stays with you througout the day.</li>
            <li>used this product since it came on the market, love the way my skin feels and it scent last longer then most shower gels.</li>
            <li>The smell is strong when you first shower, but the intensity drops off quickly and someone has to be pretty close to smell it after an hour.</li>
            <li>thanks!!</li>
            <li>It is a little pricey compared to a soap bar but the great smell lasts almost all day.</li>
            <li>Lathers nice and with our standard city water, it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite scent out of all the Old Spice products.</li>
            <li>My kids love Old Spice.</li>
            <li>The tops are easy to open (flip top that secures with friction) and don&#x27;t come undone on their own during the life of a single bottle.</li>
            <li>Smells great, but doesn&#x27;t lather up very well compared to other body washes used with a loofa.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be back for more (whenever I run out of my original purchase).</li>
            <li>Order received quickly and exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Clean and refreshing smell last all day</li>
            <li>It is a great &amp;#34;anytime&amp;#34; personal hygiene product, in that it can be used for daily showers and also has a bit of a coolant/relaxing effect after a run or workout.  </li>
            <li>I like this very  much</li>
            <li>,even my wife likes the smell very much.</li>
            <li>this smells great and is not too overbearing as some other Old Spice body washes can be.  </li>
            <li>Will buy more in future.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described and on time.</li>
            <li>I love this for my daily showers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it cleans better, but I smell better.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Been using these for a few years now, love the scent isn&#x27;t too strong.</li>
            <li>Long lasting pleasant smell&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>used the deodorant since i was in high school and why not try this right?  </li>
            <li>It arrived quickly in a cardboard Old Spice box containing all of the 18oz bottles.</li>
            <li>well with the pure sport</li>
            <li>And it cleans really well.</li>
            <li>Very like the smell of it.</li>
            <li>really like this.</li>
            <li>fast shipping - item as described.</li>
            <li>It was packaged very efficiently -</li>
            <li>I just put the whole box</li>
            <li>My son uses this and absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to go as much.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>Subscribe and save really saves money on the mutipacks.</li>
            <li>This is much cheaper than target</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry his skin the way other body washes can and leaves a nice, fresh, manly scent on him all day!  </li>
            <li>and I love the scent when my husband uses it it leads to other things.</li>
            <li>Pretty much the only thing I am using right now.</li>
            <li>While I have yet to have a problem with them, they do seem as though they could be opened relatively simply as there is a small lip on the front of the flip top for your fingers which could easily get caught on something in a travel bag.</li>
            <li>Classic sporty shower smell</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend and purchase again.</li>
            <li>Really like the Old Spice HE.</li>
            <li>Old Spice is light yet lasts all day long.</li>
            <li>We should be set for a few more months</li>
            <li>love the long lasting smell, especially with the Pure Sport</li>
            <li>I wish old spice could pay me 50 dollars for the shirts it has ruined!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are WARNED!</li>
            <li>Good Ol&#x27; High Endurance has become increasingly difficult to locate in brick &amp; mortar stores.</li>
            <li>Definitely invest in this product if you want a masculine scent after a hot shower.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sensitive to smells and</li>
            <li>Once you go old</li>
            <li>My husband insists on Old Spice, everything.  </li>
            <li>It smells just like the Old Spice Sport body spray and antiperspirant so you don&#x27;t have conflicting smells.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Old Spice is a scent that reminds us we are away but not forgotten by those at home.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>On the cleaning side, of course that matters, this stuff lathers well and really gets me squeaky clean even with the hard water that we have here.</li>
            <li>Seriously though, it&#x27;s ok soap.</li>
            <li>Makes me smell fresh like a man, not fresh like a 17 year old horndog.</li>
            <li>Those that haven&#x27;t used old spice before, walk into a walmart and find this body wash, open it and smell it to see if you like it.</li>
            <li>Even my scent sensitive wife didn&#x27;t mind the smell after the second day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t go back, but u can think it with old spice bodywash.</li>
            <li>Switched from Old Spice Denali and just wanted something different -</li>
            <li>The scent does not last very long though and is mild, but I did read this in other reviews.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten several compliments from this shower gel and this surprised me because I recently switched out of Dove soap bars, which smelled like nothing.</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend, especially if you like the Old Spice Sport body spray or antiperspirant/deoterant.</li>
            <li>Recommended for little boys, men, and seasoned veterans alike.</li>
            <li>Before then I&#x27;ve been a long Old Spice Sport antiperspirant user.</li>
            <li>This is a somewhat similar scent like the long lasting Old Spice traditional scent.</li>

            <li> Product arrived on time, but one of the bottles was leaking at the top.  </li>
            <li> I would purchase again for sure.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s most important for me!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite bodywash.</li>
            <li> Its one of the most refreshing scents out there.  </li>
            <li> This body wash works very well and smells great.</li>
            <li> always stock them to make sure I never run out of it</li>
            <li> Much better than using my wife&#x27;s girl stuff.  </li>
            <li> The wife thinks it smells great, which is really all that matters.</li>
            <li> Love the scent, love the brand, love the price.</li>
            <li> I smell awesome all day long.  </li>
            <li> Great job Old Spice!</li>
            <li> However, it did leave me feeling clean and refreshed!</li>
            <li> His chest smells amazing and he is pretty hairy!</li>
            <li> But do not worry, they made the opening at the top huge</li>
            <li> I love that this is available on Amazon.com&#x27;s Subscribe and Save program.</li>
            <li> I was really wondering if this would be a good idea to do or not.</li>
            <li> Women really like the scent too which is good.</li>
            <li> well it is made out of some kind of water-phobic gel that slides right off the sponge and into the drain.  </li>
            <li> My husband only uses old spice body wash and this was a great price and obviously great quality &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Love this stuff it gets you clean.</li>
            <li> strong fragances make me gag.</li>
            <li> I liked it the first time.</li>
            <li> It smells nice, but it&#x27;s also not over-the-top.</li>
            <li> I really love this body wash, the scent is really fresh.</li>
            <li> Hope you enjoy yours.</li>
            <li> The bottles&#x27; tops were all still securely closed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> This my signature scent and soap gets me extra clean and smells great</li>
            <li> Keeps me feeling and smelling fresh!</li>
            <li> It is fresh smelling - not too strong.</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands like the Gillette, and while it is good, I like this better.  </li>
            <li> Old spice users should already know what this smells like (amazing).</li>
            <li> My husband has always liked Old Spice products.</li>
            <li> My wife constantly says how good I smell after showers because of this product.</li>
            <li> These items were a good steal I actually bought them for family use.  </li>
            <li> I know that won&#x27;t be true of all women, but I would definitely rate this as a pleasant smell that can last nicely.</li>
            <li> IT has a fresh clean fragrance that stays with you througout the day.</li>
            <li> used this product since it came on the market, love the way my skin feels and it scent last longer then most shower gels.</li>
            <li> The smell is strong when you first shower, but the intensity drops off quickly and someone has to be pretty close to smell it after an hour.</li>
            <li> thanks!!</li>
            <li> It is a little pricey compared to a soap bar but the great smell lasts almost all day.</li>
            <li> Lathers nice and with our standard city water, it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite scent out of all the Old Spice products.</li>
            <li> My kids love Old Spice.</li>
            <li> The tops are easy to open (flip top that secures with friction) and don&#x27;t come undone on their own during the life of a single bottle.</li>
            <li> Smells great, but doesn&#x27;t lather up very well compared to other body washes used with a loofa.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be back for more (whenever I run out of my original purchase).</li>
            <li> Order received quickly and exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Clean and refreshing smell last all day</li>
            <li> It is a great &amp;#34;anytime&amp;#34; personal hygiene product, in that it can be used for daily showers and also has a bit of a coolant/relaxing effect after a run or workout.  </li>
            <li> I like this very  much</li>
            <li> ,even my wife likes the smell very much.</li>
            <li> this smells great and is not too overbearing as some other Old Spice body washes can be.  </li>
            <li> Will buy more in future.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and on time.</li>
            <li> I love this for my daily showers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it cleans better, but I smell better.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Been using these for a few years now, love the scent isn&#x27;t too strong.</li>
            <li> Long lasting pleasant smell&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> used the deodorant since i was in high school and why not try this right?  </li>
            <li> It arrived quickly in a cardboard Old Spice box containing all of the 18oz bottles.</li>
            <li> well with the pure sport</li>
            <li> And it cleans really well.</li>
            <li> Very like the smell of it.</li>
            <li> really like this.</li>
            <li> fast shipping - item as described.</li>
            <li> It was packaged very efficiently -</li>
            <li> I just put the whole box</li>
            <li> My son uses this and absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to go as much.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.  </li>
            <li> Subscribe and save really saves money on the mutipacks.</li>
            <li> This is much cheaper than target</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry his skin the way other body washes can and leaves a nice, fresh, manly scent on him all day!  </li>
            <li> and I love the scent when my husband uses it it leads to other things.</li>
            <li> Pretty much the only thing I am using right now.</li>
            <li> While I have yet to have a problem with them, they do seem as though they could be opened relatively simply as there is a small lip on the front of the flip top for your fingers which could easily get caught on something in a travel bag.</li>
            <li> Classic sporty shower smell</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend and purchase again.</li>
            <li> Really like the Old Spice HE.</li>
            <li> Old Spice is light yet lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> We should be set for a few more months</li>
            <li> love the long lasting smell, especially with the Pure Sport</li>
            <li> I wish old spice could pay me 50 dollars for the shirts it has ruined!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are WARNED!</li>
            <li> Good Ol&#x27; High Endurance has become increasingly difficult to locate in brick &amp; mortar stores.</li>
            <li> Definitely invest in this product if you want a masculine scent after a hot shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sensitive to smells and</li>
            <li> Once you go old</li>
            <li> My husband insists on Old Spice, everything.  </li>
            <li> It smells just like the Old Spice Sport body spray and antiperspirant so you don&#x27;t have conflicting smells.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Old Spice is a scent that reminds us we are away but not forgotten by those at home.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> On the cleaning side, of course that matters, this stuff lathers well and really gets me squeaky clean even with the hard water that we have here.</li>
            <li> Seriously though, it&#x27;s ok soap.</li>
            <li> Makes me smell fresh like a man, not fresh like a 17 year old horndog.</li>
            <li> Those that haven&#x27;t used old spice before, walk into a walmart and find this body wash, open it and smell it to see if you like it.</li>
            <li> Even my scent sensitive wife didn&#x27;t mind the smell after the second day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t go back, but u can think it with old spice bodywash.</li>
            <li> Switched from Old Spice Denali and just wanted something different -</li>
            <li> The scent does not last very long though and is mild, but I did read this in other reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten several compliments from this shower gel and this surprised me because I recently switched out of Dove soap bars, which smelled like nothing.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend, especially if you like the Old Spice Sport body spray or antiperspirant/deoterant.</li>
            <li> Recommended for little boys, men, and seasoned veterans alike.</li>
            <li> Before then I&#x27;ve been a long Old Spice Sport antiperspirant user.</li>
            <li> This is a somewhat similar scent like the long lasting Old Spice traditional scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try other body washes, but I&#x27;ll get about half way through them and go back to the Pure Sport.</li>
            <li> Scent also seems to carry on much longer after use than anything else I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time as well because you do not have to use a ton of it.</li>
            <li> yused for a long time</li>
            <li> so that if it does open, you will not have your other items ruined as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Old Spice body wash has been part of my life the past 4-5 years.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Also, it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin dry and chap!</li>
            <li> Works as you expected.</li>
            <li> No, not really.</li>
            <li> The package arrived quickly (in a military post overseas time-line) and was well received.</li>
            <li> Unlike other body washes like Armani, the scent is not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I usually use Irish Spring, but this was cheaper at the price per ounce level this time when I bought a six pack.</li>
            <li> The other five bottle were intact.</li>
            <li> For this reason, if you are traveling with this, I recommend placing it in a zip lock bag or other container</li>
            <li> One bottle last forever, and I take a least 4+ showers a day (student-athlete).</li>
            <li> If you live in a cold climate and the delivery company leaves your packages outside when it&#x27;s around 35&#x27;F or less, you may harm the product.  </li>
            <li> so a lot can come out and go down the drain all at once!  </li>
            <li> The scent however, is not long lasting, so I was a bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> No more hunting around stores for who and who doesn&#x27;t have it now.</li>
            <li> not sure if I would order again, considering two bottles were damaged.</li>
            <li> Unable to find in local stores.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are a bit pricey, so I usually buy them at wholesale club or when there is a sale or if there is coupon from manufacture.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I know this sounds stupid, but this scent really does help me wake up in the morning.</li>
            <li> Although the shipping process was brutal and my package came a little wet from the gel leaking, I still like the product.</li>
            <li> Before I start, I would like for you to know, that this is a serious review!</li>
            <li> 4 stars because of the lousy shipping situation but customer service helped me out a ton.</li>
            <li> but way too expensive.</li>
            <li> But the bottle is very thin.</li>
            <li> We were disappointed when the stores stopped stocking and selling it</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Started using about a year ago, am vefy satisfied with product.</li>
            <li> Keeps me feeling and smelling fresh!</li>
            <li> This is my second order of this.  I have tried other brands like the Gillette, and while it is good, I like this better.  IT has a fresh clean fragrance that stays with you througout the day. Nuff said.</li>
            <li> my husband love want use anything else</li>
            <li> I love this body wash.  Great scent.  Note that the box they come in says \\&quot;Do not expose to temperatures above 45&#x27;C or below 5&#x27;C.\\&quot;  If you live in a cold climate and the delivery company leaves your packages outside when it&#x27;s around 35&#x27;F or less, you may harm the product.  (I don&#x27;t know how.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 months now. Unlike other body washes like Armani, the scent is not overpowering. I&#x27;m sensitive to smells and strong fragances make me gag. Old Spice is light yet lasts all day long. And it cleans really well.</li>
            <li> Good product, but its cheaper at walmart.</li>
            <li> Get these in a 6 pack with subscribe and save. Good deal.</li>
            <li> used this product since it came on the market, love the way my skin feels and it scent last longer then most shower gels.</li>
            <li> and the price for prime members that subscribe and save but wish this product was better for your body without all the harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> I personally love the smell of this stuff so I like it for that  But, buying this stuff online in a pack of 6 saved me about 2 dollars a bottle and I also have extras in my house now for when I run out. No more hunting around stores for who and who doesn&#x27;t have it now.</li>
            <li> Order received quickly and exactly as described. Great to do business with!  AAAAA+++++</li>
            <li> This is a somewhat similar scent like the long lasting Old Spice traditional scent. The Pure Sport smells great and foams up quite well. The scent however, is not long lasting, so I was a bit disappointed. However, it did leave me feeling clean and refreshed!</li>
            <li> loved that I could order this in bulk.</li>
            <li> Very like the smell of it.</li>
            <li> I like this because the smell stays on me for hours.</li>
            <li> Good Ol&#x27; High Endurance has become increasingly difficult to locate in brick &amp; mortar stores. Can beat the price, or having about a years supply in the closet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this body wash for years now and absolutely love it. Also love how it is part of the subscribe and save product lines.</li>
            <li> I have used this body gel for years and it&#x27;ll be the only body gel I use. It smells great and gets compliments all the time.</li>
            <li> One bottle last forever, and I take a least 4+ showers a day (student-athlete). So when I saw six bottles for this price I had to get them. Old spice users should already know what this smells like (amazing). Those that haven&#x27;t used old spice before, walk into a walmart and find this body wash, open it and smell it to see if you like it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. The smell is strong when you first shower, but the intensity drops off quickly and someone has to be pretty close to smell it after an hour. Even my scent sensitive wife didn&#x27;t mind the smell after the second day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pairs well with the pure sport deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t forget the Pouf Sponge</li>
            <li> I liked it the first time. Now I bought 5 extra for the coming months!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described - Great Price - Promptly Shipped</li>
            <li> My husband has always liked Old Spice products. I ordered these, and after my subscribe and save discount, they are a great price and it&#x27;s a great product! It has a good smell without being too strong and it gets him clean!</li>
            <li> great smell.  really like this.</li>
            <li> Two bottles were opened causing a it to spill in box.  I was happy with price not sure if I would order again, considering two bottles were damaged.</li>
            <li> Run out of things for the husband because he never gives me advance warning, and there are just so many things I can keep track of!  If I could have everything delivered and not run out - and never have to go into another grocery store ever in my life - I would be a much more pleasant person! We both like the scent and I prefer bottles liquid soap rather than bar soap.</li>
            <li> Great scent and lasts most of the day.  It is a great &amp;#34;anytime&amp;#34; personal hygiene product, in that it can be used for daily showers and also has a bit of a coolant/relaxing effect after a run or workout.  The sport scent is a great mild scent.</li>
            <li> I know this sounds stupid, but this scent really does help me wake up in the morning. I usually use Irish Spring, but this was cheaper at the price per ounce level this time when I bought a six pack. Lathers nice and with our standard city water, it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for about 3 years.  Love the way it cleans and my wife loves the way it smells.  Win/win at a good price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and keep coming back to it. I&#x27;ll try other body washes, but I&#x27;ll get about half way through them and go back to the Pure Sport. I like it, my woman loves it, so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> Once you go old you don&#x27;t go back, but u can think it with old spice bodywash. Recommended for little boys, men, and seasoned veterans alike.</li>
            <li> Smells manly.  It should come with a stick.  To beat the women away.  Seriously though, it&#x27;s ok soap.</li>
            <li> I really love this body wash, the scent is really fresh. Old spice is the best. Will buy more in future.</li>
            <li> Nice Smelling body wash, great price for the amount we got. Love the subscribe and save and having more show up when we are just about to run out!</li>
            <li> This my signature scent and soap gets me extra clean and smells great that&#x27;s why I ordered 6 bottles almost a year supply!</li>
            <li> Awesome price for this product</li>
            <li> works great thanks . i love the smell .</li>
            <li> Switched from Old Spice Denali and just wanted something different - this smells great and is not too overbearing as some other Old Spice body washes can be.  Would highly recommend and purchase again.</li>
            <li> Great product. Great price</li>
            <li> Really like the Old Spice HE. Pretty much the only thing I am using right now. I use it as shampoo and body wash.</li>
            <li> fast shipping - item as described. thanks!!</li>
            <li> My husband only uses old spice body wash and this was a great price and obviously great quality &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and on time.</li>
            <li> I was really wondering if this would be a good idea to do or not. Know that I have it is great that I never have to worry about running out of body wash! Plus as I am getting low I can just reorder it!</li>
            <li> smell good great deal</li>
            <li> My husband loves this product</li>
            <li> I like this very  much and it makes the bathroom smell good,even my wife likes the smell very much.It also feels good on your skin after taking a shower.</li>
            <li> my boyfriend loves this stuff and i bought these along while ago and he still has one left! great price! nothing leaked.</li>
            <li> This has been my boyfriend&#x27;s favorite scent for about 4 years.  We were disappointed when the stores stopped stocking and selling it but I&#x27;m pleased that we can purchase it online for a fair price.  It doesn&#x27;t dry his skin the way other body washes can and leaves a nice, fresh, manly scent on him all day!  I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase. Product came in a timely manner and as described. It was packaged very efficiently - I just put the whole box it came in under my sink to keep them all in one place!</li>
            <li> wish this came in a push bottle.</li>
            <li> I got everything I asked for with this order.  I didn&#x27;t do all the math and shopping around until after I placed the order though.  It ended up not making a difference whether I picked up this product at the grocery store or from Amazon.</li>
            <li> My husband insists on Old Spice, everything.  He loves it and I do, too.  It is fresh smelling - not too strong.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time, but one of the bottles was leaking at the top.  The other five bottle were intact.</li>
            <li> Great soap.  Still washing all my smelly parts with it! I would purchase again for sure. Hope you enjoy yours.</li>
            <li> it cleans the parts I need cleaned</li>
            <li> My son uses this and absolutely loves it.  Couldn&#x27;t beat the price either.  We should be set for a few more months</li>
            <li> Just what we wanted arrived on time</li>
            <li> Although the shipping process was brutal and my package came a little wet from the gel leaking, I still like the product. Gives you a really nice clean and it smells amazing. I&#x27;ve gotten several compliments from this shower gel and this surprised me because I recently switched out of Dove soap bars, which smelled like nothing. Definitely invest in this product if you want a masculine scent after a hot shower. Also, it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin dry and chap! That&#x27;s most important for me! 4 stars because of the lousy shipping situation but customer service helped me out a ton.</li>
            <li> used the deodorant since i was in high school and why not try this right?  well it is made out of some kind of water-phobic gel that slides right off the sponge and into the drain.  But do not worry, they made the opening at the top huge so a lot can come out and go down the drain all at once!  Smells great, but don&#x27;t think i will order again</li>
            <li> i realy love it and good service i realy love it and good service i realy love it and good service</li>
            <li> + Good bargain set of 6&lt;br /&gt;+ Classic sporty shower smell&lt;br /&gt;+ Long lasting pleasant smell&lt;br /&gt;You can choose newer series of Old Spice which has a more pleasant smell but this works great too.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite bodywash. I&#x27;ve used this since it came out. Before then I&#x27;ve been a long Old Spice Sport antiperspirant user. This stuff is great. It smells just like the Old Spice Sport body spray and antiperspirant so you don&#x27;t have conflicting smells. It is a little pricey compared to a soap bar but the great smell lasts almost all day. Definitely recommend, especially if you like the Old Spice Sport body spray or antiperspirant/deoterant.</li>
            <li> Its one of the most refreshing scents out there.  Unable to find in local stores. Great price.</li>
            <li> I bought this body wash from Amazon as a way to save some money at the local store. It arrived quickly in a cardboard Old Spice box containing all of the 18oz bottles. The bottles&#x27; tops were all still securely closed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For staying at home, these are perfect. The tops are easy to open (flip top that secures with friction) and don&#x27;t come undone on their own during the life of a single bottle. For travel though you may want to look elsewhere. While I have yet to have a problem with them, they do seem as though they could be opened relatively simply as there is a small lip on the front of the flip top for your fingers which could easily get caught on something in a travel bag. For this reason, if you are traveling with this, I recommend placing it in a zip lock bag or other container so that if it does open, you will not have your other items ruined as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of scent, this product is potent but very nice. Whenever I get out of the shower, my girlfriend is quite happy to just lay nearby so that she can smell it. I know that won&#x27;t be true of all women, but I would definitely rate this as a pleasant smell that can last nicely. When paired with the Pure Sport deodorant, this is a great all day combination.</li>
            <li> Smells great, but doesn&#x27;t lather up very well compared to other body washes used with a loofa.</li>
            <li> This body wash is the best! Women really like the scent too which is good. I like ordering it off Amazon now as it is cheaper than in the store and I don&#x27;t have to go as much. Perfect! I&#x27;ve been using this for years.</li>
            <li> Works as you expected. But the bottle is very thin. Always over flow a bit inside cap.</li>
            <li> Been using these for a few years now, love the scent isn&#x27;t too strong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a body wash&lt;br /&gt;I use it in the shower and it works!&lt;br /&gt;Allows me to punch through walls to reach for my towel when I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> This body wash works very well and smells great. It lasts a long time as well because you do not have to use a ton of it.</li>
            <li> yused for a long time</li>
            <li> Old Spice body wash has been part of my life the past 4-5 years.&lt;br /&gt;I love the long lasting smell, especially with the Pure Sport scent.&lt;br /&gt;It is always an item in my bathroom. I always have one in my gym&#x27;s bag.&lt;br /&gt;These are a bit pricey, so I usually buy them at wholesale club or when there is a sale or if there is coupon from manufacture.&lt;br /&gt;I always stock them to make sure I never run out of it</li>
            <li> I love this for my daily showers. I even get the &amp;#34;AXE&amp;#34; effect that Axe company is always promoting. My wife constantly says how good I smell after showers because of this product. Great job Old Spice!</li>
            <li> I smell awesome all day long.  Much better than using my wife&#x27;s girl stuff.  I&#x27;m not sure if it cleans better, but I smell better.</li>
            <li> smells great and keeps me clean</li>
            <li> Love this stuff it gets you clean. Let&#x27;s be honest though, does it matter if we like the smell? No, not really. The wife thinks it smells great, which is really all that matters. On the cleaning side, of course that matters, this stuff lathers well and really gets me squeaky clean even with the hard water that we have here. I love that this is available on Amazon.com&#x27;s Subscribe and Save program. I just make sure that each shipment has 5 or more items in the Subsribe and Save cart and BAM 15% off! that is cheaper than W**-M***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just sayin people, this is good, cheap and works!</li>
            <li> smells great hubby loves it</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Old Spice is a scent that reminds us we are away but not forgotten by those at home.\\&quot;  That is the response I received from the recipient.  The package arrived quickly (in a military post overseas time-line) and was well received. No leaks to package.  It can be shared by several and still maintain hygiene.</li>
            <li> Great price.  Fast delivery.  Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Clean and refreshing smell last all day</li>
            <li> Best price I could find on bulk body wash. Makes me smell fresh like a man, not fresh like a 17 year old horndog.</li>
            <li> This is my body wash of preference. I don&#x27;t want one that smells like gardenia&#x27;s or a fruit salad - this one is pleasant and does the job.</li>
            <li> What can I say? If your grandfather had not used it then you might not be here. Biggest problem I have is smelling so damn good.</li>
            <li> These items were a good steal I actually bought them for family use.  The fragrance just lights up the entire house once it is being used.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite scent out of all the Old Spice products. It smells nice, but it&#x27;s also not over-the-top. Scent also seems to carry on much longer after use than anything else I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what my husband said when I asked him if he liked this.  However, he won&#x27;t use another brand.  Subscribe and save really saves money on the mutipacks.</li>
            <li> This is much cheaper than target and I love the scent when my husband uses it it leads to other things. His chest smells amazing and he is pretty hairy!</li>
            <li> What a great deal. Love the scent, love the brand, love the price. I will definitely be back for more (whenever I run out of my original purchase).</li>
            <li> Does the job... but way too expensive.</li>
            <li> Its soap.. It does the cleaning part its supposed to do.. The scent does not last very long though and is mild, but I did read this in other reviews.</li>
            <li> Before I start, I would like for you to know, that this is a serious review! This soap smells good and cleans your body good except for one area. If you had started using this and noticed that your arm pits started to sweat more it is the soap! I had found the cure for sweaty arm pits use a bar soap for your pits! For some reason that works and it drys them out! I have ruined several shirts because I have only used this in the shower and it has left me with several pit stains on my shirts! This is why I am only giving this product 3/5! I wish old spice could pay me 50 dollars for the shirts it has ruined!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are WARNED!</li>
            <li> My kids love Old Spice. They use all the time any say that I should keep buying this product. If it works for them, it works for me!</li>
