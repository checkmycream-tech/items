            <li>Oh and best part is, I&#x27;m a waitress at a very popular bar here in Hawaii and it LASTED THE WHOLE SHIFT WITHOUT CAKING!  </li>

            <li>Great color pay off, you a light hand.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pictures are not the greatest for showing what eye shadow pallet or blush colors really look like.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re still nice though.</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>very pigmented and able to be blended!!!</li>
            <li>These colors are even better in person, so incredibly pigmented and great on deep skin tones!!</li>
            <li>so being able to order is nice.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful, sleek packaging with a large mirror.</li>
            <li>Love the product, but like most picture the color was off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I made this purchase and would recommend.</li>
            <li>The service and product are top notch.</li>
            <li>and I love them ALL.  </li>
            <li>I truly love ALL their products.  </li>
            <li>I love the colors.</li>
            <li>use a light hand!</li>
            <li>Love this palette.  </li>
            <li>To the creators of Sleek Makeup, as long as you keep making these beautiful blush palettes, you have a customer for life!!!</li>
            <li>Very cool arrived intact</li>
            <li>very fair like alabaster/lightest shade in any foundation and the middle color is perfect for creating a subtle orange peach blush with nice reflective qualities without being sparkly</li>
            <li>Fit all shades of skin tones.</li>
            <li>its so cheap</li>
            <li>The colors are more bight and pretty in person.</li>
            <li>Application goes on very smooth, blends easily, and you don&#x27;t need a lot of product because product is highly pigmented.</li>
            <li>I only planned on buying one palette, but I loved it so much I ended up purchasing 4 more.</li>
            <li>I suggest doing an image search on Google to see true image.</li>
            <li>The pans are 3cm by 5cm, it comes with a full size mirror.</li>
            <li>Very pigmented- will require a light touch and lots of blending!</li>
            <li>Super pigmented, and comparable to the Nars or Mac blushes.</li>
            <li>First time an eyeshadow has produced that effect for me, no joke!  </li>
            <li>Other than that, blends beautifully and very silky to touch.  </li>
            <li>The colors on the left and right are vibrant but with a light touch, still look pretty on fair skin.</li>
            <li>Aww who am I kidding.  </li>
            <li>Saw this on pixiwoo and could only find the rose gold color in a palette but</li>
            <li>Not necessarily  a bad thing, just imagine them much brighter!</li>
            <li>Intense!</li>
            <li>Great for me for the long run though as product will last FOREVER, literally!  </li>
            <li>is, dare I say it???, better pigmented and longer lasting....</li>
            <li>Overall i&#x27;m quite pleased.</li>
            <li>I got my order really fast!</li>
            <li>The colors are gorgeous in this palette, but use a light hand and a fluffy (or fan) brush because the pigment is super dense so you have to be careful.  </li>
            <li>Very pigmented, a bit to shinny with the middle color but the other 2 colors are very nice.</li>
            <li>Nice to have a little variety-</li>
            <li>On all the trio the colors shown look very muted compared to real life.</li>
            <li>I have olive toned skin and these colors work very well with it</li>
            <li>and it is very affordable.</li>
            <li>The colors of this blush palette are a lot darker and more orange than I expected.</li>
            <li>The pigmentation in the orange-coral one isn&#x27;t as intense as the others.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Just as pigmented as high end blushes.</li>
            <li>Although Sleek Makeup is not considered high end</li>
            <li>Highly pigmented.  </li>
            <li>Colors are true to life and stays on for a long period of time.</li>
            <li>I live in Hawaii, and I ordered it on January 26, 2014 and received it February 1st.</li>
            <li>The go on smooth, they are blendable, and you can make them as sheer or deep as you want.</li>
            <li>I am a beginner to wearing makeup so far it is definitely not difficult for me to tell high quality products from low quality products.</li>
            <li>My skin tends to absorb color and oftentimes I find my blush is entirely gone after 4 to 5 hours, but this blush always stays on really well and lasts all day until I remove it in the evening.</li>
            <li>So far I have purchased the Au Natural Pallet, the Storm Pallet, the Blush by 3 in Lace, and the Face Form Contour</li>
            <li>The middle shade is similar to Nars Orgasm and can be used to add some highlight/sparkle to the cheekbone alone or on top of the the other two blushes.</li>
            <li>Colors are vibrant and the palette has been dropped without breaking, which is a big pro in my book.</li>
            <li>it definitely exceeds high quality material.</li>

            <li> Since the product is so high in pigmentation you don&#x27;t even need a lot, just swirl a little bit on to your blush brush, tap off the excess</li>
            <li> Blushes look frightening in the pan, BUT they are really easily blended.</li>
            <li> I may try to just buy that as a single the next time.</li>
            <li> They are very pigmented and only require a little tap with the blush brush and another little tap to get any excess off.</li>
            <li> The biggest plus is, it lasts almost all day long.</li>
            <li> The middle shade is a close dupe to Nars Orgasm (peachy pink with gold shimmer).</li>
            <li> My only con is that since Sleek Makeup is a UK brand this item is not available in US stores so Amazon and Ebay are my only source for buying.</li>
            <li> I live in the States and received my order once again within a few days of my purchase!!</li>
            <li> the other shades are a coral and reddish pink.</li>
            <li> Currently working on purchasing the Oh so special and maybe the Arabian Nights or Bad Girl.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed :-)</li>
            <li> The colors are so pigmented on my dark skin</li>
            <li> I had to get used to dipping my makeup brush ever so slightly into pot.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a looooong looooong way.  </li>
            <li> The color is a little brighter then in the photo.</li>
            <li> The packaging on the palette is sturdy and a little heavy.</li>
            <li> waste my time and money with this order.</li>
            <li> I can absolutely guarantee you will not be disappointed!  </li>
            <li> I have bought multiple pallets and have never been disappointed.</li>
            <li> However, the shipping was done poorly.</li>

            <li> Awesome product! very pigmented and able to be blended!!! However, the shipping was done poorly. one of my blush trios came in smashed.</li>
            <li> I love sleek blushes! Application goes on very smooth, blends easily, and you don&#x27;t need a lot of product because product is highly pigmented. The biggest plus is, it lasts almost all day long. Plus it&#x27;s affordable! 👍</li>
            <li> This set are blushes are incredible, specially for the price. Super pigmented, and comparable to the Nars or Mac blushes. The go on smooth, they are blendable, and you can make them as sheer or deep as you want. Great quality and beautiful packaging!</li>
            <li> These blushes pack a punch. They are very pigmented and only require a little tap with the blush brush and another little tap to get any excess off. The colors on the left and right are vibrant but with a light touch, still look pretty on fair skin. The middle shade is similar to Nars Orgasm and can be used to add some highlight/sparkle to the cheekbone alone or on top of the the other two blushes. Great value for the price.</li>

            <li> Love it!!! Colors are true to life and stays on for a long period of time. I have olive toned skin and these colors work very well with it :) Happy I purchased it</li>
            <li> I love the color! Intense!</li>
            <li> Just as pigmented as high end blushes. Beautiful, sleek packaging with a large mirror. Blushes look frightening in the pan, BUT they are really easily blended. Fit all shades of skin tones. Lightening speed shipment from this seller by Air Mail from Europe.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this item. The picture does not give this product justice. The colors are more bight and pretty in person. Perfect summer colors. I&#x27;m so glad I made this purchase and would recommend.</li>
            <li> I live in the States and received my order once again within a few days of my purchase!! The service and product are top notch. You won&#x27;t be disappointed :-)</li>
            <li> I am a beginner to wearing makeup so far it is definitely not difficult for me to tell high quality products from low quality products. Although Sleek Makeup is not considered high end it definitely exceeds high quality material. The colors are so pigmented on my dark skin and it is very affordable. Since the product is so high in pigmentation you don&#x27;t even need a lot, just swirl a little bit on to your blush brush, tap off the excess your good to go. I only planned on buying one palette, but I loved it so much I ended up purchasing 4 more. If I could give this product 10 stars I would. My only con is that since Sleek Makeup is a UK brand this item is not available in US stores so Amazon and Ebay are my only source for buying. To the creators of Sleek Makeup, as long as you keep making these beautiful blush palettes, you have a customer for life!!!</li>
            <li> Highly pigmented.  A little goes a looooong looooong way.  I had to get used to dipping my makeup brush ever so slightly into pot.  Great for me for the long run though as product will last FOREVER, literally!  Other than that, blends beautifully and very silky to touch.  Oh and best part is, I&#x27;m a waitress at a very popular bar here in Hawaii and it LASTED THE WHOLE SHIFT WITHOUT CAKING!  First time an eyeshadow has produced that effect for me, no joke!  Love the beautiful color pallets.  So far I have purchased the Au Natural Pallet, the Storm Pallet, the Blush by 3 in Lace, and the Face Form Contour and I love them ALL.  Currently working on purchasing the Oh so special and maybe the Arabian Nights or Bad Girl.  Aww who am I kidding.  I&#x27;m probably going to purchase them all.  If you want bang for your buck, you need to try Sleek.  I truly love ALL their products.  I can absolutely guarantee you will not be disappointed!  Oh and almost forgot, a lot of these colors are dupes for Mac and Naked eye shadows except Sleek is, dare I say it???, better pigmented and longer lasting....lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE**&lt;br /&gt;Pictures are not the greatest for showing what eye shadow pallet or blush colors really look like.  I suggest doing an image search on Google to see true image.</li>
            <li> I love the colors. In the picture the colores looks liter but they are really bright but very nice. I have not try it still but just by look at it and feeling they ate good blush.</li>
            <li> Saw this on pixiwoo and could only find the rose gold color in a palette but its so cheap so I bought all 3&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very fair like alabaster/lightest shade in any foundation and the middle color is perfect for creating a subtle orange peach blush with nice reflective qualities without being sparkly&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Used this palette while traveling. Loved the side colors, pigmentation, and mirror.</li>
            <li> These colors are even better in person, so incredibly pigmented and great on deep skin tones!!</li>
            <li> I ordered 19items but I just got 6items and another was missing.&lt;br /&gt;I waste my time and money with this order.</li>
            <li> So pigmented! use a light hand!</li>
            <li> Love this palette.  Colors are vibrant and the palette has been dropped without breaking, which is a big pro in my book.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get Sleek in drugs stores in the US so being able to order is nice.  Very pigmented, a bit to shinny with the middle color but the other 2 colors are very nice.</li>
            <li> Very cool arrived intact</li>
            <li> Best blush i has purchased. Use it every day</li>
            <li> The colors of this blush palette are a lot darker and more orange than I expected. They&#x27;re still nice though. The pans are 3cm by 5cm, it comes with a full size mirror. The tangerine color and the deep salmon-red color are matte, whereas the middle orange-coral color is a shimmer. The pigmentation in the orange-coral one isn&#x27;t as intense as the others. Overall i&#x27;m quite pleased. I got my order really fast! I live in Hawaii, and I ordered it on January 26, 2014 and received it February 1st. It was packaged in bubble wrap as well as a padded envelope. The packaging on the palette is sturdy and a little heavy.</li>
            <li> Love the palette! Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Nice product. Received in 12 days even though the shipping estimate was 4-6 weeks (UK to Alabama). Very pigmented- will require a light touch and lots of blending! The middle shade is a close dupe to Nars Orgasm (peachy pink with gold shimmer). I may try to just buy that as a single the next time. Nice to have a little variety- the other shades are a coral and reddish pink. Recommend!</li>
            <li> Sleek products are the best and so inexpensive. I have bought multiple pallets and have never been disappointed.</li>
