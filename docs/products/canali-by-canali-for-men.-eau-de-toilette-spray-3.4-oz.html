            <li>Perfect.</li>
            <li>I read the great reviews on this cologne on Sephora&#x27;s website and decided to purshase it for my boyfriend.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a stronger really good scent, try Pasha de Cartier for Men or Bvlgari Man.</li>
            <li>Canali was a gift to our son and is one of the best colognes out there right now.  </li>
            <li>For the money, its a great product and will always be my favorite, and the ladys favorite too!</li>
            <li>The wife hates it, but I love it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells great, comes in a cool looking bottle and isn&#x27;t priced in the stratosphere.</li>
            <li>but it is good really like this scent for men it wears really good on me</li>
            <li>WILL CONTINUE TO ORDER WHEN MORE IS NEED THRU AMAZON.</li>
            <li>He loves it, I love it and he gets complements everywhere.</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance.</li>
            <li>He was very happy and uses it daily.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t get any better then</li>
            <li>:) I wish I could rate it 10 stars</li>
            <li>Wow amazing aroma from this cologne !</li>
            <li>The product is fine, however, I did not expect it to come labeled a &amp;#34;tester&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>SHIPPED SAFELY AND ARRIVED QUICKLY.</li>
            <li>and we appreciate free shipping.</li>
            <li>GREAT PRICE FOR THE BIG BOTTLE.</li>
            <li>Fantastic fragrance - wish it weren&#x27;t discontinued.</li>
            <li>Thank you Amazon for still making it available.  </li>
            <li>i loved Canali for long time, would get more</li>
            <li>They are exclusive and unique.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to see that Amazon carried it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a well-balanced scent, not too sweet, not too spicy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Why they did not put the right picture, because they want to full the buyer</li>
            <li>All of this designer&#x27;s fragrances are worth the money.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m married though.</li>
            <li>Luckily, I found it available on Amazon and cannot tell you the countless compliments I have received on it!</li>
            <li>Very classic understated scent.  </li>
            <li>Great product, great price but outrageous postage charges which I had not picked up when ordering.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>fortunately they were sold out and subsequently discountined the product.</li>
            <li>but after a few compliments on how nice it smells, you don&#x27;t mind........</li>
            <li>Soft, clean smelling without a loud scream</li>
            <li>But the Canali I do like and will venture to say I&#x27;ll use it more often than I&#x27;ve used other colognes in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but good enough that you can smell it on your clothes the next day and get a compliment just for wearing the clothes the day after since the smell stays that long...</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have wanted to replace with the same scent.  </li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>Since the sole purpose of cologne is to make you smell good to others for a while, I&#x27;d say Canali is a FAIL in this respect.  </li>
            <li>Very hard to get seeing as it has been discontinued by most retailers.</li>
            <li>But seriously, my wife brought me home one of those tiny sample tubes of Canali and I really enjoyed the scent.</li>
            <li>It is such a masculine yet aromatic scent.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I did try two other versions of Canali</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since bought some other cologne and am thinking donating this stuff or throwing it away.  </li>
            <li> Usually my wife will hope that I&#x27;ll splash some on when we go on a big date.</li>
            <li> but i kinda hope they&#x27;d discount the price little bit, get it anyway</li>
            <li> I have purchased product in the past from a specialty store.  </li>
            <li> So when I say I&#x27;m not a huge user of men&#x27;s fragrances, I mean it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve given it a few weeks now and come to the conclusion that the scent is way too weak.  </li>
            <li> And I even have a hard time smelling it on myself after an hour or so.  </li>
            <li> THIS HAS BEEN HARD TO FIND IN THE STORES</li>
            <li> What does that mean?</li>
            <li> I usually become sort of bored with a scent over time and want to try something else.  </li>
            <li> ALL the ladies go crazy why they smell Canali on me.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s impossible to get a compliment.  </li>
            <li> The worst description, it&#x27;s a travel kit.</li>

            <li> i loved Canali for long time, would get more but i kinda hope they&#x27;d discount the price little bit, get it anyway you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I have purchased product in the past from a specialty store.  The product is fine, however, I did not expect it to come labeled a &amp;#34;tester&amp;#34;.  What does that mean?</li>
            <li> Great product, great price but outrageous postage charges which I had not picked up when ordering. These charges made the overall price uneconomic. Be careful to check the transportation charges!</li>
            <li> I usually become sort of bored with a scent over time and want to try something else.  This is the first time I have wanted to replace with the same scent.  I did try two other versions of Canali but my wife agrees that this is the best.</li>
            <li> Received this for Christmas.  I&#x27;ve given it a few weeks now and come to the conclusion that the scent is way too weak.  No one ever notices it so it&#x27;s impossible to get a compliment.  And I even have a hard time smelling it on myself after an hour or so.  I&#x27;ve even tested with friends and they can&#x27;t smell it on me without sticking their nose in my neck.  Since the sole purpose of cologne is to make you smell good to others for a while, I&#x27;d say Canali is a FAIL in this respect.  I&#x27;ve since bought some other cologne and am thinking donating this stuff or throwing it away.  If you&#x27;re looking for a stronger really good scent, try Pasha de Cartier for Men or Bvlgari Man.</li>
            <li> This is not Cavalli, it is Canali a different brand. Soft, clean smelling without a loud scream but good enough that you can smell it on your clothes the next day and get a compliment just for wearing the clothes the day after since the smell stays that long... Perfect.</li>
            <li> Canali was a gift to our son and is one of the best colognes out there right now.  Thanks and we appreciate free shipping.</li>
            <li> ORDERED FOR MY HUSBAND FOR CHRISTMAS. GREAT PRICE FOR THE BIG BOTTLE. SHIPPED SAFELY AND ARRIVED QUICKLY. THIS HAS BEEN HARD TO FIND IN THE STORES AND WAS A LOT CHEAPER THAN AT NORDSTROMS.. WILL CONTINUE TO ORDER WHEN MORE IS NEED THRU AMAZON. THX..</li>
            <li> All of this designer&#x27;s fragrances are worth the money.  They are exclusive and unique.  I would recommend collecting all of them.</li>
            <li> WOW! I smelled this fragrance while on vacation and wished I had bought it at the time. Luckily, I found it available on Amazon and cannot tell you the countless compliments I have received on it! It is such a masculine yet aromatic scent. I DEFINATELY recommend it!</li>
            <li> It is a tester but it is good really like this scent for men it wears really good on me</li>
            <li> The wife hates it, but I love it! ALL the ladies go crazy why they smell Canali on me. Nothing but complements and flirting going on. I have worn it for years and have use nothing else since. (cologne) For the money, its a great product and will always be my favorite, and the ladys favorite too!</li>
            <li> I read the great reviews on this cologne on Sephora&#x27;s website and decided to purshase it for my boyfriend. Un fortunately they were sold out and subsequently discountined the product. I was excited to see that Amazon carried it. Let me tell you...Canali does not dissappoint. He loves it, I love it and he gets complements everywhere. Solid purchase!</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance. I purchased it for my husband as a gift. He was very happy and uses it daily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a guy who wears cologne or after shave on a daily basis. Usually my wife will hope that I&#x27;ll splash some on when we go on a big date. But that only happens once or twice a year (just joking honey). But seriously, my wife brought me home one of those tiny sample tubes of Canali and I really enjoyed the scent. So did she. Win-Win. I ordered some shortly thereafter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To put things in perspective, my last bottle of eau de toilette was Calvin Klein One that I bought about 6 years ago. I -just- used it up recently. So when I say I&#x27;m not a huge user of men&#x27;s fragrances, I mean it. But the Canali I do like and will venture to say I&#x27;ll use it more often than I&#x27;ve used other colognes in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a well-balanced scent, not too sweet, not too spicy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells great, comes in a cool looking bottle and isn&#x27;t priced in the stratosphere.</li>
            <li> The worst description, it&#x27;s a travel kit. Why they did not put the right picture, because they want to full the buyer</li>
            <li> Needed this in my life!!!!! It was needed! Get&#x27;s you laid!!!! Babes want me!!! I&#x27;m married though. Have to keep pushing chicks off of me!</li>
            <li> Fantastic fragrance - wish it weren&#x27;t discontinued.</li>
            <li> Wow amazing aroma from this cologne ! And it&#x27;s Huuuuge and the price is unbeatable ??? Can&#x27;t get any better then this :) I wish I could rate it 10 stars</li>
            <li> Very classic understated scent.  Very hard to get seeing as it has been discontinued by most retailers. Thank you Amazon for still making it available.  A costly purchase but after a few compliments on how nice it smells, you don&#x27;t mind........</li>
