            <li>Just what I needed I love</li>

            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>the best brushes ever thanks ever so much will order more from you soon</li>
            <li>We are feeling scrubby clean!</li>
            <li>You get two quality brushes,  The bristles are comfortable and easy to clean after using.  </li>
            <li>We love the 2 brushes in this economic 2-pack - one for each bath!  </li>
            <li>Nice plastic color and are gentles with soft skin.</li>
            <li>Good price, a little softer would make this better...</li>
            <li>These were exactly what I wanted, sturdy, easy to keep clean, the right length, and can be hung from our shower rings.  </li>
            <li>These are better quality and soft.</li>
            <li>The handles are colorful plastic and seem to stand up to use - including the seven-year-old playing with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would have liked colours or a colour that matched my ensuite décor - red, chocolate, or sand coloured.</li>
            <li>OK brushes, maybe a little too long for good control but work OK</li>
            <li>- just right.</li>
            <li>Will be easy to maintain in like new condition as it is plastic.</li>
            <li>The first one has already gotten discolored (orange rust-color) at the bottom of the brush head, where the scrubbers meet the plastic head.</li>
            <li>Very good, a little bit short.</li>
            <li>These are great and the bristles are not too stiff and hard, they are soft and fell great.</li>
            <li>Great in shower, but gentle enough to use for dry brushing, too.  </li>
            <li>overall a good product mainly because it will not create mold and mildew like a wooden handle.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not fancy, but happen to be just the right length, light, easy to handle, rugged, curved for ease of back-reach, and have goldilocks nylon bristles - not too harsh, but not too soft</li>
            <li>lol Not too hard or soft.</li>
            <li>The brushes were high quality!</li>
            <li>for the head of the brush, it&#x27;s wide enough so that you get good coverage when using.&lt;br</li>
            <li>For the price these are decent brushes.  </li>
            <li>I am not that sensitive really, but this thing is like sandpaper.</li>
            <li>Bristles are just right for my back.</li>
            <li>2 very durable, ergonomically designed brushed for use on any part of your body.</li>
            <li>Fine at first, but not great quality.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my usual cheap gift  request if anyone asks me for an idea.</li>
            <li>Stiff enough to clean and exfoliate thoroughly, but gentle as such not to irritate skin with average sensitivity.</li>
            <li>handle is a little short &amp; brush head smaller than expected but not bad for the price charged</li>

            <li> handle is a little short &amp; brush head smaller than expected but not bad for the price charged</li>
            <li> middle aged male and these do not reach all areas of my back.  </li>
            <li> Also long enough.</li>
            <li> Brush is soft, handle is sturdy and slightly curved to help with reach.  </li>
            <li> I agree with others that the handles are a bit short, but they are the same length as other brands.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are on the &amp;#34;brisk&amp;#34; side, not soft, which is what I like.</li>
            <li> While the handles may be a little short for those with longer arms, they seem to be standard size with other back brushes I&#x27;ve had.  </li>
            <li> I have bought other products and you can see I had to replaced them due to the fact that they did not last.  </li>
            <li> It keeps your soapy hand from slipping off.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Unless your diminutive or extremely flexible these brushes won&#x27;t work for you.  </li>
            <li> I had another brand with just a smooth grip and it was impossible to hold onto.</li>
            <li> A little rough on the skin.  </li>
            <li> It reaches areas in the back that have become hard to reach, otherwise.</li>
            <li> Works Wonders on the back and hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> Extremely durable!</li>
            <li> Hard to find back brushes with firm bristles, these are just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> They look like they&#x27;ll last for a few years at least.</li>
            <li> Although the synthetic materials used for the bristles is a little too scratchy for my comfort level.</li>
            <li> just had them for a few days . . .</li>
            <li> Why the missing star?  </li>
            <li> too hard, but it works</li>
            <li> I was about to grudgingly pay this for a single when I saw this offering.  </li>
            <li> Bristles are too thin to hold soap.</li>

            <li> Very good, a little bit short.</li>
            <li> Good price, a little softer would make this better...but otherwise is a good brush for the money</li>
            <li> Could have stronger handles</li>
            <li> Great shower brushes with really good bristle strength. Gave one to my sister as a gift and she also loves it! It reaches areas in the back that have become hard to reach, otherwise.</li>
            <li> 2 very durable, ergonomically designed brushed for use on any part of your body. Stiff enough to clean and exfoliate thoroughly, but gentle as such not to irritate skin with average sensitivity. Best shower brushes on Amazon imo.</li>
            <li> Got one for myself and one for my fellow.  They are very nice and sturdy. I have bought other products and you can see I had to replaced them due to the fact that they did not last.  These are better quality and soft. I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Great, does the work and the price is good. Extremely durable!</li>
            <li> Great buy on some great brushes.  We are feeling scrubby clean!</li>
            <li> Great quality for the inexpensive price.  Brush is soft, handle is sturdy and slightly curved to help with reach.  (Paid $10)  I was about to grudgingly pay this for a single when I saw this offering.  Bonus!  Recommended for this price.</li>
            <li> These were extremely good value.  You get two quality brushes,  The bristles are comfortable and easy to clean after using.  While the handles may be a little short for those with longer arms, they seem to be standard size with other back brushes I&#x27;ve had.

            <li> Hard to find back brushes with firm bristles, these are just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Contrary to what Lori for TopNotch replies above - these brushes are only 14 inches from tip to tip.  I&#x27;m 5&#x27;-10&amp;#34; middle aged male and these do not reach all areas of my back.  It was a mistake purchasing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless your diminutive or extremely flexible these brushes won&#x27;t work for you.  They do not meet the Implied Warranty of Merchantability and the listing should be removed.  This is based on the description &amp;#34;Bath and Shower Brush&amp;#34; with a handle which implies you can wash all areas of your body - you cannot.  Avoid.</li>
            <li> the best brushes ever thanks ever so much will order more from you soon</li>
            <li> I love them. It&#x27;s my usual cheap gift  request if anyone asks me for an idea. lol Not too hard or soft. Also long enough.</li>
            <li> OK brushes, maybe a little too long for good control but work OK</li>
            <li> they are Ok.  handle is a little short &amp; brush head smaller than expected but not bad for the price charged</li>
            <li> just had them for a few days . . . but well made and good price.  The bristles are on the &amp;#34;brisk&amp;#34; side, not soft, which is what I like.</li>
            <li> The brushes were high quality! Nice plastic color and are gentles with soft skin. I recommend it</li>
            <li> Good quality and easy to keep clean. Bristles are just right for my back. Will be easy to maintain in like new condition as it is plastic.</li>
            <li> too hard, but it works</li>
            <li> Yes.  These were exactly what I wanted, sturdy, easy to keep clean, the right length, and can be hung from our shower rings.  Why the missing star?  I would have liked colours or a colour that matched my ensuite décor - red, chocolate, or sand coloured.</li>
            <li> Good grip and nice size brush head.  Great in shower, but gentle enough to use for dry brushing, too.  No mildew or rot as in wood models.</li>
            <li> Good brushes, quick delivery, excellent packaging.  I agree with others that the handles are a bit short, but they are the same length as other brands.  A longer option would be nice.  One very good feature is the grip.  It keeps your soapy hand from slipping off.  I had another brand with just a smooth grip and it was impossible to hold onto.</li>
            <li> We love the 2 brushes in this economic 2-pack - one for each bath!  They&#x27;re not fancy, but happen to be just the right length, light, easy to handle, rugged, curved for ease of back-reach, and have goldilocks nylon bristles - not too harsh, but not too soft - just right. They look like they&#x27;ll last for a few years at least.</li>
            <li> Good hand grip, good reach, pleasant feel. Needed this to help be self-sufficient with ALS.</li>
            <li> So far so good! I got these for my husband and daughter. My husband said it hurts so good lol.</li>
            <li> Works Wonders on the back and hard to reach places. Just what I needed I love it works wonders on the skin.</li>
            <li> Bristles are too thin to hold soap.</li>
            <li> overall a good product mainly because it will not create mold and mildew like a wooden handle. I would recommend</li>
            <li> For the price these are decent brushes.  Although the synthetic materials used for the bristles is a little too scratchy for my comfort level. I forgot to consider this when making this purchase.  But, I have used them and they seem to be holding up well.</li>
            <li> scrub, scrub rub a dub dub :-)</li>
            <li> A little rough on the skin.  I am not that sensitive really, but this thing is like sandpaper.</li>
            <li> Fine at first, but not great quality. The first one has already gotten discolored (orange rust-color) at the bottom of the brush head, where the scrubbers meet the plastic head. Only been using it for a couple of months.</li>
