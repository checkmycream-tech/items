    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found that applying it in the evening before going to bed after showering and drying the area has worked the best.</li>
            <li>perfect !</li>
            <li>cream can be your best friend.  </li>
            <li>Very good for my feet  and hands.</li>
            <li>It works great.</li>
            <li>works great for rash of skin after weight loss surgery,,  and the 3m cavilon</li>
            <li>When I went to see the colorectal surgeon, he could still see that I had had a fissure, but was impressed with how nicely it had healed.  </li>
            <li>It, and the excellent attention to hand care and cleanliness on the part of all the staff AND my husband, (who had the job of unpacking and bandaging the wound when more than three days passed between appojntments at the WCC), kept the incision infection-free to the date I&#x27;m writing this review.</li>
            <li>When the surgeon took a good look at the popped area, he made the decision to remove the rest of the staples holding the incision together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Without a good seal around the wound, the vac couldn&#x27;t draw well through the wound.  </li>
            <li>Works good for my husband that works in a machine shop and with coolant</li>
            <li>When we applied the Cavilon to my skin, both at home and at the WCC, before any tape was applied, I found the cream lasted as an effective barrier between 30-36 hours.  </li>
            <li>when it did, get something warm to drink, curl up in your favorite chair and settle in.  </li>
            <li>Any review of this cream will, of necessity, include more information about the problem it is helping to solve than it will information about the cream.  </li>
            <li>Versus most of two years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s more about the vac and my anatomy than it is about the Cavilon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cavilon will make the difference between healthy skin, able to continue to receive tape, and itchy, inflammed and reactive skin.  </li>
            <li>Will be buying more.</li>
            <li>The only problem I have experienced is cleaning the washcloths as you need to use bleach and soap so white washcloths are best.</li>
            <li>Being able to get a good seal with the tape, which was applied over and around the bandaging, to the outside edges of my wound was what made the vac so effective.  </li>
            <li>He was very impressed, stating that he and other doctors like him have been trying to identify a doucle barrier cream that could help their patients.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use this cream</li>
            <li>As anyone with IBS or post colon surgery knows, your exit area can become quite irritated with frequent wiping, kind of our own special &amp;#34;diaper rash&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Huge.  </li>
            <li>I found that applying more cream to exposed skin around the edges of the tape helped calm the itching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the absolute best out there and has actually cleared up sores that nothing else seems to heal.  </li>
            <li>and I also realized that I wasn&#x27;t really getting a thorough application because of what had preceded it and that using a tissue to apply it was not really the best way to get to all of the irritated</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a clean smell and its not offensive.</li>
            <li>A special tape is applied over the packed wound, out onto the edges of the skin, creating a seal</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now,just to be sure you really understand.  </li>
            <li>It has proven to be a true barrier between my skin and the tape, which holds the bandage in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In my humble opinion, it is a brilliant piece of technology which, in my case, worked a miracle on my body.  </li>
            <li>I bought it for one, and they&#x27;re both using it, and the visiting nurses couldn&#x27;t say enough good about it.  </li>
            <li>Without keeping those fluids moving through the wound at a steady rate, healing slows, fluids leak, causing more irritation and skin damage, and</li>
            <li>Luckily, this has helped quite a bit.</li>
            <li>, before you get all \\&quot;that&#x27;s impossible\\&quot;, I am a large woman, so there was lots of flesh available in and around the tumor he had to incise, as well as the size of the tumor itself.  </li>
            <li>It is greasy at first but is absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;And, before you get all \\&quot;Call the lawyers,\\&quot; it is my firm, unshakable belief that NO surgeon would have had success getting a wound that size, located where it opens into my body, to close successfully all by itself.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m writing this from the perspective of someone with bowel movement issues and will keep it as medically clean as possible, but if you get squirmy about bodily functions, then you might want to find a review more suitable for your need.</li>
            <li>and I have been fortunate in that I really don&#x27;t need to do that business very often at night</li>
            <li>, on the other hand, you want to understand why I needed this product to work as advertised and why I was so very, very pleased and grateful</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s when the Cavilon really made a significant difference in keeping my skin healthy and able to bear the repeated removal and reapplication of various kinds of medical tape.  </li>
            <li>Keeping skin as healthy as possible was the job the Cavilon did for me.  </li>
            <li>and yes, I would reccomend to others if aware they have a reason to use it.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products to help my mom with the bed sores she has been prone to in the last year.  </li>
            <li>The wound vacuum did that job most of the way.  </li>
            <li>first, I put it on tissue and wiped with it when I felt I was clean enough.</li>
            <li>My mother is 92, and Cavilon helps to keep her back skin smooth, with no rashes, although she spends her whole days seated, suffering from severe arthrosis in both knees.</li>
            <li>In my case, the short, cut-to-the-chase review is that the Cavilon cream acted as a real and effective barrier, protecting my skin from damage done to it by repeated application and removal of medical adhesive tape.  </li>
            <li>If this is really all you want to know, stop here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the exception of the very end of each side of the wound, which had already begun to heal, the rest of the incision just opened up as he removed the rest of the staples.  </li>
            <li>The whole time, both under tape and on my skin, Cavilon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In thirteen weeks, the incision was reduced in size by 90%.  </li>
            <li>It really has helped.</li>
            <li>so it has time to really absorb into the skin like it is meant to.</li>
            <li>It does such a fabulous job.  </li>
            <li>The effective use of the vacuum reduced the vast majority of healing time to 13 WEEKS.  </li>
            <li>Cavilon saved my skin from the ravages of tape application and removal and made possible a good, tight seal for the vac.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>(The cream and a diet high in fiber and water.)</li>
            <li>A little more than THREE MONTHS.  </li>
            <li>The area is clean and dry</li>
            <li>/&gt;Essential to the success of a wound vacuum is the quality of the seal created over and around the wound.  </li>
            <li>It is the seal that makes possible keeping negative pressure in the vac moving fluids into the wound, then tbrough the special sponge packed inside the wound, through the tubing on the top of the dressing, out and into a canister attached to the side of the vacuum.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It sits on top of the skin and is very slow to be absorbed.  </li>
            <li>The wound is packed - sometimes carefully stuffed - with a special, sterile sponge-like material, not unlike the packing used to protect electronic items in shipping.  </li>
            <li>Given to me in the hospital, I have used  it on my back as I had a full back fusion and it soothed my tender skin.</li>
            <li>By providing that barrier, it stoped itching, reduced inflamation and made it possible for an amazing piece of medical technology to work as long as possible for me.  </li>
            <li>As you rub it in and around the area you want to protect, it becomes clear and shiny, so you still see it&#x27;s there.  </li>
            <li>I also put some in to about the depth of my finger nail to get to the really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It certainly does its job of keeping the skin areas dry.</li>
            <li>Skin breakdown would have slowed the whole process down, as any sores or tears in my skin anywhere the tape needed to be applied would have to be healed first, before the big wound in my body.  </li>
            <li>I had a large rectal fissure after the birth of my second child that took several months to heal.  </li>
            <li>the wound vacuum becomes less and less effective.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried desitin and pure aloe gel with no real result.</li>
            <li>When he was done, there was an exposed hole in my body that measured seven and a half inches from one side, straight across the front of my body to the other side, five inches from the top edge of the wound to the bottom edge, at the middle of the incision, and three and a half to four inches deep inside the whole length of the incision.  </li>
            <li>I am a 53 year old female who is 11 years post-menapausal.  </li>
            <li>After a little experimentation, I hit on the right way to use it for this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is now approximately: two inches side-to-side, an inch from the top edge to the bottom edge and three-quarters of an inch deep.  </li>
            <li>Other people with similar problems had rated it very high.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The tape began to cause problems for me after the first few weeks on the wound vac.  </li>
            <li>The location of the wound is making getting a good and productive seal on the wound very difficult.  </li>

            <li> Cavilon increased the effectiveness of the vacuum by keeping my skin from being damaged by the tape.  </li>
            <li> A wound vacuum is just what its name implies.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;pull\\&quot; fluids through the spongeand out into a canister, attached to the vacuum&#x27;s side.  </li>
            <li> There was temporary relief, but the problem would be there again with the very next toilet visit.</li>
            <li> Hence, the long, deep incision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> surgeon sent me to the local hospital&#x27;s Wound Care Center (WCC), where, on Friday, October 4, 2013, a wound vacuum* was applied to my wound and the healing began.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was long, wide and had grown deep into my body.  </li>
            <li> A week later, I popped the center staple of a very long incision.  </li>
            <li> I am still putting it on once daily after 2 weeks, but am consideringgoing to every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A YEAR AND A HALF to a possible TWO YEARS to heal.  </li>
            <li> My skin got red and inflamed under the tape, it blistered and sometimes tore a little when the tape was removed, and both under and around the taped areas, my skin would get itchy-like-you-would-not-believe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> only  need a little dab</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> NOTE TO THE READER: Any review of this cream will, of necessity, include more information about the problem it is helping to solve than it will information about the cream.  In my case, the short, cut-to-the-chase review is that the Cavilon cream acted as a real and effective barrier, protecting my skin from damage done to it by repeated application and removal of medical adhesive tape.  By providing that barrier, it stoped itching, reduced inflamation and made it possible for an amazing piece of medical technology to work as long as possible for me.  That&#x27;s the short of it.  If this is really all you want to know, stop here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If, on the other hand, you want to understand why I needed this product to work as advertised and why I was so very, very pleased and grateful when it did, get something warm to drink, curl up in your favorite chair and settle in.  While not a novel, reading this will take a bit of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a five pound tumor removed from my lower abdomen last September 13 (just happened to be a Friday...of course).  A week later, I popped the center staple of a very long incision.  When the surgeon took a good look at the popped area, he made the decision to remove the rest of the staples holding the incision together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the exception of the very end of each side of the wound, which had already begun to heal, the rest of the incision just opened up as he removed the rest of the staples.  When he was done, there was an exposed hole in my body that measured seven and a half inches from one side, straight across the front of my body to the other side, five inches from the top edge of the wound to the bottom edge, at the middle of the incision, and three and a half to four inches deep inside the whole length of the incision.  Huge.  Gaping.  Crater.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, before you get all \\&quot;that&#x27;s impossible\\&quot;, I am a large woman, so there was lots of flesh available in and around the tumor he had to incise, as well as the size of the tumor itself.  It was long, wide and had grown deep into my body.  The surgeon faced the challenge of getting it ALL out.  Hence, the long, deep incision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, before you get all \\&quot;Call the lawyers,\\&quot; it is my firm, unshakable belief that NO surgeon would have had success getting a wound that size, located where it opens into my body, to close successfully all by itself.  THE SURGEON DID NOTHING WRONG and I have NO INTENTION of suing him.  Just so we don&#x27;t get all distracted by things that matter least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The surgeon sent me to the local hospital&#x27;s Wound Care Center (WCC), where, on Friday, October 4, 2013, a wound vacuum* was applied to my wound and the healing began.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Essential to the success of a wound vacuum is the quality of the seal created over and around the wound.  It is the seal that makes possible keeping negative pressure in the vac moving fluids into the wound, then tbrough the special sponge packed inside the wound, through the tubing on the top of the dressing, out and into a canister attached to the side of the vacuum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tape began to cause problems for me after the first few weeks on the wound vac.  My skin got red and inflamed under the tape, it blistered and sometimes tore a little when the tape was removed, and both under and around the taped areas, my skin would get itchy-like-you-would-not-believe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is when the Cavilon became essential - ESSENTIAL- to the health of my skin.  And the health of my skin, and its non-reactive acceptance of the continued removal and reapplication of medical tape was critical to the healing process.  Without a good seal around the wound, the vac couldn&#x27;t draw well through the wound.  Without keeping those fluids moving through the wound at a steady rate, healing slows, fluids leak, causing more irritation and skin damage, and the wound vacuum becomes less and less effective.  Cavilon saved my skin from the ravages of tape application and removal and made possible a good, tight seal for the vac.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without the wound vacuum, Mother Nature has to close a wound that&#x27;s failed to knit while stitched or stapled together.  A wound the size mine was at the start could take between 18 and 24 months to close.  A YEAR AND A HALF to a possible TWO YEARS to heal.  Cavilon increased the effectiveness of the vacuum by keeping my skin from being damaged by the tape.  The effective use of the vacuum reduced the vast majority of healing time to 13 WEEKS.  A little more than THREE MONTHS.  Versus most of two years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now,just to be sure you really understand.  Cavilon did not heal my wound.  The wound vacuum did that job most of the way.  Cavilon put a barrier between leaking fluids (during an occasional blowout on the side or bottom of the bandage), and adhesive tape on my skin.  Both protections, provided by the Cavilon, facilitated the healing of my wound and health of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cavilon Durable Barrier Cream 3355 was suggested to us by the plastic surgeon who monitored my progress and provided treatments every few weeks.  The WCC didn&#x27;t keep a supply of the cream on hand, so we found it, of course, on Amazon.  Once we received it, it was applied to my skin BEFORE any tape was used, every time a bandage change was made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes out of the tube white and very thick.  As you rub it in and around the area you want to protect, it becomes clear and shiny, so you still see it&#x27;s there.  It sits on top of the skin and is very slow to be absorbed.  Applying tape to skin treated with Cavilon is no problem; tape sticks like the cream isn&#x27;t even there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, the difference Cavilon makes is that it provides a barrier between the adhesive on the tape and your skin.  When we applied the Cavilon to my skin, both at home and at the WCC, before any tape was applied, I found the cream lasted as an effective barrier between 30-36 hours.  After that, my skin would begin to react to the adhesive and itch.I found that applying more cream to exposed skin around the edges of the tape helped calm the itching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, it took between two and three weeks of having the tape removed and reapplied every other day before my skin started to react - blister, inflame and itch.  That&#x27;s when the Cavilon really made a significant difference in keeping my skin healthy and able to bear the repeated removal and reapplication of various kinds of medical tape.  Being able to get a good seal with the tape, which was applied over and around the bandaging, to the outside edges of my wound was what made the vac so effective.  Skin breakdown would have slowed the whole process down, as any sores or tears in my skin anywhere the tape needed to be applied would have to be healed first, before the big wound in my body.  Keeping skin as healthy as possible was the job the Cavilon did for me.  I&#x27;m not saying there weren&#x27;t problems, but as the wound got smaller, we could rest some areas while moving to tape pther areas.  The whole time, both under tape and on my skin, Cavilon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In thirteen weeks, the incision was reduced in size by 90%.  It is now approximately: two inches side-to-side, an inch from the top edge to the bottom edge and three-quarters of an inch deep.  I was put on a wound vac \\&quot;vacation\\&quot; until what&#x27;s left of my wound can be evaluated by the plastic surgeon in about two weeks.  The location of the wound is making getting a good and productive seal on the wound very difficult.  But that&#x27;s more about the vac and my anatomy than it is about the Cavilon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the coming weeks, as nature takes over from technology, there will still be tape being applied to my increasingly crancky skin.  Cavilon will make the difference between healthy skin, able to continue to receive tape, and itchy, inflammed and reactive skin.  It has proven to be a true barrier between my skin and the tape, which holds the bandage in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cavilon is, in my experience, a reallyeffective barrier cream.  It keeps body fluids (blood, plasma, urine, bowel, nasal secreations, etc.) from irritating and breaking down skin.  I&#x27;m going to use it on my nose to keep sneezing and wiping it during colds and allergy season from giving me the Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer look.  It might help protect a baby&#x27;s bottom from diaper rash, especially applied during every diaper change.  I gave it to my daughters, both of whom have occasional bouts of eczema.  I hope that Cavilon will help the healing by acting like a big bandage, a clearn cover between the excema and the rest of the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* A wound vacuum is just what its name implies.  The wound is packed - sometimes carefully stuffed - with a special, sterile sponge-like material, not unlike the packing used to protect electronic items in shipping.  A special tape is applied over the packed wound, out onto the edges of the skin, creating a seal so the vacuum could actually \\&quot;pull\\&quot; fluids through the spongeand out into a canister, attached to the vacuum&#x27;s side.  Like a carpet vacuum, while it is on, negative pressure is applied to the wound area, which keeps fluids moving through the wound.  This keeps anything from festering, turning rancid, or creating an environment ripe for infection to set in and encourages healing.  In my humble opinion, it is a brilliant piece of technology which, in my case, worked a miracle on my body.  It, and the excellent attention to hand care and cleanliness on the part of all the staff AND my husband, (who had the job of unpacking and bandaging the wound when more than three days passed between appojntments at the WCC), kept the incision infection-free to the date I&#x27;m writing this review. 1/9/2013</li>
            <li> only  need a little dab</li>
            <li> This product does the job and yes, I would reccomend to others if aware they have a reason to use it.</li>
            <li> Given to me in the hospital, I have used  it on my back as I had a full back fusion and it soothed my tender skin.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mother. It really has helped.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing this from the perspective of someone with bowel movement issues and will keep it as medically clean as possible, but if you get squirmy about bodily functions, then you might want to find a review more suitable for your need. I hope this helps others with similar problems. I am post surgery for colorectal cancer and ostomy reversal. As anyone with IBS or post colon surgery knows, your exit area can become quite irritated with frequent wiping, kind of our own special &amp;#34;diaper rash&amp;#34;. Irritation to the point you have blood on your tissue, from hemorrhoids or not, is no picnic. Mine is non-hemorrhoidal, just bad skin irritation from constant wiping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried desitin and pure aloe gel with no real result. There was temporary relief, but the problem would be there again with the very next toilet visit. Then I found Cavilon. It was the solution I was looking for. After a little experimentation, I hit on the right way to use it for this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, I put it on tissue and wiped with it when I felt I was clean enough. Needless to say, there was discomfort with this method and I also realized that I wasn&#x27;t really getting a thorough application because of what had preceded it and that using a tissue to apply it was not really the best way to get to all of the irritated skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found that applying it in the evening before going to bed after showering and drying the area has worked the best. The area is clean and dry and I have been fortunate in that I really don&#x27;t need to do that business very often at night so it has time to really absorb into the skin like it is meant to. I put on a nitrile (non-latex) glove, put some on a finger and spread it around. I also put some in to about the depth of my finger nail to get to the really sensitive skin. I started getting immediate results after 2-3 days. There is no more irritation or discomfort down there. I am still putting it on once daily after 2 weeks, but am consideringgoing to every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note, I also started taking one 500mg (.52g) psyllium capsule in the morning and before bed to help firm up the stool and decrease the toilet visits and number of wipes. Luckily, this has helped quite a bit. I chose psyllium husk over loperamide (immodium), since it is natural and loperamide is a synthetic opioid that can have bad side effects with excessive or long term use.</li>
            <li> Very hard to make tape adhere to skin after using product, no matter how little I used.</li>
            <li> My mother is 92, and Cavilon helps to keep her back skin smooth, with no rashes, although she spends her whole days seated, suffering from severe arthrosis in both knees.</li>
            <li> We ordered this for my disabled Grandmother.  It works great. Always prevents my grandmother from acquiring pressure wounds.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products to help my mom with the bed sores she has been prone to in the last year.  This is the absolute best out there and has actually cleared up sores that nothing else seems to heal.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Third time buying it. perfect ! Very good for my feet  and hands. Recommend it. You should try it too!</li>
            <li> works great for rash of skin after weight loss surgery,,  and the 3m cavilon no sting spray used in conjunction,, lasts 40 hours no itching or welpts form rash..</li>
            <li> To Anyone Who Has an Anal Fissure -&lt;br /&gt;This cream can be your best friend.  I am a 53 year old female who is 11 years post-menapausal.  I had a large rectal fissure after the birth of my second child that took several months to heal.  It has been 21 years since that time, and occasional I felt, from time to time, the fissure would reopen.  Just recently, I had a horrible bout of constipation that left me with a Grade 1 rectocele and the tear that had reopened.  I literally was petrified to have a bowel movement.  I tried all sorts of creams, petroleum jelly, gels, even Destitin ointment and still had no relief.  I scowered the internet for a product that would help, and came across this Cavilon Double Barrier Cream.  Other people with similar problems had rated it very high.  Although I could only order it from Amazon (called everywhere locally including pharmacies, hospitals, hospital and medical supply companies - even 3M and could not get it) and there is no express shipping, once I received it and used it, it was a miracle.  Just a small dab of it placed on the tear two to three times a day (also before and after a bowel movement) healed my fissure.  (The cream and a diet high in fiber and water.) When I went to see the colorectal surgeon, he could still see that I had had a fissure, but was impressed with how nicely it had healed.  He asked what I used and I showed him the cream.  He was very impressed, stating that he and other doctors like him have been trying to identify a doucle barrier cream that could help their patients.  He stated he was going to order some for his office and try it out.</li>
            <li> This creme is used by hospitals as a hand moisture.  It does such a fabulous job.  It creams the hand without the greasy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;I tried to find this creme in store and of course, I couldn&#x27;t find it.  But as usual, I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Works good for my husband that works in a machine shop and with coolant</li>
            <li> This has been a god send for my aging parents. I bought it for one, and they&#x27;re both using it, and the visiting nurses couldn&#x27;t say enough good about it.  Will be buying more. It just works.</li>
            <li> Easy to use this cream but I apply with a washcloth. It is greasy at first but is absorbed quickly. It certainly does its job of keeping the skin areas dry. It has an odor but it&#x27;s a clean smell and its not offensive. The only problem I have experienced is cleaning the washcloths as you need to use bleach and soap so white washcloths are best.</li>
