            <li>and I&#x27;m good to go!  </li>
            <li>but nothing beats a good pinch with your fingers - although this may not be the best for your skin.</li>

            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>: ) I know how to use it, it&#x27;s perfect for blackhead and doesn&#x27;t leave any mark in your skin!</li>
            <li>It gets the job done really good</li>
            <li>Good product for what it does.</li>
            <li>Good quality.</li>
            <li>It also feels good in the hand, not like some cheaper products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>The quality of these is good too but not a fan of the design.  </li>
            <li>Good quality as described.</li>
            <li>It works wonderfully and quickly.</li>
            <li>Pretty awesome.</li>
            <li>This tool is pretty ineffective at removing blackheads, but it does a great job leaving circular marks on my face!</li>
            <li>My wife is happy with how easy it is to use</li>
            <li>These things are a pain in the butt however if you know how to use them they are amazing.  </li>
            <li>and my face is all sweaty, greasy and warm or not (as others have suggested)</li>
            <li>I would honestly say this thing is for those people who pick at or pop there blackheads</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall it is a really nice tool for the cost.</li>
            <li>It does not work so good on the more mushy parts of the face.  </li>
            <li>I honestly can&#x27;t imagine why they would say what they did.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Seki &amp; Amazon for another Great Product!!!</li>
            <li>Does not work effectively.</li>
            <li>Nice product and affordable.</li>
            <li>Those would have been nice since I haven&#x27;t used a tool like this since the 7th grade.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve ended up doing more harm to my skin than good.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a loop remover for a decade with no problems, but I thought this would be a superior product because of the design (having cups instead of loops) and because it was prominently displayed at the health food store where I bought it.</li>
            <li>This is good quality because it doesn&#x27;t flex, the metal is strong.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t damage your skin and it gets your blackheads out very easily.</li>
            <li>No pain and very easy to do.  </li>
            <li>so I liked hers better.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money if it keeps the teenager happy.</li>
            <li>I find this style to be more effective than the type with the loop on the end.</li>
            <li>I was hoping this would be more effective than it turned out to be.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve had this incredible tool for over a year now, and wouldn&#x27;t want to live without it!  </li>
            <li>exactly what I wanted and worked great.</li>
            <li>no skill or practiced needed, worked great on first try.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>Greatest most gross invention ever!</li>
            <li>Much better than the others that are out on the market.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>This Seki Edge Blackhead Remover works better than anything else I have tried.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I will keep it for legitimate pimples, though, it should work better for that than a loop extractor.</li>
            <li>I have blackheads on my nose like many people do.  </li>
            <li>but i freakin love this tool...</li>
            <li>and so I was glad to find this one to replace it.</li>
            <li>This pimple squeezer is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>Works ok.</li>
            <li>Have messed around with this tool a bit and my fingernails work better.</li>
            <li>This works much better than the revlon.</li>
            <li>However, Revlon had one that was softer on the edges, and worked better.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t squeeze all the blackheads but most of it.</li>
            <li>and I feel this one works better, loops leave marks and scars on the face.</li>
            <li>I had one of these decades ago and am pleased to have one again.</li>
            <li>I think this tool is perfect for blackheads that appear in hard-to-reach places, such as around the creases of the nose.  </li>
            <li>I love this tool and can&#x27;t say enough about how great it is!  </li>
            <li>not even great--just an ok product.  </li>
            <li>I am still searching the market for a better tool after purchasing this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I have it in my draw of tricks though.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay..</li>
            <li>what more is there to say.</li>
            <li>So glad I found this product by Seki...</li>
            <li>I could do a better job with my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with the quality of the product ..</li>
            <li>I wanted an instrument with more metal built up around the openings to help get the &#x27;stuff&#x27; out..........</li>
            <li>Its just ok.</li>
            <li>I get more luck putting the blackhead between two of my nails.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be better.....</li>
            <li>that I think it hurts more than it helps.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have so many blackheads to remove</li>
            <li>Just make sure to sanitize it before and after each use.</li>
            <li>I am about to purchase more of these just in case this becomes discontinued.  </li>
            <li>It works but it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>Works well and am satisfied</li>
            <li>I love the quality of this product.</li>
            <li>My face feels more cleaner and never gets infections now.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay ,I use to bring it with me for on the road type of trips in the bath bag.</li>
            <li>The craftsmanship of this product is much better than the Revlon.</li>
            <li>Again, this is very rare!  </li>
            <li>For older, deeper ones, it is not so great.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is too large as other reviewers says, it feels perfect on the hand and works great.</li>
            <li>Smooth, well-made, better than most of what&#x27;s on the market.  </li>
            <li>This is more sanitary and pain free.  </li>
            <li>Just be careful, and sometimes getting a partner to help works best.</li>
            <li>I took chance with this one and serves me just right !!</li>
            <li>This though helps with facials, but you need to steam or do it right after warm steamy shower to not injure the skin and then use  witchhazel or a antiseptic.</li>
            <li>We tried other products but this is the best one.</li>
            <li>and I recieved it very quickly.  </li>
            <li>I like this products everything  so easy to use</li>
            <li>It works great on those pimples that you know you need to pop but can&#x27;t get quite enough pressure on it--I know, gross--but you know what I&#x27;m talking about :)  </li>
            <li>Its easy and painless.</li>
            <li>Easy to handle.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t get it to even deal with a pimple that was easy to pop.</li>
            <li>It was easy and convenient, and self-efficient as I didn&#x27;t need help to do it before.  </li>
            <li>It lifts whiteheads and blackheads easily and helps blemishes heal faster.</li>
            <li>, You will figure out how to use it easily.</li>
            <li>This is easy to use, seems well made.</li>
            <li>strong steel and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>It works fine</li>
            <li>OMG this is the best thing there is to remove your black heads.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen similar tools at places like Sephora for a lot more money, and probably not as effective!  </li>
            <li>But in the end, it worked just fine.</li>
            <li>This is a nice beauty tool to have and it&#x27;s pretty cheap.</li>
            <li>We have one like it that works just fine.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and light weight.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved using this kind of product, but lost the one I had for a long time.  </li>
            <li>Easy to,use, easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I think this would work best for very soft, young skin with surface blackheads.</li>
            <li>This product is not bad I have used other but this on I found  works best.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;ve ended up doing more harm to my face than good, as when you press in it often leaves a red ring around the area you are treating.  </li>
            <li>This tool is perfect and makes it so easy to get to those blackheads without having to pinch your face to get to the small blackheads.</li>
            <li>I just used it until I got it right, and then it worked okay.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very important to use after showering or cleaning the face with hot water or steam.</li>
            <li>this tool really worked and was very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>However before taking it this was a neat and useful tool!</li>
            <li>The hurt is worth the result!</li>
            <li>Just make sure to steam your face for like 3 or 4 min or put a hot towel over your face before you start because it will make it easier</li>
            <li>Work ok in the places on my face where you can apply good solid pressure, blackheads pop right out.  </li>
            <li>love having this in the drawer  comes in handy when you start to feel something building up under the skin and dont want it to grow bigger  </li>
            <li>To clean I dab it in benzoyl peroxide, then run it through the dishwasher for one cycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(I clean it with alcohol in-between uses.)</li>
            <li>Like another reviewer aptly put it, it is way way better than the regular loop style remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wanted a regular, old fashioned blackhead remover and this one works perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Works as advertised, nothing special though.</li>
            <li>Love it, been looking for something like this,it really works well.</li>
            <li>Thanks, I am glad I bought 2 of them, for home and travel.</li>
            <li>He really likes this product and says his skin is better because of it.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to cleanse the area on the skin, and the tool very well after each use.  </li>
            <li>Many years ago, when I was still in school, a friend had a similar tool but it worked so much better than this one.</li>
            <li>One opening, the smaller one, is perfect for most black heads.</li>
            <li>I had a smaller version of this that I picked up at the cosmetics area of a local department store, I thought it was the best tool ever.</li>
            <li>The smaller side works well for surface blemishes while the bigger side is perfect for the deeper ones.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>This Blackhead Remover is just another great product from Seki-Edge, and the remover is very well-made from the same type of steel, that the Samurai Swords were made out of....</li>
            <li>Actually, the best I&#x27;ve found in recent years.</li>
            <li>Holes are too large and it really does not do the job very easily</li>
            <li>it does what it says, but I&#x27;ve use other tools that I&#x27;ve liked better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit large but that makes it easy to hold.</li>
            <li>Not quite the same as my old original revlon tool (which I have been trying to find) but by far the best replacement option I have found.</li>
            <li>It works amazingly well, with two sizes to use, depending on your specific needs.  </li>
            <li>Not as good as I expected.</li>
            <li>Nice solid blackhead remover.</li>
            <li>the edges of the holes were rolled more on the old model.</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>but it was well worth the money to have one that acually got the blackheads out.</li>
            <li>This thing appears to be useful and reading the majority of the reviews it indicates it gets the job done</li>
            <li>I still have it, just in case, but rarely use it.</li>
            <li>Very good but like others have said the large hole is a little too large.</li>
            <li>and it still didn&#x27;t work right.</li>
            <li>While this one is bigger than what I had, it works just fine and doesn&#x27;t get lost as easily.</li>
            <li>This is a great blackhead remover, it&#x27;s a lot like an old Revlon model I had a long time ago that they quit making.</li>
            <li>It is a small tool that fits right in my make-up case if needed; great for travel.</li>
            <li>It works 99% of the time, though there is the very rare moment that it might not work on a particular blackhead or pimple.  </li>
            <li>You must have to have large blackheads...and for us, they are using it on pimples!</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>It works exactly like they said it would&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just recently started trying to take better care of my skin and was recommended one of these by a friend</li>
            <li>Really works!</li>
            <li>this is the first one i have ever bought.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping though!</li>
            <li>, i would recommend it to anybody who is interested in getting one of these.</li>
            <li>everything will come out on the first attempt.</li>
            <li>can work on white heads, but it will hurt more.</li>
            <li>not like the old revlon remover i have, which has smoothly rounded holes.  </li>
            <li>My husband loves it, and now my Mom wants one too!  </li>
            <li>The problem is that my nose has so many pores that it would literally take hours to unclog every last one.  </li>
            <li>Such magical results without pre-steaming or pre-scrubbing the face.</li>
            <li>A very well made and useful tool to have around</li>
            <li>Anyways its in the trash now, and I am back to searching for a better way to remove blackheads.</li>
            <li>I am still glad I bought it though to have it in the future.</li>
            <li>First of all, it doesn&#x27;t come with directions.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of the Seki nail clippers and the quality is top notch.  </li>
            <li>Luckily, past the point where I need this thing day to day, but it&#x27;s still the best way to get those gross blackheads out of your bod.</li>
            <li>It is better than the models with one side open.</li>
            <li>It gets rid of all the stubborn blackheads on the nose effectively with minimal effort and without hurting (YAY!).</li>
            <li>I appreciate keeping my skin clean and clear.  </li>
            <li>The smaller one was good at taking care of surface problems but ineffectual for the deeper ones that occasionally plagued my husband.</li>
            <li>but I certainly dont.</li>
            <li>Opening way to large to do anything substantial.  </li>
            <li>Never used the large end.</li>
            <li>It works well on large pimples, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li>have a little dish with alcohol to help keep it sanitary, most likely one wants to keep it clean as it is filled with bacteria from your skin.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you gently open the top with a needle before using the tool and pushing down.</li>
            <li>You have to press so hard to get to the blackheads that you might injure the surrounding good tissue.  </li>
            <li>Boy, you really haven&#x27;t lived until you have looked in a mirror and realized how huge your pores are and all the gross stuff that is contained</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t really like it.</li>
            <li>After 4 or 5 uses I have to say it really works well.</li>
            <li>These work very well.</li>
            <li>You really should be cleaning them and not popping them.  </li>
            <li>and it worked very well</li>
            <li>too much preparation just to do its job</li>
            <li>it really does not work.</li>
            <li>Look which direction the pore goes (you can see the discoloration through the skin) and push so it can work straight out of the pore even if it is at an angle.</li>
            <li>I tried the Sklar Schamberg extra-fine comedone extractor (one my sister has), and it worked very well.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really like this product</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used it for blackheads on my forehead and my nose and worked very well.</li>
            <li>Very sturdy, i like the fact that is has two hole sizes.  </li>
            <li>This tool doesn&#x27;t really work at all.</li>
            <li>work very well for acne</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>Also not made very well,</li>
            <li>I never have to touch my face with my hands or nails ever thanks to this.</li>
            <li>highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Really doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Its made of good thick metal and is sturdy.  </li>
            <li>I will write an update when I know more, but my first impression is that the ones with a very fine head are probably best--also expensive.</li>
            <li>This time I thought I would spend more money in hopes of getting a good product; well, this product is also completely USELESS!</li>
            <li>But I just got it, so it might be helpful on certain lesions, in particular areas of the face.</li>
            <li>Seems simple enough except I remember vividly that the similar design I used in middle school worked perfectly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been unsuccessful with many other methods and devices to remove blackheads.</li>
            <li>.. wish they never discontinued the original one that they made back in the day</li>
            <li>For those who aren&#x27;t having luck with this device it really helps to exfoliate or use a facial scrub and/or steaming open the pores before using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to remove blackheads that I wasn&#x27;t able to remove by any other methods with this remover (biore skin strips, loop removers, manually by hand).  </li>
            <li>Interesting little tool, doesn&#x27;t really work very well.  </li>
            <li>It works a lot better than the typical loop blackhead removers and is much gentler on your skin too.</li>
            <li>first off this in my case required me to use a lot of pressure to actually clear my pores ended up with hurt nose.</li>
            <li>For the first time in 20 years, blackheads all over my nose isn&#x27;t the first and only thing I see in the mirror.  </li>
            <li>In fact, my only dissatisfaction with this item is that I didn&#x27;t have it as a teen when the blemishes were many</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t seen this product since I was in High School.</li>
            <li>Works as I tended and much better for your skin than squeezing the little devils.</li>
            <li>Holes are reasonably sized and smoothly punched so it isn&#x27;t likely to damage your skin if used properly.</li>
            <li>very helpful for disabled person great for some one that is limited in the amount of motion for help with personal grooming.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too big to handle, just right.</li>
            <li>Nice piece of equipment for blackhead removal;  only the hole seemed to be either too small or too large.  </li>
            <li>I would advise new users to find a video before using or purchasing.</li>
            <li>No need for squeezing blackheads that cause excess redness or swelling of your skin or a new pimple.</li>
            <li>i couldnt live without it.</li>
            <li>I just wish the edges were more defined so it could really extract those hard to get blackheads</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic for those zits in those hard to reach places like right in the ridge of your nose.</li>
            <li>It usually works better on taunt skin (so trying it on my cheeks didn&#x27;t work too well).  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Also, this is easier to do after a hot shower, to open the pores.</li>
            <li>i had some that were pretty deep that would have never gotten out using just my fingers.  </li>
            <li>Stick to the old fashion way and use two fingers!</li>
            <li>Every now and then a huge black head does come out.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to keep touching my face, so I bought this tool to help extract some white and black heads from the areas.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works great, but the edges are a bit sharper than my previous one from the 50&#x27;s that suddenly went missing.  </li>
            <li>The larger hole is nice for me because it helps me get rid of problematic black heads or even white heads if I have to.</li>
            <li>I would recommend that if you are at a pre-drinking age and have good health insurance to take Accutane as it may be difficult to go 5 months without alcohol as an adult!  </li>
            <li>and I actually might have found a use for the large gauge end.</li>
            <li>The holes in the cups are too large, so you can&#x27;t get enough pressure around the pore.</li>
            <li>this is a very simple device but it works well and is very high quality.</li>
            <li>Do not buy if you have even remotely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Our old tool like this broke years ago</li>
            <li>i wasn&#x27;t trying to be rude about it, but truthful.</li>
            <li>For those who don&#x27;t know how, place it directly over the blackhead so that is shows through the opening</li>
            <li>I purchased for my 15 year old.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work so well in places that are too soft, like cheeks...</li>
            <li>Once that occurs, I simply placed one of the holes over the blackhead and pressed gently.  </li>
            <li>My parents had one when I was young.</li>
            <li>And wow it works like a charm.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t encountered any problems or &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; blemishes that this couldn&#x27;t handle thus far.</li>
            <li>I recommended it.the only problem is the size of whole</li>
            <li>Searched and searched for this tool to replace one that was 36 years old.  </li>
            <li>It works very well on my nose, forehead, shoulders, and back.</li>
            <li>I have had minimal success with the Seki Edge Blackhead Remover.</li>
            <li>You do need a powerful magnifying mirror with illumination to really center the product correctly.  </li>
            <li>The other one, larger, is a bit larger than i would like, but it&#x27;s ok overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I usually use the Revlon version, but the Seki is wider and easy to use.</li>
            <li>The concept of this tool is nice, but once you attempt to put one end of it over a black head, you lose site of the black head.  </li>
            <li>The quality is good but it does not remove blackheads unless you push down hard on the skin.</li>
            <li>Bigger than older styles, easier to handle.</li>
            <li>only gripe I have with it is that most of the time the large hole is TOO large and the small hole is TOO small.</li>
            <li>I had a hard time getting anything out of the blackheads even though I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m using this properly.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had acne in years, but the stress of graduating college, moving, planning a wedding, remodeling a house, etc. caused a major, major outbreak.</li>
            <li>Just apply pressure on the black head using the device, the blackhead comes right out through the hole of the product.  </li>
            <li>I like it so far, and I would prefer this device over the traditional two finger squeeze.</li>
            <li>out a pore it barely gets anything.  </li>
            <li>The domed side goes toward your face with the hole over the top of the poor.  </li>
            <li>I tried it on a few acne lesions without any success.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s pretty big and certainly not travel size.</li>
            <li>My only complaint (and it&#x27;s a nice complaint to have, haha)</li>
            <li>The hardly ever come out clean on me.  </li>
            <li>My young teen kids are constantly picking their face.</li>
            <li>I have always been very particular about black head extractor ..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sturdy, made with quality metal, and after a few weeks of use and rinsing under hot water shows no signs of wear or rusting, etc.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>The holes in this are too small to be useful.</li>
            <li>and I had to drill out small end to make it useful.</li>
            <li>I know it works, I haven&#x27;t used it yet but has 2 different sized holes which are easy to put over the black or whitehead to remove w/a little pressure.</li>
            <li>Worth investing little more money than other poor qualities.&lt;br /&gt;Both</li>
            <li>perhaps my expectations were too high, but there&#x27;s a lot of pressing and nothing going on other than making indentations into the skin.  </li>
            <li>Bought this to help with those really stuck in there black heads.</li>
            <li>Works well for removing black heads &amp; gets the whole thing out...</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really work at all for black heads or clogged pores.</li>
            <li>It works very well for blackhead removal and popping a zit from time to time, however it can slightly bruise the area.</li>
            <li>With the Seki model, it&#x27;s often hard to tell when you&#x27;ve had success removing a blackhead.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes you have to press really hard and is more suited for back trouble</li>

            <li> and I&#x27;m good to go!  </li>

            <li> Item was as described and works great.</li>
            <li> Great product.  </li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> : ) I know how to use it, it&#x27;s perfect for blackhead and doesn&#x27;t leave any mark in your skin!</li>
            <li> It gets the job done really good</li>
            <li> Good product for what it does.</li>
            <li> Good quality.</li>
            <li> It also feels good in the hand, not like some cheaper products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> The quality of these is good too but not a fan of the design.  </li>
            <li> Good quality as described.</li>
            <li> It works wonderfully and quickly.</li>
            <li> Pretty awesome.</li>
            <li> This tool is pretty ineffective at removing blackheads, but it does a great job leaving circular marks on my face!</li>
            <li> My wife is happy with how easy it is to use</li>
            <li> These things are a pain in the butt however if you know how to use them they are amazing.  </li>
            <li> and my face is all sweaty, greasy and warm or not (as others have suggested)</li>
            <li> I would honestly say this thing is for those people who pick at or pop there blackheads</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall it is a really nice tool for the cost.</li>
            <li> It does not work so good on the more mushy parts of the face.  </li>
            <li> I honestly can&#x27;t imagine why they would say what they did.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Seki &amp; Amazon for another Great Product!!!</li>
            <li> Does not work effectively.</li>
            <li> Nice product and affordable.</li>
            <li> Those would have been nice since I haven&#x27;t used a tool like this since the 7th grade.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve ended up doing more harm to my skin than good.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a loop remover for a decade with no problems, but I thought this would be a superior product because of the design (having cups instead of loops) and because it was prominently displayed at the health food store where I bought it.</li>
            <li> This is good quality because it doesn&#x27;t flex, the metal is strong.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t damage your skin and it gets your blackheads out very easily.</li>
            <li> No pain and very easy to do.  </li>
            <li> so I liked hers better.  </li>
            <li> Worth the money if it keeps the teenager happy.</li>
            <li> I find this style to be more effective than the type with the loop on the end.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would be more effective than it turned out to be.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had this incredible tool for over a year now, and wouldn&#x27;t want to live without it!  </li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted and worked great.</li>
            <li> no skill or practiced needed, worked great on first try.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> Greatest most gross invention ever!</li>
            <li> Much better than the others that are out on the market.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li> This Seki Edge Blackhead Remover works better than anything else I have tried.  </li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I will keep it for legitimate pimples, though, it should work better for that than a loop extractor.</li>
            <li> I have blackheads on my nose like many people do.  </li>
            <li> but i freakin love this tool...</li>
            <li> and so I was glad to find this one to replace it.</li>
            <li> This pimple squeezer is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> Works ok.</li>
            <li> Have messed around with this tool a bit and my fingernails work better.</li>
            <li> This works much better than the revlon.</li>
            <li> However, Revlon had one that was softer on the edges, and worked better.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t squeeze all the blackheads but most of it.</li>
            <li> and I feel this one works better, loops leave marks and scars on the face.</li>
            <li> I had one of these decades ago and am pleased to have one again.</li>
            <li> I think this tool is perfect for blackheads that appear in hard-to-reach places, such as around the creases of the nose.  </li>
            <li> I love this tool and can&#x27;t say enough about how great it is!  </li>
            <li> not even great--just an ok product.  </li>
            <li> I am still searching the market for a better tool after purchasing this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I have it in my draw of tricks though.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay..</li>
            <li> what more is there to say.</li>
            <li> So glad I found this product by Seki...</li>
            <li> I could do a better job with my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with the quality of the product ..</li>
            <li> I wanted an instrument with more metal built up around the openings to help get the &#x27;stuff&#x27; out..........</li>
            <li> Its just ok.</li>
            <li> I get more luck putting the blackhead between two of my nails.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be better.....</li>
            <li> that I think it hurts more than it helps.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have so many blackheads to remove</li>
            <li> Just make sure to sanitize it before and after each use.</li>
            <li> I am about to purchase more of these just in case this becomes discontinued.  </li>
            <li> It works but it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> Works well and am satisfied</li>
            <li> I love the quality of this product.</li>
            <li> My face feels more cleaner and never gets infections now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay ,I use to bring it with me for on the road type of trips in the bath bag.</li>
            <li> The craftsmanship of this product is much better than the Revlon.</li>
            <li> Again, this is very rare!  </li>
            <li> For older, deeper ones, it is not so great.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is too large as other reviewers says, it feels perfect on the hand and works great.</li>
            <li> Smooth, well-made, better than most of what&#x27;s on the market.  </li>
            <li> This is more sanitary and pain free.  </li>
            <li> Just be careful, and sometimes getting a partner to help works best.</li>
            <li> I took chance with this one and serves me just right !!</li>
            <li> This though helps with facials, but you need to steam or do it right after warm steamy shower to not injure the skin and then use  witchhazel or a antiseptic.</li>
            <li> We tried other products but this is the best one.</li>
            <li> and I recieved it very quickly.  </li>
            <li> I like this products everything  so easy to use</li>
            <li> It works great on those pimples that you know you need to pop but can&#x27;t get quite enough pressure on it--I know, gross--but you know what I&#x27;m talking about :)  </li>
            <li> Its easy and painless.</li>
            <li> Easy to handle.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get it to even deal with a pimple that was easy to pop.</li>
            <li> It was easy and convenient, and self-efficient as I didn&#x27;t need help to do it before.  </li>
            <li> It lifts whiteheads and blackheads easily and helps blemishes heal faster.</li>
            <li> , You will figure out how to use it easily.</li>
            <li> This is easy to use, seems well made.</li>
            <li> strong steel and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> It works fine</li>
            <li> OMG this is the best thing there is to remove your black heads.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen similar tools at places like Sephora for a lot more money, and probably not as effective!  </li>
            <li> But in the end, it worked just fine.</li>
            <li> This is a nice beauty tool to have and it&#x27;s pretty cheap.</li>
            <li> We have one like it that works just fine.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and light weight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved using this kind of product, but lost the one I had for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Easy to,use, easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I think this would work best for very soft, young skin with surface blackheads.</li>
            <li> This product is not bad I have used other but this on I found  works best.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve ended up doing more harm to my face than good, as when you press in it often leaves a red ring around the area you are treating.  </li>
            <li> This tool is perfect and makes it so easy to get to those blackheads without having to pinch your face to get to the small blackheads.</li>
            <li> I just used it until I got it right, and then it worked okay.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very important to use after showering or cleaning the face with hot water or steam.</li>
            <li> this tool really worked and was very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> However before taking it this was a neat and useful tool!</li>
            <li> The hurt is worth the result!</li>
            <li> Just make sure to steam your face for like 3 or 4 min or put a hot towel over your face before you start because it will make it easier</li>
            <li> Work ok in the places on my face where you can apply good solid pressure, blackheads pop right out.  </li>
            <li> love having this in the drawer  comes in handy when you start to feel something building up under the skin and dont want it to grow bigger  </li>
            <li> To clean I dab it in benzoyl peroxide, then run it through the dishwasher for one cycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I clean it with alcohol in-between uses.)</li>
            <li> Like another reviewer aptly put it, it is way way better than the regular loop style remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wanted a regular, old fashioned blackhead remover and this one works perfectly.  </li>
            <li> Works as advertised, nothing special though.</li>
            <li> Love it, been looking for something like this,it really works well.</li>
            <li> Thanks, I am glad I bought 2 of them, for home and travel.</li>
            <li> He really likes this product and says his skin is better because of it.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to cleanse the area on the skin, and the tool very well after each use.  </li>
            <li> Many years ago, when I was still in school, a friend had a similar tool but it worked so much better than this one.</li>
            <li> One opening, the smaller one, is perfect for most black heads.</li>
            <li> I had a smaller version of this that I picked up at the cosmetics area of a local department store, I thought it was the best tool ever.</li>
            <li> The smaller side works well for surface blemishes while the bigger side is perfect for the deeper ones.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> This Blackhead Remover is just another great product from Seki-Edge, and the remover is very well-made from the same type of steel, that the Samurai Swords were made out of....</li>
            <li> Actually, the best I&#x27;ve found in recent years.</li>
            <li> Holes are too large and it really does not do the job very easily</li>
            <li> it does what it says, but I&#x27;ve use other tools that I&#x27;ve liked better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit large but that makes it easy to hold.</li>
            <li> Not quite the same as my old original revlon tool (which I have been trying to find) but by far the best replacement option I have found.</li>
            <li> It works amazingly well, with two sizes to use, depending on your specific needs.  </li>
            <li> Not as good as I expected.</li>
            <li> Nice solid blackhead remover.</li>
            <li> the edges of the holes were rolled more on the old model.</li>
            <li> It is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> but it was well worth the money to have one that acually got the blackheads out.</li>
            <li> This thing appears to be useful and reading the majority of the reviews it indicates it gets the job done</li>
            <li> I still have it, just in case, but rarely use it.</li>
            <li> Very good but like others have said the large hole is a little too large.</li>
            <li> and it still didn&#x27;t work right.</li>
            <li> While this one is bigger than what I had, it works just fine and doesn&#x27;t get lost as easily.</li>
            <li> This is a great blackhead remover, it&#x27;s a lot like an old Revlon model I had a long time ago that they quit making.</li>
            <li> It is a small tool that fits right in my make-up case if needed; great for travel.</li>
            <li> It works 99% of the time, though there is the very rare moment that it might not work on a particular blackhead or pimple.  </li>
            <li> You must have to have large blackheads...and for us, they are using it on pimples!</li>
            <li> Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> It works exactly like they said it would&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just recently started trying to take better care of my skin and was recommended one of these by a friend</li>
            <li> Really works!</li>
            <li> this is the first one i have ever bought.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping though!</li>
            <li> , i would recommend it to anybody who is interested in getting one of these.</li>
            <li> everything will come out on the first attempt.</li>
            <li> can work on white heads, but it will hurt more.</li>
            <li> not like the old revlon remover i have, which has smoothly rounded holes.  </li>
            <li> My husband loves it, and now my Mom wants one too!  </li>
            <li> The problem is that my nose has so many pores that it would literally take hours to unclog every last one.  </li>
            <li> Such magical results without pre-steaming or pre-scrubbing the face.</li>
            <li> A very well made and useful tool to have around</li>
            <li> Anyways its in the trash now, and I am back to searching for a better way to remove blackheads.</li>
            <li> I am still glad I bought it though to have it in the future.</li>
            <li> First of all, it doesn&#x27;t come with directions.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of the Seki nail clippers and the quality is top notch.  </li>
            <li> Luckily, past the point where I need this thing day to day, but it&#x27;s still the best way to get those gross blackheads out of your bod.</li>
            <li> It is better than the models with one side open.</li>
            <li> It gets rid of all the stubborn blackheads on the nose effectively with minimal effort and without hurting (YAY!).</li>
            <li> I appreciate keeping my skin clean and clear.  </li>
            <li> The smaller one was good at taking care of surface problems but ineffectual for the deeper ones that occasionally plagued my husband.</li>
            <li> but I certainly dont.</li>
            <li> Opening way to large to do anything substantial.  </li>
            <li> Never used the large end.</li>
            <li> It works well on large pimples, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> have a little dish with alcohol to help keep it sanitary, most likely one wants to keep it clean as it is filled with bacteria from your skin.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you gently open the top with a needle before using the tool and pushing down.</li>
            <li> You have to press so hard to get to the blackheads that you might injure the surrounding good tissue.  </li>
            <li> Boy, you really haven&#x27;t lived until you have looked in a mirror and realized how huge your pores are and all the gross stuff that is contained</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t really like it.</li>
            <li> After 4 or 5 uses I have to say it really works well.</li>
            <li> These work very well.</li>
            <li> You really should be cleaning them and not popping them.  </li>
            <li> and it worked very well</li>
            <li> too much preparation just to do its job</li>
            <li> it really does not work.</li>
            <li> Look which direction the pore goes (you can see the discoloration through the skin) and push so it can work straight out of the pore even if it is at an angle.</li>
            <li> I tried the Sklar Schamberg extra-fine comedone extractor (one my sister has), and it worked very well.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really like this product</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it for blackheads on my forehead and my nose and worked very well.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy, i like the fact that is has two hole sizes.  </li>
            <li> This tool doesn&#x27;t really work at all.</li>
            <li> work very well for acne</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> Also not made very well,</li>
            <li> I never have to touch my face with my hands or nails ever thanks to this.</li>
            <li> highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Really doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Its made of good thick metal and is sturdy.  </li>
            <li> I will write an update when I know more, but my first impression is that the ones with a very fine head are probably best--also expensive.</li>
            <li> This time I thought I would spend more money in hopes of getting a good product; well, this product is also completely USELESS!</li>
            <li> But I just got it, so it might be helpful on certain lesions, in particular areas of the face.</li>
            <li> Seems simple enough except I remember vividly that the similar design I used in middle school worked perfectly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been unsuccessful with many other methods and devices to remove blackheads.</li>
            <li> .. wish they never discontinued the original one that they made back in the day</li>
            <li> For those who aren&#x27;t having luck with this device it really helps to exfoliate or use a facial scrub and/or steaming open the pores before using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to remove blackheads that I wasn&#x27;t able to remove by any other methods with this remover (biore skin strips, loop removers, manually by hand).  </li>
            <li> Interesting little tool, doesn&#x27;t really work very well.  </li>
            <li> It works a lot better than the typical loop blackhead removers and is much gentler on your skin too.</li>
            <li> first off this in my case required me to use a lot of pressure to actually clear my pores ended up with hurt nose.</li>
            <li> For the first time in 20 years, blackheads all over my nose isn&#x27;t the first and only thing I see in the mirror.  </li>
            <li> In fact, my only dissatisfaction with this item is that I didn&#x27;t have it as a teen when the blemishes were many</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen this product since I was in High School.</li>
            <li> Works as I tended and much better for your skin than squeezing the little devils.</li>
            <li> Holes are reasonably sized and smoothly punched so it isn&#x27;t likely to damage your skin if used properly.</li>
            <li> very helpful for disabled person great for some one that is limited in the amount of motion for help with personal grooming.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too big to handle, just right.</li>
            <li> Nice piece of equipment for blackhead removal;  only the hole seemed to be either too small or too large.  </li>
            <li> I would advise new users to find a video before using or purchasing.</li>
            <li> No need for squeezing blackheads that cause excess redness or swelling of your skin or a new pimple.</li>
            <li> i couldnt live without it.</li>
            <li> I just wish the edges were more defined so it could really extract those hard to get blackheads</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic for those zits in those hard to reach places like right in the ridge of your nose.</li>
            <li> It usually works better on taunt skin (so trying it on my cheeks didn&#x27;t work too well).  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Also, this is easier to do after a hot shower, to open the pores.</li>
            <li> i had some that were pretty deep that would have never gotten out using just my fingers.  </li>
            <li> Stick to the old fashion way and use two fingers!</li>
            <li> Every now and then a huge black head does come out.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to keep touching my face, so I bought this tool to help extract some white and black heads from the areas.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works great, but the edges are a bit sharper than my previous one from the 50&#x27;s that suddenly went missing.  </li>
            <li> The larger hole is nice for me because it helps me get rid of problematic black heads or even white heads if I have to.</li>
            <li> I would recommend that if you are at a pre-drinking age and have good health insurance to take Accutane as it may be difficult to go 5 months without alcohol as an adult!  </li>
            <li> and I actually might have found a use for the large gauge end.</li>
            <li> The holes in the cups are too large, so you can&#x27;t get enough pressure around the pore.</li>
            <li> this is a very simple device but it works well and is very high quality.</li>
            <li> Do not buy if you have even remotely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Our old tool like this broke years ago</li>
            <li> i wasn&#x27;t trying to be rude about it, but truthful.</li>
            <li> For those who don&#x27;t know how, place it directly over the blackhead so that is shows through the opening</li>
            <li> I purchased for my 15 year old.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work so well in places that are too soft, like cheeks...</li>
            <li> Once that occurs, I simply placed one of the holes over the blackhead and pressed gently.  </li>
            <li> My parents had one when I was young.</li>
            <li> And wow it works like a charm.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t encountered any problems or &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; blemishes that this couldn&#x27;t handle thus far.</li>
            <li> I recommended it.the only problem is the size of whole</li>
            <li> Searched and searched for this tool to replace one that was 36 years old.  </li>
            <li> It works very well on my nose, forehead, shoulders, and back.</li>
            <li> I have had minimal success with the Seki Edge Blackhead Remover.</li>
            <li> You do need a powerful magnifying mirror with illumination to really center the product correctly.  </li>
            <li> The other one, larger, is a bit larger than i would like, but it&#x27;s ok overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually use the Revlon version, but the Seki is wider and easy to use.</li>
            <li> The concept of this tool is nice, but once you attempt to put one end of it over a black head, you lose site of the black head.  </li>
            <li> The quality is good but it does not remove blackheads unless you push down hard on the skin.</li>
            <li> Bigger than older styles, easier to handle.</li>
            <li> only gripe I have with it is that most of the time the large hole is TOO large and the small hole is TOO small.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time getting anything out of the blackheads even though I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m using this properly.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had acne in years, but the stress of graduating college, moving, planning a wedding, remodeling a house, etc. caused a major, major outbreak.</li>
            <li> Just apply pressure on the black head using the device, the blackhead comes right out through the hole of the product.  </li>
            <li> I like it so far, and I would prefer this device over the traditional two finger squeeze.</li>
            <li> out a pore it barely gets anything.  </li>
            <li> The domed side goes toward your face with the hole over the top of the poor.  </li>
            <li> I tried it on a few acne lesions without any success.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s pretty big and certainly not travel size.</li>
            <li> My only complaint (and it&#x27;s a nice complaint to have, haha)</li>
            <li> The hardly ever come out clean on me.  </li>
            <li> My young teen kids are constantly picking their face.</li>
            <li> I have always been very particular about black head extractor ..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sturdy, made with quality metal, and after a few weeks of use and rinsing under hot water shows no signs of wear or rusting, etc.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> The holes in this are too small to be useful.</li>
            <li> and I had to drill out small end to make it useful.</li>
            <li> I know it works, I haven&#x27;t used it yet but has 2 different sized holes which are easy to put over the black or whitehead to remove w/a little pressure.</li>
            <li> Worth investing little more money than other poor qualities.&lt;br /&gt;Both</li>
            <li> perhaps my expectations were too high, but there&#x27;s a lot of pressing and nothing going on other than making indentations into the skin.  </li>
            <li> Bought this to help with those really stuck in there black heads.</li>
            <li> Works well for removing black heads &amp; gets the whole thing out...</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work at all for black heads or clogged pores.</li>
            <li> It works very well for blackhead removal and popping a zit from time to time, however it can slightly bruise the area.</li>
            <li> With the Seki model, it&#x27;s often hard to tell when you&#x27;ve had success removing a blackhead.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes you have to press really hard and is more suited for back trouble</li>
            <li> I have had great success, especially with stubborn area that I have had trouble getting in the past and seem almost impossible to get out unless you have a scalpel.  </li>
            <li> and you push straight down, sometimes rather hard depending on how much padding is under the skin.</li>
            <li> This may work for some people but for me an average white 40 year old male</li>
            <li> Back side is almost flat and does not work.</li>
            <li> Nothing comes out - either hole, the large or small.  </li>
            <li> If the price were marked down beyond its current number, I would say to try it</li>
            <li> is that I can&#x27;t use it much because while I do have blackheads, they are too small to use the tool on.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my soon to be wife and she flat out did not like it.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed since I&#x27;d read the good reviews.  </li>
            <li> Compared to others we have tried this one is well built, so far we have been unable to bend it and the larger width is far easier on your fingers than our older Revlon version.</li>
            <li> You push down into your skin and in some areas it is soft</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to push very hard (or you&#x27;ll break the skin) and you have to work clean (use alcohol or some other local disinfectant).</li>
            <li> We bought this one because it was a bit more expensive than other options on amazon.  </li>
            <li> I was pressing so hard that I really felt like it would damage my skin.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really work on fleshy parts of the face, because its hard to keep it in place on the blackhead.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good little tool that isn&#x27;t very expensive.</li>
            <li> The only difference between the one she had and this one is the bigger hole on my mom&#x27;s was a little bigger</li>
            <li> I got this a long long time ago and just never wrote anything.  </li>
            <li> I prefer to use the smaller side and drag it across my nose.</li>
            <li> and the edges seem a tad rough, but it does the job well enough</li>
            <li> It took years for me to stumble upon this.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it is hard to remove blackheads in certain areas of the face due to different thickness of the skin or the deepness of the pore.  </li>
            <li> It will require less force and hurt a little less than it would if you didn&#x27;t open it first.</li>
            <li> This blackhead/pimple remover is far less damaging to the skin than trying to dig them out with your fingers, finger nails, or a needle, God forbid!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a very small person and perhaps this tool is too large.</li>
            <li> This little thing just left my nose red.  </li>
            <li> I had to put pressure on it from one side to the other to actually have the blackhead removed.</li>
            <li> , I would avoid the face especially if you have sensitive skin, this will leave marks on your face depending on how hard you press.  </li>
            <li> The smaller end was useless to me because of my large pores, but I can see how someone would have the opposite problem.</li>
            <li> No more damage to my skin from trying to remove blackheads the old way.</li>
            <li> you do loose sight of the blackhead when you try to put it over but</li>
            <li> The previous reviewer must not have been using this tool properly.</li>
            <li> my pores are big so black heads on my nose</li>
            <li> Simply align the hole over the black head and press.  </li>
            <li> It only seems to irritate the skin where I&#x27;m trying to remove a black head and haven&#x27;t gotten it to work yet</li>
            <li> The smaller hole needs to be a little larger, but other than that, it works!</li>
            <li> You can mash and dig and gouge until your eyes cross and and your head hurts, and you will have removed little to nothing from your clogged pores or pimples.</li>
            <li> This product did not do anything for me except leave little red hickey dots on my face.</li>
            <li> A little bigger than I wanted</li>
            <li> The big hole works well for ingrown hairs I get from shaving, to push a little bit of the hair out so I can get at it with tweezers.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work as well as fingernails and is actually more painful to use.</li>
            <li> This Seki Edge Blackhead Remover was great in removing that nasty blackhead stuck in my face for months.</li>
            <li> Not as expected.  </li>
            <li> Be careful using though.</li>
            <li> It has to be sterile and be careful of infection.</li>
            <li> This tool causes minimal damage the is gone within hours.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> But I still try it on my self with not much luck.</li>
            <li> Tried a few times and finally ended up recycling it.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t drag it across the skin as you can with loop extractors.</li>
            <li> Once I use the tool on a pimple, I cleanse the area, and put a blemish control cream on, and nine times out of ten, the area is 90% healed within 12 hours or less!  </li>
            <li> i saw other ones that had a pencil shaped base but this one seems more safer for pressing down and my fingers not slipping off.</li>
            <li> I have very tiny pores, so removal of these things were not easy.  </li>
            <li> you have to press down so hard and far</li>
            <li> And I usually can get it to work on pushing blackheads and pimples out of my husbands back.  </li>
            <li> this one has sharp edges to the holes and made me bleed.  </li>
            <li> The small sharper end actually helps push out blackheads all over too.  </li>
            <li> I read other reviews saying it does not work so here</li>
            <li> The small side is even too big.</li>
            <li> Other products want you to scrap over the blackhead or use a pointed end on it.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes it works other times</li>
            <li> I used it on my sister the other day</li>
            <li> Had a different brand in the past and thus one didn&#x27;t compare at all.</li>
            <li> , one of them is so big and another one is so small</li>
            <li> works as close as any other revlon pimple remover</li>
            <li> It only works where the skin is thin, such as forehead.</li>
            <li> I did as other reviewers suggested and tried angling it and wiggling it while pressing down.</li>
            <li> Couple of good-sized craters forming too, the more I mess with them... :(</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that one end is slight too big and the other is slightly too small.</li>
            <li> this works extremely well for removing stubborn black heads.  </li>
            <li> Hard product to find, rather one that actually works.</li>
            <li> The small end is a little too small and the big end is a little too big.  </li>
            <li> Works but hurts when you push hard enough for it to do its job.</li>
            <li> only con with this product is it doesn&#x27;t come with instructions or tips, but I guess the manufacturer just assumes how to use it is common sense.</li>
            <li> small but has a heavy solid feel to it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product nearly 10 months ago and had nearly forgotten about it until I had a horribly large and impossible to move blackhead located in a difficult to reach place on my nose.  </li>
            <li> Then push down and it will pop it out.  </li>
            <li> Gets white heads if you push REALLY REALLY hard, does little justice on blackheads.</li>
            <li> There were no directions as to whether you press the tool down over the black head, or scrape it off.</li>
            <li> However if you are a popper use this instead and it will leave less scars.  </li>
            <li> dont struggle with bumps ever again; pimples,white heads, black heads, etc.  </li>
            <li> Makes removing black heads easier and doesn&#x27;t leave scares like your nails do</li>
            <li> It is also a bit oddly shaped to get any pressure to remove anything.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my black heads.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this tool if you truly had a black head problem</li>
            <li> and I could not get it to pull out a black head.</li>
            <li> had lost a similar rmover years ago and was unable to find something similar until now.</li>
            <li> Still trouble, experiment with wiggling it around just slightly as you apply pressure down.</li>
            <li> So bought it just in case since I have seen a few black heads sometimes.</li>
            <li> So a little wiggling.</li>
            <li> Either i dont have blackheads or dont know how to hold these little things</li>
            <li> I pushed down with varying degrees of pressure, but very little came out.</li>
            <li> If you do NOT know what you are doing, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I used it for a few years and then took a medicine called accutane (isotarin)</li>
            <li> Within a few days the redness changed to flaking skin.  </li>
            <li> I had one with a loop a few years ago</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Definitely a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I am partially disabled so my wife has the unenviable task of removing.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> I would return, but too much trouble for this amount of money</li>
            <li> This thing is a waste of time.</li>
            <li> I ordered this, thought I&#x27;d have to wait a few weeks to get it</li>
            <li> this did make it a bit simpiler for hard to get areas or stubborn white/ black heads.</li>
            <li> I end up getting slightly bloody and giving myself a little scab which looks worse than the original black head.  </li>
            <li> Not satisfied.</li>
            <li> no more digging in your skin creating sores.  </li>
            <li> no more waking uo to scabs</li>
            <li> so I got this thinking how can I go wrong with a Japanese product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that it usually works.</li>
            <li> I purchased one about 10 years ago and it was absolutely useless; however, I only paid a couple of dollars for it.  </li>
            <li> The small hole on unit was too small</li>
            <li> know it works for some, but I would be wary as Amazon does not like to refund items such as this if they do not work for you.</li>
            <li> I get small breakouts or blackheads that are hard to get out</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t bruise my skin up trying to get at those hard to reach pores.</li>
            <li> but I found out the hard way.</li>
            <li> I press hard and still nothing comes out some times...</li>
            <li> This method will work 1 out of 50 times, but you have to be pressing in so hard that it damages the skin, which is what I bought this thing to avoid.</li>
            <li> and you won&#x27;t have to push so hard to get the gunk out.</li>
            <li> I still prefer the Revlon Blackhead Remover but those are hard to find.</li>
            <li> Just sucks and doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> I had never had acne or blackheads until my late 30&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I tried steaming my pores and the tool was not effective at all.</li>
            <li> Did not work - the metal was too thick to squeeze the blackheads out.</li>
            <li> How hard the core is and where on the face you try to use it can be the difference between failure and success.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used to have a similar tool by Revlon, but I don&#x27;t think they make it anymore, unfortunately for them, because this type of tool works wonders!</li>
            <li> but this blackhead remover was a failure.</li>
            <li> Thankfully, it&#x27;s not too expensive, but in the end it feels like I&#x27;ve wasted my money.</li>
            <li> This is not a good blackhead remover.</li>
            <li> but it is dead wrong.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed with it, and found that it just leaves circular marks on your face, but does not actually remove blackheads or blemishes.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how easily it forced the blackhead to come out!  </li>
            <li> It is very hard to remove blackheads with this device.</li>
            <li> U have to push very hard</li>
            <li> I have to push very hard and it leaves marks for an hour or so.</li>
            <li> no what I mean to say is ... there is no pain!.</li>
            <li> It creates broken capillaries and bruised the skin.</li>
            <li> Not amazing, not wonderful.</li>
            <li> I hate to see what you would need that larger side for!!!</li>
            <li> The small end works like a charm, and even gets those awkwardly placed blackheads where the nose meets the cheek.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s less painful</li>
            <li> I have not yet found the secret to eliminating blackheads and keeping them gone, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> I found this to be useless for my needs.</li>
            <li> too difficult to work with.</li>
            <li> Almost useless.</li>
            <li> I think this tool is almost useless.  </li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> The shape is all wrong.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m using it wrong, but this product is not working for me.  </li>
            <li> What am I supposed to do with 20 of these useless things??</li>
            <li> and she found it to me useless.  </li>
            <li> This does the job for me where even the wire loop type fails.</li>
            <li> The people giving this tool bad reviews must be doing something wrong.  </li>
            <li> Its really nasty seeing all the gunk that is trapped in your pores start to ooze out.</li>
            <li> i consider it a dangerous product.  </li>
            <li> But with some disappointment it doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> Terrible waste of money.  </li>
            <li> It was getting to be very painful and hard to deal with.</li>
            <li> and it looks so painful to use, I&#x27;d never buy it.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well as I had hoped. :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed because it didn&#x27;t work, and I&#x27;m out</li>
            <li> get this u will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Thoroughly worthless.</li>
            <li> This tool is completely worthless in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> i like how the remover has a wider base</li>
            <li> Very unhappy!</li>
            <li> This works insanely well on your forehead.</li>
            <li> So tragic!!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed!!  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Whether I have just finished a jog and my face is all sweaty, greasy and warm or not (as others have suggested), this just doesn&#x27;t work super-well for me. I have not yet found the secret to eliminating blackheads and keeping them gone, unfortunately. Couple of good-sized craters forming too, the more I mess with them... :(</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t really like it. it leaves marks on your face and it actually opened my skin on my nose. the wholes are too big.</li>
            <li> It works exactly like they said it would&lt;br /&gt;Yes I would recommend this product to my friends.everyone should give this item a try</li>
            <li> Bought this to help with those really stuck in there black heads. I&#x27;ve just recently started trying to take better care of my skin and was recommended one of these by a friend so I don&#x27;t bruise my skin up trying to get at those hard to reach pores. After 4 or 5 uses I have to say it really works well. If you have some stubborn blackheads that you can&#x27;t seem to get, give this a try. I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted and worked great.</li>
            <li> Do not buy if you have even remotely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Greatest most gross invention ever! Really works!</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  Much better than the others that are out on the market.  This one does not hurt.</li>
            <li> Just sucks and doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.  it does what it says, but I&#x27;ve use other tools that I&#x27;ve liked better.</li>
            <li> My husband owns a different design in a blackhead remover, and it did not work at all for me.  I had never had acne or blackheads until my late 30&#x27;s when one of my medications created the issue.  Discontinuation of the medication resolved the acne, but left me with a blackhead prone nose.  I have very tiny pores, so removal of these things were not easy.  This Seki Edge Blackhead Remover works better than anything else I have tried.  Between this and a salicylic acid cleanser,  I have removed about 90% of the problem.</li>
            <li> I have had minimal success with the Seki Edge Blackhead Remover. The majority of the time, it doesn&#x27;t remove the blackhead and just leaves a red mark on my face. Thankfully, it&#x27;s not too expensive, but in the end it feels like I&#x27;ve wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Blackhead remover doesn&#x27;t do what it claims.  You have to press so hard to get to the blackheads that you might injure the surrounding good tissue.  Not satisfied.</li>
            <li> The previous reviewer must not have been using this tool properly. It works a lot better than the typical loop blackhead removers and is much gentler on your skin too.</li>
            <li> I got this a long long time ago and just never wrote anything.  It was a great buy and I recieved it very quickly.  Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> This product worked everytime I used it.  Love it.  You do need a powerful magnifying mirror with illumination to really center the product correctly.  Results are totally based upon the user.  If you know what you are doing, it does work.  If you do NOT know what you are doing, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> this is the first one i have ever bought. I use to remove white heads with a pair of tweezers and squeeze blackheads out.. this did make it a bit simpiler for hard to get areas or stubborn white/ black heads. Its really nasty seeing all the gunk that is trapped in your pores start to ooze out. I would advise new users to find a video before using or purchasing.</li>
            <li> These work very well.</li>
            <li> These things are a pain in the butt however if you know how to use them they are amazing.  The domed side goes toward your face with the hole over the top of the poor.  Then push down and it will pop it out.  I would honestly say this thing is for those people who pick at or pop there blackheads bye hand.  You really should be cleaning them and not popping them.  However if you are a popper use this instead and it will leave less scars.  My mother purchased one of these on a trip overseas for me 13 yrs ago when I was only 15 and it worked very well I used it for a few years and then took a medicine called accutane (isotarin) I would recommend that if you are at a pre-drinking age and have good health insurance to take Accutane as it may be difficult to go 5 months without alcohol as an adult!  I have gone years with no acne after taking that medicine.  However before taking it this was a neat and useful tool!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had acne in years, but the stress of graduating college, moving, planning a wedding, remodeling a house, etc. caused a major, major outbreak. I had both regular acne and cystic acne all on my cheeks and jawline. It was getting to be very painful and hard to deal with. I didn&#x27;t want to keep touching my face, so I bought this tool to help extract some white and black heads from the areas.&lt;br /&gt;Overall it is a really nice tool for the cost. It&#x27;s sturdy, made with quality metal, and after a few weeks of use and rinsing under hot water shows no signs of wear or rusting, etc.&lt;br /&gt;The only gripe I have with it is that most of the time the large hole is TOO large and the small hole is TOO small.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m embarrassed to be reviewing a product called \\&quot;blackhead remover,\\&quot; but I feel it necessary to say that this tool does just about nothing.  It came with no instructions whatsoever.  You can mash and dig and gouge until your eyes cross and and your head hurts, and you will have removed little to nothing from your clogged pores or pimples.</li>
            <li> Not as expected.  Used one before from same maker; this one is different.</li>
            <li> I found this to be useless for my needs. It was too big and clunky and ripped up my face.</li>
            <li> The concept of this tool is nice, but once you attempt to put one end of it over a black head, you lose site of the black head.  Also, it has yet to work for me.  There were no directions as to whether you press the tool down over the black head, or scrape it off.</li>
            <li> IT DOESN&#x27;T WORK AS WELL AS THE &amp;#34;OLD&amp;#34; STYLE THAT REVLON USED TO MAKE .</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t care for it at all. too difficult to work with. too much preparation just to do its job and it still didn&#x27;t work right. Fast shipping though!</li>
            <li> I had a hard time getting anything out of the blackheads even though I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m using this properly. I was pressing so hard that I really felt like it would damage my skin. I&#x27;m a very small person and perhaps this tool is too large. I will keep it for legitimate pimples, though, it should work better for that than a loop extractor.</li>
            <li> I like this products everything  so easy to use it.&lt;br /&gt;I wish it come with a case to carry it.</li>
            <li> this Blackhead remover is awesome! It gets the job done really good, i would recommend it to anybody who is interested in getting one of these.</li>
            <li> This is great for blackheads. No more damage to my skin from trying to remove blackheads the old way. This is not designed for pimples. For that matter what is . Pimples need medication not this tool.</li>
            <li> This may work for some people but for me an average white 40 year old male it doesn&#x27;t do anything for me.  I have blackheads on my nose like many people do.  This device doesn&#x27;t help extract them.  You push down into your skin and in some areas it is soft so it hurts.  Nothing comes out - either hole, the large or small.  I guess if you use on your forehead or a big zit with a white head then maybe this will work but nothing beats a good pinch with your fingers - although this may not be the best for your skin.</li>
            <li> i dont why you cant find this in any store; even a beauty supply store but i freakin love this tool...i gots ta have it!!!  dont struggle with bumps ever again; pimples,white heads, black heads, etc.  no more digging in your skin creating sores.  no more waking uo to scabs AND the bump came back bigger...get this thing...one shot one pop...everything will come out on the first attempt.</li>
            <li> Our old tool like this broke years ago and so I was glad to find this one to replace it.</li>
            <li> Love it, been looking for something like this,it really works well.</li>
            <li> it works when truly needed for stubborn problems. Be careful using though. Not for kids to play with. It has to be sterile and be careful of infection. Never had a problem with infection...just saying. Good product for what it does.</li>
            <li> please do not buy this product. it really does not work. i did a review on this and the owner of the company called me and asked me to change my review. i wasn&#x27;t trying to be rude about it, but truthful.</li>
            <li> This tool is perfect and makes it so easy to get to those blackheads without having to pinch your face to get to the small blackheads.</li>
            <li> My mom had one of these when I was a teenager, and it worked great.  The only difference between the one she had and this one is the bigger hole on my mom&#x27;s was a little bigger so I liked hers better.  This pimple squeezer is fantastic!  It works great on those pimples that you know you need to pop but can&#x27;t get quite enough pressure on it--I know, gross--but you know what I&#x27;m talking about :)  It&#x27;s fantastic for those zits in those hard to reach places like right in the ridge of your nose.</li>
            <li> The quality is good but it does not remove blackheads unless you push down hard on the skin. It creates broken capillaries and bruised the skin. I do not recommend.</li>
            <li> It works fine but it&#x27;s pretty big and certainly not travel size. For those who don&#x27;t know how, place it directly over the blackhead so that is shows through the opening and you push straight down, sometimes rather hard depending on how much padding is under the skin. Look which direction the pore goes (you can see the discoloration through the skin) and push so it can work straight out of the pore even if it is at an angle. Still trouble, experiment with wiggling it around just slightly as you apply pressure down. This help work it out. Also it helps if you do it soon after a shower.&lt;br /&gt;these don&#x27;t work as well on the face, period. How hard the core is and where on the face you try to use it can be the difference between failure and success.&lt;br /&gt;This can work on white heads, but it will hurt more. Just make sure you gently open the top with a needle before using the tool and pushing down. It will require less force and hurt a little less than it would if you didn&#x27;t open it first.</li>
            <li> Almost useless. Leaves marks on your skin.</li>
            <li> I tried it on a few acne lesions without any success. But I just got it, so it might be helpful on certain lesions, in particular areas of the face. I will write an update when I know more, but my first impression is that the ones with a very fine head are probably best--also expensive. I tried the Sklar Schamberg extra-fine comedone extractor (one my sister has), and it worked very well. It&#x27;s $23.85, though, and it doesn&#x27;t show shipping info.</li>
            <li> OMG this is the best thing there is to remove your black heads. Its easy and painless. Totally recomended.</li>
            <li> The Seki was delivered ahead of date stated. I usually use the Revlon version, but the Seki is wider and easy to use. Thanks, I am glad I bought 2 of them, for home and travel.</li>
            <li> I recommended it to every one. It&#x27;s great by material and quality. It&#x27;s valueble for that price.  It was I looking for.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really like this product, I&#x27;m a guy and my pores are big so black heads on my nose annoy me so I got this thinking how can I go wrong with a Japanese product but I found out the hard way. first off this in my case required me to use a lot of pressure to actually clear my pores ended up with hurt nose.</li>
            <li> We bought this one because it was a bit more expensive than other options on amazon.  And I usually can get it to work on pushing blackheads and pimples out of my husbands back.  It usually works better on taunt skin (so trying it on my cheeks didn&#x27;t work too well).  I have tried using it on my forehead as well.  But I don&#x27;t know what my issue is.  The hardly ever come out clean on me.  I end up getting slightly bloody and giving myself a little scab which looks worse than the original black head.  Oh well, I&#x27;ll keep it for the hubby.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed since I&#x27;d read the good reviews.  This little thing just left my nose red.  Within a few days the redness changed to flaking skin.  I haven&#x27;t used it since.  Guess it&#x27;ll end up in the trash sooner or later.</li>
            <li> this is the best purchase I have ever made. I get small breakouts or blackheads that are hard to get out and this does it beautifully with no effort at all.</li>
            <li> very helpful for disabled person great for some one that is limited in the amount of motion for help with personal grooming.</li>
            <li> I think this would work best for very soft, young skin with surface blackheads. For older, deeper ones, it is not so great.</li>
            <li> I purchased for my 15 year old. Wow! it works. We tried other products but this is the best one.</li>
            <li> Makes removing black heads easier and doesn&#x27;t leave scares like your nails do</li>
            <li> It is very hard to remove blackheads with this device. Some people may have the knack but I certainly dont.</li>
            <li> Works ok. Not as good as I expected. U have to push very hard</li>
            <li> I think this tool is almost useless.  It doesn&#x27;t work as well as fingernails and is actually more painful to use.</li>
            <li> I will agree that it is made for blackheads, only. That said, this tool can leave a read mark at the indentation sight; this is not a permanent marking however, it seems that it does not always do as it says. Many years ago, when I was still in school, a friend had a similar tool but it worked so much better than this one. If the price were marked down beyond its current number, I would say to try it~otherwise, look for something else.</li>
            <li> Nice solid blackhead remover. Just get it and start popping!</li>
            <li> Works well for removing black heads &amp; gets the whole thing out...doesn&#x27;t always work...and sometimes it does hurt! The hurt is worth the result!</li>
            <li> Interesting little tool, doesn&#x27;t really work very well.  Have messed around with this tool a bit and my fingernails work better.</li>
            <li> love having this in the drawer  comes in handy when you start to feel something building up under the skin and dont want it to grow bigger  use it on a daily basis!</li>
            <li> For the first time in 20 years, blackheads all over my nose isn&#x27;t the first and only thing I see in the mirror.  I have owned a revlon one that worked &amp;#34;good,&amp;#34; and another that had ovals instead of circles.  This works much better than the revlon.</li>
            <li> This is good quality because it doesn&#x27;t flex, the metal is strong. One opening, the smaller one, is perfect for most black heads. The other one, larger, is a bit larger than i would like, but it&#x27;s ok overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it for blackheads on my forehead and my nose and worked very well. You don&#x27;t have to push very hard (or you&#x27;ll break the skin) and you have to work clean (use alcohol or some other local disinfectant). Also, this is easier to do after a hot shower, to open the pores. It only works where the skin is thin, such as forehead. It doesn&#x27;t work so well in places that are too soft, like cheeks...</li>
            <li> This works insanely well on your forehead. It doesn&#x27;t really work on fleshy parts of the face, because its hard to keep it in place on the blackhead. It leaves a big dot on your face where you push the blackhead out, it goes away in about an hour.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t give anything five stars that hurts but it works as advertised. It&#x27;s a bit large but that makes it easy to hold. Well priced and excellent quality and performance.</li>
            <li> Not impressed. Gets white heads if you push REALLY REALLY hard, does little justice on blackheads.</li>
            <li> The holes in this are too small to be useful. It is also a bit oddly shaped to get any pressure to remove anything. This is not a good blackhead remover.</li>
            <li> not like the old revlon remover i have, which has smoothly rounded holes.  this one has sharp edges to the holes and made me bleed.  obviously made by someone who didn&#x27;t know or didn&#x27;t care what it does to peoples skin.  i consider it a dangerous product.  amazon should quit doing business with this company.  i threw it away.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy, i like the fact that is has two hole sizes.  I bought it to use on my son&#x27;s back for blackheads it got job done</li>
            <li> My husband had me on the hunt for this pimple popper. I couldn&#x27;t find it at any Harmon or beauty cosmetic stores.  He really likes this product and says his skin is better because of it.  Pops pimples in a way that doesn&#x27;t scar the face.</li>
            <li> However, Revlon had one that was softer on the edges, and worked better. I wish they made it still. This though helps with facials, but you need to steam or do it right after warm steamy shower to not injure the skin and then use  witchhazel or a antiseptic.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is too large as other reviewers says, it feels perfect on the hand and works great. I can&#x27;t squeeze all the blackheads but most of it. It&#x27;s also very important to use after showering or cleaning the face with hot water or steam. Good quality. I had one with a loop a few years ago and I feel this one works better, loops leave marks and scars on the face.</li>
            <li> I had one of these decades ago and am pleased to have one again. For stubborn blackheads, this Seki blackhead remover gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I had a smaller version of this that I picked up at the cosmetics area of a local department store, I thought it was the best tool ever. I was wrong, this one is way better. The smaller one was good at taking care of surface problems but ineffectual for the deeper ones that occasionally plagued my husband. This tool within seconds removed a spot that had formed deep on the muscular part of his shoulder and had been bothering him for well over a year. I tempted to order a second one because my teenage boys lost my smaller one and I dont want to be without this tool. The smaller side works well for surface blemishes while the bigger side is perfect for the deeper ones. This tool causes minimal damage the is gone within hours.</li>
            <li> I ended up using this as an earwax scoop instead of a blackhead remover. Pretty awesome.</li>
            <li> This tool doesn&#x27;t really work at all. I was disappointed with it, and found that it just leaves circular marks on your face, but does not actually remove blackheads or blemishes. I wouldn&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product nearly 10 months ago and had nearly forgotten about it until I had a horribly large and impossible to move blackhead located in a difficult to reach place on my nose.  I brushed the dust off this tool and went to work.  I recommend using this tool while in the shower, once there is plenty of steam to have your pores completely open.  Once that occurs, I simply placed one of the holes over the blackhead and pressed gently.  I was amazed at how easily it forced the blackhead to come out!  I think this tool is perfect for blackheads that appear in hard-to-reach places, such as around the creases of the nose.  To clean I dab it in benzoyl peroxide, then run it through the dishwasher for one cycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con with this product is it doesn&#x27;t come with instructions or tips, but I guess the manufacturer just assumes how to use it is common sense.</li>
            <li> Work ok in the places on my face where you can apply good solid pressure, blackheads pop right out.  It does not work so good on the more mushy parts of the face.  The small sharper end actually helps push out blackheads all over too.  It&#x27;s not too big to handle, just right.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had this incredible tool for over a year now, and wouldn&#x27;t want to live without it!  It works amazingly well, with two sizes to use, depending on your specific needs.  It works 99% of the time, though there is the very rare moment that it might not work on a particular blackhead or pimple.  Again, this is very rare!  The people giving this tool bad reviews must be doing something wrong.  I honestly can&#x27;t imagine why they would say what they did.  They probably didn&#x27;t use it enough. This blackhead/pimple remover is far less damaging to the skin than trying to dig them out with your fingers, finger nails, or a needle, God forbid!  Once I use the tool on a pimple, I cleanse the area, and put a blemish control cream on, and nine times out of ten, the area is 90% healed within 12 hours or less!  Again, this depends on the blemish.  If it&#x27;s just removing a blackhead, the redness goes away withing 15 to 20 minutes and I&#x27;m good to go!  Be sure to cleanse the area on the skin, and the tool very well after each use.  I&#x27;ve seen similar tools at places like Sephora for a lot more money, and probably not as effective!  I love this tool and can&#x27;t say enough about how great it is!  My husband loves it, and now my Mom wants one too!  Try it and give it a chance!  You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> Works great, but the edges are a bit sharper than my previous one from the 50&#x27;s that suddenly went missing.  Seems like the edges of the holes were rolled more on the old model.</li>
            <li> This product did not do anything for me except leave little red hickey dots on my face. I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Nice piece of equipment for blackhead removal;  only the hole seemed to be either too small or too large.  But in the end, it worked just fine.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product, at ALL!  It did not push my blackheads out - it only left red marks on my face the next day.  I don&#x27;t even do that when I&#x27;m trying to get rid of the them with my fingers.. Definitely a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Not amazing, not wonderful. not even great--just an ok product.  I am still searching the market for a better tool after purchasing this.</li>
            <li> Works as I tended and much better for your skin than squeezing the little devils. Wish I had bought one so er.</li>
            <li> Works as expected. Boy, you really haven&#x27;t lived until you have looked in a mirror and realized how huge your pores are and all the gross stuff that is contained within.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a little dish with alcohol to help keep it sanitary, most likely one wants to keep it clean as it is filled with bacteria from your skin.</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;blackhead remover&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t. Didn&#x27;t do a thing for me. I tried steaming my pores and the tool was not effective at all.</li>
            <li> This product is not bad I have used other but this on I found  works best.</li>
            <li> My friend told me about this and I tried it out and let me tell you I HAD a lot of blackheads. I read other reviews saying it does not work so here are some hints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When using it you have to OPEN UP YOUR PORES or it will not work. Take a shower, use a face wipe and then immediately use it. I prefer to use the smaller side and drag it across my nose. You DO NOT HAVE TO USE A LOT OF PRESSURE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Had to get another one of these...want to call it pimple remover. My parents had one when I was young. I was laughing when reading reviews a lot of others mentioning this too.Well that was a hundred years ago. My young teen kids are constantly picking their face. I guess we all do even though we should not! So I was hoping this would elevate them digging and causing larger bumps with them not having nails to help. But with some disappointment it doesn&#x27;t work well. You must have to have large blackheads...and for us, they are using it on pimples! But I still try it on my self with not much luck. The small side is even too big. I hate to see what you would need that larger side for!!! I&#x27;m glad I have it in my draw of tricks though.</li>
            <li> Works well. Love this product.</li>
            <li> I tried several different types of blackhead removers.None of them worked like this one. It has two sized holes. The smaller hole needs to be a little larger, but other than that, it works! (I clean it with alcohol in-between uses.)</li>
            <li> Performs as advertised.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my black heads.  I&#x27;ve found that it usually works. The problem is that my nose has so many pores that it would literally take hours to unclog every last one.  Its made of good thick metal and is sturdy.  My only complaint is that one end is slight too big and the other is slightly too small. That&#x27;s just for me though. I don&#x27;t know if it would be the same for everyone.</li>
            <li> Did not work - the metal was too thick to squeeze the blackheads out.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. The shape is all wrong.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. Tried a few times and finally ended up recycling it.</li>
            <li> I press hard and still nothing comes out some times... it&#x27;s okay..</li>
            <li> I tried all kinds of preperation on my face. Tried both sides. It did not remove ANY blackheads or whiteheads.Thoroughly worthless. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved using this kind of product, but lost the one I had for a long time.  It doesn&#x27;t damage your skin and it gets your blackheads out very easily.</li>
            <li> Works well. Sturdy and doesn&#x27;t bend.</li>
            <li> works well just like in youtube. my wife cant get enuff of it.</li>
            <li> This is the best type of blackhead remover I have found. I would recommend it to all who have problems with fhese issues</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a blackhead remover what more is there to say. Delivery a day earlier the predicted.</li>
            <li> So glad I found this product by Seki...I used to have a similar tool by Revlon, but I don&#x27;t think they make it anymore, unfortunately for them, because this type of tool works wonders! No need for squeezing blackheads that cause excess redness or swelling of your skin or a new pimple. It is a small tool that fits right in my make-up case if needed; great for travel. If you have blackheads on your nose, I&#x27;d recommend Biore peeling strips. Why Revlon stopped making this style blackhead remover is beyond me, they replaced it with some loopy-ended instrument...ugh..!..and it looks so painful to use, I&#x27;d never buy it. I&#x27;m so grateful to have found this on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Awesome blackhead remover. It gets rid of all the stubborn blackheads on the nose effectively with minimal effort and without hurting (YAY!). Such magical results without pre-steaming or pre-scrubbing the face. Like another reviewer aptly put it, it is way way better than the regular loop style remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am one happy customer with this purchase and will also recommend the product to my family and friends.</li>
            <li> This item works great.  No pain and very easy to do.  It is worth every penny.  Don&#x27;t fall for the cheaper items.  Other products want you to scrap over the blackhead or use a pointed end on it.  This is more sanitary and pain free.  Simply align the hole over the black head and press.  That&#x27;s it.  Great Product.</li>
            <li> A very well made and useful tool to have around</li>
            <li> About 30 years ago we use to use a product similar to this and it worked GREAT!  I purchased one about 10 years ago and it was absolutely useless; however, I only paid a couple of dollars for it.  This time I thought I would spend more money in hopes of getting a good product; well, this product is also completely USELESS!</li>
            <li> I appreciate keeping my skin clean and clear.  This product allows me to do this with ease and without pain.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t purchase this! It does not work. I read the reviews before buying and decided to give it a chance anyways. I tried pressing this thing into the skin and it does nothing. I did as other reviewers suggested and tried angling it and wiggling it while pressing down. This method will work 1 out of 50 times, but you have to be pressing in so hard that it damages the skin, which is what I bought this thing to avoid. Anyways its in the trash now, and I am back to searching for a better way to remove blackheads.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m using it wrong, but this product is not working for me.  I purchased a different one with smaller holes from Sally&#x27;s Beauty suppy and it works like a charm.  Granted, it was about three times the price of this item but it was well worth the money to have one that acually got the blackheads out. My face can breath!</li>
            <li> This tool is pretty ineffective at removing blackheads, but it does a great job leaving circular marks on my face! I could do a better job with my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I got sent a pack of 20. What am I supposed to do with 20 of these useless things??</li>
            <li> work very well for acne</li>
            <li> strong steel and gets the job done. Hard product to find, rather one that actually works. Would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with the quality of the product .. Quick delivery. I have always been very particular about black head extractor .. I took chance with this one and serves me just right !! I really like it.</li>
            <li> This is a nice beauty tool to have and it&#x27;s pretty cheap. My only complaint (and it&#x27;s a nice complaint to have, haha) is that I can&#x27;t use it much because while I do have blackheads, they are too small to use the tool on. I am still glad I bought it though to have it in the future.</li>
            <li> this works extremely well for removing stubborn black heads.  i had some that were pretty deep that would have never gotten out using just my fingers.  sounds gross but it&#x27;s the truth.  using this thing extracted them great!  this is what dermatologists use in their office.</li>
            <li> but I could not find anything like this in the stores....I wanted an instrument with more metal built up around the openings to help get the &#x27;stuff&#x27; out..........still looking for one like I had years ago.  This one is alright - but I want one for &#x27;tiny&#x27; pimple issues.</li>
            <li> perhaps my expectations were too high, but there&#x27;s a lot of pressing and nothing going on other than making indentations into the skin.  i don&#x27;t use it anymore.</li>
            <li> Its just ok. The small end is a little too small and the big end is a little too big.  I wouldnt say im dissappointed w my purchase. I just wish the edges were more defined so it could really extract those hard to get blackheads</li>
            <li> This product works but does not work on everything and is no cure all device.  Sometimes you have to press really hard and is more suited for back trouble, I would avoid the face especially if you have sensitive skin, this will leave marks on your face depending on how hard you press.  I have had great success, especially with stubborn area that I have had trouble getting in the past and seem almost impossible to get out unless you have a scalpel.  Sometimes it works and sometimes it does not.  Just be careful, and sometimes getting a partner to help works best.</li>
            <li> I was amazed how this tool works.  It is well made and the material looks of a very good quality.  I already recommended it.</li>
            <li> Opening way to large to do anything substantial.  Also not made very well, wish I could return it, but it doesn&#x27;t seem returnable</li>
            <li> A little bigger than I wanted and the edges seem a tad rough, but it does the job well enough</li>
            <li> Sometimes it works other times it doesnt. it doesnt leave circles on my nose. Every now and then a huge black head does come out. Maybe it has to be with my skin. I would recommend this tool if you truly had a black head problem</li>
            <li> It was a gift for a relative.  Hope it works well.  We have one like it that works just fine.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get your blackheads.. I was literally mashing my face with this thing, but the blackheads wouldn&#x27;t come out. I get more luck putting the blackhead between two of my nails.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with this product. I have never owned one of these before and bought it to just try it out and see if actually works. And it does!!! Just make sure to steam your face for like 3 or 4 min or put a hot towel over your face before you start because it will make it easier and you won&#x27;t have to push so hard to get the gunk out. I would def. recommend!!</li>
            <li> I thought it would be better.....doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well as I had hoped. :( So tragic!! I guess I&#x27;ll have to buy another type.</li>
            <li> The small hole on unit was too small and I had to drill out small end to make it useful.</li>
            <li> No it did not. I could not get it to work. Maybe I need someone else to do it which is not why I bought it. I just need shoulder to neck area and I could not get it to pull out a black head.</li>
            <li> This Blackhead Remover is just another great product from Seki-Edge, and the remover is very well-made from the same type of steel, that the Samurai Swords were made out of....from this company out of Japan!!  I highly-recommend all of Seki Edge&#x27;s products!!!  Thanks Seki &amp; Amazon for another Great Product!!!</li>
            <li> Holes are too large and it really does not do the job very easily you have to press down so hard and far that I think it hurts more than it helps.  Does not work effectively.</li>
            <li> The tool is so rigid and needs some pressure to work, but then leaves marks on the skin. I was trying to avoid that!</li>
            <li> Smooth, well-made, better than most of what&#x27;s on the market.  Actually, the best I&#x27;ve found in recent years. Bigger than older styles, easier to handle.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have so many blackheads to remove but I notice one once in a while. I always wanted to have one of those. I used it on my sister the other day and she told me how to use it. I had to put pressure on it from one side to the other to actually have the blackhead removed. So a little wiggling. I like it so far, and I would prefer this device over the traditional two finger squeeze.</li>
            <li> Nice product and affordable. The larger hole is nice for me because it helps me get rid of problematic black heads or even white heads if I have to. Just make sure to sanitize it before and after each use. The smaller end was useless to me because of my large pores, but I can see how someone would have the opposite problem. It also feels good in the hand, not like some cheaper products I&#x27;ve tried. Works as advertised, nothing special though.</li>
            <li> I too was looking to replace the discontinued Revlon version of this blackhead remover and this is a comparable!  For those who aren&#x27;t having luck with this device it really helps to exfoliate or use a facial scrub and/or steaming open the pores before using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to remove blackheads that I wasn&#x27;t able to remove by any other methods with this remover (biore skin strips, loop removers, manually by hand).  I am about to purchase more of these just in case this becomes discontinued.  It took years for me to stumble upon this.</li>
            <li> It works but it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> I have blackheads on my back. I am partially disabled so my wife has the unenviable task of removing. When I went to see my Doctor, he recommended this device. And wow it works like a charm. My wife is happy with how easy it is to use and it&#x27;s less painful no what I mean to say is ... there is no pain!. Absolutely wonderful. ty ty ty</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good little tool that isn&#x27;t very expensive. Yeah I get zits and blackheads a lot, it&#x27;s gross but this tool helps.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get it to work on all bumps but still trying.</li>
            <li> Bought this product thinking it would be helpful.  Terrible waste of money.  First of all, it doesn&#x27;t come with directions.  Those would have been nice since I haven&#x27;t used a tool like this since the 7th grade.  I&#x27;ve ended up trying it out several times and I&#x27;ve ended up doing more harm to my skin than good.  Seems simple enough except I remember vividly that the similar design I used in middle school worked perfectly.  With the Seki model, it&#x27;s often hard to tell when you&#x27;ve had success removing a blackhead.  And I&#x27;ve ended up doing more harm to my face than good, as when you press in it often leaves a red ring around the area you are treating.  I&#x27;ve also taken out a piece of skin on my cheek.  This tool is completely worthless in my opinion.  Would not recommend!!!</li>
            <li> had lost a similar rmover years ago and was unable to find something similar until now. Works well and am satisfied</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter and she found it to me useless.  I was very disappointed!!  Can I return it??</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of the Seki nail clippers and the quality is top notch.  The quality of these is good too but not a fan of the design.  It only seems to irritate the skin where I&#x27;m trying to remove a black head and haven&#x27;t gotten it to work yet</li>
            <li> After years of using pins, loops, tissue-wrapped fingernails, or (in my darkest hours) bobby pins as a loop, I finally find this. The small end works like a charm, and even gets those awkwardly placed blackheads where the nose meets the cheek. I haven&#x27;t encountered any problems or &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; blemishes that this couldn&#x27;t handle thus far. In fact, my only dissatisfaction with this item is that I didn&#x27;t have it as a teen when the blemishes were many and I actually might have found a use for the large gauge end.</li>
            <li> Either i dont have blackheads or dont know how to hold these little things but this blackhead remover was a failure. I ended up using the sponge treatment to get rid of blackheads. Dont waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> Back side is almost flat and does not work. I would return, but too much trouble for this amount of money</li>
            <li> I think the smaller end works well.  Never used the large end. Doesn&#x27;t leave marks on my skin.  Easy to handle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a loop remover for a decade with no problems, but I thought this would be a superior product because of the design (having cups instead of loops) and because it was prominently displayed at the health food store where I bought it. I&#x27;m disappointed because it didn&#x27;t work, and I&#x27;m out $10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The holes in the cups are too large, so you can&#x27;t get enough pressure around the pore. I pushed down with varying degrees of pressure, but very little came out. I tried the rolling technique but that didn&#x27;t work either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. You can&#x27;t drag it across the skin as you can with loop extractors. You have to go one at a time. Since I have to do my entire T zone, this would take forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll stick with my loop extractor. It works wonderfully and quickly.</li>
            <li> This thing is a waste of time. All it did was cut circles in my face. I couldn&#x27;t get it to even deal with a pimple that was easy to pop. Don&#x27;t buy it. you&#x27;ll just damage your skin.</li>
            <li> I rated this instrument 5 stars because it works, has simple instructions and is constructed of quality materials. I&#x27;ve been unsuccessful with many other methods and devices to remove blackheads. This does the job for me where even the wire loop type fails. I hope it works as well for you.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m no doctor and I have no medical advice for you. But, I am happy to share if you have any questions.</li>
            <li> Item was as described and works great.</li>
            <li> Works well for my teenager.  Seems to do the job needed.  Worth the money if it keeps the teenager happy.</li>
            <li> Not quite the same as my old original revlon tool (which I have been trying to find) but by far the best replacement option I have found.</li>
            <li> Awesome! I would definitely recommen it. I have been looking a tool like this one for some years, I had one very similar who was my mom&#x27;s when she was younger, but I lost it. Finally I could find one on Amazon. : ) I know how to use it, it&#x27;s perfect for blackhead and doesn&#x27;t leave any mark in your skin!</li>
            <li> This thing appears to be useful and reading the majority of the reviews it indicates it gets the job done but it is dead wrong.  Each attempt at &amp;#34;cleaning&amp;#34; out a pore it barely gets anything.  Stick to the old fashion way and use two fingers!</li>
            <li> I love the quality of this product. Worth investing little more money than other poor qualities.&lt;br /&gt;Both size of the holes are just perfect.</li>
            <li> I never have to touch my face with my hands or nails ever thanks to this. My face feels more cleaner and never gets infections now.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my soon to be wife and she flat out did not like it. I tried it then and it actually hurt my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know it works for some, but I would be wary as Amazon does not like to refund items such as this if they do not work for you.</li>
            <li> Great product.  It has a larger hole and a smaller hole to remove blackheads.  Just apply pressure on the black head using the device, the blackhead comes right out through the hole of the product.  It was easy and convenient, and self-efficient as I didn&#x27;t need help to do it before.  This Seki Edge Blackhead Remover was great in removing that nasty blackhead stuck in my face for months.</li>
            <li> this tool really worked and was very easy to use.  no skill or practiced needed, worked great on first try.  highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Luckily, past the point where I need this thing day to day, but it&#x27;s still the best way to get those gross blackheads out of your bod.</li>
            <li> Really doesn&#x27;t work. Had a different brand in the past and thus one didn&#x27;t compare at all. Do not buy.</li>
            <li> This is good item and worked perfectly I recommended it.the only problem is the size of whole, one of them is so big and another one is so small</li>
            <li> Good quality as described.</li>
            <li> This is a great blackhead remover, it&#x27;s a lot like an old Revlon model I had a long time ago that they quit making. I find this style to be more effective than the type with the loop on the end. It lifts whiteheads and blackheads easily and helps blemishes heal faster.</li>
            <li> No directions and it was not intuitive for me.  I just used it until I got it right, and then it worked okay.</li>
            <li> I wanted a regular, old fashioned blackhead remover and this one works perfectly.  Sometimes it is hard to remove blackheads in certain areas of the face due to different thickness of the skin or the deepness of the pore.  This works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> It works. Easy to,use, easy to clean. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay ,I use to bring it with me for on the road type of trips in the bath bag. than I got an upgarde but for the price I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!! It works perfect!!!! Easy to use and light weight. No instruction comes with the product. But it is no problem., You will figure out how to use it easily. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Very good but like others have said the large hole is a little too large. I still prefer the Revlon Blackhead Remover but those are hard to find. The craftsmanship of this product is much better than the Revlon.</li>
            <li> Tool didn&#x27;t work at all! Very unhappy!</li>
            <li> I ordered this, thought I&#x27;d have to wait a few weeks to get it and, lo and behold, it arrived almost instantly.  I couldn&#x27;t believe it.  Searched and searched for this tool to replace one that was 36 years old.  While this one is bigger than what I had, it works just fine and doesn&#x27;t get lost as easily. So thankful to have found it, and received it!</li>
            <li> This is easy to use, seems well made.</li>
            <li> i used to just squeeze the blackheads out with fingers. but with this it makes it easier. you do loose sight of the blackhead when you try to put it over but not really a big deal. i like how the remover has a wider base so my finger don&#x27;t slip off and poke my face. i saw other ones that had a pencil shaped base but this one seems more safer for pressing down and my fingers not slipping off.</li>
            <li> this is a very simple device but it works well and is very high quality. small but has a heavy solid feel to it. very nice!</li>
            <li> Works but hurts when you push hard enough for it to do its job.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet but, I knew this was the one I bought years ago and had since lost. I know it works, I haven&#x27;t used it yet but has 2 different sized holes which are easy to put over the black or whitehead to remove w/a little pressure. I recommed this product. Sue</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would be more effective than it turned out to be. It works well on large pimples, but that&#x27;s about it. Didn&#x27;t really work at all for black heads or clogged pores. I still have it, just in case, but rarely use it.</li>
            <li> Deals with the problem well.  It is better than the models with one side open.</li>
            <li> I had one of these as a teenager and couldn&#x27;t remember why I got rid of it. It works very well for blackhead removal and popping a zit from time to time, however it can slightly bruise the area. I try not to use mine unless I have to because it tends to leave the area very red and bruised.</li>
            <li> this thing is amazing!!!! i couldnt live without it. get this u will not be disappointed. alot of people say it doesnt work but they probably have no clue what there doing</li>
            <li> Compared to others we have tried this one is well built, so far we have been unable to bend it and the larger width is far easier on your fingers than our older Revlon version. Holes are reasonably sized and smoothly punched so it isn&#x27;t likely to damage your skin if used properly.</li>
            <li> It works very well on my nose, forehead, shoulders, and back. Not so well on cheeks though. I have to push very hard and it leaves marks for an hour or so. The big hole works well for ingrown hairs I get from shaving, to push a little bit of the hair out so I can get at it with tweezers.</li>
            <li> works as close as any other revlon pimple remover.. wish they never discontinued the original one that they made back in the day</li>
            <li> Great product. Haven&#x27;t seen this product since I was in High School. So bought it just in case since I have seen a few black heads sometimes.</li>
