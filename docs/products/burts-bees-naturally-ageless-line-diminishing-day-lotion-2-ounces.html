    <ol>
            <li>Best lotion I have ever used.</li>
            <li>This serum is awesome.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for daytime use.</li>
            <li>Perfect for those that doesn&#x27;t like oily feeling.</li>
            <li>This is the best product ever!  </li>
            <li>It is excellent!  </li>
            <li>This is an excellent day cream.</li>
            <li>My skin looks lovely !!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m delighted with it!</li>
            <li>good!</li>
            <li>It is not for day use if you have oily skin but great for using at night.</li>
            <li>This product feels great when you put it on.</li>
            <li>After using both products, I have noticed a great difference in the softness of my skin and firmness.</li>
            <li>but I wasn&#x27;t that happy with this one.  </li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees was great for my skin, just felt like I needed to reapply after a couple of hours.</li>
            <li>Their honey taste great, they pollinate our vegetables and fruit plants, and make ageless line diminishing lotion.  </li>
            <li>It feels great and absorbs immediately.  </li>
            <li>Works great under a primer, it stays put and never leaves an oily residue.  </li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees product line is safe, it works wonderfully  </li>
            <li>The consistency is wonderful, and my favorite thing about it is the scent.  </li>
            <li>Anything I buy that is produced by Burt&#x27;s Bees is good.</li>
            <li>But when you use it alone it just does a great job all on its own.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Drawbacks: 1) This is a perfect moisturizer for warmer months, because it&#x27;s light.  </li>
            <li>My face find good.</li>
            <li>I like this one because it is somewhat mild, but works great!</li>
            <li>It does have a stong smell and once on a while it has a kind of tacky texture-not good at all for use under make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sure, the pomegranate is a good idea (an anti-oxidant with a good pedigree), sunflower seed oil, yam and para cress.</li>
            <li>Love this!  </li>
            <li>and I love the way it feels!  </li>
            <li>Bees are amazing.  </li>
            <li>The scent (I assume from the ingredients, not from added fragrance) is also nice.</li>
            <li>As soon as I stopped using it, though, I noticed that my skin didn&#x27;t look as nice as before.  </li>
            <li>This has a really nice consistency</li>
            <li>Was thrilled when I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>In fact, the scent kind of reminds my of noxema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I quickly realized that this was the reason my skin had looked so beautiful.  </li>
            <li>The light pomegranate smell was very nice though.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not oily or greasy, but just the perfect balance for the skin of an older woman.</li>
            <li>Easy to use!</li>
            <li>In all seriousness this works as good as the next wrinkle cream, smells good, feels good,</li>
            <li>Bert&#x27;s Bees&#x27; line feels very light on the skin and seems skin-friendly.   </li>
            <li>I was purchasing this item at Walgreens and then switched to Amazon for a better price.</li>
            <li>I love Burts Bees</li>
            <li>I do love Burt&#x27;s lip balms and lip shimmers, and based on favorable reviews of this Day Lotion, I have decided to give it</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>My skin is prone to being oily and with this, my skin just shines from being healthy.</li>
            <li>I wanted to like this item, but it really wasn&#x27;t that great.</li>
            <li>Just ok.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I will get more when when this bottle runs out.</li>
            <li>I love this serum and it has made a difference in my complextion.  </li>
            <li>I love most of Burt&#x27;s Bees products except this one.  </li>
            <li>It smelled better and felt better on my skin.  </li>
            <li>But, I have found Neutrogena ageless intensives that I like better.  </li>
            <li>so glad that amazon carries this product and provides prime shipping for it...</li>
            <li>but if I use this product I feel like it makes my skin more prone to break outs.</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This lotion is so light!</li>
            <li>I love this lotion and never want to be without it.  </li>
            <li>I tried it and it&#x27;s nice, not greasy, and light.</li>
            <li>cream feels very soothing, refreshing and smells great.</li>
            <li>Had run out months ago and have looked everywhere at the drugs stores for more with no luck.</li>
            <li>My face feels so much better</li>
            <li>Love this product :)</li>
            <li>I used 2 bottles of this that I purchased at a local store and noticed a wonderful difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>friend doesn&#x27;t like it,oil was on the top and cream at the bottom, lotion already separeted</li>
            <li>Moisturizes adequately, leaves face with a dewy glow, smells of pomegranate (love!)</li>
            <li>It does smell wonderful and feels good on the face, its just not good for those with oily skin.</li>
            <li>The day lotion is a great natural alternative to the brand I was using.</li>
            <li>and when I looked in the mirror, I would feel that my skin looked more fabulous than I could ever remember it looking.  </li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bee naturally ageless day lotion is great for my skin.  </li>
            <li>Good product but too much fragrance for me.</li>
            <li>Please, make your bottles more user friendly because I do like your products.</li>
            <li>but I really liked Burt&#x27;s Bees Intense Hydration Day Lotion much better</li>
            <li>Perfume is so strong that I still cannot get used to it after using it about a month.</li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s so natural, goes on smooth and soaks right in to the skin beautifully.  </li>
            <li>And as soon as I bought another bottle and started reusing it, I noticed that that beautiful glow came back.      </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad product but there are better out there.</li>
            <li>This Burt&#x27;s Bees Agelees diminishing lotion is light and dries very quickly.</li>
            <li>The lotion is fine</li>
            <li>Packaging was fine.</li>
            <li>And if you put it on while your face is a little moist (a good thing to do with any moisturizer as it locks in the moisture), you get a really nice refreshing feeling.</li>
            <li>it is paraben free.  </li>
            <li>This is a light lotion that works well under makeup.</li>
            <li>There are some milk enzymes and the product is paraben and phthalate free.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a more natural moisturizer and usually love Burt&#x27;s Bees products, so I thought I would love this one.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and wears well under make up.  </li>
            <li>i like this facial lotion, it does not go greasy on the skin, which is great for me because i have oily skin..</li>
            <li>The product is light and does moisturize my face.  </li>
            <li>The scent is light and not overbearing.  </li>
            <li>I am now wrinkle free.  </li>
            <li>i have been using Burt&#x27;s Bees Naturally Ageless Line Diminishing Day Lotion for some time now and find that it is a good product.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>Good cream with natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>herbal and fresh, not perfume-y, it soaks in and is a light lovely formula.  </li>
            <li>this burts bees is very good for people who want to keep the face young and soft ,very good for dry skin</li>
            <li>This cream is incredible - see my other raves about the Burt Bees Aging line of creams.&lt;br /&gt;It smells</li>
            <li>When I first purchased this, I used the whole bottle but didn&#x27;t think it was doing any good.  </li>
            <li>and I really do like this lotion, but the pomegranate smell is seriously strong!</li>
            <li>It goes on the skin smoothly and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>skin is naturally pretty smooth and blemish free</li>
            <li>(since there are no chemicals, sulfates, or parabens to clog my pores), my make-up goes on better and stays on longer, and my skin feels much</li>
            <li>As for the smell, it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>it absorbs quickly and keeps my skin moisturized.</li>
            <li>I really like the Burt&#x27;s Bees Naturally Ageless line Diminishing Day Lotion, it does not feel greasy and purchased at a good price.</li>
            <li>It feels light, it has a nice fruity smell, but It is moisturizing enough to handle the drier areas of my skin.</li>
            <li>Overall, didn&#x27;t do much for my skin but great customer service.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if I notice any lines diminishing, but this lotion is wonderfully light and feels great on my skin.</li>
            <li>Pretty good lotion but not same as Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge burts bees fan but the problem with this product is, if you have oily skin this will leave it more oily and gross feeling after about an hour or so of having it on.</li>
            <li>Despite the initial smell, this product is amazing and my skin is no longer peeling</li>
            <li>as a 26 year old i&#x27;d recommend this to help reduce the appearance of wrinkles and its more natural which is better for your skin</li>
            <li>It lasts quite a while and is well worth it.</li>
            <li>I love that this is light weight, it gives me enough moisture but doesn&#x27;t take forever to sink in and does not sit on my skin which is a must before applying makeup.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the scent</li>
            <li>Def worth the money.</li>
            <li>love that there are \no parabens and everything is natural.</li>
            <li>It also reduces smile lines.</li>
            <li>so naturally I just love it.</li>
            <li>I like this product in every respect, my only wish is that it contained a sunscreen of some kind.</li>
            <li>Worth a try.</li>
            <li>If you buy this lotion make sure it states 100% natural on the bottom.</li>
            <li>This is not as good as some of the other Burt&#x27;s Bees lotions.  </li>
            <li>Since I was using all these other creams at the time, and didn&#x27;t know which ones were doing me good, I didn&#x27;t repurchase this.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Saint Ives Timeless Collagen and Elastin Facial Moisturizer which costs about $10 for a large jar works much better than this for daytime, its light and just like this lotion</li>
            <li>Tried this and was lucky to be able to take it back.  </li>
            <li>It has a very strange kind of odor to it</li>
            <li>I really like this, love the all natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very light facial lotion and feels like silk going on.</li>
            <li>Nevertheless,it just seems so inappropriate and surely replaceable with something that is entirely benign.</li>
            <li>and I am pleased because this purchase actually made it to me, unlike the purchase before this one!</li>
            <li>this is my second bottle, which means i am satisfied with its performance..</li>
            <li>I like the light and non-greasy feel of this lotion and the fact that its a natural product.</li>
            <li>I really have not complaints and not overtly exciting reviews to were</li>
            <li>I recommended this to some of my male friends who absolutely LOVE it too.  </li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve said in a review about the night creme, I had spent some time researching about making my own products when I came across Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li>Most definitely!</li>
            <li>I am 44, live in a hot dry climate, and use this daily for a smooth, lovely lovely look.</li>
            <li>cream feels great, smells subtle, and works to both give 15 SPF and line smoothing.  </li>
            <li>I liked the other so much that I went out and bought it again.</li>
            <li>can also say that I agree with some of the other reviews in that this is a wonderful product that isn&#x27;t greasy or heavy feeling.</li>
            <li>Before people knew better and thought it was OK to clean wounds with something you&#x27;d clean the floor with, the unfortunate recipients would frequently die.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a good facial moisturizer for quite a while now, and I&#x27;ve been having a hard time finding products that are effective *and* natural.  </li>
            <li>Messaged customer service and received a new, fresh bottle.</li>
            <li>Has not made me break out, and my face is super sensitive.</li>
            <li>Naturally Ageless Serum which I gave 4 stars-that works very well!!  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any problems and really like how my skin looks and feels.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.....</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t like this.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to do much for my skin.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>There is no sunscreen in it (this doesn&#x27;t matter much to me, because there&#x27;s sunscreen in my mineral makeup, so doesn&#x27;t affect the rating).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>not a miraculous cream, by any means, but it doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes as much as my clarins cream tends to do.</li>
            <li>Light enough for under makeup.</li>
            <li>it was much thicker like a cream and not a lotion.  </li>
            <li>This is a very lightweight lotion.  </li>
            <li>Really like it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>my rosacea, the sensitive is definitely the better choice, however.</li>
            <li>I read as many reviews as I could both here on Amazon as well as other places online.</li>
            <li>It does absorb very quickly, but then leaves the skin feeling just as dry.</li>
            <li>the north of England, shortly after the dawn of the industrial revolution, people would clean their front door steps with something called borax.</li>
            <li>Infants are especially prone to borax poisoning, but thankfully it is no longer used to clean nurseries.</li>
            <li>My skin is extremely sensitive - and as an adult over 50 I can still have breakouts from using many facial products.  </li>
            <li>I found this about a year and a half ago, still love it, will continue to use because of the results.</li>
            <li>When you first put it on, it has a strong fragrance that dissipates within a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Price is also on the high end, would not purchase from this line again.</li>
            <li>I know its hard to get guys to use face products, but this stuff is really nice.</li>
            <li>But after 54 years I can absolutely say I do not have that problem with the Naturally Ageless lotion.  </li>
            <li>Thicker than normal.</li>
            <li>If you need a heavy cream - example, during the dry winter months or if you&#x27;re older -- than this would be a good daytime moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Received a bottle that was many years old and the lotion was breaking down.</li>
            <li>When I dropped using cosmetics with harmful or questionable ingredients, that didn&#x27;t leave too many options...and many that were left were very price.  </li>
            <li>I now like it very much and only wish it had a built in sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>At first I thought it didn&#x27;t provide enough moisture, but that changed with continued use.</li>
            <li>First, Burt&#x27;s Bees is a terrific line of skin products.  </li>
            <li>I usually like most of Burt&#x27;s Bees products</li>
            <li>I bought 6 bottles , 3 are new boxes, 3 are old boxes .</li>
            <li>It has definitely made my face look younger, and it smells soft and gently sweet but not overdone.</li>
            <li>I like the it OK, but am not completely thrilled with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I like the idea of a natural product that is NOT tested on animals.   </li>
            <li>So, I guess they are selling their old shelf leftovers.</li>
            <li>I have used Burts Bees Naturally Ageless Lotion for 4 years.  </li>
            <li>Additionally this lotion makes my skin feel smooth without heavy coverage.  </li>
            <li>It makes my face feel so soft</li>
            <li>I will be buying from Burt&#x27;s Bees often..love their natural products</li>
            <li>is all natural.</li>
            <li>This dries really fast and just leaves enough smoothness on the face throughout the day!</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t express enough the lightness and that it really does last all day!</li>
            <li>100% natural</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work well on oily, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>was the one purchased online said 99% natural</li>
            <li>(I have sensitive skin).</li>
            <li>It relieves my dry facial skin and makes me feel fresh.</li>
            <li>The texture of the lotion is fine, but my main complaint is the glass bottle!</li>
            <li>(though I live in a rural area)so</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a young 50 year old female in the beauty business.  </li>
            <li>I have a different Burt&#x27;s Bees lotion in a similar bottle, and, although it didn&#x27;t break, when it is &amp;#34;all gone&amp;#34; you really have  </li>
            <li>This is a fabulous moisturizer if you need something heavier than Clinique&#x27;s yellow lotion but lighter than a heavy cream.  </li>
            <li>,no other problems inside,</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much and it will last a long time.</li>
            <li>it softens facial lines and keeps my skin soft.</li>
            <li>At first I raved about this day lotion and even my friends tried it---they started remarking how it made their skin slightly oily, then I realized over time it was making my skin oily as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Like many pump bottles, when you get near the end, it is difficult to get out.</li>
            <li>I have a tiny spatty (mini spatula) that I can barely get in there to get the rest at the bottom out, but I do get it.</li>
            <li>This burts bees naturally ageless day lotion production date is H2240901, it already almost 5 years, too long.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very lightweight, non greasy, and the smell is not very strong at all.</li>
            <li>I use it on my 2-year old daughter when her cheeks get dry</li>
            <li>No problems with break outs and get so much you can use a little under makeup or slather it on if need a beauty treat and feeling dry.&lt;br</li>

            <li> but I wasn&#x27;t that happy with this one.  </li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees was great for my skin, just felt like I needed to reapply after a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> Their honey taste great, they pollinate our vegetables and fruit plants, and make ageless line diminishing lotion.  </li>
            <li> It feels great and absorbs immediately.  </li>
            <li> Works great under a primer, it stays put and never leaves an oily residue.  </li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees product line is safe, it works wonderfully  </li>
            <li> The consistency is wonderful, and my favorite thing about it is the scent.  </li>
            <li> Anything I buy that is produced by Burt&#x27;s Bees is good.</li>
            <li> But when you use it alone it just does a great job all on its own.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Drawbacks: 1) This is a perfect moisturizer for warmer months, because it&#x27;s light.  </li>
            <li> My face find good.</li>
            <li> I like this one because it is somewhat mild, but works great!</li>
            <li> It does have a stong smell and once on a while it has a kind of tacky texture-not good at all for use under make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sure, the pomegranate is a good idea (an anti-oxidant with a good pedigree), sunflower seed oil, yam and para cress.</li>
            <li> Love this!  </li>
            <li> and I love the way it feels!  </li>
            <li> Bees are amazing.  </li>
            <li> The scent (I assume from the ingredients, not from added fragrance) is also nice.</li>
            <li> As soon as I stopped using it, though, I noticed that my skin didn&#x27;t look as nice as before.  </li>
            <li> This has a really nice consistency</li>
            <li> Was thrilled when I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> In fact, the scent kind of reminds my of noxema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I quickly realized that this was the reason my skin had looked so beautiful.  </li>
            <li> The light pomegranate smell was very nice though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not oily or greasy, but just the perfect balance for the skin of an older woman.</li>
            <li> Easy to use!</li>
            <li> In all seriousness this works as good as the next wrinkle cream, smells good, feels good,</li>
            <li> Bert&#x27;s Bees&#x27; line feels very light on the skin and seems skin-friendly.   </li>
            <li> I was purchasing this item at Walgreens and then switched to Amazon for a better price.</li>
            <li> I love Burts Bees</li>
            <li> I do love Burt&#x27;s lip balms and lip shimmers, and based on favorable reviews of this Day Lotion, I have decided to give it</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> My skin is prone to being oily and with this, my skin just shines from being healthy.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this item, but it really wasn&#x27;t that great.</li>
            <li> Just ok.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I will get more when when this bottle runs out.</li>
            <li> I love this serum and it has made a difference in my complextion.  </li>
            <li> I love most of Burt&#x27;s Bees products except this one.  </li>
            <li> It smelled better and felt better on my skin.  </li>
            <li> But, I have found Neutrogena ageless intensives that I like better.  </li>
            <li> so glad that amazon carries this product and provides prime shipping for it...</li>
            <li> but if I use this product I feel like it makes my skin more prone to break outs.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This lotion is so light!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion and never want to be without it.  </li>
            <li> I tried it and it&#x27;s nice, not greasy, and light.</li>
            <li> cream feels very soothing, refreshing and smells great.</li>
            <li> Had run out months ago and have looked everywhere at the drugs stores for more with no luck.</li>
            <li> My face feels so much better</li>
            <li> Love this product :)</li>
            <li> I used 2 bottles of this that I purchased at a local store and noticed a wonderful difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> friend doesn&#x27;t like it,oil was on the top and cream at the bottom, lotion already separeted</li>
            <li> Moisturizes adequately, leaves face with a dewy glow, smells of pomegranate (love!)</li>
            <li> It does smell wonderful and feels good on the face, its just not good for those with oily skin.</li>
            <li> The day lotion is a great natural alternative to the brand I was using.</li>
            <li> and when I looked in the mirror, I would feel that my skin looked more fabulous than I could ever remember it looking.  </li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bee naturally ageless day lotion is great for my skin.  </li>
            <li> Good product but too much fragrance for me.</li>
            <li> Please, make your bottles more user friendly because I do like your products.</li>
            <li> but I really liked Burt&#x27;s Bees Intense Hydration Day Lotion much better</li>
            <li> Perfume is so strong that I still cannot get used to it after using it about a month.</li>
            <li> Love that it&#x27;s so natural, goes on smooth and soaks right in to the skin beautifully.  </li>
            <li> And as soon as I bought another bottle and started reusing it, I noticed that that beautiful glow came back.      </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad product but there are better out there.</li>
            <li> This Burt&#x27;s Bees Agelees diminishing lotion is light and dries very quickly.</li>
            <li> The lotion is fine</li>
            <li> Packaging was fine.</li>
            <li> And if you put it on while your face is a little moist (a good thing to do with any moisturizer as it locks in the moisture), you get a really nice refreshing feeling.</li>
            <li> it is paraben free.  </li>
            <li> This is a light lotion that works well under makeup.</li>
            <li> There are some milk enzymes and the product is paraben and phthalate free.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a more natural moisturizer and usually love Burt&#x27;s Bees products, so I thought I would love this one.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and wears well under make up.  </li>
            <li> i like this facial lotion, it does not go greasy on the skin, which is great for me because i have oily skin..</li>
            <li> The product is light and does moisturize my face.  </li>
            <li> The scent is light and not overbearing.  </li>
            <li> I am now wrinkle free.  </li>
            <li> i have been using Burt&#x27;s Bees Naturally Ageless Line Diminishing Day Lotion for some time now and find that it is a good product.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> Good cream with natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> herbal and fresh, not perfume-y, it soaks in and is a light lovely formula.  </li>
            <li> this burts bees is very good for people who want to keep the face young and soft ,very good for dry skin</li>
            <li> This cream is incredible - see my other raves about the Burt Bees Aging line of creams.&lt;br /&gt;It smells</li>
            <li> When I first purchased this, I used the whole bottle but didn&#x27;t think it was doing any good.  </li>
            <li> and I really do like this lotion, but the pomegranate smell is seriously strong!</li>
            <li> It goes on the skin smoothly and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> skin is naturally pretty smooth and blemish free</li>
            <li> (since there are no chemicals, sulfates, or parabens to clog my pores), my make-up goes on better and stays on longer, and my skin feels much</li>
            <li> As for the smell, it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> it absorbs quickly and keeps my skin moisturized.</li>
            <li> I really like the Burt&#x27;s Bees Naturally Ageless line Diminishing Day Lotion, it does not feel greasy and purchased at a good price.</li>
            <li> It feels light, it has a nice fruity smell, but It is moisturizing enough to handle the drier areas of my skin.</li>
            <li> Overall, didn&#x27;t do much for my skin but great customer service.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I notice any lines diminishing, but this lotion is wonderfully light and feels great on my skin.</li>
            <li> Pretty good lotion but not same as Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge burts bees fan but the problem with this product is, if you have oily skin this will leave it more oily and gross feeling after about an hour or so of having it on.</li>
            <li> Despite the initial smell, this product is amazing and my skin is no longer peeling</li>
            <li> as a 26 year old i&#x27;d recommend this to help reduce the appearance of wrinkles and its more natural which is better for your skin</li>
            <li> It lasts quite a while and is well worth it.</li>
            <li> I love that this is light weight, it gives me enough moisture but doesn&#x27;t take forever to sink in and does not sit on my skin which is a must before applying makeup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about the scent</li>
            <li> Def worth the money.</li>
            <li> love that there are \no parabens and everything is natural.</li>
            <li> It also reduces smile lines.</li>
            <li> so naturally I just love it.</li>
            <li> I like this product in every respect, my only wish is that it contained a sunscreen of some kind.</li>
            <li> Worth a try.</li>
            <li> If you buy this lotion make sure it states 100% natural on the bottom.</li>
            <li> This is not as good as some of the other Burt&#x27;s Bees lotions.  </li>
            <li> Since I was using all these other creams at the time, and didn&#x27;t know which ones were doing me good, I didn&#x27;t repurchase this.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Saint Ives Timeless Collagen and Elastin Facial Moisturizer which costs about $10 for a large jar works much better than this for daytime, its light and just like this lotion</li>
            <li> Tried this and was lucky to be able to take it back.  </li>
            <li> It has a very strange kind of odor to it</li>
            <li> I really like this, love the all natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very light facial lotion and feels like silk going on.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless,it just seems so inappropriate and surely replaceable with something that is entirely benign.</li>
            <li> and I am pleased because this purchase actually made it to me, unlike the purchase before this one!</li>
            <li> this is my second bottle, which means i am satisfied with its performance..</li>
            <li> I like the light and non-greasy feel of this lotion and the fact that its a natural product.</li>
            <li> I really have not complaints and not overtly exciting reviews to were</li>
            <li> I recommended this to some of my male friends who absolutely LOVE it too.  </li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve said in a review about the night creme, I had spent some time researching about making my own products when I came across Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li> Most definitely!</li>
            <li> I am 44, live in a hot dry climate, and use this daily for a smooth, lovely lovely look.</li>
            <li> cream feels great, smells subtle, and works to both give 15 SPF and line smoothing.  </li>
            <li> I liked the other so much that I went out and bought it again.</li>
            <li> can also say that I agree with some of the other reviews in that this is a wonderful product that isn&#x27;t greasy or heavy feeling.</li>
            <li> Before people knew better and thought it was OK to clean wounds with something you&#x27;d clean the floor with, the unfortunate recipients would frequently die.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good facial moisturizer for quite a while now, and I&#x27;ve been having a hard time finding products that are effective *and* natural.  </li>
            <li> Messaged customer service and received a new, fresh bottle.</li>
            <li> Has not made me break out, and my face is super sensitive.</li>
            <li> Naturally Ageless Serum which I gave 4 stars-that works very well!!  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any problems and really like how my skin looks and feels.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.....</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t like this.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to do much for my skin.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> There is no sunscreen in it (this doesn&#x27;t matter much to me, because there&#x27;s sunscreen in my mineral makeup, so doesn&#x27;t affect the rating).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> not a miraculous cream, by any means, but it doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes as much as my clarins cream tends to do.</li>
            <li> Light enough for under makeup.</li>
            <li> it was much thicker like a cream and not a lotion.  </li>
            <li> This is a very lightweight lotion.  </li>
            <li> Really like it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> my rosacea, the sensitive is definitely the better choice, however.</li>
            <li> I read as many reviews as I could both here on Amazon as well as other places online.</li>
            <li> It does absorb very quickly, but then leaves the skin feeling just as dry.</li>
            <li> the north of England, shortly after the dawn of the industrial revolution, people would clean their front door steps with something called borax.</li>
            <li> Infants are especially prone to borax poisoning, but thankfully it is no longer used to clean nurseries.</li>
            <li> My skin is extremely sensitive - and as an adult over 50 I can still have breakouts from using many facial products.  </li>
            <li> I found this about a year and a half ago, still love it, will continue to use because of the results.</li>
            <li> When you first put it on, it has a strong fragrance that dissipates within a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Price is also on the high end, would not purchase from this line again.</li>
            <li> I know its hard to get guys to use face products, but this stuff is really nice.</li>
            <li> But after 54 years I can absolutely say I do not have that problem with the Naturally Ageless lotion.  </li>
            <li> Thicker than normal.</li>
            <li> If you need a heavy cream - example, during the dry winter months or if you&#x27;re older -- than this would be a good daytime moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Received a bottle that was many years old and the lotion was breaking down.</li>
            <li> When I dropped using cosmetics with harmful or questionable ingredients, that didn&#x27;t leave too many options...and many that were left were very price.  </li>
            <li> I now like it very much and only wish it had a built in sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> At first I thought it didn&#x27;t provide enough moisture, but that changed with continued use.</li>
            <li> First, Burt&#x27;s Bees is a terrific line of skin products.  </li>
            <li> I usually like most of Burt&#x27;s Bees products</li>
            <li> I bought 6 bottles , 3 are new boxes, 3 are old boxes .</li>
            <li> It has definitely made my face look younger, and it smells soft and gently sweet but not overdone.</li>
            <li> I like the it OK, but am not completely thrilled with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I like the idea of a natural product that is NOT tested on animals.   </li>
            <li> So, I guess they are selling their old shelf leftovers.</li>
            <li> I have used Burts Bees Naturally Ageless Lotion for 4 years.  </li>
            <li> Additionally this lotion makes my skin feel smooth without heavy coverage.  </li>
            <li> It makes my face feel so soft</li>
            <li> I will be buying from Burt&#x27;s Bees often..love their natural products</li>
            <li> is all natural.</li>
            <li> This dries really fast and just leaves enough smoothness on the face throughout the day!</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t express enough the lightness and that it really does last all day!</li>
            <li> 100% natural</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well on oily, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> was the one purchased online said 99% natural</li>
            <li> (I have sensitive skin).</li>
            <li> It relieves my dry facial skin and makes me feel fresh.</li>
            <li> The texture of the lotion is fine, but my main complaint is the glass bottle!</li>
            <li> (though I live in a rural area)so</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a young 50 year old female in the beauty business.  </li>
            <li> I have a different Burt&#x27;s Bees lotion in a similar bottle, and, although it didn&#x27;t break, when it is &amp;#34;all gone&amp;#34; you really have  </li>
            <li> This is a fabulous moisturizer if you need something heavier than Clinique&#x27;s yellow lotion but lighter than a heavy cream.  </li>
            <li> ,no other problems inside,</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much and it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> it softens facial lines and keeps my skin soft.</li>
            <li> At first I raved about this day lotion and even my friends tried it---they started remarking how it made their skin slightly oily, then I realized over time it was making my skin oily as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like many pump bottles, when you get near the end, it is difficult to get out.</li>
            <li> I have a tiny spatty (mini spatula) that I can barely get in there to get the rest at the bottom out, but I do get it.</li>
            <li> This burts bees naturally ageless day lotion production date is H2240901, it already almost 5 years, too long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very lightweight, non greasy, and the smell is not very strong at all.</li>
            <li> I use it on my 2-year old daughter when her cheeks get dry</li>
            <li> No problems with break outs and get so much you can use a little under makeup or slather it on if need a beauty treat and feeling dry.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After finishing the entire bottle I also noticed very little difference in the few fine lines I have on my face.</li>
            <li> what i really like, a little seems to go a long way.</li>
            <li> I have some small acne scars and one large one.  </li>
            <li> My skin is dry especially in the colder months and this relieves that dryness.  </li>
            <li> I also use the Night Cream, which as the same smell for a few minutes than is completely gone.</li>
            <li> Initial shipment came broken, amazon was prompt with replacement: new one came before I could send out the old one.</li>
            <li> stretched and sallow, as it was</li>
            <li> These products may have been in storage for too long.</li>
            <li> I have naturally dry skin and very, very sensitive skin that usually does not like anything on it.</li>
            <li> I have used it under and over other facial lotions and they work well together.  </li>
            <li> do not use any other products with it, outside of my face wash.</li>
            <li> I wish it included some salicylic acid in it like the other burt bees facial moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> and there is a noticeable difference from other facial lotions.</li>
            <li> have somewhat dry skin, and just putting this moisturizer on by itself does not seem to do the job.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not real strong through and doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> In fact it makes your skin really dry!</li>
            <li> and is comparable, in results, to the more expensive brands I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> Have only used it a short time, so not sure of results.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s faint and dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your hard earned money on this stuff because no way does it deliver anything it says it does.  </li>
            <li> I will certainly never buy it again.  </li>
            <li> It is extremely toxic.</li>
            <li> so I have considered melting it and pouring it into some other receptacle.</li>
            <li> and I got an allergic reaction all over my nose and chin due to this product.</li>
            <li> we hope the other one like it too.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel like it was actively \\&quot;doing\\&quot;</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have to store the bottle upside down when it gets to the point that the pump won;t work.</li>
            <li> and my face feel less finished.  </li>
            <li> Why did they discontinue their previous product?  </li>
            <li> use about a squirt and a half which is plenty to evenly cover my face and neck.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and started using this when I could no longer afford an expensive Pevonia roseacea cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m exploring using all their products, little by little.</li>
            <li> I mix it with a little of the night cream for colder months.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it is hard to get out the bottom part of the product when you&#x27;re down towards the bottom, so some seems wasted.</li>
            <li> I use this for daytime and nighttime since night creams tend to be too heavy for me specifically.</li>
            <li> i got hooked on this moisturizer a few years ago...</li>
            <li> I use it everyday..</li>
            <li> I tried this new product as I was having issues with dry skin (peeling on my face) with breakouts (blasted combination skin!).</li>
            <li> it starts clumping if I&#x27;m not careful to use a very thin coat.</li>
            <li> It was past its sell-by date.</li>
            <li> this time if its wrong I will send it back.</li>
            <li> It goes on very smoothly, not greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> You hardly realize you have anything on.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so hard to find.</li>
            <li> It is an expensive enough product that you don&#x27;t want to waste one drop!!!</li>
            <li> It does not go on thick or greasy.  </li>
            <li> I have weird skin, so this might work for other people.</li>
            <li> This is not nearly as good as the Radiance line in Bert&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li> However, this moisturizer is a bit too thin.</li>
            <li> The smell is not great, but its tolerable.</li>
            <li> outdated products, poor quality, going to return it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what to do with it because I hate to waste it, but I truly have no use for it either.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand throwing away all that expensive lotion</li>
            <li> Smells weird</li>
            <li> and it broke immediately, leaving me to risk cutting my fingers to get the rest of the lotion out.</li>
            <li> and she&#x27;s obsessed with it!</li>
            <li> the items I buy are so bad.</li>
            <li> I hate it and never by it anymore.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was purchasing this item at Walgreens and then switched to Amazon for a better price. I use this and the eye cream from this line. A little bit goes a very long way. I have very sensitive skin and started using this when I could no longer afford an expensive Pevonia roseacea cream. I haven&#x27;t had any problems and really like how my skin looks and feels. It&#x27;s very lightweight, non greasy, and the smell is not very strong at all. I use this for daytime and nighttime since night creams tend to be too heavy for me specifically.</li>
            <li> I love Burts Bees and I really do like this lotion, but the pomegranate smell is seriously strong! If you like that smell then I would say go for it.</li>
            <li> I really like this product..... My skin looks lovely !!! The only thing that I don&#x27;t like is the bottle that it is packaged in. Like many pump bottles, when you get near the end, it is difficult to get out. I have to store the bottle upside down when it gets to the point that the pump won;t work. I have a tiny spatty (mini spatula) that I can barely get in there to get the rest at the bottom out, but I do get it. It is an expensive enough product that you don&#x27;t want to waste one drop!!!</li>
            <li> this burts bees is very good for people who want to keep the face young and soft ,very good for dry skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge burts bees fan but the problem with this product is, if you have oily skin this will leave it more oily and gross feeling after about an hour or so of having it on. It does smell wonderful and feels good on the face, its just not good for those with oily skin. as a 26 year old i&#x27;d recommend this to help reduce the appearance of wrinkles and its more natural which is better for your skin</li>
            <li> I do love Burt&#x27;s lip balms and lip shimmers, and based on favorable reviews of this Day Lotion, I have decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;The verdict is - I like the it OK, but am not completely thrilled with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have somewhat dry skin, and just putting this moisturizer on by itself does not seem to do the job.  It does absorb very quickly, but then leaves the skin feeling just as dry. stretched and sallow, as it was before.&lt;br /&gt;What I found out helps a bit was mixing it with some additional oil (argan, avocado or coconut) to improve the moisturizing quality of it.&lt;br /&gt;It seemed to have helped, but I do not believe I will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> The day lotion is a great natural alternative to the brand I was using. At first I thought it didn&#x27;t provide enough moisture, but that changed with continued use. I was thrown off by the non-greasy feel. I now like it very much and only wish it had a built in sunscreen.</li>
            <li> These products may have been in storage for too long. The scent has almost faded.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of a natural product that is NOT tested on animals.   Bert&#x27;s Bees&#x27; line feels very light on the skin and seems skin-friendly.   I use it as an undercover for my foundation. Even can be used as a nighttime  moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t like this. I use the nighttime one instead all the time.</li>
            <li> The product had a 2005 copyright. The one I was replacing it with had 2015. So, I guess they are selling their old shelf leftovers. The product still smells and works the same though.</li>
            <li> This Burt&#x27;s Bees Agelees diminishing lotion is light and dries very quickly. It&#x27;s not oily or greasy, but just the perfect balance for the skin of an older woman. I&#x27;m delighted with it!</li>
            <li> I am 44, live in a hot dry climate, and use this daily for a smooth, lovely lovely look. It has definitely made my face look younger, and it smells soft and gently sweet but not overdone. My only complaint is that it is hard to get out the bottom part of the product when you&#x27;re down towards the bottom, so some seems wasted. I would get it in a different container if I could. But the pump does keep it sanitary. 2 pumps is all you need. It lasts quite a while and is well worth it. I love this.</li>
            <li> Best lotion I have ever used. My skin is prone to being oily and with this, my skin just shines from being healthy.</li>
            <li> Tried this and was lucky to be able to take it back.  I have oily skin and can&#x27;t tell if this was non-comedogenic but seemed to increase blackheads which I don&#x27;t need.  It does have a stong smell and once on a while it has a kind of tacky texture-not good at all for use under make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saint Ives Timeless Collagen and Elastin Facial Moisturizer which costs about $10 for a large jar works much better than this for daytime, its light and just like this lotion it is paraben free.  No problems with break outs and get so much you can use a little under makeup or slather it on if need a beauty treat and feeling dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did keep the Burts Bees Naturally Ageless Serum which I gave 4 stars-that works very well!!  It is not for day use if you have oily skin but great for using at night.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this item, but it really wasn&#x27;t that great. I didn&#x27;t feel like it was actively \\&quot;doing\\&quot; anything for my skin. Just ok.</li>
            <li> I have used Burts Bees Naturally Ageless Lotion for 4 years.  My skin is extremely sensitive - and as an adult over 50 I can still have breakouts from using many facial products.  But after 54 years I can absolutely say I do not have that problem with the Naturally Ageless lotion.  Additionally this lotion makes my skin feel smooth without heavy coverage.  Love it.</li>
            <li> i have been using Burt&#x27;s Bees Naturally Ageless Line Diminishing Day Lotion for some time now and find that it is a good product.</li>
            <li> Like it, but I wonder why unlike the rest of their products it has wornings.</li>
            <li> I like this product for a couple of reasons.  First, Burt&#x27;s Bees is a terrific line of skin products.  I like this one because it is somewhat mild, but works great!</li>
            <li> It goes on very smoothly, not greasy feeling. My face feels vey hydrated when I apply it. I will get more when when this bottle runs out.</li>
            <li> Anything I buy that is produced by Burt&#x27;s Bees is good. I&#x27;m exploring using all their products, little by little.</li>
            <li> This serum is awesome.  It does not go on thick or greasy.  It makes my face feel so soft and I can tell that it is making my complextion glow.  I can tell the difference when I forget to put it on and my face feel less finished.  I have used it under and over other facial lotions and they work well together.  But when you use it alone it just does a great job all on its own.  I love this serum and it has made a difference in my complextion.  I will be buying from Burt&#x27;s Bees often..love their natural products</li>
            <li> This is not as good as some of the other Burt&#x27;s Bees lotions.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to do much for my skin. I don&#x27;t like the scent either.</li>
            <li> I love that this is light weight, it gives me enough moisture but doesn&#x27;t take forever to sink in and does not sit on my skin which is a must before applying makeup. I&#x27;m not crazy about the scent but it&#x27;s faint and dissipates quickly. You don&#x27;t need much and it will last a long time. Def worth the money.</li>
            <li> I love most of Burt&#x27;s Bees products except this one.  Perfume is so strong that I still cannot get used to it after using it about a month.</li>
            <li> I found this about a year and a half ago, still love it, will continue to use because of the results.</li>
            <li> This is not nearly as good as the Radiance line in Bert&#x27;s Bees. I didn&#x27;t feel that it was as moisturizing.</li>
            <li> When I dropped using cosmetics with harmful or questionable ingredients, that didn&#x27;t leave too many options...and many that were left were very price.  Burt&#x27;s Bees product line is safe, it works wonderfully  and it&#x27;s affordable.</li>
            <li> This is a light lotion that works well under makeup. It hydrates and acts like a primer. I really like it. Perfect for daytime use.</li>
            <li> The overall condition of my skin has improved dramatically since starting to use this product about 2 weeks ago.  I&#x27;ve been looking for a good facial moisturizer for quite a while now, and I&#x27;ve been having a hard time finding products that are effective *and* natural.  The consistency is wonderful, and my favorite thing about it is the scent.  It smells delicious!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drawbacks: 1) This is a perfect moisturizer for warmer months, because it&#x27;s light.  I mix it with a little of the night cream for colder months.  2) There is no sunscreen in it (this doesn&#x27;t matter much to me, because there&#x27;s sunscreen in my mineral makeup, so doesn&#x27;t affect the rating).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five starts based on Burt&#x27;s Bees&#x27; promise and follow-through on this product.</li>
            <li> good! not a miraculous cream, by any means, but it doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes as much as my clarins cream tends to do. So I&#x27;ll use it for daily use.</li>
            <li> it softens facial lines and keeps my skin soft. I use it daily and like the results and the product comp. is all natural.</li>
            <li> Sure, the pomegranate is a good idea (an anti-oxidant with a good pedigree), sunflower seed oil, yam and para cress. There are some milk enzymes and the product is paraben and phthalate free. So far, so good. But why on earth is there sodium borate?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the north of England, shortly after the dawn of the industrial revolution, people would clean their front door steps with something called borax. It is also known as sodium borate, sodium tetraborate or disodium tetraborate. It is extremely toxic. Before people knew better and thought it was OK to clean wounds with something you&#x27;d clean the floor with, the unfortunate recipients would frequently die. Infants are especially prone to borax poisoning, but thankfully it is no longer used to clean nurseries. Spillage on the skin will cause blisters and red rashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can only imagine that Burt&#x27;s Bees have used such a miniscule amount of the stuff that it is rendered harmless. Nevertheless,it just seems so inappropriate and surely replaceable with something that is entirely benign.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a more natural moisturizer and usually love Burt&#x27;s Bees products, so I thought I would love this one. However, this moisturizer is a bit too thin. I have combination skin so it worked alright, but it wasn&#x27;t overly moisturizing. After finishing the entire bottle I also noticed very little difference in the few fine lines I have on my face. The light pomegranate smell was very nice though. It&#x27;s not a bad product but there are better out there.</li>
            <li> Have always like the product and I am pleased because this purchase actually made it to me, unlike the purchase before this one!</li>
            <li> It is out of date , the tag under the bottle showed &amp;#34;H3060701&amp;#34;,produced in 2007 . I bought 6 bottles , 3 are new boxes, 3 are old boxes . I will NOT buy any in this store</li>
            <li> Love this!  My skin is dry especially in the colder months and this relieves that dryness.  It goes on smooth and wears well under make up.  I will be purchasing this again!</li>
            <li> Perfect for those that doesn&#x27;t like oily feeling. This dries really fast and just leaves enough smoothness on the face throughout the day!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a young 50 year old female in the beauty business.  This is the best product ever!  Love that it&#x27;s so natural, goes on smooth and soaks right in to the skin beautifully.  A must have for daily skin care!</li>
            <li> This product feels great when you put it on. A small amount goes a long way. The one downside is the initial smell. When you first put it on, it has a strong fragrance that dissipates within a few minutes. I also use the Night Cream, which as the same smell for a few minutes than is completely gone. After using both products, I have noticed a great difference in the softness of my skin and firmness. I tried this new product as I was having issues with dry skin (peeling on my face) with breakouts (blasted combination skin!). Despite the initial smell, this product is amazing and my skin is no longer peeling and I notice that my breakouts are getting lesser and lesser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not use any other products with it, outside of my face wash. Light enough for under makeup.</li>
            <li> Not same consistency or smell as is suppose to be. Thicker than normal. No smell of pomegranate. Pretty good lotion but not same as Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li> I usually like most of Burt&#x27;s Bees products but I wasn&#x27;t that happy with this one.  The thing I don&#x27;t like about it is the scent.  It has a very strange kind of odor to it I don&#x27;t know why.  It&#x27;s suppose to help with lines and wrinkles too but I didn&#x27;t see and results in that area at all.  The lotion is fine but I really liked Burt&#x27;s Bees Intense Hydration Day Lotion much better it was much thicker like a cream and not a lotion.  It smelled better and felt better on my skin.  I will be going back to that one.</li>
            <li> The texture of the lotion is fine, but my main complaint is the glass bottle! I happened to drop mine on the counter once and it broke immediately, leaving me to risk cutting my fingers to get the rest of the lotion out. I have a different Burt&#x27;s Bees lotion in a similar bottle, and, although it didn&#x27;t break, when it is &amp;#34;all gone&amp;#34; you really have  about 1/4 of the lotion still stuck in the bottle with no way to get it out. I can&#x27;t stand throwing away all that expensive lotion so I have considered melting it and pouring it into some other receptacle. Please, make your bottles more user friendly because I do like your products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I notice any lines diminishing, but this lotion is wonderfully light and feels great on my skin. The scent (I assume from the ingredients, not from added fragrance) is also nice.</li>
            <li> When I first purchased this, I used the whole bottle but didn&#x27;t think it was doing any good.  Since I was using all these other creams at the time, and didn&#x27;t know which ones were doing me good, I didn&#x27;t repurchase this.  As soon as I stopped using it, though, I noticed that my skin didn&#x27;t look as nice as before.  Before, I had a glow and when I looked in the mirror, I would feel that my skin looked more fabulous than I could ever remember it looking.  But that went away with the bottle.  I quickly realized that this was the reason my skin had looked so beautiful.  And as soon as I bought another bottle and started reusing it, I noticed that that beautiful glow came back.      This is a very lightweight lotion.  It goes on the skin smoothly and absorbs quickly.  You hardly realize you have anything on.  And if you put it on while your face is a little moist (a good thing to do with any moisturizer as it locks in the moisture), you get a really nice refreshing feeling.</li>
            <li> i like this facial lotion, it does not go greasy on the skin, which is great for me because i have oily skin.. this is my second bottle, which means i am satisfied with its performance..</li>
            <li> never believed my mom when she said i&#x27;d want wrinkle cream at some point.  well, here i am.  so this is my alternative.  no way am i washing and moisturizing every night.  ever.  but this day applied cream feels great, smells subtle, and works to both give 15 SPF and line smoothing.  not saying i look 10 yrs younger, but maybe 3-5.  ha ha.  what i really like, a little seems to go a long way.</li>
            <li> Good product but too much fragrance for me.</li>
            <li> I didnt notice any difference in my skin at all, but I still support this company.  I have weird skin, so this might work for other people.</li>
            <li> I really like this, love the all natural ingredients.  But, I have found Neutrogena ageless intensives that I like better.  I have naturally dry skin and very, very sensitive skin that usually does not like anything on it. Burt&#x27;s Bees was great for my skin, just felt like I needed to reapply after a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> i got hooked on this moisturizer a few years ago...then suddenly i could not find it in any retail stores...so glad that amazon carries this product and provides prime shipping for it...</li>
            <li> I like the light and non-greasy feel of this lotion and the fact that its a natural product. The smell is not great, but its tolerable.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your hard earned money on this stuff because no way does it deliver anything it says it does.  In fact it makes your skin really dry!</li>
            <li> This works so well for me.  I like that it absorbs quickly and keeps my skin moisturized.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking of gifting it. I received it today. Packaging was fine. However the lotion bottle itself was shattered into pieces and unusable. I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I really like the Burt&#x27;s Bees Naturally Ageless line Diminishing Day Lotion, it does not feel greasy and purchased at a good price.</li>
            <li> At first I raved about this day lotion and even my friends tried it---they started remarking how it made their skin slightly oily, then I realized over time it was making my skin oily as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is naturally pretty smooth and blemish free so it was not a personal skin issue that I had before, but if I use this product I feel like it makes my skin more prone to break outs.I don&#x27;t plan on purchasing it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like Burts Bees products for the record, this product just did not work for me.I will probably throw it in the car to use as hand or leg lotion for on the go.</li>
            <li> It is excellent!  Really like it.&lt;br /&gt;Burts Bees never disappoints.&lt;br /&gt;I love that there are \no parabens and everything is natural.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer. It relieves my dry facial skin and makes me feel fresh. It also reduces smile lines. A must have.</li>
            <li> This lotion is so light! My skin didn&#x27;t freak out at all when I switched to it. I really can&#x27;t express enough the lightness and that it really does last all day!</li>
            <li> Smells weird and I got an allergic reaction all over my nose and chin due to this product. Gave it away to my mom, who seems to like it. Price is also on the high end, would not purchase from this line again.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion and never want to be without it.  I have some small acne scars and one large one.  Burt&#x27;s Bees Lotion truly does diminish lines and scars.</li>
            <li> The product is light and does moisturize my face.  The scent is light and not overbearing.  I wish it included some salicylic acid in it like the other burt bees facial moisturizer.  I really have not complaints and not overtly exciting reviews to were i saw a difference by using this product</li>
            <li> Has not made me break out, and my face is super sensitive. Moisturizes adequately, leaves face with a dewy glow, smells of pomegranate (love!) and is comparable, in results, to the more expensive brands I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for years.  100% natural and I love the way it feels!  Burt&#x27;s Bees - please don&#x27;t ever change the recipe!!!</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bee naturally ageless day lotion is great for my skin.  I have very sensitive skin and this works so naturally I just love it.</li>
            <li> I like this product&#x27;s effectiveness and ease of use.  After my morning shower, I just apply it on my face and I could feel it moisturize my face throughout the day.  I apply the product twice, in the morning after the shower and in the afternoon after lunch.  Easy to use!</li>
            <li> I like this product in every respect, my only wish is that it contained a sunscreen of some kind. It feels light, it has a nice fruity smell, but It is moisturizing enough to handle the drier areas of my skin. I use it on my 2-year old daughter when her cheeks get dry and she has no adverse reaction to it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the last 2 years.  I receive comments about my skin all the time since I&#x27;ve started using it.  Worth a try.</li>
            <li> I am now wrinkle free.  Bees are amazing.  Their honey taste great, they pollinate our vegetables and fruit plants, and make ageless line diminishing lotion.  In all seriousness this works as good as the next wrinkle cream, smells good, feels good, nothing to complain about.  Initial shipment came broken, amazon was prompt with replacement: new one came before I could send out the old one.</li>
            <li> I prefer the &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; cream in the jar that Burt&#x27;s Bees makes for my skin but I&#x27;ll go ahead and use the rest. It smells like sweet-tarts.&lt;br /&gt;For my rosacea, the sensitive is definitely the better choice, however.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s damage while I opened the package.</li>
            <li> the items I buy are so bad. Date of production :2009.09. It was past its sell-by date. I hate it and never by it anymore.</li>
            <li> Good cream with natural ingredients. Works on my breakout prone skin but pump stops working halfway through,&lt;br /&gt;Hence 4 stars.</li>
            <li> This is no match for the day lotion with royal jelly.  It is runny in consistency and smells like a sterilizing solution from a dental office.  There is no UV protection.  I&#x27;m not sure what to do with it because I hate to waste it, but I truly have no use for it either.  I will certainly never buy it again.  Why did they discontinue their previous product?  I&#x27;ll pay the extra to have royal jelly, the lucious feel and scent it had before, not to mention the UV protection!  Arrrgh!!  Why?</li>
            <li> This burts bees naturally ageless day lotion production date is H2240901, it already almost 5 years, too long. I think it is a Expired Products.</li>
            <li> outdated products, poor quality, going to return it</li>
            <li> After using this for a couple of days I broke out in hives and got very&lt;br /&gt;irritated.  Doesn&#x27;t work well on oily, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This has a really nice consistency but I don&#x27;t like the smell, it&#x27;s not real strong through and doesn&#x27;t last. I also find about mid day it starts clumping if I&#x27;m not careful to use a very thin coat. Have only used it a short time, so not sure of results.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous moisturizer if you need something heavier than Clinique&#x27;s yellow lotion but lighter than a heavy cream.  It feels great and absorbs immediately.  If you need a heavy cream - example, during the dry winter months or if you&#x27;re older -- than this would be a good daytime moisturizer.</li>
            <li> A got to product for my wife.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend and she&#x27;s obsessed with it! I tried it and it&#x27;s nice, not greasy, and light.</li>
            <li> This cream is incredible - see my other raves about the Burt Bees Aging line of creams.&lt;br /&gt;It smells herbal and fresh, not perfume-y, it soaks in and is a light lovely formula.  Works great under a primer, it stays put and never leaves an oily residue.  I recommended this to some of my male friends who absolutely LOVE it too.  I know its hard to get guys to use face products, but this stuff is really nice.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent day cream. The Burt&#x27;s Bees AGELESS line of products are all excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream feels very soothing, refreshing and smells great.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a while and it&#x27;s so hard to find. Had run out months ago and have looked everywhere at the drugs stores for more with no luck. Was thrilled when I found it on Amazon. It&#x27;s a very light facial lotion and feels like silk going on. My face feels so much better and there is a noticeable difference from other facial lotions. Love this product :)</li>
            <li> If you buy this lotion make sure it states 100% natural on the bottom. I used 2 bottles of this that I purchased at a local store and noticed a wonderful difference in my skin. Then I purchased some online last year. The bottle I bought online was not the same stuff. It was greasy and left my face feeling oily. I compared the bottles and the only difference was the one purchased online said 99% natural (it was also a Tester bottle). I liked the other so much that I went out and bought it again. I used the greasy stuff up on my legs after shaving. I am trying another online purchase.. this time if its wrong I will send it back. I cannot find this in stores anymore (though I live in a rural area)so I wonder if it is being discontinued.</li>
            <li> friend doesn&#x27;t like it,oil was on the top and cream at the bottom, lotion already separeted</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve said in a review about the night creme, I had spent some time researching about making my own products when I came across Burt&#x27;s Bees. I read as many reviews as I could both here on Amazon as well as other places online. This is what it claims to be: 100% natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can also say that I agree with some of the other reviews in that this is a wonderful product that isn&#x27;t greasy or heavy feeling. I&#x27;ve noticed that my imperfections aren&#x27;t as noticeable either. My pores are cleaner (since there are no chemicals, sulfates, or parabens to clog my pores), my make-up goes on better and stays on longer, and my skin feels much healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use about a squirt and a half which is plenty to evenly cover my face and neck. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with my skin breaking out or skin reactions (I have sensitive skin). As for the smell, it&#x27;s not bad. In fact, the scent kind of reminds my of noxema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend this to anyone? Most definitely!</li>
            <li> Received a bottle that was many years old and the lotion was breaking down. Messaged customer service and received a new, fresh bottle. Overall, didn&#x27;t do much for my skin but great customer service.</li>
            <li> It was the second time to buy it.But I do not know why the overpack seems not intact,no other problems inside,</li>
            <li> My face find good.I use it everyday..Because it is safe,we are all like it..we hope the other one like it too.</li>
