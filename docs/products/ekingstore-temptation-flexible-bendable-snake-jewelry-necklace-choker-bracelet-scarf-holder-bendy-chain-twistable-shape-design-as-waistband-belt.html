            <li>This is a very unusual piece of jewelry, but what an eye catcher !&lt;</li>
            <li>I think this necklace is pretty cool.</li>
            <li>Found the same one on eBay for $3 free shipping on here it ran me $20 but it was a last minute Mother&#x27;s Day gift she loved it</li>

            <li>The metal is very malleable, with a lot of stretch to the piece.  </li>
            <li>Very shiny and bright but, weak magnet.</li>
            <li>Thinner than expected, but very shiny, and not as cheap looking as I would expect for something so low priced.</li>
            <li>My 31 year old daughter is into snakes.  </li>

            <li> My 31 year old daughter is into snakes.  </li>
            <li> love this piece, lots of compliments ..wore it on a turtle neck for a night in the city to dress up a casually dressy outfit..</li>
            <li> you are a very small frame, it&#x27;s a hot belt.  </li>
            <li> The magnet attached to the head of the snake makes the piece versatile, as you can attach it to any part of the snakes body ..as for it being a loose hip belt??</li>
            <li> probably if you are a size zero or a woman with boyish hips you can hang it loose on the hips with plenty of room like in the pictures..</li>
            <li> they had it in gunmetal with dark crystals..</li>
            <li> the previous reviewer must have clicked 1star in error.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t look fake, looks like I spent a lot!!! ..</li>
            <li> And the magnet is really weak.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>

            <li> Product is cute, just smaller than what it looks in the picture. I though I was going to be able to wear it just like the picture but it wont go around the neck like that</li>
            <li> Beautify made love it</li>
            <li> It s ok for the price.  Although it looks more &amp;#34;costumish&amp;#34; for a play than a piece of jewelry.</li>

            <li> Great as a necklace. Very shiny and bright but, weak magnet. Will come off. Can&#x27;t see it being used as a belt. Still a good buy for the money.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice piece, especilly for the price.  My 31 year old daughter is into snakes.  She loved this as a CHRIST mas present!!!</li>
            <li> Better than the choker, for sure.</li>
            <li> Girlfriend loves this. It is shorter then in the picture, you can&#x27;t loop of around your neck and have it fall to your chest. It is about 32 inches. And the magnet is really weak. I changed the magnet to a stronger one and now it never undoes unless we want it to. Great buy for price</li>
            <li> This necklace  is stunning. I absolutely love it  and I received  so many compliments on the piece.  Definitely  thing about purchasing  another one  with the matching  bracelet.</li>
            <li> the previous reviewer must have clicked 1star in error. love this piece, lots of compliments ..wore it on a turtle neck for a night in the city to dress up a casually dressy outfit.. it doesn&#x27;t look fake, looks like I spent a lot!!! ..It arrived in 2days on prime membership, securely wrapped..  The magnet attached to the head of the snake makes the piece versatile, as you can attach it to any part of the snakes body ..as for it being a loose hip belt?? probably if you are a size zero or a woman with boyish hips you can hang it loose on the hips with plenty of room like in the pictures.. I&#x27;m a size 4-6 woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;wish they had it in gunmetal with dark crystals..</li>
            <li> Perfect..one of my favorite pieces..</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t flexible or bendable at all.  BOO!!!  Be honest in your descriptions!!!  BROKE upon 1st use.  Cheap and gaudy.  Double BOO!!!</li>
            <li> This item is so stylish, something different can be wear different ways, I need to buy a silver one too, I&#x27;m glad I bought this item.</li>
            <li> Found the same one on eBay for $3 free shipping on here it ran me $20 but it was a last minute Mother&#x27;s Day gift she loved it so I guess that&#x27;s all that counts.</li>
            <li> It arrived broken and what was still in tact was an extremely extremely cheap material. Not impressed.</li>
            <li> Really cute. Thinner than expected, but very shiny, and not as cheap looking as I would expect for something so low priced. Its a gift for a friend ( I kinda want to order one for me, too!) and I&#x27;m sure she will love it!.</li>
            <li> Better than expected&lt;br /&gt;I love it, it dosen&#x27;t look cheap!</li>
            <li> Very unique. For any occasion.</li>
            <li> Dont use as a belt it doesn&#x27;t hold on but makes a great neclace</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like super gold shiney.</li>
            <li> I really liked this item when I received it. It actually sparkles much more in person than it does online and looks likes it cost more than it did. It can be worn either as a necklace or a belt. I wore it as a necklace and received lots of compliments on it.</li>
            <li> Good purchase.....you will definitely have to know what to wear it with.&lt;br /&gt;If you are a very small frame, it&#x27;s a hot belt.  If not around the neck is always an eye catcher.</li>
            <li> I think this necklace is pretty cool. I bought it as part of a Halloween costume but I wear it out and even to work. It gets a lot of attention.</li>
            <li> it is not as long as it appears in the picture, but it is a cute necklace.</li>
            <li> Got it sooner than the delivery window! Not has think in the pic but its still very cute! good buy!</li>
            <li> Order was delivered 4 days before the estimated delivery dates, which was a 2 week span.  The necklace is really cool, and so versatile!  I can loop it around my neck twice, as it is shown in the picture, or drape it around my neck once to show more of a drape.  I wouldn&#x27;t wear is as a belt, though.  The metal is very malleable, with a lot of stretch to the piece.  It did arrive with some kinks, but I was able to get them out with gentle pinching.  A really fun costume piece for a great price!</li>
