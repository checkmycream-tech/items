            <li>I use it more than anything to blend blush, powder foundation and bronzer</li>
            <li>I bought this brush 2 years ago for $4 as a \\&quot;filler\\&quot; brush until I got what I thought would be a better one.</li>

            <li>I love using this for my powder foundation and contour powder blending needs.</li>
            <li>and I still love it</li>
            <li>spend more and get a better one.</li>
            <li>This one doesn&#x27;t have the tightness of most kabuki brushes, but more dense than a powder brush I suppose.</li>
            <li>Why pay more?</li>
            <li>One of my favorite brushes.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this brush. :)</li>
            <li>this is truly the bomb dot com for blending everything out its much better than a beauty blender</li>
            <li>and i really love it</li>
            <li>Love.</li>
            <li>love the Elf studio line, esp.</li>
            <li>I LOVE Elf products.</li>
            <li>I love the way it feels and how it puts on my powder/bronzer and blush.</li>
            <li>Love how my face looks after using this.</li>
            <li>so glad I ordered this vs spending 3x the amount on another kabuki brush.</li>
            <li>I love the way this brush feels on my face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love to give it a 5-star</li>
            <li>Better than MAC&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I love this item and all the others that I found.</li>
            <li>I love this brush.  </li>
            <li>so most of the powder product falls off the brush before it makes it to your face.</li>
            <li>Why pay more?</li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>Love this brush it does the job</li>

            <li>Great buy for the price, would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>They have better makeup brushes at the dollar store.</li>
            <li>Works better than most brushes I have paid a lot more money for.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re softer against your skin and more hygienic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really love this powder brush.</li>
            <li>sure if thats what they are called),</li>
            <li>It is just OK</li>
            <li>My favorite make up brush</li>
            <li>I love this face brush.</li>
            <li>Make sure you have a safe place to keep it rather than just letting it float around in your makeup bag, because that would probably damage it.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite makeup powder brush.</li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>I use a pressed powder foundation and I love that it evenly distributes onto my face.</li>
            <li>Love this brush.</li>
            <li>Studio taklon brushes are now my favorite brushes.  </li>
            <li>I like it!! :)</li>
            <li>I do love this.</li>
            <li>I SOOOO LOVE</li>
            <li>They love to spend time in the bathroom with me in the moring getti gready and while i am putting on my makeup they have nothing to do.</li>
            <li>As for me, using it as an all over face powder smoother/blender at the finish of my makeup application, I love it.</li>
            <li>Love this, needed a travel kabuki for my mineral makeup.</li>
            <li>Love the look too.</li>
            <li>I do and I love</li>
            <li>im liking it :)</li>
            <li>I was expecting a more oversized brush, but I still love it.</li>
            <li>It is gentle yet very effective.</li>
            <li>Nice brush smooth and do the job pretty good</li>
            <li>I use it to apply my elf Studio High Definition Face Powder and it goes on great.</li>
            <li>It really is amazing, easy to clean, and the bristles stay in place :)</li>
            <li>Absolutely the softest face brush I own!  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have a lot to compare to, but I think it works pretty well and is a good deal for the price.</li>
            <li>How is this so lovely and perfect at such a cheap price?</li>
            <li>For the price I will say this brush is pretty good.</li>
            <li>Love this Kabuki brush..soft and applies loose powder, or foundation powder perfectly!</li>
            <li>On products that aren&#x27;t worth two cents!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so worth it!!</li>
            <li>The best brush i have had in a very long time.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with the brush so far and haven&#x27;t experienced any shedding.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very soft and does a great job putting on my bronzer</li>
            <li>Very easy to clean too.  </li>
            <li>Provides even coverage, and is very easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li>Very soft brush, great size for packing or for your purse.  </li>
            <li>Very soft and works great.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect brush for loose powder application.  </li>
            <li>It blends my loose powder perfectly.  </li>
            <li>But if you do have loose powder, this would be GREAT!</li>
            <li>I love the finished look that this brush gives; it softens the appearance of pores and fine lines without making my makeup look cake-y.</li>
            <li>Again, (in my opinion), a soft brush is ideal for mineral powders because it facilitates full coverage and is able to pick up the powder really easily.</li>
            <li>So far very pleased with this brush!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for bronzing and blush and it&#x27;s soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really soft and great for putting on powder.</li>
            <li>Beautifully soft and does a great job.</li>
            <li>but I want my kabuki brush to be able to work with my liquid foundations and give me that light, airbrushed finish you get with a firmly-packed kabuki buffer.</li>
            <li>The brush is really soft and feels great against the skin.  </li>
            <li>Great brush for face powder but to soft for blush</li>
            <li>I am so surprised and happy</li>
            <li>the bristles are so soft that it doesn&#x27;t give great coverage.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good, it applies smoothly.</li>
            <li>Great brush, totally soft and lovely...good for blush, face powder, etc.</li>
            <li>This brush works great and is incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>I was nervous that I wouldn&#x27;t get a good product just because the price was so reasonable</li>
            <li>Soft, very nice coverage for mineral powder foundation.</li>
            <li>A true value!</li>
            <li>so soft and picks up product so well, very good product for its worth</li>
            <li>This brush creates an amazing &amp;#34;airbrushed&amp;#34; look and it is so soft and nice on your skin.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure it will clean easily.  </li>
            <li>brush is soft and gentle on the face, which is perfect for applying finishing powder.</li>
            <li>Compact size easy to store.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to carry around in your makeup purse or whateva.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>Easy to wash and easy applicator for powder.</li>
            <li>The handle is very sturdy and the brush is soft and perfect for finishing powder.</li>
            <li>i can apply my makeup easy with this brush and it does nott scratch my face or anything.  </li>
            <li>ELF has a really great product and I will be coming back for more.</li>
            <li>it&#x60;s ok but not so good for my mineral foundation, it&#x60;s too soft</li>
            <li>and it still is holding up strong.  </li>
            <li>Its so soft and feels so good on the face, i use it for the setting powder for my foundation mostly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just as good as high end products.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this brush because it had so many great reviews but within the first month of using it the synthetic bristles/hairs started to fall out.</li>
            <li>Wow.. this brush is amazing!</li>
            <li>Use it as my foundation brush with bare minerals and it works great.</li>
            <li>i bought this kabuki brush and its worth getting i love it its so soft and its great for putting foundation on</li>
            <li>it is full and it does an ok job</li>
            <li>liked it at first.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t allow the powder to sit in the fine lines on my face.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are bit soft and do not do too great of a job with my makeup to do full coverage.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s super cute.  </li>
            <li>Absolute FAVORITE face brush!</li>
            <li>Super soft and does a great job of evenly applying powder.</li>
            <li>good and Soft easy to use for foundation things only&lt;</li>
            <li>It is super soft and the price is great.</li>
            <li>All you need to know are these three things: superb quality (super soft and the dense bristles never seem to fall out), makes blending so much easier,</li>
            <li>but this little puppy is the very very best!  </li>
            <li>Perfect size for my little makeup bag.</li>
            <li>Such a great price</li>
            <li>This kabuki brush is worth more than what you pay for it.</li>
            <li>Works great, so well that I ended up buying a second one for a friend!</li>
            <li>&amp; for how cheap it is.</li>
            <li>My face makeup has never been so smooth.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Overall the poduct was great and it arrived on time.</li>
            <li>and the price is amazingly cheap.</li>
            <li>This one is fantastic.</li>
            <li>ELF products are so great for the money and a lot of them have a low toxicity rating on ewg.org/skindeep.  </li>
            <li>it gives an even smooth application...</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know how this is so cheap.</li>
            <li>it is a really nice make up brush, it works very well with foundation and a bronzer</li>
            <li>And for this cheap?</li>
            <li>I BOUGHT THIS BRUSH, ITS SO CHEAP, NEVER AGAIN.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth purchasing :)</li>
            <li>For the cost, it&#x27;s worth every penny, as most E.L.F. brushes tend to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one is fabulous.</li>
            <li>Having a spare was so important to me, i could not help buying another.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute and worth every penny</li>
            <li>Powder goes on smoothly and evenly</li>
            <li>The product is wonderful and  really works in applying my foundation to appear smooth with pores appearing smaller.  </li>
            <li>This brush is the best , it give a flawless finish , I love it , it give the same result as an expensive one</li>
            <li>I like using this to lightly apply the HD Powder as a finishing powder once all of my makeup is done.</li>
            <li>Bought this brush for blending any harsh lines after contouring and it is perfect !</li>
            <li>You know how cheap things fall apart</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so light</li>
            <li>CHEAP.</li>
            <li>And not to forget to mention how cheap it is.</li>
            <li>I like it cheap, and good.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Helps make up go on smoothly.</li>
            <li>This brush is soft and a good size.</li>
            <li>It is so soft and provides good coverage and distribution of my powder.  </li>
            <li>Nice &amp; soft :)</li>
            <li>Soft and seemingly of good quality.</li>
            <li>This brush is soft and a good size.  </li>
            <li>Good soft brush.  </li>
            <li>nice and soft, I love it</li>
            <li>But this one is nice and soft, easy to use, helps me apply my mineral makeup evenly, and generally makes my life easier, all for a great price.  </li>
            <li>Ok I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, yes I had read the other reviews but not all makeup brushes are a like, The price was cheap and these brushes are the BOMB!!!!!!!.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased this from the elf website and I am so in love with this kabuki brush!!</li>
            <li>Thanks!!!</li>
            <li>Very cute, it makes your blush look very natural.</li>
            <li>I actually love this brush even though it is pretty cheap.</li>
            <li>this brush is so soft, doesnt shed at all , works pretty wel, great price</li>
            <li>Excellent little brush!</li>
            <li>This brush is my new favorite foundation brush!</li>
            <li>Very little to no shedding of the hairs also which is wonderful!</li>
            <li>This brush is worth every cent!</li>
            <li>At first I was sure that this e.l.f.</li>
            <li>Love this thing so much!</li>
            <li>Provides awesome coverage with my bare minerals poders when I need a little more coverage than just a light brushing!  </li>
            <li>but when its clean it feels like velvet on yur skin..</li>
            <li>You just have to clean it.  </li>
            <li>Do not use anything with oil to clean your brush.  </li>
            <li>This brush is great for brushing off excess face powder or applying dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I Love, love this brush, so soft.</li>
            <li>i guess i need to try to clean the brush, but i&#x27;ve never had to clean powdered blush brushes before.)</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s VERY soft, so it keeps liquid foundation from being streaky and blends blush nicely.</li>
            <li>It arrived super fast and at a price you can&#x27;t beat!!!</li>
            <li>I was looking for a brush to apply some loose powder to my face and this had a great price.</li>
            <li>It works great with pressed and loose powder.</li>
            <li>It would probably be great at distributing a loose powder</li>
            <li>I have used on both pressed and loose powder and it works great on both.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is great for use with both compact or loose powder.</li>
            <li>Delivered right on time!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a great powder, non-shedding, brush, but it is NOT the kabuki buffer I expected.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to any woman who wants full coverage with her favorite face powder.</li>
            <li>Works great and is much softer than bare minerals for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>I love it so much.</li>
            <li>Nice kabuki brush, Soft.</li>
            <li>No complaints really :)</li>
            <li>So far none of the bristles have fallen out (I&#x27;ve been using it for months), and it&#x27;s cleaned nicely.</li>
            <li>Came in a timely manner, overall a good buy.</li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite brush.</li>
            <li>Nice and soft brush.</li>
            <li>Mine has not shed since I&#x27;ve been using it and it is still nice a soft.  </li>
            <li>that will be a true test.</li>
            <li>so I guess it&#x27;s fine-the  brush was full</li>
            <li>It feels really soft and nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really enjoyable using it, but it made my face look very cakey when I used it with my Sephora powder foundation.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li>I went on the good reviews prior to purchase as well.</li>
            <li>It is soft and a nice size.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really had any troubles with shedding, it is soft, easy to clean, and I also love that it&#x27;s inexpensive!</li>
            <li>Super soft, mineral foundation or powders goes on silky &amp; it applies nicely.</li>
            <li>I actually use this as a tool to keep my laptop screens and keyboards clean and free of dust/debris and it works amazingly.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are wonderfully soft and dense and it works perfectly for putting on loose mineral makeup, which is what I use it for.</li>
            <li>The brush is so soft, perfect for compact or loose powder.</li>
            <li>It was very cheap but of high quality.</li>
            <li>and I get complimented almost everyday about how good my make up looks!</li>
            <li>I like medium to full coverage, and I felt like I had to go back for more and more product to get it.</li>
            <li>Love this one though, cheap yet super soft and full.</li>
            <li>it does a much better job, is cheaper,and is actually one of my favorite brushes.</li>
            <li>It provides better and more even coverage than a standard brush.  </li>
            <li>Company delivery quickly..</li>
            <li>It is as good as any salon quality brush: so soft and gentle on skin and holds it&#x27;s shape.</li>
            <li>I give them a quick wash at the end of the day and they haev stood up to what my daighters have put them through.</li>
            <li>Now this brush is mostly used if you want your make up to go on lightly, to look natural.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really cute, functional and very confortable when in touch with your skin, very soft and the package is better than I imagined.</li>
            <li>Bought this for a special one who says \\&quot;This is my new favorite brush.</li>
            <li>This brush is amazing compared to the Bare Mineral&#x27;s kabuki brush.  </li>
            <li>I shall purchase two more for the other powders I own.  </li>
            <li>Very soft and makeup goes on very smooth and evenly.</li>
            <li>this cheap one is this good, the other one will be amazing.\\</li>
            <li>I use it for my everyday makeup when applying foundation, it blending the makeup beautifully</li>
            <li>Maybe a hair or two was loose at first but after that it&#x27;s been great for weeks.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve kept it clean and in great condition, but it is quote harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable size and super soft.</li>
            <li>So far, it works great with the bare minerals foundation/blush products that I use.</li>
            <li>Nice Full Brush - noticed same brush cheaper at Target.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly as everyone else said, a phenomenal soft brush at a quarter of the price others charge!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft and is pure magical!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this brush for an all over powder brush!!!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li>No fall out yet, but only used 3 times- love it!</li>
            <li>but I just love it so far!  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m willing to try it out and will update should it fall apart sooner than 6 months-1 year!</li>
            <li>I love this kabuki brush: it&#x27;s so soft and dense!</li>
            <li>love the price and super soft.</li>
            <li>It shipped fast, the product is nice, the brush is very soft and does not shed.</li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft and I liked the fact that it stands vertically which doesn&#x27;t take up much space.</li>
            <li>Its a lot smaller than you&#x27;ll think it is, but it works great and is so soft on your skin!</li>
            <li>great little brush.</li>
            <li>Great little brush for setting foundation.</li>
            <li>Great little brush for blush.</li>
            <li>Soft, with a lot of bristles, and it really buffs loose powder onto the face for flawless application.</li>
            <li>Great for traveling or everyday use</li>
            <li>A few hairs have come out, but it could of also be my dogs hair since she&#x27;s shedding, lol,</li>
            <li>Love this powder brush, so soft and does what its suppose to</li>
            <li>Lovely, soft, and while others warned that it fell apart some, I haven&#x27;t had that experience.</li>
            <li>it is so soft and so easy to clean.</li>
            <li>This is, by far, my favorite brush that I have.</li>
            <li>I had to double-check to make sure this was synthetic fur since it was so soft.  </li>
            <li>Its soft but needs more hair or something to give it a bit of firmness.</li>
            <li>Also nice a big for concealer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice soft brush for those of you who want to cover your whole cheek area and give your face a nice overall glow.</li>
            <li>It will be well worth it</li>
            <li>I would also recommend that you purchase directly from the e.l.f. website as they are always having these fantastic sales!</li>
            <li>but it seems well made and will be useful to brush on finish powder or just stroke my face .</li>
            <li>This is so soft and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>The brush top is too soft</li>
            <li>I love this brush, it is so soft and puts your make-up on evenly.</li>
            <li>soft, easy to clean, no smell</li>
            <li>Love it, I use it for my bronzer this brush is so soft</li>
            <li>It is extremely soft and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>So soft, easy to clean and maintains its bristles and shape</li>
            <li>Great for quick touch-ups and shiny noses too, because the brush makes phasing the new powder into the old makeup seamless.  </li>
            <li>This one is gentle on the face and it doesn&#x27;t leave blotches of powder I&#x27;ve experienced with other brushes.</li>
            <li>And as another reviewer mentioned, the bristles on this brush are much softer than what I remember from my original kabuki.</li>
            <li>This is the right size brush.</li>
            <li>It is also priced right.</li>
            <li>I love this brush and will never buy another $30 brush so long as this one is available.</li>
            <li>This is a great little brush!</li>
            <li>This brush is so very soft but it does not really hold any kind of powder by the time you go to put it to your face most of what wa son the the bristles has fallen off</li>
            <li>This brush is very soft and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this, the quality is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried it with wet foundation yet, but its perfect for dry powders.</li>
            <li>Super soft and light and its small size is great for taking it with u.</li>
            <li>Very soft brush, way better than the other brushes I&#x27;ve used from popular brand.</li>
            <li>Love this brush use for my finishing touches, big fluffy, great coverage.</li>
            <li>I took a risk because of the good price but so not worth it.</li>
            <li>You need a more compact group of bristles for that - in other words, a traditional foundation brush, stipple brush or the elf flat top powder brush are great options for foundation application.</li>
            <li>good- this brush is super soft, large, has densely-packed bristles, and it is only $6.00.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and don&#x27;t fall off like some brands&#x27; brushes easily do.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>Hunted for reasonable priced kabuki brush- finally found one- soft, full, not to long, and feels Great!  </li>
            <li>Soft, easy to store &amp; it does not shed</li>
            <li>Good for light coverage or thick coverage.  </li>
            <li>It really evens out the make to give a fresh and exciting look.</li>
            <li>Soft and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Super brush at a really affordable price.</li>
            <li>Applies loose makeup nicely.  </li>
            <li>No shedding and very very strurdy</li>
            <li>It seems to hold enough makeup and puts it on very smoothly.</li>
            <li>its very gentle and blends well.</li>
            <li>Bristles are fine and soft, and densely packed.</li>
            <li>This kabuki brush works great with my Bare Escentuals loose mineral powder foundation.</li>
            <li>Very soft and holds more powder than my other brushes, which I love.</li>
            <li>Which I suppose can be blamed on the inconsistency of how it&#x27;s made since I never had this problem with my first purchase.</li>
            <li>The short handle gives better control/pressure too.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t hold powder well at first.</li>
            <li>but you don&#x27;t have a big budget or just don&#x27;t want to spend more than you have to</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll be back for more for gifts.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it is supposed to do and is rather inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>The bristles really fall out of this one!</li>
            <li>It will last you a long time and it washes great.  </li>
            <li>the reviews are not wrong.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I used it as a duster for my nails, would be better if its bigger....</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s soft and it make my studio fix go on so smooth.</li>
            <li>bought it to spread translucent powder all over my face and blend my blush/bronzer, and it does that pretty well.</li>
            <li>This one is so much softer than my MAC Kabuki brush and does NOT shed!</li>
            <li>Wow, for the cost this is a fantastic brush.  </li>
            <li>This product was exactly as described.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>In the first week that I had this, it did seem to shed quite a bit, however I does not shed anymore.</li>
            <li>I kept pulling (gently!)</li>
            <li>I will definetly be buying more of this product in the future.</li>
            <li>This brush is so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Admittedly, it is my first brush of this type</li>
            <li>Thought I lost my FAVORITE blush brush on recent trip, so I resorted to trusty amazon to rescue me.</li>
            <li>and the bristles are as soft as a rabbit which makes me comfortable using on my Mac retina screen.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Be aware that there isn&#x27;t a case included or a cap attachment to protect the bristles.  </li>
            <li>It cute but not enough bristles.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not like the first Kabuki face brush I bought in here ...</li>
            <li>I find it to be super soft, large enough for my round face and the coverage of the mineral powder is excellent.  </li>
            <li>wish the handle  was a little longer, but overall, it&#x27;s a very good brush for my pressed powder.  </li>
            <li>Great kabuki brush, only had minimal shedding the first couple of times I washed it (like 2 or 3 bristles).</li>
            <li>I reallly liked this, it&#x27;s so small and cute, and soft.</li>
            <li>I love how it&#x27;s soft and not stiff.</li>
            <li>Love this magical little brush for applying my powder bronzer!!</li>
            <li>use it everyday, soft and gives great coverage with any powder I use and doesn&#x27;t make my face irritated.</li>
            <li>Works very well and offers me the light coverage that I need.</li>
            <li>Always feels soft and clean.</li>
            <li>Package was crushed a bit, but the brush was fine.&lt;br /&gt;Bristles are SUPER soft - feels amazing on your face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t put it alone in my makeup bag without the case (I like to keep my brushed super clean).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice, big, soft kabuki brush.</li>
            <li>It is just as good as something more expensive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;v bought it 3 times and they last forever if you clean them (with elf brush cleaner)!</li>
            <li>SUPER SOFT -I think I just put my pressed powder foundation on with a cloud!</li>
            <li>It is super soft and blends all makeup well, to include foundation!</li>
            <li>It applies my mineral foundation quickly and evenly and is sooooo soft!  </li>
            <li>It was just what I wanted.... super soft!  </li>
            <li>but I use it pretty much for everything, powder, bronzer and blush.</li>
            <li>Brush is soft and full.  </li>
            <li>If you are not looking for the natural look and want full coverage, then this brush is not for you.</li>
            <li>I use so much less and save money, but also it feels so amazing against my face.</li>
            <li>Super soft, airbrushed effect.</li>
            <li>It is a small, and wonderful tool for knocking off any access powder - or how you would use a wide kabuki brush.</li>
            <li>Easy to use &amp; not too big.</li>
            <li>Super soft brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super soft and does its job well.</li>
            <li>super soft.</li>
            <li>It is super soft, large, and distributes the powder well.</li>
            <li>I got this brush because the reviews all said how large in size it was.</li>
            <li>It will set the powder in those areas as well, even though it is a large headed brush.  </li>
            <li>Have both the large and travel kabukis by bareminerals</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s kind of big to use in certain areas such as my under-eye and around my nostrils, but I like it alright.</li>
            <li>This kabuki brush was just as nice as more expensive versions.  </li>
            <li>Item is ok and kind of expensive given the quality.</li>
            <li>I really like this brush.</li>
            <li>i really cannot complain n</li>
            <li>i wasn&#x27;t so gentle with this brush during this year</li>
            <li>you really can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
            <li>I had looked at others that cost as much as five times the price I paid.</li>
            <li>There was no way I spending that much.  </li>
            <li>I really like this brush now</li>
            <li>Works very well with blush.</li>
            <li>a really even application of powder.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also makes the application of foundation very even.</li>

            <li>When you wash your brushes, be gentle.  </li>
            <li>It also seems very well made.</li>

            <li>Definitely was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>Cheaper than most of the things at other stores.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it has other uses, but that&#x27;s what I use it for.  </li>
            <li>Nice thick, soft brush, small enough to fit in the larger compartments of most cosmetics organizers but full enough to do a nice job.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Small enough to not take up much space in my makeup bag, but big enough to get good coverage where I need.</li>
            <li>But other than that it&#x27;s one of my favorite kabuki brushes and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Still soft like the first time I tried it, and it still applies my cover up evenly.</li>
            <li>This brush has nice, soft bristles, and the brush itself is pretty small and compact.</li>
            <li>I was pretty surprised at the quality of this brush.</li>
            <li>Usually I will use the sponge that came in my Makeup Forever powder foundation, and it doesn&#x27;t leave this kind of look.</li>
            <li>It works VERY well for lightly spreading loose powder and making it invisible.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite makeup brush, hands down.</li>
            <li>and it still feels like new!</li>
            <li>the black stand mostly chipped it</li>
            <li>There are better items out there and probably for less $.</li>
            <li>also, and this could be more blame of the blush i&#x27;m using than the brush, but after a couple months there&#x27;s a slight odor.  </li>
            <li>The only product from elf that I would actually recommend to a friend! :)</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t a reflection on this specific product, though, as many kabuki brushes have the short handle.</li>
            <li>Fantastically soft and comfortable, but dense enough to hold the product in a controlled way and deposit it well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is amazingly soft, so soft I like to touch it to my face sometimes just for the fun of it</li>
            <li>I mainly ordered this brush because I&#x27;ve read that ELF bristles remain intact.</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s an OK brush for the price, but I&#x27;ve learned my lesson and will stick with the more expensive ones.</li>
            <li>Very soft and applies face powder very evenly over my face.</li>
            <li>I its very soft and applies the powder very well</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a big, fluffy brush that in my opinion is (by far) best for LOOSE mineral POWDER.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this elf brush to my friends.</li>
            <li>tmy high ends brushes</li>
            <li>I can highly recommend this face brush.</li>
            <li>highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend trying it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li>highly recommend</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I use it to put on the &amp;#34;elf Studio High Definition</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Makeup</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I own several other e.l.f studio brushes and I&#x27;ve never had any problems with them.</li>
            <li>I gave it to my little cousin who loves playing with makeup. :)</li>
            <li>Love this little brush</li>
            <li>Love this brush, like treating your face to little kisses.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Wet your brush and then put it in the foamy cleanser and use gentle circular motions to clean your brush.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product and reasonable price - essentially does the same job that other more expensive kabuki brushes do.</li>
            <li>better than i expected!!!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have very high hopes because it was so cheap, but I prefer it over more expensive brushes that I have purchased.</li>
            <li>Dry skin cleansers contain oily products.l to clean your brush.  </li>
            <li>I am happy because MAC face brushes are so expensive.</li>
            <li>I just wished I had purchased it from the company (ELK) directly because it is much cheaper.</li>
            <li>This brush is so soft and yet really does the job.  </li>
            <li>It is SO soft and feels absolutely luxurious against my skin.</li>
            <li>The bristles are extremely soft and flexible, and really help to evenly distribute product on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a soft silky gentle caress ....</li>
            <li>So soft and does its job very well.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how dense and how soft the bristles were, and even after my first wash, there has been no shedding.</li>
            <li>While this one is definitely budget-friendly, it works just as well as some of the most expensive brushes I own.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how smooth and soft it feels (and how I put up with a scratchy brush for so long).  </li>
            <li>I love my larger Sheer Cover Essential Beauty Kabuki brush, but needed a smaller brush that could fit in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li>I love these fluffy brushes for powdered bronzer.  </li>
            <li>I normally use the powder brush</li>
            <li>only 6 $ deffenetly worth  </li>
            <li>so my makeup looks more natural and the makeup is less</li>
            <li>This brush picks up less product and therefore gives a more natural finish.  </li>
            <li>I bought two thinking that these would be more stiff than they are.</li>
            <li>I bought this at my local store and I absolutely love it for applying my Clinique Transparency 3 Loose Blended Face Powder.  </li>
            <li>turned out too big for me, soft, although uncomfortable to wash, is versatile to squeeze a bit ... used to contour or blend ideal for applying much product.</li>
            <li>Other than that, its fantastic.</li>
            <li>I thought it might be a little larger, but was still a nice size.</li>
            <li>Love this little brush..really soft</li>
            <li>but if I ever lose it I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate buying a new one.</li>
            <li>So, i&#x27;ve been in the market for a new kabuki brush.</li>
            <li>There is sooooo much fall out; after one wash many of the bristle were going down the sink and after washing it was never the same</li>
            <li>Have had for at least a month and so far no bristles have fallen out (like many other brushes I have tried that cost more).</li>
            <li>Kabuki brushes are quite expensive and I found this reasonable and of good quality.</li>
            <li>Nice and big and fluffy without the stem you don&#x27;t need.</li>
            <li>I have since found my old, favored blush brush, but it has sadly been replaced with this one.</li>
            <li>I love this little brush!</li>
            <li>A lot better than the dinky little brush that came with my foundation!</li>
            <li>I will say that I still used my scratchy flat top powder brush to pick up my loose mineral powder and pack onto my skin, then used this brush buff and blend in.  </li>
            <li>Much cheaper than Bare Minerals kabuki brush which costs $26 compared to this at $6!</li>
            <li>this is so very soft.</li>
            <li>VERY soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>The hair on this kabuki brush is very, very soft.</li>
            <li>Very soft, bristle height distributed well for coverage.</li>
            <li>but the brush was still usable as it was still very soft.</li>
            <li>It is very soft, but holds powder and promotes even distribution.</li>
            <li>They are very soft and seem to be made well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s very soft as well.</li>
            <li>Very soft and loaded with bristles.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft.  </li>
            <li>I use it to apply a very light powder all over, which works great as a base for eye shadow and blush, making it last longer, and I am no longer using foundation.  </li>
            <li>works well, very soft</li>
            <li>Very soft, not scratchy and performs.</li>
            <li>Very soft and inexpensive.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what expected and its so soft, also the package arrived very fast.</li>
            <li>This is my second time purchasing this exact same brush since my puppy got to the first.</li>
            <li>The first lasted me for well over 6 months with occasional cleaning although not as often as I probably should have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There have been some bristles that were bent or sticking out on the periphery, but after washing, just take a second to shape the brush back into its original conformation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This thing is so soft!</li>
            <li>The brush does not get  clumpy with the liquid makeup on your face like my old bareessentials kabuki brush!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty big brush</li>
            <li>This brush is SO soft it feels almost luxurious on my face!</li>
            <li>So today I actually used it for the first time and upon using it, the bristles fell out in clumps.</li>
            <li>Nery soft!</li>
            <li>IT HAS NOT SHED AND IT REALLLY REALLLY REALLLY SOFT!</li>
            <li>This is okay, but It&#x27;s a bit small.</li>
            <li>It eats up mineral powder but it&#x27;s so freakin soft!  </li>
            <li>And no shedding so far!</li>
            <li>So soft!</li>
            <li>I love how small and handheld it is, it makes application easier for me to control.</li>
            <li>The brush is really really soft and works like a dream!  </li>
            <li>It cleans easily and returns to it&#x27;s former softness once dry.</li>
            <li>This brush is really small and cute and incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>When the one I have gets too old I will be replacing it with the exact same one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and feels very natural.</li>
            <li>I ended up putting on a little more foundation than usual because I didn&#x27;t want to stop using it, and even with the extra foundation it still had more of an &amp;#34;airbrushed&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I just love the size of this face brush and the short dark hairs make soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>Super soft and spreads the makeup well while not absorbing.</li>
            <li>Either everything else is super over-priced, or there&#x27;s something weird going on w/ELF products :)</li>
            <li>Other than that one minor issue, this is my favorite brush.</li>
            <li>Had a little shedding after first use but seems pretty put together.  </li>
            <li>LOVE this little guy!!</li>
            <li>Light, fluffy, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin one bit.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so much better than the barely there brushes that I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.  </li>
            <li>The only problem is that the really soft brush doesn&#x27;t pick up as much color as I want</li>
            <li>Whether you use expensive powder or just the drug store brand, this brush applies the powder evenly, smoothly and thoroughly, almost giving a light &amp;#34;airbrushed&amp;#34; look.  </li>
            <li>one would go in the thrift-store donation box because it&#x27;s so soft, but I tried it and actually think it works very well.  </li>
            <li>the bristles are still so soft</li>
            <li>This brush is incrediably soft.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>Definitely comparable to the real techniques powder brush.</li>
            <li>I found this one and it works really well to set my facial powder.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft, and who can beat the price??  </li>
            <li>The bristles are soft.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and I find that this brush is soft and does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>I use it every day and have so far had no issues.</li>
            <li>It was too soft and didn&#x27;t pick up powder well.</li>
            <li>Soft and flexible.</li>
            <li>Soft and flexible.</li>
            <li>However, if you&#x27;re using liquid, cream, or &amp;#34;cakelike&amp;#34; powder, you may find that this brush is too soft to pick up or spread the makeup efficiently, so you may want to check out elf&#x27;s firmer brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is really soft.</li>
            <li>and I like that and really soft</li>
            <li>It is soft and the bristles do not shed.</li>
            <li>This studio kabuki is so soft and it makes the foundation and setting powder application a breeze.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my BE kabuki brush for ages (nearly 8 years)</li>
            <li>Doesnt scratch my face and feels as soft as fur.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t shed and is so soft.</li>
            <li>The bristles of this brush are really soft.  </li>
            <li>Its like powdering my face with a kitten or a soft, baby bunny.</li>
            <li>So far no shedding with this brush, time will tell if will hold up.</li>
            <li>Extremely soft on my face</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazingly soft and doesn&#x27;t hold on to the product after you&#x27;ve applied.</li>
            <li>Soft and blends well.</li>
            <li>As far as caring for your brushes, whether they are e.l.f.</li>
            <li>It is soft and does not sheed</li>
            <li>The bristles are extremely soft and I haven&#x27;t had any falling out on my skin either.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s really soft and holds powder well.</li>
            <li>Insanely soft.</li>
            <li>Soft but still picks up product.</li>
            <li>Really soft face brush.</li>
            <li>It is wery soft plimp and do not  irritate skin.</li>
            <li>I also like its softness and so far it doesn&#x27;t shed</li>
            <li>This brush is SO soft.</li>
            <li>This Kabuki brush is so soft.</li>
            <li>It is so soft and well made.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still amazingly soft,</li>
            <li>far I have had no shedding when I use it or wash it.</li>
            <li>The hair is no longer soft and in fact, just clump together that I can&#x27;t use it to buff powder evenly anymore</li>
            <li>The bristles seem very sturdy too, and I can tell this brush will probably last a while.</li>
            <li>This brush is is so soft and blends so well.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and it has yet to irritate it.</li>
            <li>brush has been demoted to the old brush drawer, and my hunt continues.</li>
            <li>, I think this is because of the soft brissels.</li>
            <li>The brush is so soft.</li>
            <li>too soft so it spreads out.</li>
            <li>Its soft, applies product evenly, doesnt hurt my face when I pat product onto it.</li>
            <li>I apply bronze to my face and this brush distributes it evenly and softly.</li>
            <li>Brush soft to the touch</li>
            <li>but it is so soft, distributes powders evenly, and I haven&#x27;t noticed one nylon bristle fall out yet</li>
            <li>They are so soft and they don&#x27;t shred.</li>
            <li>but so far it&#x27;s a quality brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft and so far it hasn&#x27;t shed bristles.</li>
            <li>It is extremely soft and it doesn&#x27;t cake on my makeup.</li>
            <li>Soft</li>
            <li>Did I say its SOFT</li>
            <li>I bought three of these, one for me and one for each of my young daighters.</li>
            <li>they are 2 yrs old and 10 months.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft and</li>
            <li>I love this kabuki brush - I was looking for a big fluffy brush to apply my foundation powder, bronzer, blush, etc</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok, but it&#x27;s just too big and fluffy for that purpose.  </li>
            <li>The quality seems good and I always say you can&#x27;t go wrong with a taklon brush.</li>
            <li>Super soft, high quality, and doesn&#x27;t waste powder product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d buy another one before going that route as I&#x27;m lazy but this brush is just a dream come true!</li>
            <li>It is small and compact, so it fits in your purse easily.  </li>
            <li>It would be better to spend a little more elsewhere rather than waste time plucking the loose bristles and lint rolling off the rest from your clothes, so that you don&#x27;t look like you rolled in cat hair because the bristles look like white cat hairs on your face and clothes.</li>
            <li>I use it everyday to apply my mineral powder foundation and it is large enough to help me quickly apply my makeup.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super soft, a little too soft for my taste</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell funny like other kabuki brushes and it&#x27;s very soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a quality brush that I use daily and cleanse weekly and still functions the same as when I first purchased it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the second one I&#x27;ve had, and i plan to order more as small gifts for my friends.</li>
            <li>I use bare minerals foundation and have been on the hunt for a good brush that&#x27;s not too expensive.</li>
            <li>I normally use a bigger brush like this for foundation, but this brush is too soft for that.  </li>
            <li>If you are a Clinique loose powder user, you know how cheap their brush is made; I&#x27;m referring to the one that Clinque includes in the loose powder box (it&#x27;s garbage).</li>
            <li>It is soft and not sharp at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of brushes in my day, and have reviewed several from Amazon that truly deserve their high ratings, but this one is on another level.</li>
            <li>I know I&#x27;ll use it daily for blending and would highly recommend this as a must-have for anyone who wears makeup.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small enough to fit into my makeup bag but soft and big enough to apply makeup on right.  </li>
            <li>Works very well and lasts long</li>
            <li>I usually underestimate elf because of the cheap prices.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also small so easier to fit into my makeup bag when I&#x27;m on the go.</li>
            <li>EXACTLY WHAT I EXPECTED.</li>
            <li>This little brush evenly and adequately distributes the product.</li>
            <li>The hairs are soft enough that they will not irritate sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>affordable prices!&lt;br /&gt;the brush is dense but at the same time very soft.</li>
            <li>Very soft on your skin and made with enough quality that it feels sturdy.</li>
            <li>I had something more banal in mind for this brush, until I received it!</li>
            <li>I use it all the time with my Bare Minerals foundation!</li>
            <li>Maybe it won&#x27;t last as long due to its cheap price</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s hard for me to fit this brush into my regime</li>
            <li>dollars!!!&lt;br /&gt;i gave it 2 stars because its a good brush but not worth 6.00 plus shipping when you can go to target for it for less than half on here!!!&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>But small enough to fit in my portable, purse-sized makeup bag.</li>
            <li>Affordable and comparable to the kabuki brush from bare minerals.</li>
            <li>I purchased this kabuki brush to replace the one I bought with my Bare Minerals makeup.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the same old Kabuki brush for probably 10 years now.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to use with my Mineral veil from bare essentials.  </li>
            <li>I got this brush from an old navy store, not actually off of amazon.  </li>
            <li>I just got my brush and it is so soft and big!</li>
            <li>Bought this as a replacement for a bare minerals brush.</li>
            <li>This brush is not only ridiculously soft, but it also does not shed.</li>
            <li>They barely hold their shape on the brush.</li>
            <li>Before I bought this I was using the bare escentuals $23 brush.</li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft and with proper care it should last a while..</li>
            <li>think my main concern is on proper storage, as it&#x27;s too short to just place in a standard brush holder/cup.</li>
            <li>no loose bristles-</li>
            <li>A few strands fell out but very durable and soft.</li>
            <li>I have noticed minor shedding but it is definitely not much (in 2 weeks I have lost 2-3 &amp;#34;hairs&amp;#34;)</li>
            <li>Makes you wonder why most companies sell the smaller and thin brushes all the time.</li>
            <li>It is big enough like the other ones with a much higher price.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent purchase and price.</li>
            <li>I use concealer and foundation and once those little hairs get stuck in the makeup, it could ruin a whole makeup job effort!  </li>
            <li>Smells a little funky at first.</li>
            <li>Pretty black and white bristles too.</li>
            <li>They are not only way cheaper than Bare Escentuals brushes but also nicer to use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick to the Bare Minerals kabuki in the future.</li>
            <li>It is not crazy small...</li>
            <li>I have to use them for loose powder because they are too soft.</li>
            <li>On the search for a large fluffy face brush but not wanting to splurge on a sigma or MAC brush i decided to try out ELF.</li>
            <li>Sheds a little too much for me.</li>
            <li>Also, as some other reviewers have mentioned, it&#x27;s very very soft.</li>

            <li> I use it more than anything to blend blush, powder foundation and bronzer</li>
            <li> I bought this brush 2 years ago for $4 as a \\&quot;filler\\&quot; brush until I got what I thought would be a better one.</li>

            <li> I love using this for my powder foundation and contour powder blending needs.</li>
            <li> and I still love it</li>
            <li> spend more and get a better one.</li>
            <li> This one doesn&#x27;t have the tightness of most kabuki brushes, but more dense than a powder brush I suppose.</li>
            <li> Why pay more?</li>
            <li> One of my favorite brushes.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. :)</li>
            <li> this is truly the bomb dot com for blending everything out its much better than a beauty blender</li>
            <li> and i really love it</li>
            <li> Love.</li>
            <li> love the Elf studio line, esp.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Elf products.</li>
            <li> I love the way it feels and how it puts on my powder/bronzer and blush.</li>
            <li> Love how my face looks after using this.</li>
            <li> so glad I ordered this vs spending 3x the amount on another kabuki brush.</li>
            <li> I love the way this brush feels on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love to give it a 5-star</li>
            <li> Better than MAC&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I love this item and all the others that I found.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.  </li>
            <li> so most of the powder product falls off the brush before it makes it to your face.</li>
            <li> Why pay more?</li>
            <li> I love this brush.</li>

            <li> They have better makeup brushes at the dollar store.</li>
            <li> Works better than most brushes I have paid a lot more money for.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re softer against your skin and more hygienic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really love this powder brush.</li>
            <li> sure if thats what they are called),</li>
            <li> It is just OK</li>
            <li> My favorite make up brush</li>
            <li> I love this face brush.</li>
            <li> Make sure you have a safe place to keep it rather than just letting it float around in your makeup bag, because that would probably damage it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite makeup powder brush.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.</li>
            <li> I use a pressed powder foundation and I love that it evenly distributes onto my face.</li>
            <li> Love this brush.</li>
            <li> Studio taklon brushes are now my favorite brushes.  </li>
            <li> I like it!! :)</li>
            <li> I do love this.</li>
            <li> I SOOOO LOVE</li>
            <li> They love to spend time in the bathroom with me in the moring getti gready and while i am putting on my makeup they have nothing to do.</li>
            <li> As for me, using it as an all over face powder smoother/blender at the finish of my makeup application, I love it.</li>
            <li> Love this, needed a travel kabuki for my mineral makeup.</li>
            <li> Love the look too.</li>
            <li> I do and I love</li>
            <li> im liking it :)</li>
            <li> I was expecting a more oversized brush, but I still love it.</li>
            <li> It is gentle yet very effective.</li>
            <li> Nice brush smooth and do the job pretty good</li>
            <li> I use it to apply my elf Studio High Definition Face Powder and it goes on great.</li>
            <li> It really is amazing, easy to clean, and the bristles stay in place :)</li>
            <li> Absolutely the softest face brush I own!  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have a lot to compare to, but I think it works pretty well and is a good deal for the price.</li>
            <li> How is this so lovely and perfect at such a cheap price?</li>
            <li> For the price I will say this brush is pretty good.</li>
            <li> Love this Kabuki brush..soft and applies loose powder, or foundation powder perfectly!</li>
            <li> On products that aren&#x27;t worth two cents!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so worth it!!</li>
            <li> The best brush i have had in a very long time.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with the brush so far and haven&#x27;t experienced any shedding.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very soft and does a great job putting on my bronzer</li>
            <li> Very easy to clean too.  </li>
            <li> Provides even coverage, and is very easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li> Very soft brush, great size for packing or for your purse.  </li>
            <li> Very soft and works great.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect brush for loose powder application.  </li>
            <li> It blends my loose powder perfectly.  </li>
            <li> But if you do have loose powder, this would be GREAT!</li>
            <li> I love the finished look that this brush gives; it softens the appearance of pores and fine lines without making my makeup look cake-y.</li>
            <li> Again, (in my opinion), a soft brush is ideal for mineral powders because it facilitates full coverage and is able to pick up the powder really easily.</li>
            <li> So far very pleased with this brush!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for bronzing and blush and it&#x27;s soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really soft and great for putting on powder.</li>
            <li> Beautifully soft and does a great job.</li>
            <li> but I want my kabuki brush to be able to work with my liquid foundations and give me that light, airbrushed finish you get with a firmly-packed kabuki buffer.</li>
            <li> The brush is really soft and feels great against the skin.  </li>
            <li> Great brush for face powder but to soft for blush</li>
            <li> I am so surprised and happy</li>
            <li> the bristles are so soft that it doesn&#x27;t give great coverage.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good, it applies smoothly.</li>
            <li> Great brush, totally soft and lovely...good for blush, face powder, etc.</li>
            <li> This brush works great and is incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> I was nervous that I wouldn&#x27;t get a good product just because the price was so reasonable</li>
            <li> Soft, very nice coverage for mineral powder foundation.</li>
            <li> A true value!</li>
            <li> so soft and picks up product so well, very good product for its worth</li>
            <li> This brush creates an amazing &amp;#34;airbrushed&amp;#34; look and it is so soft and nice on your skin.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure it will clean easily.  </li>
            <li> brush is soft and gentle on the face, which is perfect for applying finishing powder.</li>
            <li> Compact size easy to store.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to carry around in your makeup purse or whateva.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> Easy to wash and easy applicator for powder.</li>
            <li> The handle is very sturdy and the brush is soft and perfect for finishing powder.</li>
            <li> i can apply my makeup easy with this brush and it does nott scratch my face or anything.  </li>
            <li> ELF has a really great product and I will be coming back for more.</li>
            <li> it&#x60;s ok but not so good for my mineral foundation, it&#x60;s too soft</li>
            <li> and it still is holding up strong.  </li>
            <li> Its so soft and feels so good on the face, i use it for the setting powder for my foundation mostly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just as good as high end products.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this brush because it had so many great reviews but within the first month of using it the synthetic bristles/hairs started to fall out.</li>
            <li> Wow.. this brush is amazing!</li>
            <li> Use it as my foundation brush with bare minerals and it works great.</li>
            <li> i bought this kabuki brush and its worth getting i love it its so soft and its great for putting foundation on</li>
            <li> it is full and it does an ok job</li>
            <li> liked it at first.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t allow the powder to sit in the fine lines on my face.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are bit soft and do not do too great of a job with my makeup to do full coverage.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s super cute.  </li>
            <li> Absolute FAVORITE face brush!</li>
            <li> Super soft and does a great job of evenly applying powder.</li>
            <li> good and Soft easy to use for foundation things only&lt;</li>
            <li> It is super soft and the price is great.</li>
            <li> All you need to know are these three things: superb quality (super soft and the dense bristles never seem to fall out), makes blending so much easier,</li>
            <li> but this little puppy is the very very best!  </li>
            <li> Perfect size for my little makeup bag.</li>
            <li> Such a great price</li>
            <li> This kabuki brush is worth more than what you pay for it.</li>

            <li> ELF products are so great for the money and a lot of them have a low toxicity rating on ewg.org/skindeep.  </li>
            <li> it gives an even smooth application...</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know how this is so cheap.</li>
            <li> it is a really nice make up brush, it works very well with foundation and a bronzer</li>
            <li> And for this cheap?</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THIS BRUSH, ITS SO CHEAP, NEVER AGAIN.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth purchasing :)</li>

            <li> Powder goes on smoothly and evenly</li>

            <li> This brush is the best , it give a flawless finish , I love it , it give the same result as an expensive one</li>
            <li> I like using this to lightly apply the HD Powder as a finishing powder once all of my makeup is done.</li>
            <li> Bought this brush for blending any harsh lines after contouring and it is perfect !</li>
            <li> You know how cheap things fall apart</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so light</li>
            <li> CHEAP.</li>
            <li> And not to forget to mention how cheap it is.</li>
            <li> I like it cheap, and good.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Helps make up go on smoothly.</li>
            <li> This brush is soft and a good size.</li>

            <li> This brush is soft and a good size.  </li>
            <li> Good soft brush.  </li>
            <li> nice and soft, I love it</li>
            <li> But this one is nice and soft, easy to use, helps me apply my mineral makeup evenly, and generally makes my life easier, all for a great price.  </li>
            <li> Ok I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, yes I had read the other reviews but not all makeup brushes are a like, The price was cheap and these brushes are the BOMB!!!!!!!.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this from the elf website and I am so in love with this kabuki brush!!</li>
            <li> Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> Very cute, it makes your blush look very natural.</li>
            <li> I actually love this brush even though it is pretty cheap.</li>
            <li> this brush is so soft, doesnt shed at all , works pretty wel, great price</li>
            <li> Excellent little brush!</li>
            <li> This brush is my new favorite foundation brush!</li>
            <li> Very little to no shedding of the hairs also which is wonderful!</li>
            <li> This brush is worth every cent!</li>
            <li> At first I was sure that this e.l.f.</li>
            <li> Love this thing so much!</li>
            <li> Provides awesome coverage with my bare minerals poders when I need a little more coverage than just a light brushing!  </li>
            <li> but when its clean it feels like velvet on yur skin..</li>
            <li> You just have to clean it.  </li>
            <li> Do not use anything with oil to clean your brush.  </li>
            <li> This brush is great for brushing off excess face powder or applying dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I Love, love this brush, so soft.</li>
            <li> i guess i need to try to clean the brush, but i&#x27;ve never had to clean powdered blush brushes before.)</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s VERY soft, so it keeps liquid foundation from being streaky and blends blush nicely.</li>
            <li> It arrived super fast and at a price you can&#x27;t beat!!!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a brush to apply some loose powder to my face and this had a great price.</li>
            <li> It works great with pressed and loose powder.</li>
            <li> It would probably be great at distributing a loose powder</li>
            <li> I have used on both pressed and loose powder and it works great on both.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is great for use with both compact or loose powder.</li>
            <li> Delivered right on time!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a great powder, non-shedding, brush, but it is NOT the kabuki buffer I expected.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to any woman who wants full coverage with her favorite face powder.</li>
            <li> Works great and is much softer than bare minerals for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> I love it so much.</li>
            <li> Nice kabuki brush, Soft.</li>
            <li> No complaints really :)</li>
            <li> So far none of the bristles have fallen out (I&#x27;ve been using it for months), and it&#x27;s cleaned nicely.</li>
            <li> Came in a timely manner, overall a good buy.</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite brush.</li>
            <li> Nice and soft brush.</li>
            <li> Mine has not shed since I&#x27;ve been using it and it is still nice a soft.  </li>
            <li> that will be a true test.</li>
            <li> so I guess it&#x27;s fine-the  brush was full</li>
            <li> It feels really soft and nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really enjoyable using it, but it made my face look very cakey when I used it with my Sephora powder foundation.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li> I went on the good reviews prior to purchase as well.</li>
            <li> It is soft and a nice size.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really had any troubles with shedding, it is soft, easy to clean, and I also love that it&#x27;s inexpensive!</li>
            <li> Super soft, mineral foundation or powders goes on silky &amp; it applies nicely.</li>
            <li> I actually use this as a tool to keep my laptop screens and keyboards clean and free of dust/debris and it works amazingly.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are wonderfully soft and dense and it works perfectly for putting on loose mineral makeup, which is what I use it for.</li>
            <li> The brush is so soft, perfect for compact or loose powder.</li>
            <li> It was very cheap but of high quality.</li>
            <li> and I get complimented almost everyday about how good my make up looks!</li>
            <li> I like medium to full coverage, and I felt like I had to go back for more and more product to get it.</li>
            <li> Love this one though, cheap yet super soft and full.</li>
            <li> it does a much better job, is cheaper,and is actually one of my favorite brushes.</li>
            <li> It provides better and more even coverage than a standard brush.  </li>
            <li> Company delivery quickly..</li>
            <li> It is as good as any salon quality brush: so soft and gentle on skin and holds it&#x27;s shape.</li>
            <li> I give them a quick wash at the end of the day and they haev stood up to what my daighters have put them through.</li>
            <li> Now this brush is mostly used if you want your make up to go on lightly, to look natural.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really cute, functional and very confortable when in touch with your skin, very soft and the package is better than I imagined.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a special one who says \\&quot;This is my new favorite brush.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing compared to the Bare Mineral&#x27;s kabuki brush.  </li>
            <li> I shall purchase two more for the other powders I own.  </li>
            <li> Very soft and makeup goes on very smooth and evenly.</li>
            <li> this cheap one is this good, the other one will be amazing.\\</li>
            <li> I use it for my everyday makeup when applying foundation, it blending the makeup beautifully</li>
            <li> Maybe a hair or two was loose at first but after that it&#x27;s been great for weeks.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve kept it clean and in great condition, but it is quote harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable size and super soft.</li>
            <li> So far, it works great with the bare minerals foundation/blush products that I use.</li>
            <li> Nice Full Brush - noticed same brush cheaper at Target.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly as everyone else said, a phenomenal soft brush at a quarter of the price others charge!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft and is pure magical!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this brush for an all over powder brush!!!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> No fall out yet, but only used 3 times- love it!</li>
            <li> but I just love it so far!  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m willing to try it out and will update should it fall apart sooner than 6 months-1 year!</li>
            <li> I love this kabuki brush: it&#x27;s so soft and dense!</li>
            <li> love the price and super soft.</li>
            <li> It shipped fast, the product is nice, the brush is very soft and does not shed.</li>
            <li> The bristles are very soft and I liked the fact that it stands vertically which doesn&#x27;t take up much space.</li>
            <li> Its a lot smaller than you&#x27;ll think it is, but it works great and is so soft on your skin!</li>
            <li> great little brush.</li>
            <li> Great little brush for setting foundation.</li>
            <li> Great little brush for blush.</li>
            <li> Soft, with a lot of bristles, and it really buffs loose powder onto the face for flawless application.</li>
            <li> Great for traveling or everyday use</li>
            <li> A few hairs have come out, but it could of also be my dogs hair since she&#x27;s shedding, lol,</li>
            <li> Love this powder brush, so soft and does what its suppose to</li>
            <li> Lovely, soft, and while others warned that it fell apart some, I haven&#x27;t had that experience.</li>
            <li> it is so soft and so easy to clean.</li>
            <li> This is, by far, my favorite brush that I have.</li>
            <li> I had to double-check to make sure this was synthetic fur since it was so soft.  </li>
            <li> Its soft but needs more hair or something to give it a bit of firmness.</li>
            <li> Also nice a big for concealer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice soft brush for those of you who want to cover your whole cheek area and give your face a nice overall glow.</li>
            <li> It will be well worth it</li>
            <li> I would also recommend that you purchase directly from the e.l.f. website as they are always having these fantastic sales!</li>
            <li> but it seems well made and will be useful to brush on finish powder or just stroke my face .</li>
            <li> This is so soft and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> The brush top is too soft</li>
            <li> I love this brush, it is so soft and puts your make-up on evenly.</li>
            <li> soft, easy to clean, no smell</li>
            <li> Love it, I use it for my bronzer this brush is so soft</li>
            <li> It is extremely soft and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> So soft, easy to clean and maintains its bristles and shape</li>
            <li> Great for quick touch-ups and shiny noses too, because the brush makes phasing the new powder into the old makeup seamless.  </li>
            <li> This one is gentle on the face and it doesn&#x27;t leave blotches of powder I&#x27;ve experienced with other brushes.</li>
            <li> And as another reviewer mentioned, the bristles on this brush are much softer than what I remember from my original kabuki.</li>
            <li> This is the right size brush.</li>
            <li> It is also priced right.</li>
            <li> I love this brush and will never buy another $30 brush so long as this one is available.</li>
            <li> This is a great little brush!</li>
            <li> This brush is so very soft but it does not really hold any kind of powder by the time you go to put it to your face most of what wa son the the bristles has fallen off</li>
            <li> This brush is very soft and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this, the quality is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it with wet foundation yet, but its perfect for dry powders.</li>
            <li> Super soft and light and its small size is great for taking it with u.</li>
            <li> Very soft brush, way better than the other brushes I&#x27;ve used from popular brand.</li>
            <li> Love this brush use for my finishing touches, big fluffy, great coverage.</li>
            <li> I took a risk because of the good price but so not worth it.</li>
            <li> You need a more compact group of bristles for that - in other words, a traditional foundation brush, stipple brush or the elf flat top powder brush are great options for foundation application.</li>
            <li> good- this brush is super soft, large, has densely-packed bristles, and it is only $6.00.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and don&#x27;t fall off like some brands&#x27; brushes easily do.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> Hunted for reasonable priced kabuki brush- finally found one- soft, full, not to long, and feels Great!  </li>
            <li> Soft, easy to store &amp; it does not shed</li>
            <li> Good for light coverage or thick coverage.  </li>
            <li> It really evens out the make to give a fresh and exciting look.</li>
            <li> Soft and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Super brush at a really affordable price.</li>
            <li> Applies loose makeup nicely.  </li>
            <li> No shedding and very very strurdy</li>
            <li> It seems to hold enough makeup and puts it on very smoothly.</li>
            <li> its very gentle and blends well.</li>
            <li> Bristles are fine and soft, and densely packed.</li>
            <li> This kabuki brush works great with my Bare Escentuals loose mineral powder foundation.</li>
            <li> Very soft and holds more powder than my other brushes, which I love.</li>
            <li> Which I suppose can be blamed on the inconsistency of how it&#x27;s made since I never had this problem with my first purchase.</li>
            <li> The short handle gives better control/pressure too.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t hold powder well at first.</li>
            <li> but you don&#x27;t have a big budget or just don&#x27;t want to spend more than you have to</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll be back for more for gifts.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it is supposed to do and is rather inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> The bristles really fall out of this one!</li>
            <li> It will last you a long time and it washes great.  </li>
            <li> the reviews are not wrong.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I used it as a duster for my nails, would be better if its bigger....</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s soft and it make my studio fix go on so smooth.</li>
            <li> bought it to spread translucent powder all over my face and blend my blush/bronzer, and it does that pretty well.</li>
            <li> This one is so much softer than my MAC Kabuki brush and does NOT shed!</li>
            <li> Wow, for the cost this is a fantastic brush.  </li>
            <li> This product was exactly as described.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> In the first week that I had this, it did seem to shed quite a bit, however I does not shed anymore.</li>
            <li> I kept pulling (gently!)</li>
            <li> I will definetly be buying more of this product in the future.</li>
            <li> This brush is so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Admittedly, it is my first brush of this type</li>
            <li> Thought I lost my FAVORITE blush brush on recent trip, so I resorted to trusty amazon to rescue me.</li>
            <li> and the bristles are as soft as a rabbit which makes me comfortable using on my Mac retina screen.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Be aware that there isn&#x27;t a case included or a cap attachment to protect the bristles.  </li>
            <li> It cute but not enough bristles.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like the first Kabuki face brush I bought in here ...</li>
            <li> I find it to be super soft, large enough for my round face and the coverage of the mineral powder is excellent.  </li>
            <li> wish the handle  was a little longer, but overall, it&#x27;s a very good brush for my pressed powder.  </li>
            <li> Great kabuki brush, only had minimal shedding the first couple of times I washed it (like 2 or 3 bristles).</li>
            <li> I reallly liked this, it&#x27;s so small and cute, and soft.</li>
            <li> I love how it&#x27;s soft and not stiff.</li>
            <li> Love this magical little brush for applying my powder bronzer!!</li>
            <li> use it everyday, soft and gives great coverage with any powder I use and doesn&#x27;t make my face irritated.</li>
            <li> Works very well and offers me the light coverage that I need.</li>
            <li> Always feels soft and clean.</li>
            <li> Package was crushed a bit, but the brush was fine.&lt;br /&gt;Bristles are SUPER soft - feels amazing on your face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t put it alone in my makeup bag without the case (I like to keep my brushed super clean).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice, big, soft kabuki brush.</li>
            <li> It is just as good as something more expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;v bought it 3 times and they last forever if you clean them (with elf brush cleaner)!</li>
            <li> SUPER SOFT -I think I just put my pressed powder foundation on with a cloud!</li>
            <li> It is super soft and blends all makeup well, to include foundation!</li>
            <li> It applies my mineral foundation quickly and evenly and is sooooo soft!  </li>
            <li> It was just what I wanted.... super soft!  </li>
            <li> but I use it pretty much for everything, powder, bronzer and blush.</li>
            <li> Brush is soft and full.  </li>
            <li> If you are not looking for the natural look and want full coverage, then this brush is not for you.</li>
            <li> I use so much less and save money, but also it feels so amazing against my face.</li>
            <li> Super soft, airbrushed effect.</li>
            <li> It is a small, and wonderful tool for knocking off any access powder - or how you would use a wide kabuki brush.</li>
            <li> Easy to use &amp; not too big.</li>
            <li> Super soft brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super soft and does its job well.</li>
            <li> super soft.</li>
            <li> It is super soft, large, and distributes the powder well.</li>
            <li> I got this brush because the reviews all said how large in size it was.</li>
            <li> It will set the powder in those areas as well, even though it is a large headed brush.  </li>
            <li> Have both the large and travel kabukis by bareminerals</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s kind of big to use in certain areas such as my under-eye and around my nostrils, but I like it alright.</li>
            <li> This kabuki brush was just as nice as more expensive versions.  </li>
            <li> Item is ok and kind of expensive given the quality.</li>

            <li> i really cannot complain n</li>
            <li> i wasn&#x27;t so gentle with this brush during this year</li>
            <li> you really can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
            <li> I had looked at others that cost as much as five times the price I paid.</li>
            <li> There was no way I spending that much.  </li>
            <li> I really like this brush now</li>
            <li> Works very well with blush.</li>
            <li> a really even application of powder.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also makes the application of foundation very even.</li>

            <li> now not so much.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this foundation brush!</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t notice much hair falling out.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really use this for an even application of powder.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with the low price, but was surprised at the quality.</li>
            <li> I use the mineral powders,and this soft cute brush picks up enough powder for my face without having to dip in again.</li>
            <li> nice small makeup brush just what i was looking for good for all makeup use if looking for a small makeup brush</li>
            <li> This brush is so soft!!!</li>
            <li> As good if not better than the BareMinerals brush!  </li>
            <li> Definitely was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Cheaper than most of the things at other stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it has other uses, but that&#x27;s what I use it for.  </li>
            <li> Nice thick, soft brush, small enough to fit in the larger compartments of most cosmetics organizers but full enough to do a nice job.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Small enough to not take up much space in my makeup bag, but big enough to get good coverage where I need.</li>
            <li> But other than that it&#x27;s one of my favorite kabuki brushes and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Still soft like the first time I tried it, and it still applies my cover up evenly.</li>
            <li> This brush has nice, soft bristles, and the brush itself is pretty small and compact.</li>
            <li> I was pretty surprised at the quality of this brush.</li>
            <li> Usually I will use the sponge that came in my Makeup Forever powder foundation, and it doesn&#x27;t leave this kind of look.</li>
            <li> It works VERY well for lightly spreading loose powder and making it invisible.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite makeup brush, hands down.</li>
            <li> and it still feels like new!</li>
            <li> the black stand mostly chipped it</li>
            <li> There are better items out there and probably for less $.</li>
            <li> also, and this could be more blame of the blush i&#x27;m using than the brush, but after a couple months there&#x27;s a slight odor.  </li>
            <li> The only product from elf that I would actually recommend to a friend! :)</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a reflection on this specific product, though, as many kabuki brushes have the short handle.</li>
            <li> Fantastically soft and comfortable, but dense enough to hold the product in a controlled way and deposit it well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is amazingly soft, so soft I like to touch it to my face sometimes just for the fun of it</li>
            <li> I mainly ordered this brush because I&#x27;ve read that ELF bristles remain intact.</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s an OK brush for the price, but I&#x27;ve learned my lesson and will stick with the more expensive ones.</li>
            <li> Very soft and applies face powder very evenly over my face.</li>
            <li> I its very soft and applies the powder very well</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a big, fluffy brush that in my opinion is (by far) best for LOOSE mineral POWDER.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this elf brush to my friends.</li>
            <li> tmy high ends brushes</li>
            <li> I can highly recommend this face brush.</li>
            <li> highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend trying it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> highly recommend</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I use it to put on the &amp;#34;elf Studio High Definition</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Makeup</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I own several other e.l.f studio brushes and I&#x27;ve never had any problems with them.</li>
            <li> I gave it to my little cousin who loves playing with makeup. :)</li>
            <li> Love this little brush</li>
            <li> Love this brush, like treating your face to little kisses.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Wet your brush and then put it in the foamy cleanser and use gentle circular motions to clean your brush.  </li>
            <li> Excellent product and reasonable price - essentially does the same job that other more expensive kabuki brushes do.</li>
            <li> better than i expected!!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have very high hopes because it was so cheap, but I prefer it over more expensive brushes that I have purchased.</li>
            <li> Dry skin cleansers contain oily products.l to clean your brush.  </li>
            <li> I am happy because MAC face brushes are so expensive.</li>
            <li> I just wished I had purchased it from the company (ELK) directly because it is much cheaper.</li>
            <li> This brush is so soft and yet really does the job.  </li>
            <li> It is SO soft and feels absolutely luxurious against my skin.</li>
            <li> The bristles are extremely soft and flexible, and really help to evenly distribute product on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a soft silky gentle caress ....</li>
            <li> So soft and does its job very well.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how dense and how soft the bristles were, and even after my first wash, there has been no shedding.</li>
            <li> While this one is definitely budget-friendly, it works just as well as some of the most expensive brushes I own.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how smooth and soft it feels (and how I put up with a scratchy brush for so long).  </li>
            <li> I love my larger Sheer Cover Essential Beauty Kabuki brush, but needed a smaller brush that could fit in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li> I love these fluffy brushes for powdered bronzer.  </li>
            <li> I normally use the powder brush</li>
            <li> only 6 $ deffenetly worth  </li>
            <li> so my makeup looks more natural and the makeup is less</li>
            <li> This brush picks up less product and therefore gives a more natural finish.  </li>
            <li> I bought two thinking that these would be more stiff than they are.</li>
            <li> I bought this at my local store and I absolutely love it for applying my Clinique Transparency 3 Loose Blended Face Powder.  </li>
            <li> turned out too big for me, soft, although uncomfortable to wash, is versatile to squeeze a bit ... used to contour or blend ideal for applying much product.</li>
            <li> Other than that, its fantastic.</li>
            <li> I thought it might be a little larger, but was still a nice size.</li>
            <li> Love this little brush..really soft</li>
            <li> but if I ever lose it I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate buying a new one.</li>
            <li> So, i&#x27;ve been in the market for a new kabuki brush.</li>
            <li> There is sooooo much fall out; after one wash many of the bristle were going down the sink and after washing it was never the same</li>
            <li> Have had for at least a month and so far no bristles have fallen out (like many other brushes I have tried that cost more).</li>
            <li> Kabuki brushes are quite expensive and I found this reasonable and of good quality.</li>
            <li> Nice and big and fluffy without the stem you don&#x27;t need.</li>
            <li> I have since found my old, favored blush brush, but it has sadly been replaced with this one.</li>
            <li> I love this little brush!</li>
            <li> A lot better than the dinky little brush that came with my foundation!</li>
            <li> I will say that I still used my scratchy flat top powder brush to pick up my loose mineral powder and pack onto my skin, then used this brush buff and blend in.  </li>
            <li> Much cheaper than Bare Minerals kabuki brush which costs $26 compared to this at $6!</li>
            <li> this is so very soft.</li>
            <li> VERY soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> The hair on this kabuki brush is very, very soft.</li>
            <li> Very soft, bristle height distributed well for coverage.</li>
            <li> but the brush was still usable as it was still very soft.</li>
            <li> It is very soft, but holds powder and promotes even distribution.</li>
            <li> They are very soft and seem to be made well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s very soft as well.</li>
            <li> Very soft and loaded with bristles.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft.  </li>
            <li> I use it to apply a very light powder all over, which works great as a base for eye shadow and blush, making it last longer, and I am no longer using foundation.  </li>
            <li> works well, very soft</li>
            <li> Very soft, not scratchy and performs.</li>
            <li> Very soft and inexpensive.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what expected and its so soft, also the package arrived very fast.</li>
            <li> This is my second time purchasing this exact same brush since my puppy got to the first.</li>
            <li> The first lasted me for well over 6 months with occasional cleaning although not as often as I probably should have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There have been some bristles that were bent or sticking out on the periphery, but after washing, just take a second to shape the brush back into its original conformation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This thing is so soft!</li>
            <li> The brush does not get  clumpy with the liquid makeup on your face like my old bareessentials kabuki brush!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty big brush</li>
            <li> This brush is SO soft it feels almost luxurious on my face!</li>
            <li> So today I actually used it for the first time and upon using it, the bristles fell out in clumps.</li>
            <li> Nery soft!</li>
            <li> IT HAS NOT SHED AND IT REALLLY REALLLY REALLLY SOFT!</li>
            <li> This is okay, but It&#x27;s a bit small.</li>
            <li> It eats up mineral powder but it&#x27;s so freakin soft!  </li>
            <li> And no shedding so far!</li>
            <li> So soft!</li>
            <li> I love how small and handheld it is, it makes application easier for me to control.</li>
            <li> The brush is really really soft and works like a dream!  </li>
            <li> It cleans easily and returns to it&#x27;s former softness once dry.</li>
            <li> This brush is really small and cute and incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> When the one I have gets too old I will be replacing it with the exact same one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and feels very natural.</li>
            <li> I ended up putting on a little more foundation than usual because I didn&#x27;t want to stop using it, and even with the extra foundation it still had more of an &amp;#34;airbrushed&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I just love the size of this face brush and the short dark hairs make soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> Super soft and spreads the makeup well while not absorbing.</li>
            <li> Either everything else is super over-priced, or there&#x27;s something weird going on w/ELF products :)</li>
            <li> Other than that one minor issue, this is my favorite brush.</li>
            <li> Had a little shedding after first use but seems pretty put together.  </li>
            <li> LOVE this little guy!!</li>
            <li> Light, fluffy, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin one bit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so much better than the barely there brushes that I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.  </li>
            <li> The only problem is that the really soft brush doesn&#x27;t pick up as much color as I want</li>
            <li> Whether you use expensive powder or just the drug store brand, this brush applies the powder evenly, smoothly and thoroughly, almost giving a light &amp;#34;airbrushed&amp;#34; look.  </li>
            <li> one would go in the thrift-store donation box because it&#x27;s so soft, but I tried it and actually think it works very well.  </li>
            <li> the bristles are still so soft</li>
            <li> This brush is incrediably soft.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> Definitely comparable to the real techniques powder brush.</li>
            <li> I found this one and it works really well to set my facial powder.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft, and who can beat the price??  </li>
            <li> The bristles are soft.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> and I find that this brush is soft and does not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> I use it every day and have so far had no issues.</li>
            <li> It was too soft and didn&#x27;t pick up powder well.</li>
            <li> Soft and flexible.</li>
            <li> Soft and flexible.</li>
            <li> However, if you&#x27;re using liquid, cream, or &amp;#34;cakelike&amp;#34; powder, you may find that this brush is too soft to pick up or spread the makeup efficiently, so you may want to check out elf&#x27;s firmer brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is really soft.</li>
            <li> and I like that and really soft</li>
            <li> It is soft and the bristles do not shed.</li>
            <li> This studio kabuki is so soft and it makes the foundation and setting powder application a breeze.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my BE kabuki brush for ages (nearly 8 years)</li>
            <li> Doesnt scratch my face and feels as soft as fur.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shed and is so soft.</li>
            <li> The bristles of this brush are really soft.  </li>
            <li> Its like powdering my face with a kitten or a soft, baby bunny.</li>
            <li> So far no shedding with this brush, time will tell if will hold up.</li>
            <li> Extremely soft on my face</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazingly soft and doesn&#x27;t hold on to the product after you&#x27;ve applied.</li>
            <li> Soft and blends well.</li>
            <li> As far as caring for your brushes, whether they are e.l.f.</li>
            <li> It is soft and does not sheed</li>
            <li> The bristles are extremely soft and I haven&#x27;t had any falling out on my skin either.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s really soft and holds powder well.</li>
            <li> Insanely soft.</li>
            <li> Soft but still picks up product.</li>
            <li> Really soft face brush.</li>
            <li> It is wery soft plimp and do not  irritate skin.</li>
            <li> I also like its softness and so far it doesn&#x27;t shed</li>
            <li> This brush is SO soft.</li>
            <li> This Kabuki brush is so soft.</li>
            <li> It is so soft and well made.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still amazingly soft,</li>
            <li> far I have had no shedding when I use it or wash it.</li>
            <li> The hair is no longer soft and in fact, just clump together that I can&#x27;t use it to buff powder evenly anymore</li>
            <li> The bristles seem very sturdy too, and I can tell this brush will probably last a while.</li>
            <li> This brush is is so soft and blends so well.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and it has yet to irritate it.</li>
            <li> brush has been demoted to the old brush drawer, and my hunt continues.</li>
            <li> , I think this is because of the soft brissels.</li>
            <li> The brush is so soft.</li>
            <li> too soft so it spreads out.</li>
            <li> Its soft, applies product evenly, doesnt hurt my face when I pat product onto it.</li>
            <li> I apply bronze to my face and this brush distributes it evenly and softly.</li>
            <li> Brush soft to the touch</li>
            <li> but it is so soft, distributes powders evenly, and I haven&#x27;t noticed one nylon bristle fall out yet</li>
            <li> They are so soft and they don&#x27;t shred.</li>
            <li> but so far it&#x27;s a quality brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft and so far it hasn&#x27;t shed bristles.</li>
            <li> It is extremely soft and it doesn&#x27;t cake on my makeup.</li>
            <li> Soft</li>
            <li> Did I say its SOFT</li>
            <li> I bought three of these, one for me and one for each of my young daighters.</li>
            <li> they are 2 yrs old and 10 months.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft and</li>
            <li> I love this kabuki brush - I was looking for a big fluffy brush to apply my foundation powder, bronzer, blush, etc</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok, but it&#x27;s just too big and fluffy for that purpose.  </li>
            <li> The quality seems good and I always say you can&#x27;t go wrong with a taklon brush.</li>
            <li> Super soft, high quality, and doesn&#x27;t waste powder product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d buy another one before going that route as I&#x27;m lazy but this brush is just a dream come true!</li>
            <li> It is small and compact, so it fits in your purse easily.  </li>
            <li> It would be better to spend a little more elsewhere rather than waste time plucking the loose bristles and lint rolling off the rest from your clothes, so that you don&#x27;t look like you rolled in cat hair because the bristles look like white cat hairs on your face and clothes.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday to apply my mineral powder foundation and it is large enough to help me quickly apply my makeup.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super soft, a little too soft for my taste</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell funny like other kabuki brushes and it&#x27;s very soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a quality brush that I use daily and cleanse weekly and still functions the same as when I first purchased it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the second one I&#x27;ve had, and i plan to order more as small gifts for my friends.</li>
            <li> I use bare minerals foundation and have been on the hunt for a good brush that&#x27;s not too expensive.</li>
            <li> I normally use a bigger brush like this for foundation, but this brush is too soft for that.  </li>
            <li> If you are a Clinique loose powder user, you know how cheap their brush is made; I&#x27;m referring to the one that Clinque includes in the loose powder box (it&#x27;s garbage).</li>
            <li> It is soft and not sharp at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of brushes in my day, and have reviewed several from Amazon that truly deserve their high ratings, but this one is on another level.</li>
            <li> I know I&#x27;ll use it daily for blending and would highly recommend this as a must-have for anyone who wears makeup.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small enough to fit into my makeup bag but soft and big enough to apply makeup on right.  </li>
            <li> Works very well and lasts long</li>
            <li> I usually underestimate elf because of the cheap prices.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also small so easier to fit into my makeup bag when I&#x27;m on the go.</li>
            <li> EXACTLY WHAT I EXPECTED.</li>
            <li> This little brush evenly and adequately distributes the product.</li>
            <li> The hairs are soft enough that they will not irritate sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> affordable prices!&lt;br /&gt;the brush is dense but at the same time very soft.</li>
            <li> Very soft on your skin and made with enough quality that it feels sturdy.</li>
            <li> I had something more banal in mind for this brush, until I received it!</li>
            <li> I use it all the time with my Bare Minerals foundation!</li>
            <li> Maybe it won&#x27;t last as long due to its cheap price</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard for me to fit this brush into my regime</li>
            <li> dollars!!!&lt;br /&gt;i gave it 2 stars because its a good brush but not worth 6.00 plus shipping when you can go to target for it for less than half on here!!!&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> But small enough to fit in my portable, purse-sized makeup bag.</li>
            <li> Affordable and comparable to the kabuki brush from bare minerals.</li>
            <li> I purchased this kabuki brush to replace the one I bought with my Bare Minerals makeup.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the same old Kabuki brush for probably 10 years now.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to use with my Mineral veil from bare essentials.  </li>
            <li> I got this brush from an old navy store, not actually off of amazon.  </li>
            <li> I just got my brush and it is so soft and big!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a replacement for a bare minerals brush.</li>
            <li> This brush is not only ridiculously soft, but it also does not shed.</li>
            <li> They barely hold their shape on the brush.</li>
            <li> Before I bought this I was using the bare escentuals $23 brush.</li>
            <li> The bristles are very soft and with proper care it should last a while..</li>
            <li> think my main concern is on proper storage, as it&#x27;s too short to just place in a standard brush holder/cup.</li>
            <li> no loose bristles-</li>
            <li> A few strands fell out but very durable and soft.</li>
            <li> I have noticed minor shedding but it is definitely not much (in 2 weeks I have lost 2-3 &amp;#34;hairs&amp;#34;)</li>
            <li> Makes you wonder why most companies sell the smaller and thin brushes all the time.</li>
            <li> It is big enough like the other ones with a much higher price.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent purchase and price.</li>
            <li> I use concealer and foundation and once those little hairs get stuck in the makeup, it could ruin a whole makeup job effort!  </li>
            <li> Smells a little funky at first.</li>
            <li> Pretty black and white bristles too.</li>
            <li> They are not only way cheaper than Bare Escentuals brushes but also nicer to use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick to the Bare Minerals kabuki in the future.</li>
            <li> It is not crazy small...</li>
            <li> I have to use them for loose powder because they are too soft.</li>
            <li> On the search for a large fluffy face brush but not wanting to splurge on a sigma or MAC brush i decided to try out ELF.</li>
            <li> Sheds a little too much for me.</li>
            <li> Also, as some other reviewers have mentioned, it&#x27;s very very soft.</li>
            <li> The handle may be difficult for people to use since it&#x27;s so short/stubby, but it&#x27;s great for people with small hands (like me!)</li>
            <li> I stopped using this brush because it sheds hairs on my face and is not as soft as my other brush.</li>
            <li> Also, as someone with sensitive skin i have to be extremely carful about the tools I use.</li>
            <li> Just as good as (if not better than) expensive &amp;#34;high-end&amp;#34; brushes that shed and scratch your face up.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft but firm enough to evenly spread around powder.  </li>
            <li> Order arrived fast as usual from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I know it will last a long time</li>
            <li> I can tell it will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brushes that were more expensive than this, and they were so scratchy they left red marks on my face.  </li>
            <li> The brush is very soft, and does shed a little.  </li>
            <li> I wish it was a bit less soft...</li>
            <li> , I use it almost everyday, and so far no bristles left on my face like with some brushes.</li>
            <li> little hard to clean</li>
            <li> its so fluffy &amp; soft!</li>
            <li> I thought this was a flat long brush based on the picture.</li>
            <li> Sometimes you think because you skimp on the price that you skim on quality, and although no, it&#x27;s not a high end (or high priced) brush, it&#x27;s the one I use everyday.</li>
            <li> The other kabuki brushes that I&#x27;ve seen and felt at the local drug store and big box stores do not compare to the softness of this e.l.f. brush.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles stay put in the applicator unlike a lot of other more expensive</li>
            <li> It is small but very soft!</li>
            <li> The old one I&#x27;ve been using (made out of a somewhat stiffer bristle) tends to break off and I find little pieces of it on my face.  </li>
            <li> This brush feels soft as all get-out, but I did expect the bristles to be a little stiffer...</li>
            <li> the brush is so soft, and small enough to put in a travel bag.</li>
            <li> i bought it from a really long time</li>
            <li> The bristles are not soft at all, so I went looking for another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Idk how I went without it for so long.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have long term use comment</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s see how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> The bristles are so long they would suck up the foundation instead of putting it on my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bottom diameter of the brush is similar to a quarter or dollar-coin.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, gets the job done and isn&#x27;t rough.</li>
            <li> Lets see how long it will laast</li>
            <li> So soft but firm for some coverage.</li>
            <li> Not a huge deal, I ended up sealing it with a coat of clear nail polish and problem solved.</li>
            <li> This brush is super soft and I bought it because I saw a bunch of you tubers going crazy over it.</li>
            <li> Gently rinse in COLD water in the same way by placing it in your palm and rinse by the same circular motions until water is clear.  </li>
            <li> I actually bought this not to apply makeup but to evenly distribute this other product called PIT POWDER...</li>
            <li> Dry skin cleansers contain oily products.</li>
            <li> Update, March 4, 2013.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this brush for several weeks now a few of the bristles are starting to come loose.</li>
            <li> It feels really soft on my face and is big and fluffy!!  </li>
            <li> So soft and fluffy!</li>
            <li> Brushes I&#x27;ve used in the past felt like they were scratching my face even though they felt soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li> Too soft and too small.</li>
            <li> I had one of these brushes when I bought the Bare Minerals starter kit a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> A gazillion times softer than the kabuki brush that came with the bare minerals kit that always felt harsh on my skin.  </li>
            <li> so you won&#x27;t loose a ton of money</li>
            <li> I use it for blush, and loose powder.</li>
            <li> I use it as a loose powder brush and it doesn&#x27;t disappoint me.</li>
            <li> In fact, the package says it&#x27;s for loose powder.  </li>
            <li> Studio SPF 45 Sunscreen UVA/UVB Protection Loose Powder (83332)  </li>
            <li> I use a mineral loose powder and not all brushes work well.</li>
            <li> I used to to apply my Make up Forever HD finishing powder (loose powder).  </li>
            <li> I dont like using it for my compact powder as I feel that the hairs are too loose....</li>
            <li> Loose Face Powder.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> It seems to be well made, I haven&#x27;t had any loose bristles stick to my face, so that is a plus.</li>
            <li> Bought it to apply loose powder that i&#x27;d just bought, but i never wear loose powder, so it was like..</li>
            <li> Use with loose powder, pressed powder.  </li>
            <li> I use this for both loose and compact powder.  </li>
            <li> I like that it&#x27;s white rather than black just in case one drops out, though.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is very soft and thick and applies my makeup evenly.</li>
            <li> Very soft and thick.</li>
            <li> After owning 3 kabuki brushes, I can now say that the kabuki FACE brush has very long hairs - while it helps buffing on a larger surface, it makes buffing harder than when using kabuki brushes with shorter, tightly held</li>
            <li> The application of the actual makeup - the loose powders - is where I find it gets a little lost .....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft and small enough to carry in a small purse.</li>
            <li> Mine hasn&#x27;t shed any...but even if it does a little after washing then it was only $6</li>
            <li> My only wish is that the hairs were packed a little tighter for maximum blending.</li>
            <li> A little different than my RT powder brush, firmer.</li>
            <li> It does shed a little but not enough to ruin my makeup.</li>
            <li> But it was so soft and fluffy that it held little product causing minimal coverage.</li>
            <li> rather it were at least a third larger.</li>
            <li> It really feels no different from the expensive $30+ brushes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I expected this type of brush,&lt;br /&gt;kabuki, to be a lot</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use for liquid foundation it does not work well with wet products.</li>
            <li> I spent maybe an hour just rubbing the brush over my hands and face.</li>
            <li> Works just as expected.</li>
            <li> (The bristles weren&#x27;t wet.)</li>
            <li> am including these next few words</li>
            <li> To me though, this brush makes no sense for applying wet makeup like foundation.</li>
            <li> The base is also nice--</li>
            <li> This brush is so soft it&#x27;s almost unbelievable!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t rub it on my face like a mad woman and use light pressure.</li>
            <li> I spent $40 on my other Kabuki brushes, so this is a STEAL!&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> Plus it is easy to store d/t no long handles which can be annoying when traveling.</li>
            <li> My problem with other brushes, shedding.  </li>
            <li> I looked at L&#x27;Oreal and other over the counter brushes and e.l.f.</li>
            <li> Before putting on my face I usually brush it up against my hands to get the extra shedding off, I use this brush to apply powder for the finishing touch.  </li>
            <li> I bought this item from Amazon but the other day I found elf at a department store here in town.</li>
            <li> Im now looking at other elf products that I have not considered before</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shed like other brushes.  </li>
            <li> This is my FIRST ELF brush/product, i wanted a kabuki brush, but I didn&#x27;t want to pay the expensive prices for it.</li>
            <li> I will have to try the other brushes</li>
            <li> My powder goes on smoother with this one than any other makeup brush that I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> My other kabuki brush&#x27;s bristles were getting very rough and sharp on my face.  </li>
            <li> it will last you for at least a couple of years</li>
            <li> The only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t&#x27; have a cover besides its case</li>
            <li> Not much buffing can happen with this brush because it&#x27;s wayyyy to fluffy and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My other one was so used you couldn&#x27;t even see the label anymore!</li>
            <li> The other reviews are right--one of the softest brushes ever!  </li>
            <li> and I recommend this one over any other kabuki brush I&#x27;ve used and for the price why not!</li>
            <li> but I am having a hard time not getting all my makeup lost because it&#x27;s a little too big and too spread</li>
            <li> My only complaint that it&#x27;s difficult to hang onto with such a short handle.</li>
            <li> Be very careful while washing it, don&#x27;t get any water into the handle, it will shed!</li>
            <li> (i got it on elf&#x27;s sale for half the price))  </li>
            <li> This is a decent kabuki, not too expensive, that&#x27;s probably why the outer black handle cover came unglued, slid off at some point and got lost.</li>
            <li> but I saw a slight bit of shedding..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably never clean</li>
            <li> could be a little softer</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little &amp;#34;floppy&amp;#34; for a kabuki.</li>
            <li> Even though I like how it feels, it seems a little too fluffy.  </li>
            <li> I only use Bare Minerals foundation and their kabuki brushes are very expensive.</li>
            <li> Disappointing because I really like how it feels and works.</li>
            <li> and i use it everyday</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and don&#x27;t feel uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through a few kabuki brushes</li>
            <li> and I use it everyday with NYX HD translucent powder.</li>
            <li> what a waste.....</li>
            <li> I also like it because it enables you to apply the make up lightly (not too heavy).</li>
            <li> This was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> As soon as I got it out of the package I noticed a few strands sticking up, so I pulled them and a ton of bristles came out.</li>
            <li> ; The problem is that while putting makeup on my face with it, a few of the hairs come off and onto my face.</li>
            <li> Just a few</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for awhile and seriously haven&#x27;t noticed a single bristle fall out of it.</li>
            <li> I have owned a number of kabuki brushes over the years, ranging from very expensive to very budget-friendly.</li>
            <li> I needed a small, fluffy kabuki that did not shed for powdering...</li>
            <li> Its very fluffy, maybe too fluffy for some people.....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very little, but it does happen.</li>
            <li> Some people say it is a little too thick, but I disagree.  </li>
            <li> I was shocked, since I used it gently.</li>
            <li> I rated it 4 stars because it&#x27;s small</li>
            <li> too small</li>
            <li> so I need to put on two layers of it usually.</li>
            <li> but I feel that I am wasting powder and not getting as much of it on my face as I&#x27;d like! :(</li>
            <li> It is small and well made--does not lose its bristles.</li>
            <li> which has been my problem in the past.  </li>
            <li> brush is also a bit on the small side-</li>
            <li> /&gt;First off, this brush seems like an imitation elf, as the elf insignia on the handle is really poorly replicated.</li>
            <li> Sadly, it looses a few bristles with each use and I&#x27;m afraid it won&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Its small and the short handle was somewhat awkward.</li>
            <li> and I use it at least once a day.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it with foundation but read a negative review on that use.</li>
            <li> duh, why am i doing this?  </li>
            <li> It is thick and the bristles do not fall out.  </li>
            <li> i mean if you just have to have a kabuki it is one of the cheaper ones on the market.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is the black paint on the base of the brush started to bubble and flake off after a while.</li>
            <li> It is very difficult to gauge how big this brush is given the picture.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is probably the softest Kabuki Brush I&#x27;ve ever felt, Seriously.</li>
            <li> only bad thing I have to say about this brush is the shedding.</li>
            <li> but recently it has begun to shed in a bad way.</li>
            <li> Just not good.</li>
            <li> Not sure why it&#x27;s listed so expensively on Amazon, as it&#x27;s cheaper in both drugstores and on the e.l.f.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to return it since it&#x27;s only $6 stuff, but really disappointing at this quality!</li>
            <li> The only down side for me was horrible packaging.</li>
            <li> I currently just have it placed on its base in a drawer.</li>
            <li> Unclear logo and broken pacage.</li>
            <li> what I believe to be false advertising</li>
            <li> i read a review that suggested putting a hair tie at the base of the bristles to make it a little firmer</li>
            <li> You can never go wrong with this Kabuki brush.</li>
            <li> I always wanted one but the ones at the mall are so expensive.</li>
            <li> I bought it to use as a duster for my expensive model cars.</li>
            <li> Not absolutely perfect</li>
            <li> However, if you want value AND quality for your money, you can not go wrong with this brush.</li>
            <li> sorry</li>
            <li> I hate when I waste my money.</li>
            <li> The box the brush came in was torn and ripped, so I was worried if something was wrong with it.</li>
            <li> For the price, this brush could rival any expensive option.</li>
            <li> Crazy bargain.</li>
            <li> I have had this for 6 months now, and i must say that after 2 times washing, it sheds like crazy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost afraid to look to see if it&#x27;s made out of animal hair as it feels like a mink coat.  </li>
            <li> it does the job, and it doesn&#x27;t get dirty..</li>
            <li> You honestly can&#x27;t go wrong with this one!</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this brush!</li>
            <li> and this definately does the trick and for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> bad-</li>
            <li> not feel bad about spending $$.</li>
            <li> ugly-</li>
            <li> I have never been disappointed with e.l.f. products.</li>
            <li> I am deeply disappointed and will be looking for another brush.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t hate it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will keep experimenting with it though, it&#x27;s probably just my bad skin that makes it look like this--nothing against the brush!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> hope it doesn&#x27;t get worst.</li>
            <li> After a month that brush started shedding whenever I applied the makeup to my face which was very annoying because I would ruin my foundation trying to get the fallen bristles off my face.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> too light..doesnt pick up any product. throwing away</li>
            <li> This is my second time purchasing this exact same brush since my puppy got to the first. The first lasted me for well over 6 months with occasional cleaning although not as often as I probably should have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Small enough to not take up much space in my makeup bag, but big enough to get good coverage where I need. Light, fluffy, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin one bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only bad thing I have to say about this brush is the shedding. It&#x27;s very little, but it does happen. Which I suppose can be blamed on the inconsistency of how it&#x27;s made since I never had this problem with my first purchase.</li>
            <li> Nice brush smooth and do the job pretty good</li>
            <li> this is so very soft. it&#x27;s so much better than the barely there brushes that I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.  I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Love this powder brush, so soft and does what its suppose to</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE...use with rice powder, no shedding, soooo soft and great coverage!!!</li>
            <li> I just love the size of this face brush and the short dark hairs make soft to the touch. I would highly recommend this elf brush to my friends. The brush is full so it will give great coverage..</li>
            <li> Prefect, compact size.  Great for traveling or everyday use</li>
            <li> I really like this brush. It&#x27;s very soft and small enough to carry in a small purse. It&#x27;s a good purchase.</li>
            <li> I love it! The best kabuki ever!! I would buy this a million times! And the price is great. I would definitely recomend this brush</li>
            <li> Love this brush. Such a great price and it&#x27;s very soft and does a great job putting on my bronzer</li>
            <li> This kabuki brush is worth more than what you pay for it. The bristles are soft and don&#x27;t fall off like some brands&#x27; brushes easily do.&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely repurchase. Although it would be nice if this brush also came in retractable form.</li>
            <li> Nice, compact brushes. Picked up my bronzer well and applied nicely.</li>
            <li> loveee it... soft n perfect. little hard to clean but when its clean it feels like velvet on yur skin..</li>
            <li> it is a great kabuki brush i always use with finishing powder  n have never used it with foundation n will never do i don&#x27;t think it was made for that&lt;br /&gt;but after over a year of using n washing regularly&lt;br /&gt;i can see it is gonna break soon  it has never shed on me&lt;br /&gt;but it has changed its shape ( a brush guard helped with that) n the black stand mostly chipped it color!&lt;br /&gt;which make me  dont use it that often now&lt;br /&gt;but for the price i paid for it (i got it on elf&#x27;s sale for half the price))  i really cannot complain n i am giving it 4 stars totally deserve it for being $3&lt;br /&gt;n the bristles are still so soft&lt;br /&gt;n being honest here i wasn&#x27;t so gentle with this brush during this year i throw it mostly on my purse which is something i will never do wih tmy high ends brushes&lt;br /&gt;so i believe if u take good care of this brush  it will last you for at least a couple of years</li>
            <li> This brush is incrediably soft. I love it so much. I showed it to my therapist friend who now uses it as a comfert technique. Definitly a great buy.</li>
            <li> I bought two thinking that these would be more stiff than they are. I wanted them for buffing in foundation. I have to use them for loose powder because they are too soft.</li>
            <li> One of the softest brushes you will ever use! and for the price? you really can&#x27;t beat that. I read the one star reviews and they all mentioned the bristles coming off. That sounds to me like they received a defective one. I&#x27;ve yet to experience that and I&#x27;ve had it for 5 months now. Still soft like the first time I tried it, and it still applies my cover up evenly. I&#x27;m happy with the product and I know I&#x27;ll be purchasing this again. definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> Great brush. Came in good packaging. Super soft and spreads the makeup well while not absorbing.</li>
            <li> Works great, so well that I ended up buying a second one for a friend!</li>
            <li> I freaking LOVE this brush. It is the softest thing I have ever used!! &amp; for how cheap it is. Wow. I will always have one of these.</li>
            <li> You can never go wrong with this Kabuki brush. It&#x27;s great for bronzing and blush and it&#x27;s soft. It&#x27;s definitely a must have in any makeup collection.</li>
            <li> I love this brush, it&#x27;s so soft and gives a great finished look!</li>
            <li> Wow.. this brush is amazing! So soft and fluffy! Definitely comparable to the real techniques powder brush. Amazing value and amazing quality!</li>
            <li> I got this brush because the reviews all said how large in size it was. It&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s smaller than any kabuki brush I&#x27;ve bought. If you are looking for a big one, go to Walgreens. I&#x27;ve found big ones there.</li>
            <li> VERY soft to the touch. Its awesome! The only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t&#x27; have a cover besides its case and I can&#x27;t put it alone in my makeup bag without the case (I like to keep my brushed super clean). Other than that, its fantastic.</li>
            <li> Really nice Kabuki brush for the price. I always wanted one but the ones at the mall are so expensive. I found this one and it works really well to set my facial powder. Threw it in my make-up bag and its held up quite well.</li>
            <li> This is a really good Kabuki! The only product from elf that I would actually recommend to a friend! :)</li>
            <li> This is one of the best make-up brushes I&#x27;ve ever had.  It&#x27;s so soft, and who can beat the price??  These can also be purchased at Target if you&#x27;d like to compare prices.</li>
            <li> Great brush for a great price!</li>
            <li> Love this. It is small but very soft!</li>
            <li> I now use this every day.  I have had it for almost a year now and it still is holding up strong.  You just have to clean it.  I don&#x27;t know what I did without this</li>
            <li> Nice kabuki brush, Soft.</li>
            <li> Excellent little brush!</li>
            <li> Best brush I&#x27;ve ever used!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this magical little brush for applying my powder bronzer!! It&#x27;s perfect!!</li>
            <li> Lovely, soft, and while others warned that it fell apart some, I haven&#x27;t had that experience. Maybe a hair or two was loose at first but after that it&#x27;s been great for weeks.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT WOULD BUY AGAIN AND RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li> I am impressed with how good this brush is. I had looked at others that cost as much as five times the price I paid. I doubt that they work five times better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft and cute!!! It&#x27;s perfect for traveling and very affordable for the quality! It feels great on your skin. Highly recommend this brush for an all over powder brush!!! It&#x27;s just as good as high end products. Mine hasn&#x27;t shed any...but even if it does a little after washing then it was only $6 so you won&#x27;t loose a ton of money but so far I love it!!!</li>
            <li> Just not good. It&#x27;s very cheaply made. I took a risk because of the good price but so not worth it. doesn&#x27;t blend make-up at all</li>
            <li> Super soft, airbrushed effect.</li>
            <li> Best brush I&#x27;ve ever purchased. It&#x27;s so soft and is pure magical!</li>
            <li> I love elf products and this brush didn&#x27;t disappoint. It&#x27;s really soft and great for putting on powder. No complaints really :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the softness of this brush and that it does not shed.  I rated it 4 stars because it&#x27;s small and I&#x27;d rather it were at least a third larger.</li>
            <li> This brush creates an amazing &amp;#34;airbrushed&amp;#34; look and it is so soft and nice on your skin. 10/10 would recommend.</li>
            <li> This kabuki brush was just as nice as more expensive versions.  ELF is great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super soft, a little too soft for my taste but it does the job.</li>
            <li> All I can say is Wowwwwwww! This brush is so, so soft, it works, the price is awesome! Delivered right on time! There&#x27;s no shedding! Ten thumbs up on this product!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Affordable and comparable to the kabuki brush from bare minerals.</li>
            <li> This is the right size brush. The bristles are soft. It is gentle yet very effective. I can highly recommend this face brush.</li>
            <li> I love kabuki brushes for the powder foundations I use. This one was inexpensive, so I took the chance. I have sensitive skin and I find that this brush is soft and does not irritate my skin. So far none of the bristles have fallen out (I&#x27;ve been using it for months), and it&#x27;s cleaned nicely.</li>
            <li> Save your money and buy THIS kabuki brush! It&#x27;s silky and feels great on the skin while distributing powder evenly across the skin. I love this brush and will never buy another $30 brush so long as this one is available. It&#x27;s a quality brush that I use daily and cleanse weekly and still functions the same as when I first purchased it. A true value!</li>
            <li> It works wonderfully!</li>
            <li> BEWARE! Not sure why it&#x27;s listed so expensively on Amazon, as it&#x27;s cheaper in both drugstores and on the e.l.f. official website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do love this brush though! The handle may be difficult for people to use since it&#x27;s so short/stubby, but it&#x27;s great for people with small hands (like me!) The short handle gives better control/pressure too. I use this brush all over my face for wide-area coverage, especially with powder foundation or with translucent powder to set my makeup. I love the finished look that this brush gives; it softens the appearance of pores and fine lines without making my makeup look cake-y. I was surprised at how dense and how soft the bristles were, and even after my first wash, there has been no shedding. There have been some bristles that were bent or sticking out on the periphery, but after washing, just take a second to shape the brush back into its original conformation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think my main concern is on proper storage, as it&#x27;s too short to just place in a standard brush holder/cup. I currently just have it placed on its base in a drawer. This isn&#x27;t a reflection on this specific product, though, as many kabuki brushes have the short handle.</li>
            <li> better than i expected!!! so soft and picks up product so well, very good product for its worth</li>
            <li> I love this brush for blending in my foundation and powders.  Some people say it is a little too thick, but I disagree.  I would not change a thing about it.  Will immediately purchase this again if something ever happens to the one I have now.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. Kabuki brushes are quite expensive and I found this reasonable and of good quality. I use it every day and have so far had no issues.</li>
            <li> Very soft brush, way better than the other brushes I&#x27;ve used from popular brand. Very easy to clean too.  And no animals harmed!</li>
            <li> I wanted a brush to keep in my purse and saw one I like at MAC but it was $50!  There was no way I spending that much.  Found this and love it.</li>
            <li> I had never heard of a kabuki brush until I came across this product. I was looking for a brush to apply some loose powder to my face and this had a great price. I absolutely love it. The size is great, the bristles are soft, and it works wonderfully. I&#x27;m very impressed with this brush!</li>
            <li> I know this kabuki had a bunch of great reviews but it just didn&#x27;t work for me. It was too soft and didn&#x27;t pick up powder well. I gave it to my little cousin who loves playing with makeup. :)</li>
            <li> This is a really great sturdy kabuki brush.  I use it for a lot of things (contouring and blending).  I haven&#x27;t washed it yet but I&#x27;m sure it will clean easily.  No hairs falling out and I use it daily.  I love e.l.f.!</li>
            <li> Nice and beautiful.Price is attractive and quality is acceptable.</li>
            <li> This is the best brush I have ever used it works wonderfully and feels so good on my face</li>
            <li> I really like this brush now but I didn&#x27;t hold powder well at first. Now that I have used it a while it works perfectly</li>
            <li> its great for the price i just don&#x27;t like how it has no stick my brother said it looks good for shaving :-p,&lt;br /&gt;anyway i bought it from a really long time and i use it everyday it do its job:)</li>
            <li> This brush works best to apply your powder to your face</li>
            <li> Nice foundation powder brush. Doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin which is awesome. I&#x27;d buy this again.</li>
            <li> I will never try a different brush again, this is is perfect.  Provides even coverage, and is very easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li> For the price you cannot beat this brush. I have owned a number of kabuki brushes over the years, ranging from very expensive to very budget-friendly. While this one is definitely budget-friendly, it works just as well as some of the most expensive brushes I own. The hairs are soft enough that they will not irritate sensitive skin. The brush is also made with enough quality that it can actually pick up and hold the powder and apply it evenly to your face. I have had more expensive kabuki brushes that don&#x27;t work as well as this one in terms of quality and the amount of coverage provided. If you&#x27;re looking for a kabuki brush and you want a very nice one but you don&#x27;t have a big budget or just don&#x27;t want to spend more than you have to, I definitely suggest this one. I will update this review after a couple months have passed to report about how well it holds up, but I honestly don&#x27;t foresee any problems with it.</li>
            <li> I love this it is so soft and so easy to clean. No shedding and very very strurdy</li>
            <li> Soft and luxurious, perfect finishing brush for light powder. This is my favorite makeup brush, hands down.</li>
            <li> Great kabuki brush for the price. Soft and flexible. Good purchase. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Works very well with blush.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.  It&#x27;s small enough to fit into my makeup bag but soft and big enough to apply makeup on right.  I won&#x27;t go back to the regular brushes after this.</li>
            <li> Just love it. nothing more to say</li>
            <li> The hair on this kabuki brush is very, very soft. And you can&#x27;t beat the price. You&#x27;re getting a solid product at a fraction of what you&#x27;d pay for something comparable. The brush has yet to shed any hair, and I&#x27;ve been using it for over 6 months.</li>
            <li> This brush is a really good value! The bristles are soft and don&#x27;t feel uncomfortable. In addition, it picks up the perfect amount of powder foundation and leaves the face looking even and gives it an airbrushed effect. Definitely a good Kabuki for applying any type of powder foundation/bronzer, maybe even blush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also really liked the size of the handle. It&#x27;s the perfect size and easy to grip. Overall, this is a steal! You won&#x27;t regret buying this!</li>
            <li> I am glad I found this product. It serves it purpose and is good quality and I&#x27;ll be back for more for gifts.</li>
            <li> I Don&#x27;t think I have ever left a comment on Amazon but I had to take time to write this one.  SUPER SOFT -I think I just put my pressed powder foundation on with a cloud!</li>
            <li> i mean if you just have to have a kabuki it is one of the cheaper ones on the market. it is full and it does an ok job its just too lose which makes powdering your face messier than it should be. i read a review that suggested putting a hair tie at the base of the bristles to make it a little firmer this did help a bit. otherwise id just stick to the elf powder brush it does a much better job, is cheaper,and is actually one of my favorite brushes.</li>
            <li> too small but it&#x27;s nice how you feel it in your face and you can put it any where ;p</li>
            <li> I was happy to find an inexpensive brush. A great tool for applying face powder and the price is perfect. Try it, you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
            <li> This is, by far, my favorite brush that I have. It&#x27;s a nice, big, soft kabuki brush. It doesn&#x27;t shed. I didn&#x27;t have very high hopes because it was so cheap, but I prefer it over more expensive brushes that I have purchased. Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> I like this brush a lot…super soft and effective and great price!</li>
            <li> This brush has nice, soft bristles, and the brush itself is pretty small and compact. I would recommend this to friends.</li>
            <li> I have used the regular brushes you buy at the drug store and the ones that came with the mineral make up but this little puppy is the very very best!  I find it to be super soft, large enough for my round face and the coverage of the mineral powder is excellent.  I bought it as an add on item and am in love!  I shall purchase two more for the other powders I own.  LOVE!!  and perfect price!</li>
            <li> It is a small, and wonderful tool for knocking off any access powder - or how you would use a wide kabuki brush. Brilliant!</li>
            <li> LOVE this little guy!! Soft and flexible.</li>
            <li> this is a nice soft brush that does a great job. the fact that it is inexpensive just adds to its value.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of brushes in my day, and have reviewed several from Amazon that truly deserve their high ratings, but this one is on another level. I guess the ability for brushes to do their job all depends on context, so here it is for this one:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a big, fluffy brush that in my opinion is (by far) best for LOOSE mineral POWDER. So if you want full coverage (foundation, bronzer, setting powder, etc), this is incredible. Also, as some other reviewers have mentioned, it&#x27;s very very soft. Again, (in my opinion), a soft brush is ideal for mineral powders because it facilitates full coverage and is able to pick up the powder really easily. However, if you&#x27;re using liquid, cream, or &amp;#34;cakelike&amp;#34; powder, you may find that this brush is too soft to pick up or spread the makeup efficiently, so you may want to check out elf&#x27;s firmer brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the quality on this brush is awesome. I&#x27;ve been using it for awhile and seriously haven&#x27;t noticed a single bristle fall out of it. The base is also nice--it&#x27;s metal (not some cheap plastic) and fairly weighty which keeps it upright. I know it will last a long time but if I ever lose it I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate buying a new one.</li>
            <li> It is really soft. There were just maybe 2 or 3 pcs of hair that came off it but, over all its good!</li>
            <li> Came in a timely manner, overall a good buy. Satisfied with my purchase. I use on a regular basis and it gets the job done. This brush is soft and a good size.</li>
            <li> This is the softest brush ever! AND it was cheap! I used this for the longest time and then it went to the bottom of my makeup bag when I bought sigma brushes. But then I rediscovered it multiple times! Love this little brush</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it is supposed to do and is rather inexpensive.  Girlfriend was very happy to have received this.</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite brush. I use this brush for everything. It is super soft and blends all makeup well, to include foundation!</li>
            <li> does not shed at all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its smaller and I like that and really soft&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;gives a really even application of powder.</li>
            <li> Best brush I ever used!</li>
            <li> The bristles really fall out of this one! I cannot recommend it. It would be better to spend a little more elsewhere rather than waste time plucking the loose bristles and lint rolling off the rest from your clothes, so that you don&#x27;t look like you rolled in cat hair because the bristles look like white cat hairs on your face and clothes.</li>
            <li> I have used this brush for years.. My other one was so used you couldn&#x27;t even see the label anymore! Will definitely repurchase over and over!</li>
            <li> I only use Bare Minerals foundation and their kabuki brushes are very expensive. I tried this one out and loved it. It was very cheap but of high quality. It is soft and the bristles do not shed. I will definitely buy another.</li>
            <li> I had to double-check to make sure this was synthetic fur since it was so soft.  It is, so I love it.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, clean and applies flawless coverage. highly recommend. The entire ELF line is great! I use it for bronzer and blush.</li>
            <li> Very soft brush, great size for packing or for your purse.  Perfect for the Elf correcting powder.  Order arrived fast as usual from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is my second one!  I loved it and lost it so I got another one.  It will last you a long time and it washes great.  Oh, and the price....</li>
            <li> I have since ordered another and will look for more ELF products instead of the more expence &#x27;brand&#x27; ones.  Beautifully soft and does a great job.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write a lot of reviews but I had to write this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush is fantastic!  It&#x27;s very soft but firm enough to evenly spread around powder.  I&#x27;ve gone through a few kabuki brushes but so far this one is the best.  Brushes I&#x27;ve used in the past felt like they were scratching my face even though they felt soft to the touch.  This one is gentle on the face and it doesn&#x27;t leave blotches of powder I&#x27;ve experienced with other brushes. It works great with pressed and loose powder. I highly recommend trying it.</li>
            <li> This studio kabuki is so soft and it makes the foundation and setting powder application a breeze. It&#x27;s also makes the application of foundation very even. Great product.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this from the elf website and I am so in love with this kabuki brush!! It has the softest bristles I have ever felt. This little brush evenly and adequately distributes the product. I have noticed minor shedding but it is definitely not much (in 2 weeks I have lost 2-3 &amp;#34;hairs&amp;#34;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my BE kabuki brush for ages (nearly 8 years) and I&#x27;ve always loved it but recently it has begun to shed in a bad way. So, i&#x27;ve been in the market for a new kabuki brush. This one got such rave reviews I had to try it for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the reviews are not wrong. This is an awesome brush for what it is. It&#x27;s just not what I expected.  This is more like a powder brush. It&#x27;s not firmly packed like the BE brush, it&#x27;s fluffy and soft. It would probably be great at distributing a loose powder but I want my kabuki brush to be able to work with my liquid foundations and give me that light, airbrushed finish you get with a firmly-packed kabuki buffer. Not much buffing can happen with this brush because it&#x27;s wayyyy to fluffy and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great powder, non-shedding, brush, but it is NOT the kabuki buffer I expected.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this brush! Doesnt scratch my face and feels as soft as fur. Shipped fast and great product! Thank you!!</li>
            <li> I was just reading about how good these elf brushes are in some makeup review so I came to amazon and ordered this one to apply powder with and it is absolutely wonderful. It doesn&#x27;t shed and is so soft. I love it and I plan to try more of their brushes. If they are all as nice as this one elf will be my brush of choice from now on. And the best part is you don&#x27;t have to break the bank to buy one.</li>
            <li> The bristles of this brush are really soft.  It is the perfect size for my travel bag.  Happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This kabuki brush is superb, its soft provides excellent coverage and is the right size, have no complaints about it.</li>
            <li> I had one of these brushes when I bought the Bare Minerals starter kit a few years ago.  My brush &amp;#34;broke&amp;#34; (the handle came off) about a year later and I&#x27;ve been using a standard brush since then.  I saw these on Amazon and based on the reviews, I decided to buy.  Definitely was not disappointed.  I now see why a kabuki brush is recommended for applying powder foundation.  It provides better and more even coverage than a standard brush.  Very glad I purchased this product.  And as another reviewer mentioned, the bristles on this brush are much softer than what I remember from my original kabuki.</li>
            <li> very cheap, very good quality, just what i was looking for! I love eyes lips face products because of their quality and affordability!</li>
            <li> Nice and soft brush. Picks up powder well. Cheaper than most of the things at other stores. 3 more words.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this brush :) Its like powdering my face with a kitten or a soft, baby bunny. Its a lot smaller than you&#x27;ll think it is, but it works great and is so soft on your skin!</li>
            <li> Learned about this brush from YouTube makeup videos. Can&#x27;t beat the quality for the price. My brush collection is so over loaded it&#x27;s hard for me to fit this brush into my regime but when I use it I&#x27;m always satisfied</li>
            <li> I really liked the size and softness of the brush.  I use it for blush, and loose powder. Great price.</li>
            <li> I had something more banal in mind for this brush, until I received it! It is LOVELY. Very soft, bristle height distributed well for coverage. Great price. I love it.</li>
            <li> Soft, very nice coverage for mineral powder foundation. Have had for at least a month and so far no bristles have fallen out (like many other brushes I have tried that cost more). So far very pleased with this brush! Will likely order again.</li>
            <li> This brush is worth every cent! The bristles are wonderfully soft and dense and it works perfectly for putting on loose mineral makeup, which is what I use it for. I believe it would even work well for the pressed powder makeup. You honestly can&#x27;t go wrong with this one! I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a B.E.Kabuki for years and I&#x27;ve kept it clean and in great condition, but it is quote harsh on my skin. The bristles are not soft at all, so I went looking for another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve purchased items from E.L.F. before, but only makeup items, I didn&#x27;t know they had tools. SO I saw this one and wanted to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is probably the softest Kabuki Brush I&#x27;ve ever felt, Seriously. It feels amazing on my skin. And the price? Are you kidding me? I spent $40 on my other Kabuki brushes, so this is a STEAL!&lt;br /&gt;Well made, great price. Works great with Mineral Powder makeup. Not for liquids tho!! It fits nicely in my hand and applies my powders amazingly.&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY Recommend! I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate for a second to purchase another one if mine gets yukky!</li>
            <li> The the brush forever ..... It smoothen my makeup n makes my face flawless..</li>
            <li> This is a decent kabuki, not too expensive, that&#x27;s probably why the outer black handle cover came unglued, slid off at some point and got lost.</li>
            <li> Hunted for reasonable priced kabuki brush- finally found one- soft, full, not to long, and feels Great!  No fall out yet, but only used 3 times- love it!</li>
            <li> I use it as a loose powder brush and it doesn&#x27;t disappoint me. It’s a great product, pricing is extremely reasonable! Two thumbs up.</li>
            <li> My problem with other brushes, shedding.  So far no shedding with this brush, time will tell if will hold up.</li>
            <li> Love this brush. It feels great on the face and leaves no residue.</li>
            <li> Love this brush use for my finishing touches, big fluffy, great coverage. Highly recommend! Nice price! Extremely soft on my face</li>
            <li> My brush handle came damaged, there were like marks and stuff all over the handle. There were some bristles that fallen out/ were damaged when i took it out the box but the brush was still usable as it was still very soft. Went to get a refund and Amazon let me keep the brush as well. &amp;#60;3 love Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going to have to take care of the handle so it doesn&#x27;t fall off or something. Also make sure to clean the brush before you use it!! My one looked used so I went ahead and just cleaned it.</li>
            <li> Great applicator for all over powder</li>
            <li> This is the best kabuki brush I&#x27;ve ever used...by far. It&#x27;s amazingly soft and doesn&#x27;t hold on to the product after you&#x27;ve applied. Always feels soft and clean. Very deserving of 5 stars!</li>
            <li> This brush is so soft it&#x27;s almost unbelievable!  I just got it and haven&#x27;t used it a lot but I just love it so far!  It isn&#x27;t shedding or losing hair and I love the softness.  It seems to hold enough makeup and puts it on very smoothly.</li>
            <li> its so fluffy &amp; soft! I&#x27;ve had it for a couple years now &amp; it still works wonderfully! I am so buying this again.</li>
            <li> It is very difficult to gauge how big this brush is given the picture. It is larger than I was anticipating, however it still fits in the lid of my mineral foundation so I am able to use it. I am satisfied with the brush so far and haven&#x27;t experienced any shedding.</li>
            <li> I purchased this kabuki brush to replace the one I bought with my Bare Minerals makeup.  This brush is amazing compared to the Bare Mineral&#x27;s kabuki brush.  Very soft and makeup goes on very smooth and evenly. I am going to buy another one just to have on hand.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Soft and blends well.</li>
            <li> I actually love this brush even though it is pretty cheap. I use it to buff out my liquid foundation and contour.  It works great.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different powder brushes &amp; this is the best around! Perfect, even application that never leaves my skin looking cakey. A must have in my makeup arsenal!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really cute, functional and very confortable when in touch with your skin, very soft and the package is better than I imagined.</li>
            <li> I really love, love, LOVE this kabuki brush. I can tell it will last me a long time. The quality is great, it came in a protective plastic container. Holds and applies fine powder nicely. Elf products has truly impressed me.</li>
            <li> It shipped fast, the product is nice, the brush is very soft and does not shed. Compact for my purse! Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this at my local store and I absolutely love it for applying my Clinique Transparency 3 Loose Blended Face Powder.  If you are a Clinique loose powder user, you know how cheap their brush is made; I&#x27;m referring to the one that Clinque includes in the loose powder box (it&#x27;s garbage). Now about this e.l.f. brush......This is the perfect brush for loose powder application.  In fact, the package says it&#x27;s for loose powder.  It does not say it&#x27;s for mineral or liquid makeup.  Mine has not shed since I&#x27;ve been using it and it is still nice a soft.  It is a very good brush for $6.  The other kabuki brushes that I&#x27;ve seen and felt at the local drug store and big box stores do not compare to the softness of this e.l.f. brush.  I looked at L&#x27;Oreal and other over the counter brushes and e.l.f. beats them all.  I am a makeup artist and have seen alot of brushes in my day.  I can&#x27;t believe how well this blends my powder and it doesn&#x27;t allow the powder to sit in the fine lines on my face.  It blends my loose powder perfectly.  I use it in a circular motion all over my face.  I close my eyes and blend it under my eyes and do the same around my nose.  It will set the powder in those areas as well, even though it is a large headed brush.  I also purchased the e.l.f. blush brush and I am happy with it too.  Great line of brushes! As far as caring for your brushes, whether they are e.l.f. or not, if you ever see a stray bristle coming out of any of your brushes, do not pull them out!  Trim the end to match the others.  You will pull out part of the glue with your stray bristle and it will ruin your brush.  When you wash your brushes, be gentle.  In your palm, make a lather with a foamy cleanser or Ivory bar soap.  Wet your brush and then put it in the foamy cleanser and use gentle circular motions to clean your brush.  Gently rinse in COLD water in the same way by placing it in your palm and rinse by the same circular motions until water is clear.  Do not use anything with oil to clean your brush.  Dry skin cleansers contain oily products.l to clean your brush.  Dry skin cleansers contain oily products.</li>
            <li> Bristles were coming off.  Its soft but needs more hair or something to give it a bit of firmness. Powder ened up everywhere except your face.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush for the price.  The brush is really soft and feels great against the skin.  I use it for powdered bronzer.  The only problem is that the really soft brush doesn&#x27;t pick up as much color as I want so I need to put on two layers of it usually.</li>
            <li> It is very soft, but holds powder and promotes even distribution. Plus it is easy to store d/t no long handles which can be annoying when traveling.</li>
            <li> This brush is great for brushing off excess face powder or applying dry shampoo.  I&#x27;m sure it has other uses, but that&#x27;s what I use it for.  It also seems very well made.</li>
            <li> could be a little softer</li>
            <li> Package was crushed a bit, but the brush was fine.&lt;br /&gt;Bristles are SUPER soft - feels amazing on your face.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend to use with a powder, not a liquid.</li>
            <li> at target that have it from 2-3 dollars!!!&lt;br /&gt;i gave it 2 stars because its a good brush but not worth 6.00 plus shipping when you can go to target for it for less than half on here!!!&lt;br /&gt;but good brush though!!!</li>
            <li> Great price, doesn&#x27;t shed at all, and feels nice- the bristles do not hurt my face. Great price and shipped quickly as an add-on item. I will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> Very good brush. Soft, with a lot of bristles, and it really buffs loose powder onto the face for flawless application. My only wish is that the hairs were packed a little tighter for maximum blending. It&#x27;s a little &amp;#34;floppy&amp;#34; for a kabuki. Still quality for this price and I use it everyday with NYX HD translucent powder. My face makeup has never been so smooth.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST powder brush I&#x27;ve ever used. It is so soft and the coverage it provides is awesome. Enough said.</li>
            <li> This is a nice brush.&lt;br /&gt;But I expected this type of brush,&lt;br /&gt;kabuki, to be a lot firmer.&lt;br /&gt;It is more like a blush brush.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t hate it.&lt;br /&gt;It is just not a kabuki.</li>
            <li> Easy to use &amp; not too big. Easy to clean. I would recommend it to any woman who wants full coverage with her favorite face powder. I love it.</li>
            <li> Super soft and does a great job of evenly applying powder. Also nice a big for concealer.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. It is soft and does not sheed</li>
            <li> Love it! The brush is so soft, perfect for compact or loose powder. Does the job great and sets flawless.</li>
            <li> It was a great brush at first, seemed the hairs were good quality. But then clumps started falling out!  After about 4 weeks of use!  Don&#x27;t use anymore.</li>
            <li> I was nervous that I wouldn&#x27;t get a good product just because the price was so reasonable and I was worried for nothing. This is exactly what I was looking for. The bristles are extremely soft and I haven&#x27;t had any falling out on my skin either. Very pleased with my purchase and would recommend!</li>
            <li> Great for an all over powder application. It&#x27;s soft and feels very natural. I haven&#x27;t tried it with wet foundation yet, but its perfect for dry powders.</li>
            <li> I absolutley love this brush.  It&#x27;s so soft and works wonderfully. It arrived super fast and at a price you can&#x27;t beat!!!</li>
            <li> Great brush for the price. Super soft and light and its small size is great for taking it with u. The best brush i have had in a very long time.</li>
            <li> I used it as a duster for my nails, would be better if its bigger....</li>
            <li> Great brush. I use it all the time with my Bare Minerals foundation!</li>
            <li> I have been using the same old Kabuki brush for probably 10 years now.  All of the ones I&#x27;ve tried to buy to replace it shed bristles all over by face and clothes...what a waste.....but this e.l.f. Kauki brush is so amazing.  I love it!!  It is so soft and provides good coverage and distribution of my powder.  Works well with the e.l.f. Studio SPF 45 Sunscreen UVA/UVB Protection Loose Powder (83332)  I have never been disappointed with e.l.f. products.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. I use it for applying my powder, blending concealer and foundation, sometimes I use it for blush. Its definetely my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; brush</li>
            <li> turned out too big for me, soft, although uncomfortable to wash, is versatile to squeeze a bit ... used to contour or blend ideal for applying much product.</li>
            <li> When I got this, it seems to be used. Unclear logo and broken pacage. I don&#x27;t want to return it since it&#x27;s only $6 stuff, but really disappointing at this quality!</li>
            <li> Best brush I&#x27;ve ever owned, and I have bought the high-end ones, including Too Faced, etc. Fantastically soft and comfortable, but dense enough to hold the product in a controlled way and deposit it well. Absolutely love it. Crazy bargain.</li>
            <li> I like this brush, it&#x27;s really soft and holds powder well. I haven&#x27;t washed it yet, though, that will be a true test.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a flat long brush based on the picture. It&#x27;s not but its still great :)</li>
            <li> Very nice face brush.  Very soft and applies face powder very evenly over my face.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use for liquid foundation it does not work well with wet products. Only use this kabuki on powders, because it is not a foundation brush. This brush is super soft and I bought it because I saw a bunch of you tubers going crazy over it. It really is amazing, easy to clean, and the bristles stay in place :)</li>
            <li> Very soft and holds more powder than my other brushes, which I love. Highly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice soft brush for those of you who want to cover your whole cheek area and give your face a nice overall glow. Makes you wonder why most companies sell the smaller and thin brushes all the time. This does so much better at a cheaper price.</li>
            <li> great value. I like this brush better than my $40 brush from Bobbi Brown.</li>
            <li> Great brush for face powder but to soft for blush</li>
            <li> Super soft brush. I love it.</li>
            <li> It works very well with my MAC mineral make-up. I am happy because MAC face brushes are so expensive. I will purchase this brush again as it is recommended to use with mineral make up. I also like it because it enables you to apply the make up lightly (not too heavy). It gives an airbrushed finished.</li>
            <li> Sheds a little too much for me.</li>
            <li> Insanely soft. I spent maybe an hour just rubbing the brush over my hands and face. A few hairs have come out, but it could of also be my dogs hair since she&#x27;s shedding, lol, But yeah, does a great job of blending and buffing my face makeup. One of my best buys!</li>
            <li> Love my kabuki brush!! I use it just for powder and it&#x27;s wonderful. Idk how I went without it for so long.</li>
            <li> This kabuki brush is excellent. don&#x27;t let the price fool you, good quality also comes at affordable prices!&lt;br /&gt;the brush is dense but at the same time very soft. I use it more than anything to blend blush, powder foundation and bronzer so my makeup looks more natural and the makeup is less obvious.&lt;br /&gt;Really good. If you don&#x27;t have a kabuki brush and want to try one, this is the one!</li>
            <li> This thing is so soft! I bought it to use as a duster for my expensive model cars. Doesn&#x27;t leave any scratches and gets all the dust off. If I was a women I would want to put makeup on my face all day just to feel its softness</li>
            <li> Great brush. I just wished I had purchased it from the company (ELK) directly because it is much cheaper. Overall the poduct was great and it arrived on time.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush 2 years ago for $4 as a \\&quot;filler\\&quot; brush until I got what I thought would be a better one. I used it for about a month and thought \\&quot;if this cheap one is this good, the other one will be amazing.\\&quot; So I bought the more expensive one and IT SUCKED compared to this one. This will always be my favorite brush.</li>
            <li> So great to use this brush for any mineral makeup you would want to use. It is a great brush and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter but i keep using it myself. It distributes powder so well on the face.</li>
            <li> OMG! This makeup brush is amazing. So glad I ordered it. If you are considering purchasing this kabuki makeup brush, Just order it! It will be well worth it and the price is amazingly cheap.</li>
            <li> great little brush. I actually bought this not to apply makeup but to evenly distribute this other product called PIT POWDER... the brush works great to spread that product around evenly. highly recommend</li>
            <li> Very dense. Buffs like a dream. I love it, I love it, I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this brush..great for blush and bronzer..high quality materials..will be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> Good brush and brand for beginners. Soft but still picks up product. I have used on both pressed and loose powder and it works great on both.</li>
            <li> Really soft face brush. I absolutely love it!!!! Perfect for my powder foundation.</li>
            <li> This make up brush is phenomenal! It&#x27;s the only part of my make up change and I get complimented almost everyday about how good my make up looks!</li>
            <li> I used this brush with some translucent face powder it it applies very well.  It also feels good as you apply it.  I recommend this for the price!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this, the quality is fantastic. The price is unbeatable and works very well, no shedding. I see them at Target, will buy different sizes of brushes there.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied od this brush. It is wery soft plimp and do not  irritate skin. It distributes make up well.</li>
            <li> This brush is so soft and yet really does the job.  It is big enough like the other ones with a much higher price.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent purchase and price.</li>
            <li> This face brush works wonders it does not shed and is perfect for applying powder over liquid makeup. The brush does not get  clumpy with the liquid makeup on your face like my old bareessentials kabuki brush!</li>
            <li> Bought these as Christmas gifts for some of the women in my family. They are very soft and seem to be made well. Also the size is nice and compact, great for a purse brush.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the softest face brush I own!  Great for finishing powder. Great quality at an even better price!</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing it&#x27;s soft and it make my studio fix go on so smooth. I will be buy more of these brushes.</li>
            <li> use it everyday, soft and gives great coverage with any powder I use and doesn&#x27;t make my face irritated. Good buy</li>
            <li> This brush is so soft!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it to spread translucent powder all over my face and blend my blush/bronzer, and it does that pretty well. Not absolutely perfect, it&#x27;s kind of big to use in certain areas such as my under-eye and around my nostrils, but I like it alright.</li>
            <li> The price is great and while applying foundation it does a great job!  I also like its softness and so far it doesn&#x27;t shed</li>
            <li> I reallly liked this, it&#x27;s so small and cute, and soft. Just what I was looking for in a brush!</li>
            <li> excellent very happy with the product really recommend it 100% excellent quality and 100% original brand really excellent very good product.</li>
            <li> Love this brush and it&#x27;s compact size. Fits great inside my makeup bag. Very soft bristles, excellent for applying a finishing powder.</li>
            <li> It brushes on great and feels good to the face and puts the makeup on with ease and stays on.</li>
            <li> Item is ok and kind of expensive given the quality. There are better items out there and probably for less $.</li>
            <li> Love this brush and love the price even more!</li>
            <li> This brush is SO soft. I use it to apply my elf Studio High Definition Face Powder and it goes on great. It&#x27;s a pretty big brush so it&#x27;s perfect for applying powder all over.</li>
            <li> I Love, love this brush, so soft.</li>
            <li> Love it. I use a mineral loose powder and not all brushes work well. This one is fantastic. It is super soft, large, and distributes the powder well. It is also priced right.</li>
            <li> Good value for the price.  Does not shed and that is a big plus!</li>
            <li> I use this brush for all over powder and/or bronzer. It is very soft and thick and applies my makeup evenly. I would purchase this product again for sure.</li>
            <li> This brush is so soft!!! I love applying makeup with it. I use so much less and save money, but also it feels so amazing against my face.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace the kabuki brush I had. Am I glad I did. I actually held both brushes up to my face at the same time and immediately felt the difference in texture. The e.l.f. brush is soft and gentle on the face, which is perfect for applying finishing powder. I have not used it to apply foundations, however I do use it to blend out edges and it works great for that also. Would definitely recommend. I would also recommend that you purchase directly from the e.l.f. website as they are always having these fantastic sales!</li>
            <li> This is one of the softest brushes in my collection. I love using this for my powder foundation and contour powder blending needs. It cleans easily and returns to it&#x27;s former softness once dry. The only complaint I have is the black paint on the base of the brush started to bubble and flake off after a while. Not a huge deal, I ended up sealing it with a coat of clear nail polish and problem solved. Other than that one minor issue, this is my favorite brush.</li>
            <li> nice small makeup brush just what i was looking for good for all makeup use if looking for a small makeup brush this fits the bill</li>
            <li> I needed a small, fluffy kabuki that did not shed for powdering... I use concealer and foundation and once those little hairs get stuck in the makeup, it could ruin a whole makeup job effort!  This brush does NOT shed at all.  Haven&#x27;t even seen one hair.  ELF products are so great for the money and a lot of them have a low toxicity rating on ewg.org/skindeep.  It is not crazy small... But small enough to fit in my portable, purse-sized makeup bag. So happy!</li>
            <li> This Kabuki brush is so soft. It is made of Taklon NO ANIMAL HAIR! YAY! Synthetic. I prefer these.&lt;br /&gt;It cost$6.00 at Walmart. This one is so much softer than my MAC Kabuki brush and does NOT shed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about three years now and I still love it</li>
            <li> Great brush- no lost bristles!</li>
            <li> spend more and get a better one. This one doesn&#x27;t have the tightness of most kabuki brushes, but more dense than a powder brush I suppose.</li>
            <li> This brush feels so good on my skin, it&#x27;s a joy to apply my mineral powder foundation... it gives an even smooth application...</li>
            <li> Great brush...works well for bronzer!  Nice quality.</li>
            <li> I thought it might be a little larger, but was still a nice size. Value/price very in line.</li>
            <li> Works just as expected. No shedding.Compact size easy to store. Why pay more?</li>
            <li> Excellent product and reasonable price - essentially does the same job that other more expensive kabuki brushes do. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This brush is SO soft it feels almost luxurious on my face! It works VERY well for lightly spreading loose powder and making it invisible. Sadly, it looses a few bristles with each use and I&#x27;m afraid it won&#x27;t last long. Disappointing because I really like how it feels and works.</li>
            <li> AMAZING BRUGH IT GIVES ME AN AIRBRUSHED LOOKED!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe this brush was only $6. It is SO soft and feels absolutely luxurious against my skin. It really feels no different from the expensive $30+ brushes. I use it with the ELF Translucent dusting powder. The bristles are extremely soft and flexible, and really help to evenly distribute product on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how this is so cheap. Either everything else is super over-priced, or there&#x27;s something weird going on w/ELF products :)</li>
            <li> I bought this to use with my Mineral veil from bare essentials.  Works great. Very soft and thick.</li>
            <li> does the job great and it&#x27;s easy to carry around in your makeup purse or whateva.&lt;br /&gt;Love it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very soft as well.</li>
            <li> Very soft and loaded with bristles. I will purchase a second one.</li>
            <li> Needed a brush for my travel bag for mineral powder. Perfect size and very soft. Got one for my daughter as well and she loves it.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush.  Had a little shedding after first use but seems pretty put together.  Easy to wash and easy applicator for powder.</li>
            <li> I just got this so I don&#x27;t have long term use comment but it seems well made and will be useful to brush on finish powder or just stroke my face . ahhh.</li>
            <li> EXACTLY WHAT I EXPECTED. ARRIVED ON TIME AND WAS WELL PACKAGED AND IT WASN&#x27;T DAMAGED. WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND IT TO MY FRIENDS</li>
            <li> One of my favorite brushes.It is so soft and well made.What a steal, for just $6 it&#x27;s a must have.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my brush for quite some time now and I love it. It&#x27;s much cheaper than the ones at the store &amp; I&#x27;ve had no problem with it. Nice &amp; soft :)</li>
            <li> I got this brush from an old navy store, not actually off of amazon.  The brush is very soft, and does shed a little.  Before putting on my face I usually brush it up against my hands to get the extra shedding off, I use this brush to apply powder for the finishing touch.  All in all it is a good brush for the price.</li>
            <li> I was pretty surprised at the quality of this brush. The handle is very sturdy and the brush is soft and perfect for finishing powder. I love this brush. :)</li>
            <li> Just received the brush yesterday and tried it this morning.  The other reviews are right--one of the softest brushes ever!  I can&#x27;t believe how smooth and soft it feels (and how I put up with a scratchy brush for so long).  I will say that I still used my scratchy flat top powder brush to pick up my loose mineral powder and pack onto my skin, then used this brush buff and blend in.  This brush picks up less product and therefore gives a more natural finish.  I know I&#x27;ll use it daily for blending and would highly recommend this as a must-have for anyone who wears makeup.</li>
            <li> Perfect size for my little makeup bag. It&#x27;s also very soft. Better than expected. Sometimes you think because you skimp on the price that you skim on quality, and although no, it&#x27;s not a high end (or high priced) brush, it&#x27;s the one I use everyday. I actually bought a more expensive one, and I keep returning to this one..</li>
            <li> love this this is amazing ! the only elf brush that i actually loveeeeeeee this is truly the bomb dot com for blending everything out its much better than a beauty blender</li>
            <li> These type brushes are good for the cheeks, and very handy to carry everywhere in your purse.  Would buy it again.</li>
            <li> it is a really nice make up brush, it works very well with foundation and a bronzer and i really love it</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t hear any complaints so I guess it&#x27;s fine-the  brush was full and my daughter liked it.  I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for 3 months and it&#x27;s still amazingly soft, the bristles haven&#x27;t fallen out, and it applies my powder amazingly. And for this cheap? Buy it buy it buy it.</li>
            <li> If you think you need to spend big money on a kabuki make-up brush, you need to try this brush from e.l.f.! It&#x27;s soft, the bristles do not fall out, and it gives you perfect coverage. I found it worked especially well with finishing powder. I am going back for another one because I want to keep a separate one for blending blush and bronzers. Ladies, you do not need to go broke to have great cosmetic brushes. This Studio Kabuki Face Brush is excellent!</li>
            <li> Love this brush, like treating your face to little kisses.&lt;br /&gt;I am in the process of converting all of my brushes to e.l.f. brushes.</li>
            <li> I am in love, i&#x27;m so happy I got this it&#x27;s perfect!&lt;br /&gt;It is amazingly soft, so soft I like to touch it to my face sometimes just for the fun of it lol.&lt;br /&gt;It gives me a flawless application of my face power and product doesn&#x27;t get stuck to the brush at all!&lt;br /&gt;Everyone needs one of these and I recommend this one over any other kabuki brush I&#x27;ve used and for the price why not!</li>
            <li> Upon receiving this brush yesterday, I was very happy with it. The bristles are very soft and I liked the fact that it stands vertically which doesn&#x27;t take up much space. So today I actually used it for the first time and upon using it, the bristles fell out in clumps. (The bristles weren&#x27;t wet.) I was shocked, since I used it gently. I mainly ordered this brush because I&#x27;ve read that ELF bristles remain intact. I am deeply disappointed and will be looking for another brush. This was a waste of my money. Not recommended.</li>
            <li> a $6 Kabuki brush.  How can you beat that.  It is thick and the bristles do not fall out.  I use it every day and have washed it multiple times.  Love.</li>
            <li> Too soft and too small. Doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;pick up&amp;#34; product. I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> this brush is so soft, doesnt shed at all , works pretty wel, great price&lt;br /&gt;i would totally recommend this!</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this brush! I use it for my everyday makeup when applying foundation, it blending the makeup beautifully</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THIS BRUSH, ITS SO CHEAP, NEVER AGAIN.</li>
            <li> Love this brush!! Definitely worth purchasing :)</li>
            <li> This brush is so very soft but it does not really hold any kind of powder by the time you go to put it to your face most of what wa son the the bristles has fallen off</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft.  Works as intended.  For the cost, it&#x27;s worth every penny, as most E.L.F. brushes tend to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I have had no shedding when I use it or wash it.</li>
            <li> This is a quality product that I re-order regularly - not because the brush wears out, but because I know you should replace them every couple of months.</li>
            <li> i can apply my makeup easy with this brush and it does nott scratch my face or anything.  i would buy it</li>
            <li> Whatever you do, DO NOT buy this! I have had this for 6 months now, and i must say that after 2 times washing, it sheds like crazy. The hair is no longer soft and in fact, just clump together that I can&#x27;t use it to buff powder evenly anymore (whats the point of a kabuki brush anw?) After owning 3 kabuki brushes, I can now say that the kabuki FACE brush has very long hairs - while it helps buffing on a larger surface, it makes buffing harder than when using kabuki brushes with shorter, tightly held hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the Elf studio line, esp. the powder and stippling brush, but I totally regret buying this.</li>
            <li> This is so soft and easy to clean.  I havent had any problems with and and would buy it again if the need comes up</li>
            <li> Best Brush ever!!!  Provides awesome coverage with my bare minerals poders when I need a little more coverage than just a light brushing!  I would recommend this product to everyone!</li>
            <li> Everyone who wears powder needs this brush, it is the best! I had to replace mine because my daughter kept using mine</li>
            <li> This brush is so soft, I haven&#x27;t had any bristles fall out, it hold powder well and is all around wonderful!  I will be purchasing the rest of the set soon.  I bought this about 2 months ago and I use it at least once a day.  Great price for an excellent product!</li>
            <li> Wife loves this brush. Nery soft!</li>
            <li> Not that impressed with this. Its small and the short handle was somewhat awkward. Havent used it much.</li>
            <li> I love this kabuki brush - I was looking for a big fluffy brush to apply my foundation powder, bronzer, blush, etc and this definately does the trick and for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong! Love elf products!</li>
            <li> Love this Kabuki brush..soft and applies loose powder, or foundation powder perfectly!</li>
            <li> Wow, for the cost this is a fantastic brush.  Soft and seemingly of good quality.</li>
            <li> This product line is always a happy surprise.  Great prices on good quality items, and this blush brush is no exception.  It feels really soft and nice.</li>
            <li> This is one of the softest brushes that I&#x27;ve ever used. I am so in love with it! Use it as my foundation brush with bare minerals and it works great. Very little to no shedding of the hairs also which is wonderful!</li>
            <li> I LOVE Elf products. This one is fabulous. I&#x27;v bought it 3 times and they last forever if you clean them (with elf brush cleaner)! I love the way it feels and how it puts on my powder/bronzer and blush. A must have</li>
            <li> Great kabuki brush, only had minimal shedding the first couple of times I washed it (like 2 or 3 bristles). Bristles are fine and soft, and densely packed.</li>
            <li> I just got my brush and it is so soft and big! the brissels are so nice and perfect for powder</li>
            <li> The ELF kabuki face brush is amazing!  As good if not better than the BareMinerals brush!  Makes my makeup look flawless.  Wonderful price!</li>
            <li> Packages we both damaged!</li>
            <li> Heavenly made products.This is a quality product and i do not think anyone should be unsatisfied with this.This is an excellent kabuki brush.My second time purchasing.Having a spare was so important to me, i could not help buying another.You will be happy with it too.Love how my face looks after using this.Company delivery quickly..</li>
            <li> This was a brush for someone else. Thank u</li>
            <li> good and Soft easy to use for foundation things only&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dont expect much more&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;over all good i can say</li>
            <li> I love this Kabuki brush! It is super soft and the price is great. Im so glad I ordered this vs spending 3x the amount on another kabuki brush. Its a great buy for sure and my powdered makeup goes on flawlessly!</li>
            <li> My other kabuki brush&#x27;s bristles were getting very rough and sharp on my face.  Ordered this one and I love it!</li>
            <li> This brush is perfect for using with the HD powder by ELF. I also use it to bluff and blend my entire face together before misting with a setting mist. I recommend this to any and everyone that are looking to get a kabuki brush. I am going to buy another one to keep in my makeup kit!</li>
            <li> Works very well and lasts long</li>
            <li> the hairs fall out very easily</li>
            <li> I love this brush! It&#x27;s cute and worth every penny</li>
            <li> Very cute, it makes your blush look very natural.</li>
            <li> I love the way this brush feels on my face. It&#x27;s like a soft silky gentle caress .... but I am having a hard time not getting all my makeup lost because it&#x27;s a little too big and too spread so it doesn&#x27;t apply the make-up as well as I like unless I use a LOT ... that&#x27;s my only regret. It&#x27;s a great price, shipped super fast, was packaged nicely, and is a great quality. The application of the actual makeup - the loose powders - is where I find it gets a little lost ..... I&#x27;d love to give it a 5-star but I feel that I am wasting powder and not getting as much of it on my face as I&#x27;d like! :(</li>
            <li> Smells a little funky at first.</li>
            <li> Great quality. Better than MAC&#x27;s. Will definitely re-purchase.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than Bare Minerals kabuki brush which costs $26 compared to this at $6! Works very well and offers me the light coverage that I need. It does shed here and there. I just started using it. Let&#x27;s see how long it lasts. So far, it works great with the bare minerals foundation/blush products that I use. Very soft on your skin and made with enough quality that it feels sturdy. Maybe it won&#x27;t last as long due to its cheap price but I&#x27;m willing to try it out and will update should it fall apart sooner than 6 months-1 year!</li>
            <li> Great brush! It allows the powder to glide over your cheeks nice and smoothe. Feels good as well!</li>
            <li> Love this little brush..really soft</li>
            <li> This product was exactly as described.&lt;br /&gt;I am including these next few words becasue Amazon requires it. That needs to be changed.</li>
            <li> love the price and super soft. daughter loved it too....haven&#x27;t seen it since. Now I need to buy another one.</li>
            <li> This brush is really small and cute and incredibly soft. It&#x27;s really enjoyable using it, but it made my face look very cakey when I used it with my Sephora powder foundation. Usually I will use the sponge that came in my Makeup Forever powder foundation, and it doesn&#x27;t leave this kind of look. I will keep experimenting with it though, it&#x27;s probably just my bad skin that makes it look like this--nothing against the brush! The bristles seem very sturdy too, and I can tell this brush will probably last a while. For the price that it was, it is great quality.</li>
            <li> I like it, but maybe I misunderstood the measurements....wish the handle  was a little longer, but overall, it&#x27;s a very good brush for my pressed powder.  Powder goes on smoothly and evenly</li>
            <li> as described.  love it !  excellent cond. very happy with product and transaction</li>
            <li> This is an excellent kabuki face brush!  It&#x27;s the second one I&#x27;ve had, and i plan to order more as small gifts for my friends.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush! I have had it for a year now and it still works great and is in excellent condition. In the first week that I had this, it did seem to shed quite a bit, however I does not shed anymore. It is as good as any salon quality brush: so soft and gentle on skin and holds it&#x27;s shape. When the one I have gets too old I will be replacing it with the exact same one.</li>
            <li> I bought this item from Amazon but the other day I found elf at a department store here in town. I love this item and all the others that I found.</li>
            <li> The brush is really soft, the powders sticks to it perfectly. It has big enough handle to hold it. I really like the things i ordered from this brand</li>
            <li> Great little brush for setting foundation. Soft, easy to store &amp; it does not shed</li>
            <li> I love this brush.  It applies my mineral foundation quickly and evenly and is sooooo soft!  Just as good as (if not better than) expensive &amp;#34;high-end&amp;#34; brushes that shed and scratch your face up.  If you like paying for a name, go ahead.  However, if you want value AND quality for your money, you can not go wrong with this brush.</li>
            <li> I stopped using this brush because it sheds hairs on my face and is not as soft as my other brush. I love my larger Sheer Cover Essential Beauty Kabuki brush, but needed a smaller brush that could fit in my makeup bag. I purchased the elf brush because it was cheap and had good reviews.  I guess it&#x27;s an OK brush for the price, but I&#x27;ve learned my lesson and will stick with the more expensive ones.</li>
            <li> Bought these brushes because I bought $50 face powder.  These brushes work great.  But they work just as well with $7 face powder.  My personal opinion is that It is not in the powder, but in the brush.  Whether you use expensive powder or just the drug store brand, this brush applies the powder evenly, smoothly and thoroughly, almost giving a light &amp;#34;airbrushed&amp;#34; look.  Great for quick touch-ups and shiny noses too, because the brush makes phasing the new powder into the old makeup seamless.  I use it to apply a very light powder all over, which works great as a base for eye shadow and blush, making it last longer, and I am no longer using foundation.  Good for light coverage or thick coverage.  It is small and well made--does not lose its bristles.</li>
            <li> Nice thick, soft brush, small enough to fit in the larger compartments of most cosmetics organizers but full enough to do a nice job.  I&#x27;m very happy!</li>
            <li> The product is wonderful and  really works in applying my foundation to appear smooth with pores appearing smaller.  The company delivered what was promised!</li>
            <li> great, i use it for my setting powder</li>
            <li> works well, very soft</li>
            <li> Nice and big and fluffy without the stem you don&#x27;t need.</li>
            <li> Great brush. A few strands fell out but very durable and soft.</li>
            <li> This kabuki brush is wonderful! I use it everyday to apply my mineral powder foundation and it is large enough to help me quickly apply my makeup. I haven&#x27;t really had any troubles with shedding, it is soft, easy to clean, and I also love that it&#x27;s inexpensive! I own several other e.l.f studio brushes and I&#x27;ve never had any problems with them.</li>
            <li> The brush top is too soft so most of the powder product falls off the brush before it makes it to your face. I feel like it&#x27;s wasteful.</li>
            <li> This brush is is so soft and blends so well.  It is very well made and no loose bristles- which has been my problem in the past.  I highly recommend adding this brush to your collection!</li>
            <li> It feels really soft on my face and is big and fluffy!!  No shedding!! yay!!  Even though I like how it feels, it seems a little too fluffy.  I used to to apply my Make up Forever HD finishing powder (loose powder).  I dont like using it for my compact powder as I feel that the hairs are too loose....I think a denser brush would work for compact powders.  But if you do have loose powder, this would be GREAT! And the size is so cute !!</li>
            <li> i bought this kabuki brush and its worth getting i love it its so soft and its great for putting foundation on</li>
            <li> It feels really nice. That&#x27;s true. But it was so soft and fluffy that it held little product causing minimal coverage. This is nice for maybe a finishing powder but not a foundation. It is also a larger brush practical for use on the entire face rather than blusher or contour.</li>
            <li> I love this little brush! it gives you great makeup coverage and the application process is a breeze. I saw this being used in a youtube video on how to apply flawless foundation makeup. I was impressed. Why pay more? ELF has a really great product and I will be coming back for more. Im now looking at other elf products that I have not considered before (that is how great the brush is). IT HAS NOT SHED AND IT REALLLY REALLLY REALLLY SOFT! I have sensitive skin and it has yet to irritate it. I am so surprised and happy I went on the good reviews prior to purchase as well.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this makeup brush to anyone. It was just what I wanted.... super soft!  And it was a GREAT price, also.  I love it!!</li>
            <li> I use bare minerals foundation and have been on the hunt for a good brush that&#x27;s not too expensive. This had good reviews and some of the features I was looking for, so I gave it a try. Here are my thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good- this brush is super soft, large, has densely-packed bristles, and it is only $6.00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad- the bristles are so soft that it doesn&#x27;t give great coverage. I like medium to full coverage, and I felt like I had to go back for more and more product to get it. The bristles are so long they would suck up the foundation instead of putting it on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ugly- it sheds!!! As soon as I got it out of the package I noticed a few strands sticking up, so I pulled them and a ton of bristles came out. I kept pulling (gently!) and they kept coming out.  It sheds every time I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush has been demoted to the old brush drawer, and my hunt continues.</li>
            <li> I bought this as I couldn&#x27;t really find what I wanted on Amazon. This is okay, but It&#x27;s a bit small.</li>
            <li> I love this brush. It is soft and a nice size. I can go over my whole face in just a few swipes. It holds just enough powder also. I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> This brush is soft and a good size.  It doesn&#x27;t shed like other brushes.  It&#x27;s great for powder, blush, and bronzer.</li>
            <li> This is a great face brush for the price. I use it to put on the &amp;#34;elf Studio High Definition Loose Face Powder.&amp;#34; The problem is that while putting makeup on my face with it, a few of the hairs come off and onto my face. I don&#x27;t rub it on my face like a mad woman and use light pressure. It beats me why this happens, but hey, I still use it despite it.</li>
            <li> This brush is the best , it give a flawless finish , I love it , it give the same result as an expensive one</li>
            <li> I really like the color and texture of this brush.  In fact, I bought 3 of them, so I can keep one with my makeup at home, one in my suitcase, and one in my makeup bag in my purse.  My only complaint that it&#x27;s difficult to hang onto with such a short handle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good, it applies smoothly. The only thing is it does shed, but for the price, it&#x27;s not a deal breaker.</li>
            <li> Love this brush it does the job and it&#x27;s super cute.  It&#x27;s perfect for traveling or whatever you need it for.</li>
            <li> I bought this for myself and I love it.  Very soft, very fine bristles and applies my mineral powder perfectly.</li>
            <li> These bristles stay in the brush and do not drop off onto my face.  I like that it&#x27;s white rather than black just in case one drops out, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the softest feel on my skin, almost luxurious.  I absolutely love using it.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing, I love it. It really evens out the make to give a fresh and exciting look.</li>
            <li> I love this kabuki brush: it&#x27;s so soft and dense! I&#x27;ve had it for over two years and it still feels like new! It&#x27;s great for applying powder - I like using this to lightly apply the HD Powder as a finishing powder once all of my makeup is done. A fantastic product!</li>
            <li> Great brush for the price.</li>
            <li> I love this brush, it is so soft and puts your make-up on evenly. I have seen a decrease in blemishes as well, I think this is because of the soft brissels. I will definetly be buying more of this product in the future.</li>
            <li> This is my FIRST ELF brush/product, i wanted a kabuki brush, but I didn&#x27;t want to pay the expensive prices for it. I actually purchased this product from target for the same price 6.00$. Its so soft and feels so good on the face, i use it for the setting powder for my foundation mostly.Its very fluffy, maybe too fluffy for some people.....but i love it!!</li>
            <li> It eats up mineral powder but it&#x27;s so freakin soft!  I&#x27;m almost afraid to look to see if it&#x27;s made out of animal hair as it feels like a mink coat.  A gazillion times softer than the kabuki brush that came with the bare minerals kit that always felt harsh on my skin.  I&#x27;ll probably never clean it- I&#x27;d buy another one before going that route as I&#x27;m lazy but this brush is just a dream come true!</li>
            <li> This really served what it&#x27;s suppose to do. The brush is so soft. I love it and I will definitely recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a replacement for a bare minerals brush. Works great and is much softer than bare minerals for a fraction of the price. Would definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> Great little brush for blush. Wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with the low price, but was surprised at the quality. Not the softest, but with the price I was happy with it.</li>
            <li> Soft and easy to use. It doesn&#x27;t smell funny like other kabuki brushes and it&#x27;s very soft. It doesn&#x27;t shed either. Great buy for the price, would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> soft, easy to clean, no smell</li>
            <li> Love it, I use it for my bronzer this brush is so soft</li>
            <li> too soft so it spreads out. this prevents control over where your makeup is applied.  wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product. sorry</li>
            <li> I use these kabuki brushes to apply face powder.  The old one I&#x27;ve been using (made out of a somewhat stiffer bristle) tends to break off and I find little pieces of it on my face.  At first I was sure that this e.l.f. one would go in the thrift-store donation box because it&#x27;s so soft, but I tried it and actually think it works very well.  And no shedding so far!</li>
            <li> I hate when I waste my money. On products that aren&#x27;t worth two cents!! They have better makeup brushes at the dollar store.</li>
            <li> Very excellent quality without killing ya wallet! I would definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly as everyone else said, a phenomenal soft brush at a quarter of the price others charge!!! Love it!</li>
            <li> This brush serves its purpose. It is extremely soft and easy to clean. It works just as well as the more expensive mac 187 duo fibre face brush. Also, as someone with sensitive skin i have to be extremely carful about the tools I use. This brush has in no way irritated my skin. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This brush is great for applying powder.  It seems to be well made, I haven&#x27;t had any loose bristles stick to my face, so that is a plus.</li>
            <li> Works better than most brushes I have paid a lot more money for. It works well with powders and liquids, I love e.l.f. products!!!</li>
            <li> Bought this brush for blending any harsh lines after contouring and it is perfect ! It does exactly what expected and its so soft, also the package arrived very fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brushes that were more expensive than this, and they were so scratchy they left red marks on my face.  But this one is nice and soft, easy to use, helps me apply my mineral makeup evenly, and generally makes my life easier, all for a great price.  So I&#x27;m definitely happy with this buy.</li>
            <li> This brush is so soft and smooth. Perfect size, perfect touch. Leaving you and your make up look flawless! If your looking for a kabuki brush, I highly recommend this! For only $4.29? It&#x27;s so worth it!!</li>
            <li> This is a great makeup brush.  It is small and compact, so it fits in your purse easily.  It is also made well, I use it almost everyday, and so far no bristles left on my face like with some brushes.</li>
            <li> Awesome brush. All the brushes I&#x27;ve owned prior to this brush shed and get tiny gross hairs all over my face. This brush is not only ridiculously soft, but it also does not shed. Yay!</li>
            <li> I love love love this brush, it helps me apply powder and it works great. I love how it&#x27;s soft and not stiff.</li>
            <li> This brush is very soft and easy to use. Admittedly, it is my first brush of this type (I just started using powder recently) so I don&#x27;t have a lot to compare to, but I think it works pretty well and is a good deal for the price. A lot better than the dinky little brush that came with my foundation!</li>
            <li> Felt so great on my face. I have never tried this brand before but I am very happy. I will have to try the other brushes</li>
            <li> There is sooooo much fall out; after one wash many of the bristle were going down the sink and after washing it was never the same; when using it on my face it was like course, like hay</li>
            <li> This brush feels soft as all get-out, but I did expect the bristles to be a little stiffer... They barely hold their shape on the brush. \&lt;br /&gt;That being said the bush works and is great.&lt;br /&gt;The brush is also a bit on the small side- The bottom diameter of the brush is similar to a quarter or dollar-coin.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, gets the job done and isn&#x27;t rough.</li>
            <li> Good soft brush.  Nice size to carry in purse.  I love these fluffy brushes for powdered bronzer.  Pretty black and white bristles too.</li>
            <li> it&#x60;s ok but not so good for my mineral foundation, it&#x60;s too soft</li>
            <li> Brush is soft and full.  Applies loose makeup nicely.  Very cute and compact in size.  Good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> I usually underestimate elf because of the cheap prices. I order this to get a review, and the best idea ever! the brush is so soft, and small enough to put in a travel bag. I LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> So soft! love it! but I saw a slight bit of shedding.. hope it doesn&#x27;t get worst.</li>
            <li> it does the job, and it doesn&#x27;t get dirty.. I recommend it 100 % . . . . . .</li>
            <li> Update, March 4, 2013.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this brush for several weeks now a few of the bristles are starting to come loose. Just a few so the brush is still intact. But I&#x27;d say this is likely a sign of its authenticity. .. or lack thereof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-----------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, this brush seems like an imitation elf, as the elf insignia on the handle is really poorly replicated. Lol&lt;br /&gt;For what I believe to be false advertising I&#x27;m giving 4 not 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, it actually is a very good brush for the $6 price tag. Very comfortable size and super soft. The quality seems good and I always say you can&#x27;t go wrong with a taklon brush. They&#x27;re softer against your skin and more hygienic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is great for use with both compact or loose powder. I haven&#x27;t used it with foundation but read a negative review on that use. To me though, this brush makes no sense for applying wet makeup like foundation. You need a more compact group of bristles for that - in other words, a traditional foundation brush, stipple brush or the elf flat top powder brush are great options for foundation application.</li>
            <li> I really love this powder brush. It really makes a flawless airbrushed like finish and the hairs are not flying off.</li>
            <li> Great brush, totally soft and lovely...good for blush, face powder, etc.</li>
            <li> Amazing brush!!! Love this thing so much! Its soft, applies product evenly, doesnt hurt my face when I pat product onto it. All around great brush!</li>
            <li> This is a great little brush! I apply bronze to my face and this brush distributes it evenly and softly.</li>
            <li> Thought I lost my FAVORITE blush brush on recent trip, so I resorted to trusty amazon to rescue me. I have since found my old, favored blush brush, but it has sadly been replaced with this one. Great control, perfect firmness/ fullness of the bristles(?not sure if thats what they are called), but best part is it is REALLY soft when brushing on my face. Great product</li>
            <li> Very soft and works great!</li>
            <li> I actually use this as a tool to keep my laptop screens and keyboards clean and free of dust/debris and it works amazingly.  I appreciate it&#x27;s compact and portable size and the bristles are as soft as a rabbit which makes me comfortable using on my Mac retina screen.  That said, I&#x27;m certain it would be a wonderful product to utilize for it&#x27;s intended purpose!</li>
            <li> Brush soft to the touch</li>
            <li> Does what it says on the tin. It is just OK</li>
            <li> Good for the price and didn&#x27;t fall apart &#x3D;) . You know how cheap things fall apart this is great</li>
            <li> nice and soft, I love it</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this brush because it had so many great reviews but within the first month of using it the synthetic bristles/hairs started to fall out. I just wasn&#x27;t impressed, it gets the job done but you definitely get what you pay for. I highly recommend the Makeup Forever HD kabuki brush, it is about $22 but it is so soft, distributes powders evenly, and I haven&#x27;t noticed one nylon bristle fall out yet and I&#x27;ve had it for over 6 months now.</li>
            <li> My favorite make up brush it&#x27;s so light</li>
            <li> I use this brush for foundation and blush, and since I don&#x27;t wear foundation or blush very often I keep my brushes in my drawer. It&#x27;s easy to find this one when I need it because it&#x27;s standing upright! I love how small and handheld it is, it makes application easier for me to control. Also, it&#x27;s VERY soft, so it keeps liquid foundation from being streaky and blends blush nicely.</li>
            <li> liked it at first. now not so much.  but that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s not meant for how i&#x27;m using it.  Bought it to apply loose powder that i&#x27;d just bought, but i never wear loose powder, so it was like.. duh, why am i doing this?  so now i use it to put on blush.  it&#x27;s ok, but it&#x27;s just too big and fluffy for that purpose.  also, and this could be more blame of the blush i&#x27;m using than the brush, but after a couple months there&#x27;s a slight odor.  (i use powder blush.... i guess i need to try to clean the brush, but i&#x27;ve never had to clean powdered blush brushes before.)</li>
            <li> On the search for a large fluffy face brush but not wanting to splurge on a sigma or MAC brush i decided to try out ELF. All you need to know are these three things: superb quality (super soft and the dense bristles never seem to fall out), makes blending so much easier, CHEAP. get it. you&#x27;ll thank me.</li>
            <li> Great brush for contouring and blending, will recommend and repurchase!</li>
            <li> Bought this for a special one who says \\&quot;This is my new favorite brush. I can&#x27;t help it but I use it pretty much for everything, powder, bronzer and blush. Very soft, not scratchy and performs. And not to forget to mention how cheap it is. I like it cheap, and good.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> How is this so lovely and perfect at such a cheap price? MAC, take a lesson.</li>
            <li> I love this face brush. I have reordered for myself and my family members. It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> The brush is really really soft and works like a dream!  The price was the main reason I brought this brand, but I am very happy with the quality as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be aware that there isn&#x27;t a case included or a cap attachment to protect the bristles.  Make sure you have a safe place to keep it rather than just letting it float around in your makeup bag, because that would probably damage it.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best brushes since it is so soft and airy!</li>
            <li> Ok I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, yes I had read the other reviews but not all makeup brushes are a like, The price was cheap and these brushes are the BOMB!!!!!!!. They are so soft and they don&#x27;t shred. They are exactually better than the socalled expensive badger hair brushes that I bought some years back. I haven&#x27;t cleaned it yet so we&#x27;ll see that goes but so far it&#x27;s a quality brush. I was amazed bythis brush.</li>
            <li> This kabuki brush is great quality for a nice price. It&#x27;s super soft and does its job well. The only down side for me was horrible packaging. The box the brush came in was torn and ripped, so I was worried if something was wrong with it. But other than that it&#x27;s one of my favorite kabuki brushes and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite makeup powder brush. My powder goes on smoother with this one than any other makeup brush that I&#x27;ve ever used. This makeup holds the mineral makeup perfectly and does a great job for smooth application on to the face.</li>
            <li> I wish it was a bit less soft... its very gentle and blends well. Lets see how long it will laast</li>
            <li> Absolute FAVORITE face brush! So soft, easy to clean and maintains its bristles and shape</li>
            <li> I love this brush. It&#x27;s so soft and so far it hasn&#x27;t shed bristles.</li>
            <li> This brush is my new favorite foundation brush! It is extremely soft and it doesn&#x27;t cake on my makeup. I use a pressed powder foundation and I love that it evenly distributes onto my face. I ended up putting on a little more foundation than usual because I didn&#x27;t want to stop using it, and even with the extra foundation it still had more of an &amp;#34;airbrushed&amp;#34; look. The best part about the brush was that is wasn&#x27;t a million dollars! It was fairly inexpensive to purchase. I also used it for my bronzer as well. It says it can be used to apply liquid foundation, but I do not use liquid so I haven&#x27;t tried it for that. I highly recommend this foundation brush! You won&#x27;t regret the purchase!</li>
            <li> I love this brush! So soft and does its job very well.</li>
            <li> Love this brush. Creates a flawless look.</li>
            <li> great for translucent powder</li>
            <li> Soft and I didn&#x27;t notice much hair falling out. I have been using this brush daily for several months with my Origins powder foundation. Works great with even coverage. Fits compactly into a traveling case and holds up well even though I&#x27;ve been squishing it in a bag.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite brushes to use!</li>
            <li> This is a really great brush, expecially for the price.  I normally use a bigger brush like this for foundation, but this brush is too soft for that.  However, it is a great finishing powder brush, since it can distribute the powder without messing up all my contouring work.</li>
            <li> e.l.f. Studio taklon brushes are now my favorite brushes.  They are not only way cheaper than Bare Escentuals brushes but also nicer to use.  This kabuki brush works great with my Bare Escentuals loose mineral powder foundation.</li>
            <li> It cute but not enough bristles. I can&#x27;t really use this for an even application of powder.</li>
            <li> great value.. super soft. I like it!! :)</li>
            <li> I do love this.I use the mineral powders,and this soft cute brush picks up enough powder for my face without having to dip in again.Did I say its SOFT</li>
            <li> Super soft, high quality, and doesn&#x27;t waste powder product.  Feels so nice on the skin! Love it!</li>
            <li> Nice Full Brush - noticed same brush cheaper at Target.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like the first Kabuki face brush I bought in here ... U definitely should try the one in the zebra case .... I SOOOO LOVE THAT ONE</li>
            <li> I bought three of these, one for me and one for each of my young daighters. They love to spend time in the bathroom with me in the moring getti gready and while i am putting on my makeup they have nothing to do. they are 2 yrs old and 10 months. I bought these thinking they would be perfect for their size hands and that they could pretend along with mommmy. It was perfect! They chew them, brush them on their face. I give them a quick wash at the end of the day and they haev stood up to what my daighters have put them through. As for me, using it as an all over face powder smoother/blender at the finish of my makeup application, I love it. It is soft and not sharp at all. It is just as good as something more expensive.</li>
            <li> I use this for my powder and I love it! I its very soft and applies the powder very well</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t beat these brushes for the price</li>
            <li> For the price, this brush could rival any expensive option. Be very careful while washing it, don&#x27;t get any water into the handle, it will shed!</li>
            <li> Does the job. Very soft and inexpensive. I can replace it when I need to&lt;br /&gt;and not feel bad about spending $$.</li>
            <li> does the trick and doesn&#x27;t shed! who needs to pay $30 for a mac one? when you can get this one for a steal!</li>
            <li> This brush works great and is incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> So soft but firm for some coverage. A little different than my RT powder brush, firmer. Good for applying bronzer and pressed powder.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping, great product!!</li>
            <li> Love this, needed a travel kabuki for my mineral makeup. Have both the large and travel kabukis by bareminerals but they feel soo scratchy I can never bear to use them. Love this one though, cheap yet super soft and full. Love the look too. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this brush!</li>
            <li> I do and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Super coverage.  Use with loose powder, pressed powder.  Use your imagination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also great for craft use.  But buy one just for that!  Do not use just one with your cosmetics and your craft items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was an inexpensive brush but I feel I got a lot of bang for my buck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles stay put in the applicator unlike a lot of other more expensive brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try Eyes Lips Face (ELF)</li>
            <li> The bristles are bit soft and do not do too great of a job with my makeup to do full coverage. I&#x27;ll stick to the Bare Minerals kabuki in the future.</li>
            <li> Great kabuki brush! I normally use the powder brush but I decided to try this one and I LOVE it! Helps make up go on smoothly. Now this brush is mostly used if you want your make up to go on lightly, to look natural. If you are not looking for the natural look and want full coverage, then this brush is not for you.</li>
            <li> I use this for both loose and compact powder.  It works great for both.  I recommend this as a powder brush.</li>
            <li> Before I bought this I was using the bare escentuals $23 brush. After a month that brush started shedding whenever I applied the makeup to my face which was very annoying because I would ruin my foundation trying to get the fallen bristles off my face. This one is a better alternative because it is very soft and perfect for both powder and liquid makeup. It&#x27;s also small so easier to fit into my makeup bag when I&#x27;m on the go. It does shed a little but not enough to ruin my makeup.</li>
            <li> I got this real fast!!! Like the next day,,big surprise!  felt the hair on the brush, very smooth,, im liking it :) would recommend this to anyone using mineral or any kind of powder foundation.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a more oversized brush, but I still love it. Very soft and works great. Good price too.</li>
            <li> The nicest kabuki brush I&#x27;ve owned. Super soft, mineral foundation or powders goes on silky &amp; it applies nicely. Bristles are not shedding either like others. Super brush at a really affordable price. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft and only 6 $ deffenetly worth  it use  it all the time for  bronzed and primer . .</li>
            <li> For the price I will say this brush is pretty good. The bristles are very soft and with proper care it should last a while..</li>
