            <li> I think theraputty is a little better, but this is a less messy second form of treatment.</li>
            <li> a pain for when you used your hand too much over a small span of time and it needs to be rested, and fatigue</li>
            <li> I bought a soft one and it is quite firm enough for my hand (female).  </li>
            <li> The ball shows no signs of wear but the thumb strap has slowly been cracking along the silicon molding line since the first couple weeks.</li>
            <li> This one did not really make sense and it will not fit the fingers of a large hand.</li>
            <li> The loops are shipped separated from the ball and required the use of a tool to reach through the ball to grasp the single loop and pull it through, but it does not slip back out.  </li>
            <li> I was too excited waiting for this item, and when I got it, it didn&#x27;t have the yellow stretching rubber, which basically makes the item useless</li>
            <li> The finger loops hold the ball in your palm when you open your hand wide to stretch.  </li>
            <li> Not much to say about such a simple little product</li>
            <li> yellow bands hurt and too tight.</li>
            <li> This little piece of equipment has brought mobility back to my hand and fingers.  </li>
            <li> I have a little problem in the left hand.</li>
            <li> I need this product for tennis elbow, which is an injury more painful than it sounds.  </li>
            <li> Cheaper than other sites also.</li>
            <li> My husband has a few hand exercise items to help with carpol tunnel due to his work.  </li>
            <li> There is a pain for when you worked your hand a lot the previous day</li>
            <li> Not worth it!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed, and on top of that, I didn&#x27;t find the way to contact the seller so I could communicate the problem.</li>
            <li> So far, as painful as it is to exercise with the little ball, it is making a difference.  </li>
            <li> I hypothesize that replacing broken bands with four rubber bands should be a snap.</li>

            <li> Good exercise for those aching joints!</li>
            <li> Works well.  I think theraputty is a little better, but this is a less messy second form of treatment.</li>
            <li> I need this product for tennis elbow, which is an injury more painful than it sounds.  This product is the recommended one to correct the problem.  So far, as painful as it is to exercise with the little ball, it is making a difference.  I can tell the tendon is building the way it is supposed to be building.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good product for those who are suffering from tennis/golfers elbow.  Incidentally, I neither golf nor play tennis.  My injury is from  computer overuse.  Instead of carpal tunnel syndrome, I got tennis elbow.</li>
            <li> I was too excited waiting for this item, and when I got it, it didn&#x27;t have the yellow stretching rubber, which basically makes the item useless (I would&#x27;ve just bought a therapeutic ball). I was very disappointed, and on top of that, I didn&#x27;t find the way to contact the seller so I could communicate the problem.</li>
            <li> I ordered several toys to strengthen my forefinger and thumb on my right hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soft ball was the best because I could use it the most.</li>
            <li> My husband has a few hand exercise items to help with carpol tunnel due to his work.  This one did not really make sense and it will not fit the fingers of a large hand.</li>
            <li> These are great for flexibility and strengthening.  I just had carpal tunnel surgery and these have served me well!  I am starting with &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; and then moving to more resistance.</li>
            <li> Cool concept, but it&#x27;s really flimsy.</li>
            <li> Not worth it! Needs to be smaller or the rings need to be stronger or not as stretchy. I did not feel it was enough exercise.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted and was delivered very quickly</li>
            <li> Great product. It has helped my recovery from hand surgery. Would Recommend!</li>
            <li> This is a great introduction to hand muscle strengthening.  Just enough resistance to build strength without injury.</li>
            <li> I have developed some hand pain issues due to playing the piano for so many years.  This little piece of equipment has brought mobility back to my hand and fingers.  Great investment.</li>
            <li> I am preparing to go to massage school so I ordered this to strengthen my hands, fingers and wrists and work on flexibility and dexterity.  Really works nicely.  Definitely easy to use.  Being lightweight and portable is a big plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only gave it 4 stars because there were no directions in the box.  The outside of the box only gives 2 exercises but according to a youtube video, the printed instructions that are supposed to come with more than 2.</li>
            <li> Helped me a lot to restore my palm strength after the surgery for carpal tunnel. Would recommend if you need some tool to train and restore fingers movement.</li>
            <li> I have a little problem in the left hand. this product is useful to everyone. it´s the smoother handmaster but is perfect. Buy it</li>
            <li> HOW WELL IT WKRS DONT KNOW MY WOMEN NEVER USED IT. IAM SURE IT WILL HELP YOU. Motion is necessary.</li>
            <li> yellow bands hurt and too tight. Not what I needed. Therapist said not to use this for my surgery rehab</li>
            <li> Not much to say about such a simple little product It is light, portable, easy to use and works as advertised. Cheaper than other sites also.</li>
            <li> To exercise the muscles in your hand, this is very convenient to use.  The finger loops hold the ball in your palm when you open your hand wide to stretch.  I bought a soft one and it is quite firm enough for my hand (female).  The loops are shipped separated from the ball and required the use of a tool to reach through the ball to grasp the single loop and pull it through, but it does not slip back out.  Recommended to me by my chiropractor.</li>
            <li> I got this thing four months ago and I have to say I adore it. It has really strengthened my grip a lot, as advertised. The ball shows no signs of wear but the thumb strap has slowly been cracking along the silicon molding line since the first couple weeks. when it finally snaps, there was another and included in the box. I could not tell and difference between the two silicon bands. I hypothesize that replacing broken bands with four rubber bands should be a snap. (you see what I did there)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it for about two mins on each hand per day. I take it on vacations and notice my muscles atrophying very quickly when I forget it. At first, there was pain but I have since started to learn the meanings and causes of the different types of pain my hands give me. There is a pain for when you worked your hand a lot the previous day and it just needs to be warmed up, a pain for when you used your hand too much over a small span of time and it needs to be rested, and fatigue you feel immediately after an activity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;along with meticulous stretching of the small hand muscles and larger arm and back muscles, i&#x27;m feeling much better now. I haven&#x27;t noticed the ball giving my hands any of the stamina I had hoped it would give me for doing art, but maybe I need to make my tiny workout last longer? I originally could only draw for 20 minutes before fatigue set in: now i&#x27;m back up to an hour of continuous doodling or animating, and that&#x27;s putting me well on the road to where I was in highschool. The ball definitely improved my grip strength, though, and the pain felt  when lifting something with my wrist is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tl;dr: the foam ball with a hole strung with rubber bands has been taken to a whole other level and you need this thing like you need a ball filled with rubber bands. ie: a lot &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Wayyyy better than just a plain squeeze ball. This ball works each finger. And you feel it. I play guitar and it&#x27;s great for strengthening your grip... For killa string bends!</li>
            <li> Must have for carpal tunnel.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 5 yr old son with cerebral palsy (CP). He has a mild case of CP but still has issues with his hands/fingers. This item is relatively easy for him to use. Its relatively easy to re-thread the finger insert, which you will have to do.</li>
