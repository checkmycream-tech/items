            <li>I received my brushes a week ago or so ... &amp; I love them ...</li>
            <li>THE ONE THING THAT IS UN FRIKKIN BELIEVABLE IS THE PRICE???  </li>
            <li>They are OK.</li>
            <li>Way too many for me to EVER use</li>
            <li>I love this makeup brush kit</li>
            <li>I would gladly recommend these brushes.</li>
            <li>Ok so I have now used my brushes and wanted to answer some questions that I had before buying them.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>So like there is no angle to most any of them.</li>
            <li>They are soft and work great with my Pandora make-up.</li>
            <li>The brushes are so soft and they fit great in your hand.  </li>
            <li>but I must admit there is a strong odor from the case</li>
            <li>Overall great product.</li>
            <li>However, the brushes are cheaply made.</li>
            <li>The eye and other blushes are pretty awesome</li>
            <li>Made a super smooth line</li>
            <li>The thick brushes are the best i think, i use the biggest one for powder to set my face, angled one for blush and another one for bronzer.</li>
            <li>And i really like the price too.:)</li>
            <li>The brushes are nice they are soft to touch</li>
            <li>, they clean with baby shampoo, and they rarely shed...</li>
            <li>They are my first set of brushes, before them I had the scratchy ones that came with cheap make-up.</li>
            <li>even better than my old brush!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s is worth the money</li>
            <li>and I love the carrying case it comes in more of a gold other than champagne color.</li>
            <li>plus they got her super fast!</li>
            <li>The order did meet my expectations, this is a good quality, i just love it , very fluffy and gentle .</li>
            <li>I use them often, but they aren&#x27;t really anything special.  </li>
            <li>After opening the first brush I was amazed on the quality.</li>
            <li>:) I defiantly recommend these to anyone especially for a gift.</li>
            <li>These exact brushes were my starter set out of Esthetics School, and I swear, they have lasted me years....</li>
            <li>so if you are looking for a great quality, long lasting set..</li>
            <li>Price, Fast shipping some useful brushes ..</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t get this set if I could review them first, but this is my first \\&quot;set\\&quot; that I have bought.</li>
            <li>The small precision ones look good.</li>
            <li>The smell has gone away and the brushes are super soft on your skin.  </li>
            <li>there was a light chemical smell from the bag, which faded away within several hours.</li>
            <li>thank you so much .Im</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, these brushes apply really well</li>
            <li>Very pleased-they are substantial in weight and well constructed...</li>
            <li>and they don&#x27;t really hold the make up</li>
            <li>She is very thankful for it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The other specialty brushes that are not in this set you should be able to purchase online through Crown Brush...</li>
            <li>metal part from the wood handle), in which case I fixed it with hot glue and no problem.</li>
            <li>My main concern was that they would shed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a simple fix with some super glue</li>
            <li>a decent roll-up case to keep them in.</li>
            <li>Some of the blush and foundation brushes heads came unglued from handle, so will have to super glue back together</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very soft and doesent bother my skin</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>I ordered this brushes and I have to say is exactly as described,I would definitely  order this again when these ones get old.  </li>
            <li>I also received four large face brushes instead of the three in picture, and the bag was different color.</li>
            <li>They are soo soft and there&#x27;s no shedding.</li>
            <li>Use my old estee lauder brush for that.</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft, and I havn&#x27;t noticed any hair falling out of them.</li>
            <li>I had to throw them out because after two washes, mist of the brushes head&#x27;s COMPLETELY FEEL OFF.</li>
            <li>These brushes work well as far as applying makeup is concerned.</li>
            <li>so so : Face brushes are too soft.</li>
            <li>you get some good brushes and some useless, by no means a complete set.</li>
            <li>They are super soft and hardly shed</li>
            <li>They do a good job but are cheaply made so i am doubtful they will last very long.</li>
            <li>I have purchased brushes from other companies, primarily high -end, name brand ones which I won&#x27;t name, but I always go back to these.  </li>

            <li> If I am not mistaken, the company does private labeling for other major companies.....</li>
            <li> They are kind of stiff, which is no good because I prefer my brushed to be a little softer.  </li>
            <li> There is no fluffy small brushes , only flat.</li>
            <li> Crazy CHEAP!~</li>
            <li> I wish they were double sided brushes like my other set.</li>
            <li> I use a couple of them in my daily application of makeup and use some of the other ones when I do face painting for events.</li>
            <li> Did I receive a different set then other reviewers?</li>
            <li> I will keep them because, I&#x27;m too lazy to deal with returning, and by the time I pay for shipping on return I will have spent ten dollars for nothing on shipping to my house and back to seller.</li>
            <li> Small brushes are stiff, flat and soft.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in these brushes because based on the reviews, I was expecting better quality.</li>
            <li> There are a lot of small flat brushes with a rounded head.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> and I just received it less than a week ago.</li>
            <li> The bag does smell a little bit, but it does go away.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on these.</li>
            <li> The bag does have a small odor</li>
            <li> Shortly after using them the glue to the head of the brush must have come loose because at least 4 of the brush heads have come off of the base.</li>
            <li> So the shipping sucks.</li>
            <li> Angled blush brush is useless because when you apply to face brush just spreads flat and you cant control where makeup goes...really sad about that.</li>
            <li> They are poor quality but one of the brush head became unglued and fell off about three days after I began using it.</li>
            <li> They do have a kinda weird smell but is nothing to exaggerate over.</li>
            <li> These brushes smell awful, and shed everywhere.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> These brushes arrived on time as scheduled. After opening the first brush I was amazed on the quality. The bigger brushes come with brush guards. They are super soft and hardly shed but I must admit there is a strong odor from the case but after that&#x27;s washed away you have an awesome set of brushes :) I defiantly recommend these to anyone especially for a gift.</li>
            <li> They are definitely top quality brushes! They are soo soft and there&#x27;s no shedding. I am very satisfied and it&#x27;s a great set plus they got her super fast! LOVE THEM!</li>
            <li> Great brushes! My main concern was that they would shed. I have been using them for almost a month and dont have this problem at all. When i received them ( almost a week before the estimated delivery date! ) there was a light chemical smell from the bag, which faded away within several hours. The thick brushes are the best i think, i use the biggest one for powder to set my face, angled one for blush and another one for bronzer. I wish there was a blending brush for eye shadows in this set though. But. Use my old estee lauder brush for that. Overall great product. And i really like the price too.:)</li>
            <li> I received the brushes as a gift and I love them. The bag does smell a little bit, but it does go away. The brushes are soft, and I havn&#x27;t noticed any hair falling out of them. Good product.</li>
            <li> These brushes smell awful, and shed everywhere. I had to throw them out because after two washes, mist of the brushes head&#x27;s COMPLETELY FEEL OFF. Don&#x27;t waste your money on these.</li>
            <li> I received my brushes a week ago or so ... &amp; I love them ... The price was also great! I&#x27;m very satisfied!! I thought the brushes would shed but I haven&#x27;t had any problems! Awesome quality</li>
            <li> I purchased these to use in cleaning my watch collection as well as dusting objects before photographing them. They do a good job but are cheaply made so i am doubtful they will last very long. At the price they are a fair deal...</li>
            <li> It took about 26 days to get it. The order did meet my expectations, this is a good quality, i just love it , very fluffy and gentle . thank you so much .Im very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> OMG!! These exact brushes were my starter set out of Esthetics School, and I swear, they have lasted me years....literally 8 years! I have purchased brushes from other companies, primarily high -end, name brand ones which I won&#x27;t name, but I always go back to these.  The packaging and handles aren&#x27;t fancy or anything...I think that is the reason these brushes aren&#x27;t as popular...HOWEVER, these brushes apply really well, they clean with baby shampoo, and they rarely shed...I put my make-up brushes through a lot...so if you are looking for a great quality, long lasting set..these babies are IT! The other specialty brushes that are not in this set you should be able to purchase online through Crown Brush...If I am not mistaken, the company does private labeling for other major companies.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I THINK THE ONE THING THAT IS UN FRIKKIN BELIEVABLE IS THE PRICE???  WTH??? Crazy CHEAP!~</li>
            <li> I received my bushes within two days of my order, the quality is amazing, the case is very handy and beautiful.</li>
            <li> These brushes work well as far as applying makeup is concerned. I was happy with the bristle quality and the fact that there is every kind of brush I could ever need in this package. However, the brushes are cheaply made. Shortly after using them the glue to the head of the brush must have come loose because at least 4 of the brush heads have come off of the base. It&#x27;s a simple fix with some super glue but it shouldn&#x27;t have happened.</li>
            <li> The quality isn&#x27;t great, and one of my brushes has fallen apart.  I use them often, but they aren&#x27;t really anything special.  They are kind of stiff, which is no good because I prefer my brushed to be a little softer.  I think the bristles are some form of plastic.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my daughter in law for her career in makeup artist. They are nice brushes and my daughter in law likes them.</li>
            <li> They are OK. I wish they were double sided brushes like my other set. But great for the money.</li>
            <li> I ordered this brushes and I have to say is exactly as described,I would definitely  order this again when these ones get old.  They do have a kinda weird smell but is nothing to exaggerate over.</li>
            <li> This set is very nice for the price, more than expected, i definitively recommand it to anyone, i use it for work, it is just perfect!</li>
            <li> I bought these set about 6 months ago or so. They are my first set of brushes, before them I had the scratchy ones that came with cheap make-up. They have not shed at all. A couple of them came loose(the metal part from the wood handle), in which case I fixed it with hot glue and no problem. They are soft and work great with my Pandora make-up.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use a ton of make-up and have never had a &#x27;set&#x27; of brushes, but for some reason decided to try one. Way too many for me to EVER use but they don&#x27;t shed, work great and a great value-also a decent roll-up case to keep them in. Very pleased-they are substantial in weight and well constructed...I feel like a pro now ..except there are so many, I still don&#x27;t know what they are all for, lol!!</li>
            <li> Some of the blush and foundation brushes heads came unglued from handle, so will have to super glue back together and they don&#x27;t really hold the make up that well but it works. The eye and other blushes are pretty awesome and I love the carrying case it comes in more of a gold other than champagne color. The color of the brush are different too all brown. Expect for like one.</li>
            <li> I love this makeup brush kit it&#x27;s very soft and doesent bother my skin it&#x27;s a good quality It&#x27;s is worth the money</li>
            <li> I ordered this item on june 15 and I just received it less than a week ago. So the shipping sucks. The brushes are nice they are soft to touch but I was hoping to get a variety of brushes a lot of the brushes are duplicates. Over all its good for the price but the company need to get better shipping.</li>
            <li> The travel bag is so nice! I would gladly recommend these brushes. I use a couple of them in my daily application of makeup and use some of the other ones when I do face painting for events.</li>
            <li> I gave this as a Christmas gift and the person I gave it to just loved it! She is very thankful for it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a really big search to get the one that didn&#x27;t smell toxic nor chemical and that was actually of good quality and it definitely is the best ones I found!</li>
            <li> WOW!  I cant believe the quality of brushes you get for the price!  My set arrived on time and was gorgeous!  The brushes are so soft and they fit great in your hand.  The bag does have a small odor but I just let it sit out and open over night and it was gone.  I am going to wash the brushes tonight and I cant wait to start using them!  Awesome quality for the price!!!  A++++&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE!:  Ok so I have now used my brushes and wanted to answer some questions that I had before buying them.  The brushes hold makeup surprising well and disperse the color on your skin awesome!!  The smell has gone away and the brushes are super soft on your skin.  I used the eye liner brush this morning and it kicked butt!!  Made a super smooth line and I was very precise.  even better than my old brush!  :)</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in these brushes because based on the reviews, I was expecting better quality. They are poor quality but one of the brush head became unglued and fell off about three days after I began using it. For the price, I guess the quality matched but I would have liked the brushes stay together.</li>
            <li> Pros : Price, Fast shipping some useful brushes ..not all&lt;br /&gt;The so so : Face brushes are too soft. Small brushes are stiff, flat and soft. Angled blush brush is useless because when you apply to face brush just spreads flat and you cant control where makeup goes...really sad about that. Brushes I received looked different in regards to color of hair then picture posted.I also received four large face brushes instead of the three in picture, and the bag was different color. Did I receive a different set then other reviewers? There are a lot of small flat brushes with a rounded head. Four look the same except for the size. So like there is no angle to most any of them. There is no fluffy small brushes , only flat.The small precision ones look good. The eyebrow groomer brush isnt glued at all and fell off as soon as I picked up to inspect.I guess for twenty bucks you get some good brushes and some useless, by no means a complete set. I will keep them because, I&#x27;m too lazy to deal with returning, and by the time I pay for shipping on return I will have spent ten dollars for nothing on shipping to my house and back to seller. Not worth it. I wouldn&#x27;t get this set if I could review them first, but this is my first \\&quot;set\\&quot; that I have bought. I will now search for something different.</li>
