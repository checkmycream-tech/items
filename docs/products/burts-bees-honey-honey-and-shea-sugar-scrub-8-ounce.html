            <li>you wi love this product!!!! :)</li>
            <li>But, I can&#x27;t say I loved the smell of it.</li>
            <li>Good pricing.</li>
            <li>Very nice sugar scrub with a nice scent.  </li>
            <li>I remember my first jar of this stuff smelling a bit more delicious, but this is still good.</li>
            <li>I love the honey because it works good on my skin.</li>
            <li>I also like the consistency of the scrub, it feels luxurious and smells nice.</li>
            <li>The scent is very strong, though.</li>
            <li>It smells absolutely wonderful, and I went through my first container way too quickly.</li>
            <li>This scrub leaves my skin very smooth.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I never used scrubs before, and I truly enjoyed this one.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of the honey.</li>
            <li>I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products.</li>
            <li>I just love this product.  </li>
            <li>It worked ok in terms of scrubbiness.</li>
            <li>and I love it already.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Much better than baby oil &amp; doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue in the tub.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the fact that it has sodium benzoate; I would feel better about the company if it didn&#x27;t use that stuff at all, but since it isn&#x27;t going on any mucous membranes I will let this one slide.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t LOVE the smell - reminds me a bit of petrochemicals,</li>
            <li>This lovely scrub smells delicious and is extremely moisturizing without a greasy residue.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so smooth and comfortable after using it.</li>
            <li>I love it especially, and my boyfriend is very pleased and said that my skin is as smooth as baby&#x27;s skin</li>
            <li>I was quite excited to try this scrub and ordered it as soon as I saw it.  </li>
            <li>All this for a very reasonable price compared to the high end brands that I have tried and weren&#x27;t as good.</li>
            <li>But I can live with it because of the amazing feeling it leaves for my skin.</li>
            <li>I feel like it dissolves quickly as I use it.</li>
            <li>I have used other moisturizing sugar scrubs before with finer sugar grains and a wonderful fragrance that left my skin just as smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li>While scrubbing all I smell is an acrid mustard smell, though the fragrance left on my skin afterward is nice.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite Burt Bees product by far and has kept my skin glowing for two winters now.</li>
            <li>I use another kind now, cheaper and smells better :) It seems like it could be more grainy, feels a little goopy, especially after you get near the end of the jar.</li>
            <li>I cannot describe exactly what it is</li>
            <li>Well, it is really as the seller describes it: smooths and glows your skin!</li>
            <li>I tossed it after the first use.</li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend it if you&#x27;re looking to exfoliate for the start of summer.</li>
            <li>but I was very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li>The smell is cloying, and you have to use so much each time to get your whole body.</li>
            <li>Makes my feet really slippery.</li>
            <li>This product left my legs feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It is a very high quality product that easily removes dead skin, but also moisturizes very well.  </li>
            <li>This was a new product for me.  </li>
            <li>I used this with my 2-year-old who has excema and developed a rash from a chemical sunscreen.</li>
            <li>and my skin was soft.</li>
            <li>Brightens skin and makes it feel soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>It made my skin so soft I will def.</li>
            <li>The whole jar will probably last me 4 uses.</li>
            <li>The scent is a just little too sweet, which bothers me a bit because I can still smell it after 30min.</li>
            <li>The only thing to note is-- watch out if you take long, hot showers.  </li>
            <li>The scrub was gentle enough for his skin, and the excema and rash are gone after a few days of consistent use.</li>
            <li>It exfoliates gently and moisturizes extremely well.</li>
            <li>But personally, I&#x27;m looking for something that smells good as it works and leaves a little fragrance behind.</li>
            <li>This scrub did leave my dry skin feeling soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>, I thought it lacked sugar so it was really just a runny mess.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s bees is a product and it did the job very good...I love the honey because it works good on my skin.</li>
            <li> I used this with my 2-year-old who has excema and developed a rash from a chemical sunscreen. The scrub was gentle enough for his skin, and the excema and rash are gone after a few days of consistent use. The scent is very strong, though.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item after reading a raving review in a  magazine. I was extremely disappointed. First it has a very unpleasant smell. I cannot describe exactly what it is but it was not appealing in the least. Second I did not like the sugar to liquid ratio, I thought it lacked sugar so it was really just a runny mess.  I am a big Burt&#x27;s Bee fan and was looking forward to trying this product but I was very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> This scrub did leave my dry skin feeling soft and moisturized. That said, the sugar grains were large and rough, and the smell is horrible. While scrubbing all I smell is an acrid mustard smell, though the fragrance left on my skin afterward is nice. I have used other moisturizing sugar scrubs before with finer sugar grains and a wonderful fragrance that left my skin just as smooth and moisturized. I won&#x27;t buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I use this on my feet and legs and the results are wonderful. I no longer have any callouses and now can wear any sandal and my heels etc. look great. I also like the consistency of the scrub, it feels luxurious and smells nice. All this for a very reasonable price compared to the high end brands that I have tried and weren&#x27;t as good.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It smells absolutely wonderful, and I went through my first container way too quickly. The only thing to note is-- watch out if you take long, hot showers.  I do that, and towards the end of the container, it went from a sugar scrub to a sugar syrup.  Yeah, the sugar melted and it became unusable.  But it still smelled great.</li>
            <li> Well, it is really as the seller describes it: smooths and glows your skin! I love it especially, and my boyfriend is very pleased and said that my skin is as smooth as baby&#x27;s skin (I know it is a bit exaggerating but I do feel like that)</li>
            <li> This product is awesome!!! I love how it makes your skin feel after you take a shower using it!!! Skin feels moisturizered!!!! If you have dry skin you wi love this product!!!! :)</li>
            <li> This was a new product for me.  I never used scrubs before, and I truly enjoyed this one. I love the smell of the honey.</li>
            <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products. I expected to smell honey since that&#x27;s part of the description. It only smelled like oily cream. The sugar does exfoliate well and it rinses well and my skin was soft. But personally, I&#x27;m looking for something that smells good as it works and leaves a little fragrance behind.</li>
            <li> Brightens skin and makes it feel soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I just love this product.  It is a great shower addition. One of the best in the line. It is great.</li>
            <li> It worked ok in terms of scrubbiness. But, I can&#x27;t say I loved the smell of it. I hate to have to go back to B&amp;B but their scrubs do smell delicious.</li>
            <li> This was a surprise purchase for the gf. She so enjoys sugar scrubs and this one was well-received! I would certainly recommend it if you&#x27;re looking to exfoliate for the start of summer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once and I love it already.It made my skin so soft I will def. buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a black male late twentie, very sensative to razors on my face. After exfoliating every night I was hardly getting any ingrown hairs. Now I just exfoliate before I shave and I&#x27;m having no problems with bumbs.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees.  I was quite excited to try this scrub and ordered it as soon as I saw it.  The scrub serves it purpose but I just can&#x27;t get past the smell.  It could just be me but it smells terrible, I can&#x27;t even describe the smell.  I tossed it after the first use.</li>
            <li> This product left my legs feeling soft and smooth. I got this product as a gift, and I am not officially a lover of Burt&#x27;s Bees products. I will definitely use this again!</li>
            <li> I get a foot sugar scrub from my regular masseuse but like to use this in between visits.  It also works wonderful on elbows.</li>
            <li> I have used this once a week on my arms and bum since I bought it. It&#x27;s not too rough. I feel like it dissolves quickly as I use it. I think this is because the scrub is composed of scratchy yet dissolvable ingredients like sugar and salt.</li>
            <li> I think this is the best scrub ever made!  It is a very high quality product that easily removes dead skin, but also moisturizes very well.  This isn&#x27;t a wimpy scrub!  I love this product.</li>
            <li> Such luxury! This lovely scrub smells delicious and is extremely moisturizing without a greasy residue. I use it to shave with instead of shaving cream and my legs are smoother and softer. Much better than baby oil &amp; doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue in the tub. Try it for yourself! You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I remember my first jar of this stuff smelling a bit more delicious, but this is still good. It leaves a moisturized feel to the skin.  I don&#x27;t like the fact that it has sodium benzoate; I would feel better about the company if it didn&#x27;t use that stuff at all, but since it isn&#x27;t going on any mucous membranes I will let this one slide.</li>
            <li> This scrub leaves my skin very smooth.  Don&#x27;t LOVE the smell - reminds me a bit of petrochemicals, tho&#x27; I don&#x27;t believe that&#x27;s actually what I&#x27;m smelling!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite Burt Bees product by far and has kept my skin glowing for two winters now.</li>
            <li> The smell is cloying, and you have to use so much each time to get your whole body. The whole jar will probably last me 4 uses.</li>
            <li> This is my first time buying beauty product online, and I did feel nervous because sweet scent can be disgusting sometimes. This turns out great! My skin feels so smooth and comfortable after using it. The scent is a just little too sweet, which bothers me a bit because I can still smell it after 30min. But I can live with it because of the amazing feeling it leaves for my skin.</li>
            <li> Very nice sugar scrub with a nice scent.  Good pricing.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! It exfoliates gently and moisturizes extremely well. When combined with Burt&#x27;s Bees Honey and Shea Body Butter, the results are awesome.</li>
            <li> Makes my feet really slippery. I use another kind now, cheaper and smells better :) It seems like it could be more grainy, feels a little goopy, especially after you get near the end of the jar.</li>
