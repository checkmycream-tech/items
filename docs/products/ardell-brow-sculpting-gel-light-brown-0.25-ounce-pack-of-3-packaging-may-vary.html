            <li>I love this eyebrow gel and tint!  </li>
            <li>I like this product SO much better!</li>
            <li>I am happy with my purchase of Ardell Brow Sculpting Gel, it is easy to use and stays in place</li>
            <li>Goes on easily with an applicator brush and looks great.</li>
            <li>Great for applying after you have filled in sparse areas on your brows.</li>
            <li>I opened one, liked the color,</li>
            <li>Received in very good condition and very new.</li>
            <li>I had been looking all over for a product like this and was very pleased to find that amazon.com had it and at a fantastic price.  </li>
            <li>I loved this product because I don&#x27;t always have time to do the full eyebrow grooming routine in the morning.  </li>
            <li>stays on colours &amp; sets don&#x27;t need tinting but don&#x27;t have tinting if make up free love this product!</li>
            <li>I have these on subscription, need I say more?</li>
            <li>So glad to have it.</li>
            <li>Love the color</li>
            <li>This product, with it&#x27;s mascara-style wand, does an excellent job of only covering the hairs without drawing &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; brows on your skin.  </li>
            <li>Still, I like it much better than pencils or powders.</li>
            <li>After I ordered and tried the product, I was glad I received a triple shipment.  </li>
            <li>SInce I had chemotherapy and lost most of my eyebrows this items helped me out a lot.</li>
            <li>The color is more auburn and that is part of why I don&#x27;t like it.  </li>
            <li>It looks much better in the picture.  </li>
            <li>Works OK.  </li>
            <li>Color is a nice, rich brown.</li>
            <li>The light brown color is perfect for my almost all white eye brows.</li>
            <li>However, the light brown I ordered is more of an auburn color.  </li>
            <li>This fits great into that part of my makeup collection that allows me to quickly get ready and still look polished.</li>
            <li>Easy to remove.</li>
            <li>Perfect color as it does not look so dark</li>
            <li>Brow Sculpting Gel, Light Brown - make my eyebrows look fuller.  </li>
            <li>It costs more, but worth it.</li>
            <li>This product was light and gel like.</li>
            <li>I ordered light brown.  </li>
            <li>It is a light consistency as some noted, but that works for me.</li>
            <li>A product called Wunderbrow available through Soft Surroundings is a much superior product.</li>
            <li>ON GOOD AND LOOKS NATURAL.</li>
            <li>If the brows are full &amp;  have good natural color</li>
            <li>lol strange but true.</li>
            <li>and I am glad I have so much I can wear it every day..</li>
            <li>The tint is minimal, just enough to make my brows a tad more visible, but great for any time in the day.</li>
            <li>Looks natural &amp; better than pencil.</li>
            <li>It goes on nicely with low residue.</li>
            <li>But I still need brow powder to make my eyebrows look right</li>
            <li>The color is light--definitely a medium sort of brown, but it looks a lot better to have less than more when it comes to eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I normally buy Merle Norman brow sealer in light brown.  </li>
            <li>I have very light blonde eyebrows</li>
            <li>I have used a similar product from Origins and it was much more expensive, it worked slightly better, but they no longer make it, and this is a great alternative.  </li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>FIRST TIME I HAVE USED THIS BROW</li>
            <li>I use these as I have sparse eyebrows, and they really look great, like wearing mascara on your eyelashes to have them look thick and lustrous,</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Not much of a gel, more like an eyelash consistency.</li>
            <li>Then this morning (six weeks later) I found the gel had decomposed into a light brown liquid with all of the darker color settling into the bottom of the container.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t really provide much color at all; it&#x27;s almost like using water color on your eyebrows.</li>
            <li>and I have light red hair.</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t add much color at all.  </li>
            <li>So - it controls but doesn&#x27;t color much.  </li>
            <li>THE COLOR WAS LISTED AS LIGHT BROWN BUT IS VERY RED !!</li>
            <li>I REALLY</li>
            <li>Much cheaper that</li>
            <li>It adds just a little color to your eyebrows - plus has just enough gel that it will sculpt your eyebrows very nicely.</li>
            <li>I was very glad to come across this product on Amazon, as I am aware of only one other company that produces a tinted brow gel, at five times the price.</li>
            <li>Good because much cheaper than GloMinerals but not nearly as good.  </li>
            <li>The brush tip is much too large for the average person to make a refined brow line; however if you already have heavy brows and you just want to add more color, it probably be OK.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting a little more color.  </li>
            <li>Only used a few times,  a nice product</li>
            <li>so I was very surprised this works for my skin tone.</li>
            <li>It goes on almost clear.  </li>
            <li>I have blonde eyebrows and this doesn&#x27;t really seem to make a difference at all.</li>
            <li>Very thin when applied, no where near as good as the MAC or Anastasia eyebrow gel.</li>
            <li>I have thinning brows, some little whispy hairs are there but don&#x27;t show up, so this make my brows look full without coloring the skin..</li>
            <li>felt it was just thick enough to create more \\&quot;volume\\&quot; and definition to my brows.</li>
            <li>I bought the 3 pack of these, waste of money, I am very blonde, and it was pretty much colorless, went and bought the another powder gel for 3 times the $</li>
            <li>(The Anastasia product is darker and heavier and if I&#x27;m not really careful, I end up looking beetle-browed!)</li>
            <li>HARD TO FIND A LIGHT BROWN GEL</li>
            <li>I have blond eyebrows, which are barely visible without makeup.</li>
            <li>It barely gives any color or tint though if you want that then buy a powder instead.</li>
            <li>Must admit I was greatly surprised and relieved to find that it actually makes the &amp;#34;non-existent&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Unless you&#x27;re a true makeup artist, this product is too hard to use.  </li>
            <li>Need to make a dark blonde that is an ashen color, can&#x27;t find a good color to use for a blonde.</li>
            <li>Color was good, too bad there was no gel.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Need to make a dark blonde that is an ashen color, can&#x27;t find a good color to use for a blonde.</li>
            <li> Color was good, too bad there was no gel.</li>
            <li> any other product I&#x27;ve found so far.  </li>
            <li> After a few uses, I find this brow gel doesn&#x27;t go on dark enough to do much for my blonde eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> It seems a bit dry to apply heavily enough.  </li>
            <li> I ordered another product first, like another reviewer, that is very dark and heavy.  </li>
            <li> It takes me a very long time to see any color on my brow...</li>
            <li> One tube was dry.</li>
            <li> and then my eyebrows actually match my hair color, which is a dark blond.</li>
            <li> I color my hair dark blonde, and in a pinch I can use it to hide my gray roots.</li>
            <li> Perhaps ordering a darker color would solve the issue of natural fill look, but not sure.  </li>
            <li> so I went back and ordered my previous brow product.  </li>
            <li> Harder to apply.</li>
            <li> It is not heavy or thick, at all.</li>
            <li> Any color darker than this will be too dark, as in the Frida Kahlo look.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the trade.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that the product is thick and doesn&#x27;t always coat the wand evenly.  </li>
            <li> Thank you none the less.</li>
            <li> This product works well, but I should have gotten a little darker shade.  </li>
            <li> Covers my few gray eyebrows and keeps them in place.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> Seems too thin and doesn&#x27;t cling to the brow enough for me.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it is too dark for my blonde hair type or my complexion.</li>
            <li> The applicator brush makes it very difficult to apply...and the gel is very watery.</li>
            <li> This product is almost impossible to find in stores, so order a big supply.</li>
            <li> This product is so thin in consistency it does not even coat them</li>
            <li> I am not happy that I have three of these brow gels to deal with.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I bought three of these.</li>
            <li> and they are very thin</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with the product.  </li>
            <li> I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED BY THIS PRODUCT.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> The product is good.  However, the light brown I ordered is more of an auburn color.  I would order a darker brown next time</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted for my brows.</li>
            <li> Only used a few times,  a nice product</li>
            <li> I really like this product. Covers my few gray eyebrows and keeps them in place.</li>
            <li> I bought the 3 pack of these, waste of money, I am very blonde, and it was pretty much colorless, went and bought the another powder gel for 3 times the $ but it works, get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> I have very light blonde eyebrows and they are very thin so you cannot even see them if I dont use a gel or some color on them.  This product is so thin in consistency it does not even coat them so I went back and ordered my previous brow product.  I will not order this product again.</li>
            <li> I use these as I have sparse eyebrows, and they really look great, like wearing mascara on your eyelashes to have them look thick and lustrous, this&lt;br /&gt;Ardell Brow Sculpting Gel, Light Brown - make my eyebrows look fuller.  Perfect color as it does not look so dark that makes my eyebrows look like Frida Kahlo&#x27;s.  (Hint: Google is our friend) and I am olive skinned so I was very surprised this works for my skin tone. Any color darker than this will be too dark, as in the Frida Kahlo look.  I have these on subscription, need I say more?</li>
            <li> I had been looking all over for a product like this and was very pleased to find that amazon.com had it and at a fantastic price.  This product is great.  It adds just a little color to your eyebrows - plus has just enough gel that it will sculpt your eyebrows very nicely.</li>
            <li> The light brown color is perfect for my almost all white eye brows. So glad to have it. thank you.</li>
            <li> I have blond eyebrows, which are barely visible without makeup. So this is perfect to brush on and then my eyebrows actually match my hair color, which is a dark blond. I can&#x27;t find anything like this in stores. Also great that you get 3 of them, which makes it a good deal.</li>
            <li> I had another brand (WunderBrow) and I thought this brand would be similar. The applicator brush makes it very difficult to apply...and the gel is very watery. It takes me a very long time to see any color on my brow...although I am brushing for 5 minutes. Too time consuming. I will order the Wunder Brow next time. It costs more, but worth it.</li>
            <li> One tube was dry. Not much of a gel, more like an eyelash consistency. Color was good, too bad there was no gel.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping it would make my eyebrows look darker and maybe thicker but it doesn&#x27;t do either. I you just want to sculpt your brows then it&#x27;s fine and it smells really good! lol strange but true. It barely gives any color or tint though if you want that then buy a powder instead.</li>
            <li> I am happy with my purchase of Ardell Brow Sculpting Gel, it is easy to use and stays in place</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I bought three of these. I opened one, liked the color, felt it was just thick enough to create more \\&quot;volume\\&quot; and definition to my brows. Then this morning (six weeks later) I found the gel had decomposed into a light brown liquid with all of the darker color settling into the bottom of the container.</li>
            <li> Keeps the brows under control as promised. The tint is minimal, just enough to make my brows a tad more visible, but great for any time in the day.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t really provide much color at all; it&#x27;s almost like using water color on your eyebrows. I have blonde eyebrows and this doesn&#x27;t really seem to make a difference at all.</li>
            <li> Great for applying after you have filled in sparse areas on your brows. Holds brow hairs in place all day. Easy to remove. Color is a nice, rich brown.</li>
            <li> This product was light and gel like. Not sufficient to color my sparse eyebrows. The color was perfect, reddish brown. But I still need brow powder to make my eyebrows look right</li>
            <li> I would buy again. Looks natural &amp; better than pencil.</li>
            <li> Love the color and I have light red hair. Goes on easily with an applicator brush and looks great.</li>
            <li> The sculpting gel seems to give my brows a finished look and the are shiny.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cover gray hairs.  Would not buy again or recommend.</li>
            <li> I normally buy Merle Norman brow sealer in light brown.  I thought I&#x27;d try this for the price.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  This has not tint to it and doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Very thin when applied, no where near as good as the MAC or Anastasia eyebrow gel. Not worth the trade.</li>
            <li> Best product I&#x27;ve ever found, and I have tried tons at all price points for my thinning, graying brows. This product is almost impossible to find in stores, so order a big supply.</li>
            <li> The brush is similar to a mascara brush so there needs to be &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; for it to work. Have no idea how someone would &amp;#34;sculpt&amp;#34; a brow using that type of brush. A product called Wunderbrow available through Soft Surroundings is a much superior product.</li>
            <li> I have used a similar product from Origins and it was much more expensive, it worked slightly better, but they no longer make it, and this is a great alternative.  I have thinning brows, some little whispy hairs are there but don&#x27;t show up, so this make my brows look full without coloring the skin.. I bought the 3 pack because it was inexpensive and I am glad I have so much I can wear it every day..</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with the product.  It really doesn&#x27;t add much color at all.  If the brows are full &amp;  have good natural color it would Hebrew of some help.</li>
            <li> This product, with it&#x27;s mascara-style wand, does an excellent job of only covering the hairs without drawing &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; brows on your skin.  The only downside is that the product is thick and doesn&#x27;t always coat the wand evenly.  Still, I like it much better than pencils or powders.</li>
            <li> stays on colours &amp; sets don&#x27;t need tinting but don&#x27;t have tinting if make up free love this product!</li>
            <li> Unless you&#x27;re a true makeup artist, this product is too hard to use.  The brush tip is much too large for the average person to make a refined brow line; however if you already have heavy brows and you just want to add more color, it probably be OK.  I just prefer another product that I purchase through online Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this eyebrow gel and tint!  It is perfect for someone with thinning and gray eyebrows.  It is perfect.  After I ordered and tried the product, I was glad I received a triple shipment.  I ordered another product first, like another reviewer, that is very dark and heavy.  I like this product SO much better!</li>
            <li> Good product, good price</li>
            <li> Very good product, will have to re-order more</li>
            <li> After a few uses, I find this brow gel doesn&#x27;t go on dark enough to do much for my blonde eyebrows.  I ordered light brown.  It goes on almost clear.  So - it controls but doesn&#x27;t color much.  I&#x27;m going to return and try one shade darker. If that one doesn&#x27;t work, I&#x27;ll refrain from using this product again.</li>
            <li> I really like Ardell products and they are ususally not available in local stores.  SInce I had chemotherapy and lost most of my eyebrows this items helped me out a lot. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I like the product. It is a light consistency as some noted, but that works for me. I like the way it colors the brow hair not just marking the skin like pencils do. It also happens to work well as a touch up on my hair roots I discovered. I color my hair dark blonde, and in a pinch I can use it to hide my gray roots. It goes on nicely with low residue.</li>
            <li> I brush this onto my brows, and its perfect.  It gives my brows just enough color to give shape to my eye area. It is not heavy or thick, at all.</li>
            <li> I am not happy that I have three of these brow gels to deal with.  The color is more auburn and that is part of why I don&#x27;t like it.  It looks much better in the picture.  Perhaps ordering a darker color would solve the issue of natural fill look, but not sure.  I am using my brow powder than this over until the three are gone.  Not soon enough</li>
            <li> I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED BY THIS PRODUCT. THE COLOR WAS LISTED AS LIGHT BROWN BUT IS VERY RED !! DID NOT COVER AT ALL AND CLUMPED. IT WAS ONLY OFFERED AS A SET OF THREE SO NOW I AM STUCK WITH SOMETHING I WILL NEVER USE !! I ONLY BROUGHT THIS AS MAYBELLINE HAS DISCONTINUED THE BROW GEL THEY USED TO MAKE WHICH WAS A WONDERFUL PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Good because much cheaper than GloMinerals but not nearly as good.  Harder to apply.</li>
            <li> This product works well, but I should have gotten a little darker shade.  It goes on well and stays well.</li>
            <li> I was allergic to the product.  It caused flaking on my eyebrows, as though they had dandruff.  Stopped using and the flakes went away.</li>
            <li> Need to make a dark blonde that is an ashen color, can&#x27;t find a good color to use for a blonde.</li>
            <li> Works OK.  I was expecting a little more color.  Price is very good</li>
            <li> Received in very good condition and very new. Unfortunately it is too dark for my blonde hair type or my complexion. Thank you none the less.</li>
            <li> I loved this product because I don&#x27;t always have time to do the full eyebrow grooming routine in the morning.  This fits great into that part of my makeup collection that allows me to quickly get ready and still look polished.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product, but would like to try a medium brown perhaps you can send me a sample</li>
            <li> I have a white (skin colored) mole in the middle of my eyebrow. I bought ybf eyebrow pencil, I get great coverage with that, but somehow I thought this would be easier to apply. For my situation, this didn&#x27;t work, and I gambled and purchased a three pack, that I&#x27;ll never use!</li>
            <li> I was very glad to come across this product on Amazon, as I am aware of only one other company that produces a tinted brow gel, at five times the price. Anastasia Tinted Brow Gel Brunette 0.32 oz The color is light--definitely a medium sort of brown, but it looks a lot better to have less than more when it comes to eyebrows. (The Anastasia product is darker and heavier and if I&#x27;m not really careful, I end up looking beetle-browed!) A great find!</li>
            <li> I purchased this not having a clue as to what it would do or even it it would work.  Must admit I was greatly surprised and relieved to find that it actually makes the &amp;#34;non-existent&amp;#34; brow look &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; again and would definitely recommend to those of you who need to &amp;#34;redesign&amp;#34; your brow.  I really like it!</li>
            <li> FIRST TIME I HAVE USED THIS BROW GEL I REALLY LIKE IT GOES ON GOOD AND LOOKS NATURAL. I USED ANOTHER BRAND BEFORE BUT THEY DISCONTINUED. HARD TO FIND A LIGHT BROWN GEL THIS ONE IS GREAT.</li>
            <li> Perfect and the price is just right!</li>
            <li> I have to keep applying it to get the effect I want.  It seems a bit dry to apply heavily enough.  The price was good so I guess I&#x27;ll buy it again and just keep applying.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as others I have ordered have. Seems too thin and doesn&#x27;t cling to the brow enough for me.</li>
            <li> The stuff I used to use was discontinued.  Happy to have it.  Will order it again and recommend to others</li>
            <li> This is great!  Much cheaper that any other product I&#x27;ve found so far.  It cover my brows and makes them look thicker and darker, which is what I want.  (Mine are thin and light).  I will but from this seller again.</li>
