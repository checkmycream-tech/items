            <li>XTAVA provided a lot of information about how to use the curling iron, plus pleasant emails asking how I was doing (great marketing on their part); however, I just could not develop the technique for using the iron.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks amazing with this!</li>
            <li>Love it, great time saver in the morning!</li>

            <li>but it looks more like I&#x27;ve crimped my hair!</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>and they were pretty awesome.</li>
            <li>hopefully it can help me learn and curl better!</li>
            <li>This curling iron is amazing.  </li>
            <li>It is something that I can deal with since the rest of it works so amazingly well</li>
            <li>This curling iron is amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled with this product</li>
            <li>The style of the iron looks as if it will generate a nice spiral curl.</li>
            <li>When we were able to hold our hair in it and twist it, the hair looked good.  </li>
            <li>It seemed to make a nice curl but had the kink at the end.:</li>
            <li>I received this product in exchange for an honest review, but this did not sway the quality of my review whatsoever.</li>
            <li>The best part for me is how reasonable price it is.</li>
            <li>I see this curling iron being a popular gift for the holidays.</li>
            <li>I have avoided heat except for sitting under a warm dryer.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly I was pleased with the results the Xtava Spiral Hair Curler gave me.</li>
            <li>Honestly, whoever wrote these reviews had to have been paid reviewers.  </li>
            <li>Makes nice curls.</li>
            <li>I really liked that about it.</li>
            <li>I returned the product and bought a wand instead, which is super easy to use and makes the perfect curls every time.</li>
            <li>Even if your new to doing your hair this is perfect.</li>
            <li>is the design flaw with the cord, it gets very easily tangled up</li>
            <li>It is also very easy to hold and</li>
            <li>This is by far the best invention ever!  </li>
            <li>The Xtava Professional Curling Iron is awesome!</li>
            <li>This curling iron is by far, the best one I have used for my hair.</li>
            <li>I ended up getting a curling wand (the kind without the clamp) and a heat-resistant glove and that&#x27;s the better option...</li>
            <li>and was so easy to use!</li>
            <li>It seems to effectively maintain a nice steady hot temperature, around 400 degrees, and the curls come out perfect, and hold all day.</li>
            <li>This curling iron is also very comfortable to use, as some irons have caused my hands to cramp.</li>
            <li>It is very light weight</li>
            <li>It curls perfectly, if you don&#x27;t mind all your hair on the same direction.</li>
            <li>I love the look of this to start.</li>
            <li>The swirls on the barrel is actually a guide, that way you can have perfect uniformed curls.</li>
            <li>Ok I love it</li>
            <li>I am in love with this curling iron.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve paid double this price for curlers that were nothing as great as this!</li>
            <li>i really love it</li>
            <li>was given this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li>I told her I could find a better one</li>
            <li>; look that many women want to achieve.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this curling iron.</li>
            <li>and I wasnt able to use it ?</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this iron.</li>
            <li>I love that there&#x27;s no danger of burning myself.</li>
            <li>My sister used this product and she was extremely pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Make sure to use a heat protection spray or serum.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure I didn&#x27;t affect the product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad..!!</li>
            <li>ok.</li>
            <li>I think this is better for someone who has shoulder length or medium length hair, not longer hair like I have.</li>
            <li>, I received item for free in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li>I love the curling iron</li>
            <li>hahahaha, very nice products</li>
            <li>Very nice product, and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I was worried with some of the comments about getting your hair stuck in the spiral foundation, but really what&#x27;s best, as when using any curling iron, is brush and straighten your hair first, BEFORE you use this.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m happy with my new toy for my hair</li>
            <li>I love that it is so easy to use</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought it because it&#x27;s easy to use</li>
            <li>I am happy with this Professional Curling Iron, i love it.</li>
            <li>It produces the perfect curl every single time.</li>
            <li>cheap very light in weight</li>
            <li>Not only that, it looks good too!</li>
            <li>It looks a bit funny, but the function is pretty great.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I am a lefty and it is not as easy to use for a lefty than a righty.</li>
            <li>It truly is easy to use</li>
            <li>This curler is easy to use and easy to take control of strands of my hair so that I can wrap it up without burning myself.</li>
            <li>, it’s easy to use for beginners like me and it makes my hair look healthier.</li>
            <li>This one is so easy to use and curls</li>
            <li>and once you get used to it, it&#x27;s easy.  </li>
            <li>The iron is easy to use, too.</li>
            <li>but I figured why not buy this and play...very easy to use</li>
            <li>and it came pretty fast!!!!!</li>
            <li>I always have perfect curls and I am able to reproduce those curls for my whole entire head of hair.</li>
            <li>and if you have already damaged hair or fine hair, I would not recommend this iron.</li>
            <li>It has an interesting design, it heats up quickly</li>
            <li>Heats up quick!</li>
            <li>comfortable--</li>
            <li>She specifically said she wanted to try and curl her hair because I had mentioned in passing how great I thought she&#x27;d look with firy red curls.</li>
            <li>and I dont think all of it would fit in that curling iron.</li>
            <li>So worth 2 thumbs up and more.</li>
            <li>It take some practice, but once you figure out how to use correctly it will be smooth sailing for you.</li>
            <li>Love this... Very easy to use for my 12 year old...</li>
            <li>My hair holds all day and it&#x27;s super easy to use.</li>
            <li>According to her, it&#x27;s easy to use and heats up quickly.</li>
            <li>I love the concept and for someone who hasn&#x27;t been doing hair long or wants to try this for first time curling iron this would be perfect.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this giving me nice curls</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was perfect to give it back the curl, and not the wildness that I naturally have.</li>
            <li>Well, I ended up being the maid of honor for a friends wedding and wanted to do something special with my hair.</li>
            <li>I was super excited to receive this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful blue color, and made very well.</li>
            <li>Not only did I not end up with tangles, the curls came out beautifully and lasted the whole evening.</li>
            <li>To get the curls I had to use soo much hair spray then more after.  </li>
            <li>I think if it had a bigger hook or stronger grasp in which to hold your hair or something it would be a good product.  </li>
            <li>I finally gave up for about a good year.</li>
            <li>She uses it on a daily basis and I’ve always loved the way her curls looked.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this curling iron.  </li>
            <li>and I get beautiful curls in less time.</li>
            <li>Such a great product, worth the investment, really cheat and get&#x27;s the job done!</li>
            <li>She said that it created great curls that she had not gotten with other curling irons, and also that it heated quickly which was a plus</li>
            <li>Only one  advise: put the cord longer because  sometimes&lt;br /&gt;you need to move it  around the head and it is a bit short, but it is the best curling iron i have seen.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m never able to consistently reproduce curls that are almost perfect.</li>
            <li>would be nice if it was a cord more like other curling irons or straighteners.  </li>
            <li>Even my 12 year old loves it because she says it doesn&#x27;t burn her hand so easily and makes it easy for her to curl her hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m right handed, and for the life of me, couldn&#x27;t get the right angle to twist!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this curling iron to anyone that wants a easy way to get staying curl in their hair.  </li>
            <li>It gives you that soft, beautiful curl that last all day for me.</li>
            <li>I have stick straight fine hair and wanted something that would add some waves to my hair.  </li>
            <li>It really works once you get comfortable with it.</li>
            <li>amazing my hair is pin straight and usually curls fall out completely an hour after I curl my hair, but they lasted beautifully untill</li>
            <li>the wand itself makes great curls, but the piece that holds the hair in place actually catches hair under it frequently.</li>
            <li>What I love most about it, is that it is really low maintenance and isn&#x27;t very taxing to do every morning.</li>
            <li>The curls are so beautiful and long-lasting I usually don&#x27;t even use hair spray.</li>
            <li>Most importantly learn how to use your opposite hand.</li>
            <li>I will warn you the tip where the white is fine to touch, but the blue plastic part where the rod is get very warm.</li>
            <li>Perhaps if they sold a product in different lengths (i.e. one offered for those with significantly longer hair, that would be better).</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curling iron heats up pretty quickly, and the plastic all around prevents you from burning yourself.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curling iron came in a really nice black box for easy storage.</li>
            <li>This curling iron looked so cool and all the reviews were so positive</li>
            <li>Put that comb right up against your head and then turn it up to the head.</li>
            <li>I believe this would work well on the right length hair.</li>
            <li>Right now I&#x27;m rating the project at four stars because like I said before I just got it haven&#x27;t did nothing but 3 curls with it</li>
            <li>But would defiantly recommend if you know what your doing but for a first time curler maybe something more old school</li>
            <li>I know this has some great reviews, but it just doesn&#x27;t work for my fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li>Curling irons have never been able to curl my hair and the ones that do, well they fall flat quickly.</li>
            <li>However, after multiple attempts over the course of a few days, I could not handle the hair I was losing trying to perfect spiral curls.  </li>
            <li>Also, the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>so I have used many different products to curl my hair.</li>
            <li>thank you so much!  </li>
            <li>and I get better curls than I did with winding my hair manually on a standard 1&amp;#34; curling iron.  </li>
            <li>I say this because it took my sisters kinky curly natural hair to smooth and sleek spirals.</li>
            <li>It does take a bit of effort the first time you use it though.</li>
            <li>This iron makes Really pretty curls but pulls hair quite a bit.</li>
            <li>She said that it&#x27;s sturdy and curls consistently.</li>
            <li>TO USE SEND IT BACK FOR BED HEAD 3/4&#x27;SPIRAL IRON THAT I LOVE</li>
            <li>Not only did my wife love it</li>
            <li>I have never been able to curl my hair and have the curls actually stay in all day.</li>
            <li>I would love a wider barrel for bigger curls.</li>
            <li>I have been through countless curling irons over the years, and none have outperformed, or looked better than this curling iron.</li>
            <li>No curls just hot</li>
            <li>if it would even curl without getting tangled and Friday in the first place</li>
            <li>and it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>It works very well and heats up fast and does the job quickly</li>
            <li>Only if it&#x27;s a super humid day will I use spray just as curl &amp;#34;insurance.&amp;#34; Because honestly, these curls last.</li>
            <li>This curler would be perfect with someone with short to mid-length hair, that isn&#x27;t too thick.</li>
            <li>After having read many of the reviews, and considering there were more positive than negative reviews, I decided to pull the trigger on this item and try it.</li>
            <li>The curling iron itself, only curls about 6 inches high of your hair, so for someone with hair as long as mine, it actually wasn&#x27;t much of a great look, but as soon as I cut it, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll look a whole lot</li>
            <li>The curler heats up very quickly and stays hot throughout my entire use.</li>
            <li>I have long hair and it doesn&#x27;t curl all the way up, but that&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>It has to go a certain way</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to have it needly straight but enough to where it&#x27;s easy to twist your hair into this product.</li>
            <li>Finally a curling iron that works on fine hair</li>
            <li>my hair is shoulder length, not very thick, could not get my hair around this, it is too fat to be useful for someone with my hair</li>
            <li>Then I found this one - my favorite thing about it is being able to use it to style my hair in tight curls - for a formal &#x27;updo&#x27; like I recently did, or using it to make my hair look glossy and wavy.  </li>
            <li>in all, I liked the curler very much, but for someone with long hair like me, it did prove to be a bit time consuming to curl, because of the blue spiral guides.</li>
            <li>Over the years it hasn&#x27;t become much easier until this curler.  </li>
            <li>I order the pink and love it..</li>
            <li>They curl very spirally, and very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not one to put much products in my hair, Shampoo, Conditioner, and some Argan oil,</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say very well, how well it would hold with hair gel, or mousse,</li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>all the girls of my daughters come home to ask me , how much did  you&lt;br /&gt;pay</li>
            <li>(and the price is very affordable as well, another plus)</li>
            <li>The one thing my wife kept telling me was that she didn&#x27;t have to worry about  being burned because it cools fast.</li>
            <li>I really like this.</li>
            <li>No matter how soon I get them sprayed, my hair is always straight by the end of the</li>
            <li>Heats up really fast</li>
            <li>since she tends to get ready in a hurry.</li>
            <li>are some helpful tips: Do not clip your hair at the very ends.</li>
            <li>This makes it much easier to roll up without the hair strands coming out.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll give another review once I curl my whole head.</li>
            <li>I have incredibly straight hair so curling can take quite a while to get done.</li>
            <li>My daughter even wants to borrow it from me now.</li>
            <li>But the bottom of my hair that I did curl, the curls came out really</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend buying this product!</li>
            <li>My hot curlers and flat irons caused significant damage to my hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have a product that doesn&#x27;t damage my hair and allows me the style versatility I was missing.</li>
            <li>When curling hair make sure you take an old flat comb.</li>
            <li>Do not use to much hair or otherwise you will not be able to release the end and gently pull down the iron so the hair slides out.</li>
            <li>how well it curled my hair and I have extremely thick but fine hair!!</li>
            <li>I used to try to get loose waves or curls with a regular curling iron, as I have very straight hair, but never ever was able to achieve the look I wanted.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m older</li>
            <li>Clever idea</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it’s a decent product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly, and it retains it&#x27;s heat the entire time I am using it.</li>
            <li>the curling irons don&#x27;t get hot enough, while others get too hot.</li>
            <li>high....</li>
            <li>Nice but hard to use, this cant roll my hair in it</li>
            <li>It is primarily plastic, and there are rough edges that pull my hair and cause breakage.  </li>
            <li>So Far I like the Xtava curling wand I haven&#x27;t played with it too much, but i did put a couple of curls in my hair to test it out</li>
            <li>The shipment came fast (because I have prime), it was nearly package there was a dent in the box that the wand came in</li>
            <li>I use it on my natural hair and my clip-in extensions for a long eye-catching look and for fabulous up-dos.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and does the trick, not quite sure what those complaining about found so complicated.</li>
            <li>Being that I have SUPER long hair, I have a lot of difficulty with curling irons.</li>
            <li>Now I purchased the spiral curling iron, and for special  occasions, I have loose curls all over, put my fingers thru it, and that&#x27;s it.  </li>
            <li>I have problems styling it at times, because of the length, so anytime I get to try something new, I&#x27;m all for</li>
            <li>This is a new curling iron that I wanted to try out.</li>
            <li>As you can see pictured below, only about one half of a strand for me will fit up the spiral guide (forcing me to curl the top half of my hair first</li>
            <li>Love that it came it either blue, orange or pink.  </li>
            <li>My hair is super long, down to my waist, and is super straight.</li>
            <li>This definitely surprised me!</li>
            <li>It does the exact opposite of that.</li>
            <li>I have long, fun hair and this curling iron</li>
            <li>I have been avoiding chemicals and excessive heat in my hair for more than two years.</li>
            <li>I would consider other XTAVA products because the company is so customer service friendly.</li>
            <li>Simple and Fast to use nothing more then a few seconds per curl and your on your way for the day or night.</li>
            <li>Also with a price at this low getting this would save in all the perms and salon runs just for some curls on a special or simple day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get any where near hot enough to hold a curl...</li>
            <li>Cheap design and will pass along to my little sister.</li>
            <li>curls, ho~ho i feel young.</li>
            <li>Just stick with old fashioned hair curling irons..</li>
            <li>Personally, I don’t know much about curling irons and the like, but this iron works quite well for me.  </li>
            <li>Friends of mine could have sworn that I had gotten a professional spiral perm.</li>
            <li>Not a  handy as it looks more time consuming</li>
            <li>It can be a pain to sleep with curlers in your hair, even the soft foam ones</li>
            <li>and so only the bottom part of my hair really got curled.</li>
            <li>I can do both but harder with my right hand.</li>
            <li>It really burn my hair and having fine hair that&#x27;s not a good thing</li>
            <li>couldn&#x27;t give this product a full 5 stars, because I had a lot of trouble with my hair getting stuck in the hair clip, and pulling strands of my hair out, gave for a bit of a painful curl, but I must say, that the curls were SUPER nice.</li>
            <li>The only thing I would say is it takes a while to cool down after you have heated it up.  </li>
            <li>I have very long hair, it&#x27;s so long that I can sit on it right now.</li>
            <li>I figured it would end up like all the other ones I had gotten where it wouldn&#x27;t get hot enough, but I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I feel like I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different kinds (I have long straight hair), so</li>
            <li>But if you are not careful, you may end up pulling out some hair, which is a con that I’ve noticed.</li>
            <li>I have also sent one to my younger sister, and she so far has not gone a day without it.</li>
            <li>hair was left with soft and bouncy spirals.</li>
            <li>I love the idea and concept behind this.</li>
            <li>but after a few tries I found it easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These curlers left my hair feeling smooth and not dry and hard.</li>
            <li>Like most of the other curling irons I have tried in the past, this curling iron falls short of my needs being that I have longer hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always found straighteners and curlers not very easy on the hands, but this is the exact opposite.</li>
            <li>I was definitely a bit of a skeptic, but after the first few uses, I think it&#x27;s a must have product.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re tired of being frustrated with curlers, this will be your new best friend!</li>
            <li>It heats up really fast and has a little plastic guard at the end</li>
            <li>My hair is too short, fine, and thin for this design.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Works great though</li>
            <li> Love the curls with no frizz!!</li>
            <li> XTAVA provided a lot of information about how to use the curling iron, plus pleasant emails asking how I was doing (great marketing on their part); however, I just could not develop the technique for using the iron.  </li>
            <li> My hair looks amazing with this!</li>
            <li> Love it, great time saver in the morning!</li>
            <li> She said they have a really good curling iron.</li>
            <li> What I really loved was the outreach by the seller.</li>
            <li> curling iron works really good.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my oldest daughter she loves it so much!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just glad she was happy...</li>
            <li> This iron is safe and makes great curls.</li>
            <li> but it looks more like I&#x27;ve crimped my hair!</li>
            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> and they were pretty awesome.</li>
            <li> hopefully it can help me learn and curl better!</li>
            <li> This curling iron is amazing.  </li>
            <li> It is something that I can deal with since the rest of it works so amazingly well</li>
            <li> This curling iron is amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled with this product</li>
            <li> The style of the iron looks as if it will generate a nice spiral curl.</li>
            <li> When we were able to hold our hair in it and twist it, the hair looked good.  </li>
            <li> It seemed to make a nice curl but had the kink at the end.:</li>
            <li> I received this product in exchange for an honest review, but this did not sway the quality of my review whatsoever.</li>
            <li> The best part for me is how reasonable price it is.</li>
            <li> I see this curling iron being a popular gift for the holidays.</li>
            <li> I have avoided heat except for sitting under a warm dryer.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly I was pleased with the results the Xtava Spiral Hair Curler gave me.</li>
            <li> Honestly, whoever wrote these reviews had to have been paid reviewers.  </li>
            <li> Makes nice curls.</li>
            <li> I really liked that about it.</li>
            <li> I returned the product and bought a wand instead, which is super easy to use and makes the perfect curls every time.</li>
            <li> Even if your new to doing your hair this is perfect.</li>
            <li> is the design flaw with the cord, it gets very easily tangled up</li>
            <li> It is also very easy to hold and</li>
            <li> This is by far the best invention ever!  </li>
            <li> The Xtava Professional Curling Iron is awesome!</li>
            <li> This curling iron is by far, the best one I have used for my hair.</li>
            <li> I ended up getting a curling wand (the kind without the clamp) and a heat-resistant glove and that&#x27;s the better option...</li>
            <li> and was so easy to use!</li>
            <li> It seems to effectively maintain a nice steady hot temperature, around 400 degrees, and the curls come out perfect, and hold all day.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is also very comfortable to use, as some irons have caused my hands to cramp.</li>
            <li> It is very light weight</li>
            <li> It curls perfectly, if you don&#x27;t mind all your hair on the same direction.</li>
            <li> I love the look of this to start.</li>
            <li> The swirls on the barrel is actually a guide, that way you can have perfect uniformed curls.</li>
            <li> Ok I love it</li>
            <li> I am in love with this curling iron.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve paid double this price for curlers that were nothing as great as this!</li>
            <li> i really love it</li>
            <li> was given this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I told her I could find a better one</li>
            <li> ; look that many women want to achieve.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this curling iron.</li>
            <li> and I wasnt able to use it ?</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this iron.</li>
            <li> I love that there&#x27;s no danger of burning myself.</li>
            <li> My sister used this product and she was extremely pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Make sure to use a heat protection spray or serum.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure I didn&#x27;t affect the product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad..!!</li>
            <li> ok.</li>
            <li> I think this is better for someone who has shoulder length or medium length hair, not longer hair like I have.</li>
            <li> , I received item for free in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> I love the curling iron</li>
            <li> hahahaha, very nice products</li>
            <li> Very nice product, and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I was worried with some of the comments about getting your hair stuck in the spiral foundation, but really what&#x27;s best, as when using any curling iron, is brush and straighten your hair first, BEFORE you use this.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m happy with my new toy for my hair</li>
            <li> I love that it is so easy to use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought it because it&#x27;s easy to use</li>
            <li> I am happy with this Professional Curling Iron, i love it.</li>
            <li> It produces the perfect curl every single time.</li>
            <li> cheap very light in weight</li>
            <li> Not only that, it looks good too!</li>
            <li> It looks a bit funny, but the function is pretty great.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I am a lefty and it is not as easy to use for a lefty than a righty.</li>
            <li> It truly is easy to use</li>
            <li> This curler is easy to use and easy to take control of strands of my hair so that I can wrap it up without burning myself.</li>
            <li> , it’s easy to use for beginners like me and it makes my hair look healthier.</li>
            <li> This one is so easy to use and curls</li>
            <li> and once you get used to it, it&#x27;s easy.  </li>
            <li> The iron is easy to use, too.</li>
            <li> but I figured why not buy this and play...very easy to use</li>
            <li> and it came pretty fast!!!!!</li>
            <li> I always have perfect curls and I am able to reproduce those curls for my whole entire head of hair.</li>
            <li> and if you have already damaged hair or fine hair, I would not recommend this iron.</li>
            <li> It has an interesting design, it heats up quickly</li>
            <li> Heats up quick!</li>
            <li> comfortable--</li>
            <li> She specifically said she wanted to try and curl her hair because I had mentioned in passing how great I thought she&#x27;d look with firy red curls.</li>
            <li> and I dont think all of it would fit in that curling iron.</li>
            <li> So worth 2 thumbs up and more.</li>
            <li> It take some practice, but once you figure out how to use correctly it will be smooth sailing for you.</li>
            <li> Love this... Very easy to use for my 12 year old...</li>
            <li> My hair holds all day and it&#x27;s super easy to use.</li>
            <li> According to her, it&#x27;s easy to use and heats up quickly.</li>
            <li> I love the concept and for someone who hasn&#x27;t been doing hair long or wants to try this for first time curling iron this would be perfect.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this giving me nice curls</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was perfect to give it back the curl, and not the wildness that I naturally have.</li>
            <li> Well, I ended up being the maid of honor for a friends wedding and wanted to do something special with my hair.</li>
            <li> I was super excited to receive this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful blue color, and made very well.</li>
            <li> Not only did I not end up with tangles, the curls came out beautifully and lasted the whole evening.</li>
            <li> To get the curls I had to use soo much hair spray then more after.  </li>
            <li> I think if it had a bigger hook or stronger grasp in which to hold your hair or something it would be a good product.  </li>
            <li> I finally gave up for about a good year.</li>
            <li> She uses it on a daily basis and I’ve always loved the way her curls looked.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this curling iron.  </li>
            <li> and I get beautiful curls in less time.</li>
            <li> Such a great product, worth the investment, really cheat and get&#x27;s the job done!</li>
            <li> She said that it created great curls that she had not gotten with other curling irons, and also that it heated quickly which was a plus</li>
            <li> Only one  advise: put the cord longer because  sometimes&lt;br /&gt;you need to move it  around the head and it is a bit short, but it is the best curling iron i have seen.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m never able to consistently reproduce curls that are almost perfect.</li>
            <li> would be nice if it was a cord more like other curling irons or straighteners.  </li>
            <li> Even my 12 year old loves it because she says it doesn&#x27;t burn her hand so easily and makes it easy for her to curl her hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m right handed, and for the life of me, couldn&#x27;t get the right angle to twist!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this curling iron to anyone that wants a easy way to get staying curl in their hair.  </li>
            <li> It gives you that soft, beautiful curl that last all day for me.</li>
            <li> I have stick straight fine hair and wanted something that would add some waves to my hair.  </li>
            <li> It really works once you get comfortable with it.</li>
            <li> amazing my hair is pin straight and usually curls fall out completely an hour after I curl my hair, but they lasted beautifully untill</li>
            <li> the wand itself makes great curls, but the piece that holds the hair in place actually catches hair under it frequently.</li>
            <li> What I love most about it, is that it is really low maintenance and isn&#x27;t very taxing to do every morning.</li>
            <li> The curls are so beautiful and long-lasting I usually don&#x27;t even use hair spray.</li>
            <li> Most importantly learn how to use your opposite hand.</li>
            <li> I will warn you the tip where the white is fine to touch, but the blue plastic part where the rod is get very warm.</li>
            <li> Perhaps if they sold a product in different lengths (i.e. one offered for those with significantly longer hair, that would be better).</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curling iron heats up pretty quickly, and the plastic all around prevents you from burning yourself.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curling iron came in a really nice black box for easy storage.</li>
            <li> This curling iron looked so cool and all the reviews were so positive</li>
            <li> Put that comb right up against your head and then turn it up to the head.</li>
            <li> I believe this would work well on the right length hair.</li>
            <li> Right now I&#x27;m rating the project at four stars because like I said before I just got it haven&#x27;t did nothing but 3 curls with it</li>
            <li> But would defiantly recommend if you know what your doing but for a first time curler maybe something more old school</li>
            <li> I know this has some great reviews, but it just doesn&#x27;t work for my fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li> Curling irons have never been able to curl my hair and the ones that do, well they fall flat quickly.</li>
            <li> However, after multiple attempts over the course of a few days, I could not handle the hair I was losing trying to perfect spiral curls.  </li>
            <li> Also, the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> so I have used many different products to curl my hair.</li>
            <li> thank you so much!  </li>
            <li> and I get better curls than I did with winding my hair manually on a standard 1&amp;#34; curling iron.  </li>
            <li> I say this because it took my sisters kinky curly natural hair to smooth and sleek spirals.</li>
            <li> It does take a bit of effort the first time you use it though.</li>
            <li> This iron makes Really pretty curls but pulls hair quite a bit.</li>
            <li> She said that it&#x27;s sturdy and curls consistently.</li>
            <li> TO USE SEND IT BACK FOR BED HEAD 3/4&#x27;SPIRAL IRON THAT I LOVE</li>
            <li> Not only did my wife love it</li>
            <li> I have never been able to curl my hair and have the curls actually stay in all day.</li>
            <li> I would love a wider barrel for bigger curls.</li>
            <li> I have been through countless curling irons over the years, and none have outperformed, or looked better than this curling iron.</li>
            <li> No curls just hot</li>
            <li> if it would even curl without getting tangled and Friday in the first place</li>
            <li> and it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> It works very well and heats up fast and does the job quickly</li>
            <li> Only if it&#x27;s a super humid day will I use spray just as curl &amp;#34;insurance.&amp;#34; Because honestly, these curls last.</li>
            <li> This curler would be perfect with someone with short to mid-length hair, that isn&#x27;t too thick.</li>
            <li> After having read many of the reviews, and considering there were more positive than negative reviews, I decided to pull the trigger on this item and try it.</li>
            <li> The curling iron itself, only curls about 6 inches high of your hair, so for someone with hair as long as mine, it actually wasn&#x27;t much of a great look, but as soon as I cut it, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll look a whole lot</li>
            <li> The curler heats up very quickly and stays hot throughout my entire use.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and it doesn&#x27;t curl all the way up, but that&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li> It has to go a certain way</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to have it needly straight but enough to where it&#x27;s easy to twist your hair into this product.</li>
            <li> Finally a curling iron that works on fine hair</li>
            <li> my hair is shoulder length, not very thick, could not get my hair around this, it is too fat to be useful for someone with my hair</li>
            <li> Then I found this one - my favorite thing about it is being able to use it to style my hair in tight curls - for a formal &#x27;updo&#x27; like I recently did, or using it to make my hair look glossy and wavy.  </li>
            <li> in all, I liked the curler very much, but for someone with long hair like me, it did prove to be a bit time consuming to curl, because of the blue spiral guides.</li>
            <li> Over the years it hasn&#x27;t become much easier until this curler.  </li>
            <li> I order the pink and love it..</li>
            <li> They curl very spirally, and very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not one to put much products in my hair, Shampoo, Conditioner, and some Argan oil,</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say very well, how well it would hold with hair gel, or mousse,</li>
            <li> It works really well.</li>
            <li> all the girls of my daughters come home to ask me , how much did  you&lt;br /&gt;pay</li>
            <li> (and the price is very affordable as well, another plus)</li>
            <li> The one thing my wife kept telling me was that she didn&#x27;t have to worry about  being burned because it cools fast.</li>
            <li> I really like this.</li>
            <li> No matter how soon I get them sprayed, my hair is always straight by the end of the</li>
            <li> Heats up really fast</li>
            <li> since she tends to get ready in a hurry.</li>
            <li> are some helpful tips: Do not clip your hair at the very ends.</li>
            <li> This makes it much easier to roll up without the hair strands coming out.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll give another review once I curl my whole head.</li>
            <li> I have incredibly straight hair so curling can take quite a while to get done.</li>
            <li> My daughter even wants to borrow it from me now.</li>
            <li> But the bottom of my hair that I did curl, the curls came out really</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend buying this product!</li>
            <li> My hot curlers and flat irons caused significant damage to my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have a product that doesn&#x27;t damage my hair and allows me the style versatility I was missing.</li>
            <li> When curling hair make sure you take an old flat comb.</li>
            <li> Do not use to much hair or otherwise you will not be able to release the end and gently pull down the iron so the hair slides out.</li>
            <li> how well it curled my hair and I have extremely thick but fine hair!!</li>
            <li> I used to try to get loose waves or curls with a regular curling iron, as I have very straight hair, but never ever was able to achieve the look I wanted.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m older</li>
            <li> Clever idea</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it’s a decent product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly, and it retains it&#x27;s heat the entire time I am using it.</li>
            <li> the curling irons don&#x27;t get hot enough, while others get too hot.</li>
            <li> high....</li>
            <li> Nice but hard to use, this cant roll my hair in it</li>
            <li> It is primarily plastic, and there are rough edges that pull my hair and cause breakage.  </li>
            <li> So Far I like the Xtava curling wand I haven&#x27;t played with it too much, but i did put a couple of curls in my hair to test it out</li>
            <li> The shipment came fast (because I have prime), it was nearly package there was a dent in the box that the wand came in</li>
            <li> I use it on my natural hair and my clip-in extensions for a long eye-catching look and for fabulous up-dos.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and does the trick, not quite sure what those complaining about found so complicated.</li>
            <li> Being that I have SUPER long hair, I have a lot of difficulty with curling irons.</li>
            <li> Now I purchased the spiral curling iron, and for special  occasions, I have loose curls all over, put my fingers thru it, and that&#x27;s it.  </li>
            <li> I have problems styling it at times, because of the length, so anytime I get to try something new, I&#x27;m all for</li>
            <li> This is a new curling iron that I wanted to try out.</li>
            <li> As you can see pictured below, only about one half of a strand for me will fit up the spiral guide (forcing me to curl the top half of my hair first</li>
            <li> Love that it came it either blue, orange or pink.  </li>
            <li> My hair is super long, down to my waist, and is super straight.</li>
            <li> This definitely surprised me!</li>
            <li> It does the exact opposite of that.</li>
            <li> I have long, fun hair and this curling iron</li>
            <li> I have been avoiding chemicals and excessive heat in my hair for more than two years.</li>
            <li> I would consider other XTAVA products because the company is so customer service friendly.</li>
            <li> Simple and Fast to use nothing more then a few seconds per curl and your on your way for the day or night.</li>
            <li> Also with a price at this low getting this would save in all the perms and salon runs just for some curls on a special or simple day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get any where near hot enough to hold a curl...</li>
            <li> Cheap design and will pass along to my little sister.</li>
            <li> curls, ho~ho i feel young.</li>
            <li> Just stick with old fashioned hair curling irons..</li>
            <li> Personally, I don’t know much about curling irons and the like, but this iron works quite well for me.  </li>
            <li> Friends of mine could have sworn that I had gotten a professional spiral perm.</li>
            <li> Not a  handy as it looks more time consuming</li>
            <li> It can be a pain to sleep with curlers in your hair, even the soft foam ones</li>
            <li> and so only the bottom part of my hair really got curled.</li>
            <li> I can do both but harder with my right hand.</li>
            <li> It really burn my hair and having fine hair that&#x27;s not a good thing</li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t give this product a full 5 stars, because I had a lot of trouble with my hair getting stuck in the hair clip, and pulling strands of my hair out, gave for a bit of a painful curl, but I must say, that the curls were SUPER nice.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would say is it takes a while to cool down after you have heated it up.  </li>
            <li> I have very long hair, it&#x27;s so long that I can sit on it right now.</li>
            <li> I figured it would end up like all the other ones I had gotten where it wouldn&#x27;t get hot enough, but I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different kinds (I have long straight hair), so</li>
            <li> But if you are not careful, you may end up pulling out some hair, which is a con that I’ve noticed.</li>
            <li> I have also sent one to my younger sister, and she so far has not gone a day without it.</li>
            <li> hair was left with soft and bouncy spirals.</li>
            <li> I love the idea and concept behind this.</li>
            <li> but after a few tries I found it easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These curlers left my hair feeling smooth and not dry and hard.</li>
            <li> Like most of the other curling irons I have tried in the past, this curling iron falls short of my needs being that I have longer hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always found straighteners and curlers not very easy on the hands, but this is the exact opposite.</li>
            <li> I was definitely a bit of a skeptic, but after the first few uses, I think it&#x27;s a must have product.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re tired of being frustrated with curlers, this will be your new best friend!</li>
            <li> It heats up really fast and has a little plastic guard at the end</li>
            <li> My hair is too short, fine, and thin for this design.  </li>
            <li> Plus I have super long thick hair</li>
            <li> and I was actually using a flat iron to curl my hair.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair that reaches the middle of my back.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To cut the long story short, my wife loves this iron curler!</li>
            <li> I am a female with really long hair, which I have always dyed, so getting a perm is out of the question for me.</li>
            <li> The hair located around my face I could spiral all the way to my roots, but since my hair is so long in the back</li>
            <li> I brought this item because I didn&#x27;t know how to curl with flat irons</li>
            <li> I have really long hair and could only get part of my hair into the curling part of it</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyhow, it works well, especially if you have long hair.</li>
            <li> Very difficult to use on your own hair.</li>
            <li> The other &#x27;wrap-around&#x27; ones were too short of a base for me, but this curls great.</li>
            <li> I tried several times to use this piece of junk and every single time, the clip just gets caught on your hair and rips it out.  </li>
            <li> In order to do the other side of your head, yo have to use your opposite hand because the iron will only roll up in one direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant at first, but looked at a few videos on Youtube and thought i would give it a try....</li>
            <li> Could never get my long hair to go into the grooves.  </li>
            <li> i crossed the forties long time ago</li>
            <li> Even when I hold the iron for a long period of time, my hair will just not curl.</li>
            <li> and I spent the day shopping recently</li>
            <li> Very hard to use at first,</li>
            <li> By morning time when my hair is dry, I have curls.</li>
            <li> The only down side to this.</li>
            <li> Coming in 3 different colors lets you add a little flare and could even match your style alone.</li>
            <li> I used this, sprayed a little hair spray, and my curls are still holding up even on the second day!</li>
            <li> The iron and instructions were just floating loose in the box!</li>
            <li> Needless to say I use this curling iron everyday now, and really enjoy the outcome I get.</li>
            <li> The thicker your hair the harder it will be to curl.</li>
            <li> It took a couple tries to get it going.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s really no way around that which I can find.</li>
            <li> but I could not get it to wrap around this curling iron - it kept slipping out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*I have been partially reimbursed for the cost of this product</li>
            <li> I always used to have trouble with traditional curling irons</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no burning smell and the curls lasted longer than I expected.</li>
            <li> Much harder to use than implied.</li>
            <li> My last ION is unusable because as my hair got longer, it was too heavy to pin up.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s different from other curling irons that I&#x27;ve used and it does take a little practice to get used to it</li>
            <li> I have long thick curly hair, so I straighten it of course, daily.</li>
            <li> A little awkward to use, but I think once I&#x27;m used to it it will be fine.</li>
            <li> not worth the money spent; thrown away.</li>
            <li> I received my package when they told me and it was just what I expected!</li>
            <li> but it was about $30 bucks cheaper than any other product like it in beauty stores.</li>
            <li> I just received this item the other day and have not had the chance to use it yet.  </li>
            <li> The struggle to hold your hair in place and twist was not worth it.</li>
            <li> Not really worth the money.</li>
            <li> Not worth the time</li>
            <li> and then the bottom half).  </li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair and finding a curler that works for me has been a nightmare.</li>
            <li> Curls my thick long hair and lasts all day!!</li>
            <li> I usually roll my hair into small foam curlers at night when it&#x27;s wet and sleep in them.</li>
            <li> You can do a few directions and curls with this wand.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair that never wants to hold a curl, and the curls fall out in just minutes.</li>
            <li> Maybe my hair is too short (shoulder-length) or too thin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had trouble with curling irons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> hard to curl one side of head vs other</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair and it usually takes a ton of time, not with this.</li>
            <li> In fact, it takes no more than 10 minutes to have me hair done.</li>
            <li> and I was nervous about getting it for her because of past curling irons, but the Xtava brand handled it.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if they make this one in a cordless</li>
            <li> no, I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> I usually use rollers because I have been avoiding using heat curlers.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I been using it for the past 5 months and it does the job</li>
            <li> I have a hard time using it.</li>
            <li> PLACTIC &amp; HARD</li>
            <li> My hair is too thick for this.</li>
            <li> This iron doesn&#x27;t work well on my thick hair.  </li>
            <li> She has thick hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe if you had alot of thick hair,  but still, the hair does not stay in the curling part.&lt;br /&gt;Would not reccommend.</li>
            <li> This is an unbelievable curling iron!</li>
            <li> It was also a bit difficult, because I have uneven hair, so I couldn&#x27;t get it to stay in place to curl through the guides.</li>
            <li> Its not good there is no instruction inside the box</li>
            <li> This is defintely not made for thin hair, it does not work at all as a curling iron for me.  </li>
            <li> I like how thin you can separate the hair for this.</li>
            <li> its useless...</li>
            <li> Cord gets all twisted up.</li>
            <li> There are no illustrated instructions, and the written instructions it comes with are somewhat useless.</li>
            <li> Sorry.  </li>
            <li> It was a very frustrating process.</li>
            <li> Very frustrating.</li>
            <li> I am always afraid of burning myself when I curl my hair and this curling iron takes away all that fear.</li>
            <li> I had a spiral iron that was awkward to use</li>
            <li> Very difficult to use-stays in the cabinet now</li>
            <li> difficult to use, I hate it</li>
            <li> The price isn&#x27;t bad either.</li>
            <li> im disappointed</li>
            <li> but I hate the cord it tangles up too bad</li>
            <li> Piece of crap.  </li>
            <li> I have always hated using a curling iron because my hair gets all wrapped around and tangled.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing, seeing that it was supposed to be a Christmas gift!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, my girlfriend was looking forward to using it.</li>
            <li> the product was awful do not buy</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Does not perform according to the description....not worth the money spent; thrown away.</li>
            <li> Nice but hard to use, this cant roll my hair in it</li>
            <li> My iron arrived in a box that was opened and had no plastic wrapping around it at all. The box was all scratched up and marred. It was obviously a returned item. The iron and instructions were just floating loose in the box! Very disappointing, seeing that it was supposed to be a Christmas gift!</li>
            <li> This product arrived in Venezuela on time. Excellent product.-</li>
            <li> Very difficult to use on your own hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is too thick for this. My daughter just loves it.</li>
            <li> Finally a curling iron that works on fine hair</li>
            <li> Had to return it.  Could never get my long hair to go into the grooves.  It was a very frustrating process.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t care for the way it curls</li>
            <li> Did not work well with my hair</li>
            <li> It curls perfectly, if you don&#x27;t mind all your hair on the same direction.</li>
            <li> I love the look of this to start. It looks a bit funny, but the function is pretty great. The swirls on the barrel is actually a guide, that way you can have perfect uniformed curls. Just clip a section of hair into the clip at the bottom and follow the guide with your hair. This definitely surprised me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m older so I have used many different products to curl my hair. Remember the 80&#x27;s BIG hair? Yeah, that was me.  To get the curls I had to use soo much hair spray then more after.  Over the years it hasn&#x27;t become much easier until this curler.  It curled and stay curled as it hung.  The spiral curls are awesome.  I will be gifting my niece one for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Love that it came it either blue, orange or pink.  I order the pink and love it.. It is so easy to use.  Love the curls with no frizz!! Curled my hair in uniformed curls in no time.</li>
            <li> I was super excited to receive this product. It&#x27;s a beautiful blue color, and made very well. My hair is super long, down to my waist, and is super straight. I have problems styling it at times, because of the length, so anytime I get to try something new, I&#x27;m all for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curling iron heats up pretty quickly, and the plastic all around prevents you from burning yourself. There is only an on/off button, so there is no temperature setting at all. Whatever it heats to, that&#x27;s what you get. The curling iron itself, only curls about 6 inches high of your hair, so for someone with hair as long as mine, it actually wasn&#x27;t much of a great look, but as soon as I cut it, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll look a whole lot better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t give this product a full 5 stars, because I had a lot of trouble with my hair getting stuck in the hair clip, and pulling strands of my hair out, gave for a bit of a painful curl, but I must say, that the curls were SUPER nice. They curl very spirally, and very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not one to put much products in my hair, Shampoo, Conditioner, and some Argan oil, and that&#x27;s about it. I can&#x27;t say very well, how well it would hold with hair gel, or mousse, but without it, the curls took quite well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I liked the curler very much, but for someone with long hair like me, it did prove to be a bit time consuming to curl, because of the blue spiral guides. It was also a bit difficult, because I have uneven hair, so I couldn&#x27;t get it to stay in place to curl through the guides. This curler would be perfect with someone with short to mid-length hair, that isn&#x27;t too thick. The thicker your hair the harder it will be to curl. BUT, I can&#x27;t deny how well it curls. It works really well.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this Professional Curling Iron, i love it. i crossed the forties long time ago and i look like fifteen now with&lt;br /&gt;my curls, ho~ho i feel young. hahahaha, very nice products all the girls of my daughters come home to ask me , how much did  you&lt;br /&gt;pay for it, ? i want to buy one......!!!, so  they said they will buy one. Only one  advise: put the cord longer because  sometimes&lt;br /&gt;you need to move it  around the head and it is a bit short, but it is the best curling iron i have seen. so i will give you 99.95.</li>
            <li> Ok I love it but I had to give this one 4 stars for this reason. I am a lefty and it is not as easy to use for a lefty than a righty. I can do both but harder with my right hand. I love the idea and concept behind this. I think this is a great product for a teenager who is wanting to do up their hair. It took a couple tries to get it going. I tested this for quality and am basing my review on my experience! Once I did it was easier for me using my non dominate hand. I will warn you the tip where the white is fine to touch, but the blue plastic part where the rod is get very warm. Not that I am not used to using a curling iron. So here is my suggestion. When curling hair make sure you take an old flat comb. Put that comb right up against your head and then turn it up to the head. By doing this you are preventing your ear or head from burning. The cord is one that won&#x27;t get tangled up and will move with you while using this product. I love the concept and for someone who hasn&#x27;t been doing hair long or wants to try this for first time curling iron this would be perfect. You can do a few directions and curls with this wand.</li>
            <li> its useless...Just stick with old fashioned hair curling irons..</li>
            <li> This curling iron is amazing.  I have been looking for something to give my hair the curl effect now that it is longer and this does just the trick.  Simple to use with the guide.  Shows you where to place your hair to get the perfect curl.</li>
            <li> Product did not work! Did not even turn on. Very disappointed, my girlfriend was looking forward to using it.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this giving me nice curls but it looks more like I&#x27;ve crimped my hair! Cheap design and will pass along to my little sister.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best invention ever!  I used to try to get loose waves or curls with a regular curling iron, as I have very straight hair, but never ever was able to achieve the look I wanted.  Now I purchased the spiral curling iron, and for special  occasions, I have loose curls all over, put my fingers thru it, and that&#x27;s it.  I&#x27;m thrilled with this product and I&#x27;m recommending it to all my friends.  thank you so much!  (and the price is very affordable as well, another plus)</li>
            <li> Takes a bit of getting use to. I have to use smaller strips of hair but it works well.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this curling iron. I have a lot of hair and it usually takes a ton of time, not with this. Even my 12 year old loves it because she says it doesn&#x27;t burn her hand so easily and makes it easy for her to curl her hair and she is not a girly girl.  The only down side to this. is the design flaw with the cord, it gets very easily tangled up would be nice if it was a cord more like other curling irons or straighteners.  It is something that I can deal with since the rest of it works so amazingly well</li>
            <li> I can style my hair and not wear a ponytail all the time.</li>
            <li> This iron doesn&#x27;t work well on my thick hair.  The clip doesn&#x27;t cover the ends as well as it could.</li>
            <li> Does not curl well!! The clip is to short. It slides rather than opens. Hair gets caught and ripped out when you release. Don&#x27;t wast your money! The style of the iron looks as if it will generate a nice spiral curl. It does the exact opposite of that. Buyer be ware!!!</li>
            <li> hard to curl one side of head vs other</li>
            <li> I have stick straight fine hair and wanted something that would add some waves to my hair.  I came across this curling iron and saw the reviews and decided to give it a try.  Well I ended up giving mine away.  It really burn my hair and having fine hair that&#x27;s not a good thing so I&#x27;ll keep trying.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Arrived as promised and for a great price.  Was a gift for my wife, she loves it and of course her hair looks great.  Asked her about it, she has no complaints whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Love this... Very easy to use for my 12 year old...</li>
            <li> amazing my hair is pin straight and usually curls fall out completely an hour after I curl my hair, but they lasted beautifully untill I washed mt hair again</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just as described</li>
            <li> Love it. Took a while c cuz I have a lot of hair but it came out great!</li>
            <li> The Xtava Professional Curling Iron is awesome! It truly is easy to use and I get better curls than I did with winding my hair manually on a standard 1&amp;#34; curling iron.  Also the cord doesn&#x27;t tangle because it has a swivel end on the curling iron.  I would recommend this curling iron to anyone that wants a easy way to get staying curl in their hair.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Its don&#x27;t curl my hair just stright it</li>
            <li> Love this! I have long, fun hair and this curling iron is the only thing that works on my hair. The curls last all day!</li>
            <li> I tried to use it and so did my daughter.  You can&#x27;t keep your hair in it.  I think if it had a bigger hook or stronger grasp in which to hold your hair or something it would be a good product.  When we were able to hold our hair in it and twist it, the hair looked good.  The struggle to hold your hair in place and twist was not worth it.</li>
            <li> the wand itself makes great curls, but the piece that holds the hair in place actually catches hair under it frequently. There&#x27;s really no way around that which I can find.</li>
            <li> I actually received the orange version of this spiral curler. It is a great curling iron. I say this because it took my sisters kinky curly natural hair to smooth and sleek spirals. It does take a bit of effort the first time you use it though. It&#x27;s basically just getting used to using it properly. Once you have the hang of it, it is a breeze to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*SAMPLE PROVIDED*</li>
            <li> This iron makes Really pretty curls but pulls hair quite a bit. Maybe I&#x27;m just not used to the different styles? But would defiantly recommend if you know what your doing but for a first time curler maybe something more old school</li>
            <li> I have tried just about everything to form the perfect curl... heat rollers, leave in rollers, straighteners (got talked into it in the Mall lol), curling irons... you name it, I&#x27;ve tried it. But I never get the perfect curl and I&#x27;m never able to consistently reproduce curls that are almost perfect. I finally gave up for about a good year. Then I came across this! I was a little hesitant at first, but looked at a few videos on Youtube and thought i would give it a try.... THIS ACTUALLY WORKS! I always have perfect curls and I am able to reproduce those curls for my whole entire head of hair. The curler heats up very quickly and stays hot throughout my entire use. It is also very easy to hold and comfortable-- I&#x27;ve always found straighteners and curlers not very easy on the hands, but this is the exact opposite. The price is an ultimate steal-- I&#x27;ve paid double this price for curlers that were nothing as great as this! Awesome buy! If you&#x27;re tired of being frustrated with curlers, this will be your new best friend!</li>
            <li> Beautiful is all I can say</li>
            <li> I have a hard time using it. I will see if my daughter who is a beautician can help me figure it out.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is by far, the best one I have used for my hair. I have thick hair that never wants to hold a curl, and the curls fall out in just minutes. Even when I hold the iron for a long period of time, my hair will just not curl. This curler is easy to use and easy to take control of strands of my hair so that I can wrap it up without burning myself. For once I feel like I know what I&#x27;m doing with my hair.</li>
            <li> For left handed people?  I&#x27;m right handed, and for the life of me, couldn&#x27;t get the right angle to twist! It has to go a certain way otherwise it makes a kink at the end. Have to return it. I&#x27;m so bummed! It seemed to make a nice curl but had the kink at the end.:(</li>
            <li> works for me i really love it</li>
            <li> my hair is shoulder length, not very thick, could not get my hair around this, it is too fat to be useful for someone with my hair</li>
            <li> I received my package when they told me and it was just what I expected!</li>
            <li> Simple and Fast to use nothing more then a few seconds per curl and your on your way for the day or night. Even if your new to doing your hair this is perfect. Following the simple guides of the barrel will leave your hair with the prettiest of curls. Coming in 3 different colors lets you add a little flare and could even match your style alone. Also with a price at this low getting this would save in all the perms and salon runs just for some curls on a special or simple day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> What I love most about it, is that it is really low maintenance and isn&#x27;t very taxing to do every morning. In fact, it takes no more than 10 minutes to have me hair done. I was worried with some of the comments about getting your hair stuck in the spiral foundation, but really what&#x27;s best, as when using any curling iron, is brush and straighten your hair first, BEFORE you use this. You don&#x27;t need to have it needly straight but enough to where it&#x27;s easy to twist your hair into this product. If you&#x27;re wanting very big curls, you&#x27;ll find yourself stuffing your hair into the sections. My hair holds all day and it&#x27;s super easy to use. The only con i would have would be how the cord gets tangled when I use it, but that&#x27;s any curling iron so.Such a great product, worth the investment, really cheat and get&#x27;s the job done!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife because she was always going to the salon to get curls. She said they have a really good curling iron. I told her I could find a better one and she wouldn&#x27;t need to keep going to the salon. I decided to get this after receiving recommendations from my officemates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To cut the long story short, my wife loves this iron curler! She said that it&#x27;s sturdy and curls consistently.</li>
            <li> PLACTIC &amp; HARD TO USE SEND IT BACK FOR BED HEAD 3/4&#x27;SPIRAL IRON THAT I LOVE</li>
            <li> Clever idea but just doesn&#x27;t work well</li>
            <li> Not really worth the money. Takes forever to curl hair. Cord gets all twisted up. Not worth the time</li>
            <li> I have always hated using a curling iron because my hair gets all wrapped around and tangled. One time, it took me almost an hour to get the iron out of my hair. My sister came to visit and brought this curling iron with her to let me try it out. Not only did I not end up with tangles, the curls came out beautifully and lasted the whole evening.</li>
            <li> Last month my wife told me that she wanted some beauty products for her approaching birthday. She specifically said she wanted to try and curl her hair because I had mentioned in passing how great I thought she&#x27;d look with firy red curls. So I, being the great husband that I am, immediately started searching for discounts online lol. I came across the Xtava curling iron and boy did I hit the jackpot. Not only did my wife love it but it was about $30 bucks cheaper than any other product like it in beauty stores. The one thing my wife kept telling me was that she didn&#x27;t have to worry about  being burned because it cools fast. I&#x27;m just glad she was happy... this product is a plus!</li>
            <li> This curling iron looked so cool and all the reviews were so positive so I decided to buy it over a wand, but once it came in the mail I had no idea how to use it! Plus I have super long thick hair and I dont think all of it would fit in that curling iron. I returned the product and bought a wand instead, which is super easy to use and makes the perfect curls every time.</li>
            <li> Being that I have SUPER long hair, I have a lot of difficulty with curling irons. Like most of the other curling irons I have tried in the past, this curling iron falls short of my needs being that I have longer hair. As you can see pictured below, only about one half of a strand for me will fit up the spiral guide (forcing me to curl the top half of my hair first and then the bottom half).  It definitely does work well for the hair that it does give coverage to! As you can see, it produces that &amp;#34;perfect curl&amp;#34; look that many women want to achieve. Perhaps if they sold a product in different lengths (i.e. one offered for those with significantly longer hair, that would be better). I received this product in exchange for an honest review, but this did not sway the quality of my review whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Bought the curling iron for my girlfriend, who needed it after a friend recommended it. She has thick hair and I was nervous about getting it for her because of past curling irons, but the Xtava brand handled it. According to her, it&#x27;s easy to use and heats up quickly. The best part for me is how reasonable price it is.</li>
            <li> Very difficult to use-stays in the cabinet now</li>
            <li> Love this. It really works once you get comfortable with it.</li>
            <li> This is not a quality product.  It is primarily plastic, and there are rough edges that pull my hair and cause breakage.  I searched YouTube for a how-to video thinking I was not using the curling iron correctly and found one.  However, after multiple attempts over the course of a few days, I could not handle the hair I was losing trying to perfect spiral curls.  Unsuccessful!</li>
            <li> It is dificult to use</li>
            <li> Works well and does the ring curls, however, every two curls you have to unplug and unwind the cord as it gets tangled.  Very frustrating. I am not sure if they make this one in a cordless (I think they do)...this is the one I will purchase next.</li>
            <li> I have never been able to curl my hair and have the curls actually stay in all day. I used this, sprayed a little hair spray, and my curls are still holding up even on the second day! I slept on the curls and they are still bouncy. I LOVE this curling iron. My only suggestion is having different sizes. I would love a wider barrel for bigger curls.</li>
            <li> It might be me my hair is short and I wasnt able to use it ?I had to return it ,not for me ?</li>
            <li> Perfect for my oldest daughter she loves it so much!!</li>
            <li> Maybe my hair is too short (shoulder-length) or too thin but I could not get it to wrap around this curling iron - it kept slipping out. I would not buy it again!</li>
            <li> I really like this. I have long thick curly hair, so I straighten it of course, daily. This was perfect to give it back the curl, and not the wildness that I naturally have.</li>
            <li> I believe this would work well on the right length hair. My hair was too short to get the spirals, but I tried, and could tell it would have worked had I had enough hair -- I believe I needed a much smaller barrel. What I really loved was the outreach by the seller. When I explained the problem, she gave me tips, and added that if it didn&#x27;t work that I was welcome to return the product. Now that&#x27;s service!</li>
            <li> cheap very light in weight</li>
            <li> difficult to use, I hate it</li>
            <li> This curling iron was recently recommended to me by a friend. She uses it on a daily basis and I’ve always loved the way her curls looked. Personally, I don’t know much about curling irons and the like, but this iron works quite well for me.  It has an interesting design, it heats up quickly, it’s easy to use for beginners like me and it makes my hair look healthier. But if you are not careful, you may end up pulling out some hair, which is a con that I’ve noticed. Otherwise, it’s a decent product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I have been partially reimbursed for the cost of this product</li>
            <li> I recently received the Spiral Hair Curler for review. I have to say that this is the easiest curling iron to use. I am not big on fixing my hair but when I do I will use this curling iron from now on. I am always afraid of burning myself when I curl my hair and this curling iron takes away all that fear. It also leaves some great curls in my hair. I see this curling iron being a popular gift for the holidays. I am thinking about even getting a 2nd one so my daughter will have one in her room.</li>
            <li> This is an unbelievable curling iron! It heats up quickly, and it retains it&#x27;s heat the entire time I am using it. This curling iron is also very comfortable to use, as some irons have caused my hands to cramp. It produces the perfect curl every single time. Not only that, it looks good too! I have been through countless curling irons over the years, and none have outperformed, or looked better than this curling iron. Also, the price is very reasonable. I heartily recommend it!</li>
            <li> This one is so easy to use and curls look great  .</li>
            <li> This curling iron is amazing. I always used to have trouble with traditional curling irons and I was actually using a flat iron to curl my hair. This has totally changed the way I do my hair. It creates those perfect spiral curls without tangling your hair. I love that it is so easy to use and I have never burned myself using it.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this curler...  I have long, thick hair and finding a curler that works for me has been a nightmare. Then I found this one - my favorite thing about it is being able to use it to style my hair in tight curls - for a formal &#x27;updo&#x27; like I recently did, or using it to make my hair look glossy and wavy.  The only thing I would say is it takes a while to cool down after you have heated it up.  Works great though</li>
            <li> I reallyI like... no, I LOVE this product. I am a female with really long hair, which I have always dyed, so getting a perm is out of the question for me. For my birthday my mother bought me this curling iron. I figured it would end up like all the other ones I had gotten where it wouldn&#x27;t get hot enough, but I was pleasantly surprised. It seems to effectively maintain a nice steady hot temperature, around 400 degrees, and the curls come out perfect, and hold all day. Friends of mine could have sworn that I had gotten a professional spiral perm. Needless to say I use this curling iron everyday now, and really enjoy the outcome I get. I have also sent one to my younger sister, and she so far has not gone a day without it. I would say to anyone out there looking for those perfect springy curls, that this product will be a saving grace. So worth 2 thumbs up and more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had trouble with curling irons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the curling irons don&#x27;t get hot enough, while others get too hot. Curling irons have never been able to curl my hair and the ones that do, well they fall flat quickly. No matter how soon I get them sprayed, my hair is always straight by the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A friend of mine and I spent the day shopping recently and by the end of the day, her hair was still curly! I asked her what she used and she referred me to this curling iron. I was definitely a bit of a skeptic, but after the first few uses, I think it&#x27;s a must have product. I could never get mine to lay the way I wanted to, but with this one, I just wrap it on and it does it all by itself. I love it.</li>
            <li> My hair is too short, fine, and thin for this design.  It slipped out of the spirals.</li>
            <li> the product was awful do not buy</li>
            <li> Very attractive and a good gift.</li>
            <li> I know this has some great reviews, but it just doesn&#x27;t work for my fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and does the trick, not quite sure what those complaining about found so complicated.</li>
            <li> Very hard to use at first, but it&#x27;s awesome!  Heats up really fast and once you get used to it, it&#x27;s easy.  I have long hair and it doesn&#x27;t curl all the way up, but that&#x27;s ok.  It gives you that soft, beautiful curl that last all day for me. And my hair doesn&#x27;t hold curls well.  I&#x27;d get this one over any Conair product.</li>
            <li> It works very well and heats up fast and does the job quickly and it came pretty fast!!!!! I&#x27;m glad that I ordered this item!!! (: I think everyone should too.</li>
            <li> This is the best curler I have ever had! I have been avoiding chemicals and excessive heat in my hair for more than two years. I usually use rollers because I have been avoiding using heat curlers. My hot curlers and flat irons caused significant damage to my hair. I have avoided heat except for sitting under a warm dryer. Well, I ended up being the maid of honor for a friends wedding and wanted to do something special with my hair. I had been hearing about the benefits of ceramic hair care heat products and found these curlers. These curlers left my hair feeling smooth and not dry and hard. There&#x27;s no burning smell and the curls lasted longer than I expected. It&#x27;s nice to have a product that doesn&#x27;t damage my hair and allows me the style versatility I was missing.</li>
            <li> Its not good there is no instruction inside the box im disappointed</li>
            <li> After having read many of the reviews, and considering there were more positive than negative reviews, I decided to pull the trigger on this item and try it. I could not, for the life of me, get my hair to go in between the plastic guide. And when I released the sliding clip, my hair did not come off of the barrel, I had to unwind it and ended up tearing a lot of my hair out. That was enough for me. Even though I use heat protectors, this item uses only one heat setting.....high....and if you have already damaged hair or fine hair, I would not recommend this iron. Over time, heat like that will damage the hair shaft. My hair is already damaged from bleach and color processing, so this was just not the way to go. I agree with the one customer who stated she could do these curls faster and easier with just a regular curling iron. Think I will just stick with what I have and say, &amp;#34;the grass isn&#x27;t always greener.....&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this iron. I use it on my natural hair and my clip-in extensions for a long eye-catching look and for fabulous up-dos. The curls are so beautiful and long-lasting I usually don&#x27;t even use hair spray. Only if it&#x27;s a super humid day will I use spray just as curl &amp;#34;insurance.&amp;#34; Because honestly, these curls last. The iron is easy to use, too. I love that there&#x27;s no danger of burning myself. I had a spiral iron that was awkward to use and I burned my forehead with it. This iron is safe and makes great curls.</li>
            <li> My sister used this product and she was extremely pleased with the results. She said that it created great curls that she had not gotten with other curling irons, and also that it heated quickly which was a plus since she tends to get ready in a hurry.</li>
            <li> It should specify for people with short to medium length hair.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly I was pleased with the results the Xtava Spiral Hair Curler gave me. I have very long hair that reaches the middle of my back. There are no illustrated instructions, and the written instructions it comes with are somewhat useless. It take some practice, but once you figure out how to use correctly it will be smooth sailing for you. Practice makes perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some helpful tips: Do not clip your hair at the very ends. I leave about 1 inch hanging out since my hair is layered at the ends. This makes it much easier to roll up without the hair strands coming out. The hair located around my face I could spiral all the way to my roots, but since my hair is so long in the back I could only go up about 3/4 before having to stop. Don&#x27;t try to go all the way up, it will not work. Do not use to much hair or otherwise you will not be able to release the end and gently pull down the iron so the hair slides out. Most importantly learn how to use your opposite hand. In order to do the other side of your head, yo have to use your opposite hand because the iron will only roll up in one direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair was left with soft and bouncy spirals. Make sure to use a heat protection spray or serum. I am a big believer and user of Argan oil and recommend [[ASIN:B00KZJURGI Simon &amp; Tom Moroccan Treatment Hair Serum with Argan Oil]] for All Hair Types to guard your hair from heating appliances and help repair any damage you already may have.</li>
            <li> need longer hair for this!</li>
            <li> Piece of junk.  Honestly, whoever wrote these reviews had to have been paid reviewers.  I tried several times to use this piece of junk and every single time, the clip just gets caught on your hair and rips it out.  By the time you can get your hair out, you&#x27;ve burned it!  And your hair doesn&#x27;t go in between the plastic curling piece, it just slides underneath it.  This is just a curling want with a piece of plastic wrapped around it.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet but I&#x27;m happy with my new toy for my hair</li>
            <li> Not a  handy as it looks more time consuming</li>
            <li> So Far I like the Xtava curling wand I haven&#x27;t played with it too much, but i did put a couple of curls in my hair to test it out and they were pretty awesome. I brought this item because I didn&#x27;t know how to curl with flat irons hopefully it can help me learn and curl better! The shipment came fast (because I have prime), it was nearly package there was a dent in the box that the wand came in but I&#x27;m sure I didn&#x27;t affect the product. Right now I&#x27;m rating the project at four stars because like I said before I just got it haven&#x27;t did nothing but 3 curls with it so I&#x27;ll give another review once I curl my whole head.</li>
            <li> I am sooo not a girly girl but I figured why not buy this and play...very easy to use and I deff like how well it curled my hair and I have extremely thick but fine hair!!</li>
            <li> Much harder to use than implied.</li>
            <li> A little awkward to use, but I think once I&#x27;m used to it it will be fine. Makes nice curls.</li>
            <li> I just received this item the other day and have not had the chance to use it yet.  It is very light weight and I hope that it works as well as&lt;br /&gt;the website stated.</li>
            <li> This is defintely not made for thin hair, it does not work at all as a curling iron for me.  No curls just hot hair.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe if you had alot of thick hair,  but still, the hair does not stay in the curling part.&lt;br /&gt;Would not reccommend.</li>
            <li> this curling iron worked great!! and was so easy to use!</li>
            <li> XTAVA provided a lot of information about how to use the curling iron, plus pleasant emails asking how I was doing (great marketing on their part); however, I just could not develop the technique for using the iron.  I thought having the &amp;#34;clip&amp;#34; would help hold everything in place, but just does not work for me.  Sorry.  I really wanted to love this curling iron.  I would consider other XTAVA products because the company is so customer service friendly.</li>
            <li> My hair gets caught in it and it rips out.  Only tried it once but don&#x27;t need to try it again.  I ended up getting a curling wand (the kind without the clamp) and a heat-resistant glove and that&#x27;s the better option... no hair loss!!</li>
            <li> Came on time. I&#x27;m glad I bought it because it&#x27;s easy to use and I get beautiful curls in less time.</li>
            <li> Works every time and you don&#x27;t even need to whined it perfectly. Love it, great time saver in the morning!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad..!! I been using it for the past 5 months and it does the job ok.</li>
            <li> Curls my thick long hair and lasts all day!! Perfect for the price</li>
            <li> My hair looks amazing with this!</li>
            <li> I have very long hair, it&#x27;s so long that I can sit on it right now. I have incredibly straight hair so curling can take quite a while to get done. I usually roll my hair into small foam curlers at night when it&#x27;s wet and sleep in them. By morning time when my hair is dry, I have curls. It can be a pain to sleep with curlers in your hair, even the soft foam ones so when I got a chance to try this curling iron out I was excited to try this out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curling iron came in a really nice black box for easy storage. It heats up really fast and has a little plastic guard at the end so if you touch it, your fingers don&#x27;t get burned. I really liked that about it. it&#x27;s different from other curling irons that I&#x27;ve used and it does take a little practice to get used to it but after a few tries I found it easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This curling iron works really good. My daughter even wants to borrow it from me now. I have really long hair and could only get part of my hair into the curling part of it and so only the bottom part of my hair really got curled. I think this is better for someone who has shoulder length or medium length hair, not longer hair like I have. But the bottom of my hair that I did curl, the curls came out really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Disclaimer, I received item for free in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> Piece of crap.  Doesn&#x27;t get any where near hot enough to hold a curl...if it would even curl without getting tangled and Friday in the first place</li>
            <li> This is a new curling iron that I wanted to try out. I feel like I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different kinds (I have long straight hair), so I didn&#x27;t mind getting this. My last ION is unusable because as my hair got longer, it was too heavy to pin up. So, I got this and it works pretty well. It definitely takes some getting used to, but that&#x27;s with any curler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, it works well, especially if you have long hair. The other &#x27;wrap-around&#x27; ones were too short of a base for me, but this curls great. I like how thin you can separate the hair for this. The price isn&#x27;t bad either.</li>
            <li> Gives a great curl! Heats up quick! Would highly recommend buying this product!</li>
            <li> I love the curling iron but I hate the cord it tangles up too bad</li>
            <li> Very nice product, and fast shipping. But I had to return it because the birthday girl had gotten one already!!</li>
