            <li>Smells great and is well priced, I liked it a lot.</li>
            <li>I like the way it was pack an came in good condition.</li>
            <li>I bought the bottle, while waiting for the bus, there was 3 girls standing around me gossiping about how good I smelled.. one even asked for a hug.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;You smell good</li>
            <li>$ a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also makes a good air freshener.</li>

            <li>very safe smell a winner.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>This is my husbands favorite body spray and we can&#x27;t find it in any stores!  </li>
            <li>This is an amazing body spray..</li>
            <li>amazing..</li>
            <li>so for his 60th birthday I wanted to buy him a bottle of it kind of as a joke.</li>
            <li>They offer a nice line of great smelling cologne for men at a really cheap price.</li>
            <li>its great and mild</li>
            <li>Sure i don&#x27;t own one yet</li>
            <li>Also, the scent is a bit overly strong!</li>
            <li>And it is true that you will get a lot of compliments on how good you it smells.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To start off, its a very light fragrance, it has a smell life span of about 5 hours before you will want to reapply some more, if you need to that is.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and i noticed one girl could not resist keeping her head more than a foot away like litterally.</li>
            <li>This is my brothers favorite scent.</li>
            <li>It has a refreshing floral smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall-</li>
            <li>This scent happens to be my favorite.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That isn&#x27;t even the end, literally everyone on the bus caught a whiff of the stuff and started complimenting me, most people complimented me as they were getting off the bus \\&quot;hey man what are you wearing?</li>
            <li>however...it was the scent that I think is okay...</li>
            <li>This was probably his best Christmas present!</li>
            <li>Need I say more?</li>
            <li>Honestly, this is by far the best smelling BOD MAN fragrance they have out right now, in terms of quality it even bumps head with some of the 100$ colognes out there</li>
            <li>Really good CLEAN and FRESH smell</li>
            <li>I love BodMan because it&#x27;s really cheap</li>
            <li>The best thing is it is super cheap, and it smells terrific.</li>
            <li>Seriously amazing first experience, I have to say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>wake up your senses with cool colour and refreshing aroma.</li>
            <li>most Bod fragrances, this is a decent copy of something popular.</li>
            <li>but I do as well nice fresh clean fragrance and is not overpowering</li>
            <li>I think the best one BLACK...</li>
            <li>The Windex sized sprayer puts out a huge amount per spray, so be warned.</li>
            <li>its cheap</li>
            <li>MAKES YOU FEEL FRESH AND SEXY</li>
            <li>I can secure myself a life time supply of it.</li>
            <li>Fresh Guy has a light, longlasting scent to it which means more attention from the ladies.</li>
            <li>You can get a bottle of Calvin Klein anything from Kohl&#x27;s for $25 that will actually smell good and have better quality ingredients in it.</li>
            <li>This is far from smelling good.</li>
            <li>Be a real man and find a good quality cologne that smells right on you.</li>
            <li>not even a floral hint just very clean and fresh smelling.</li>
            <li>But it is a great smelling product, and agree with other comments that you can sense a strong alcohol-like smell.</li>
            <li>My favorite BOB scent by far &amp; people seem to enjoy it also!</li>
            <li>Most women love it and wanna get as near you as they can.  </li>
            <li>The scent lasts really long, its a good size bottle, easy to spray handle</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really hard to explain, but, a good way to elaborate is that is does indeed smell &amp;#34;fresh.&amp;#34; It isn&#x27;t an overbearing scent, either, and I can vouch that the ladies do love it.</li>
            <li>This is a good spray that last around an hour but</li>
            <li>It has a light fresh scent.</li>
            <li>so good looks like I&#x27;ll have to order him a different bottle...  </li>
            <li>I gotta say, i have tried countless amount of deodorant sprays but none of them can even match how good this spray truly is</li>
            <li>Smell is better than high priced cologne.</li>
            <li>and it smells good for a really long time.</li>
            <li>my new favorite cologne.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product over all of the other bod sprays even though most of them are amazing, especially fresh blue musk!</li>
            <li>Amazing fragrance, I get complimented every time I wear it, will definitely be stocking up on this stuff.</li>
            <li>but when I got to smell the scent of BOD Man FRESH GUY, it blew all of those colognes out of the water.</li>
            <li>My dad always complimented me when I would wear \\&quot;Fresh Guy\\&quot;</li>
            <li>this shouldnt be  called fresh guy</li>
            <li>BOD Fresh Guy body spray, is another BOD perfume for men.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing fresh smelling about it, it just has an overpowering feminine flower smell.</li>
            <li>I started wearing Bod Man two years ago and Fresh Guy was my first one.</li>
            <li>It smells good, last long &amp; is fairly strong.</li>
            <li>Also, yes it will attract the ladies ;)</li>
            <li>thats exactly what it does</li>
            <li>Better price then the local drug stores.</li>
            <li>I first bought the stuff (by accident)</li>
            <li>I just bought three bottles of three different scents and this is on of the better ones.  </li>
            <li>Seriously though it smells fantastic for sure!</li>
            <li>Even though I&#x27;m exponentially more sensitive to different scents than most people, I can barely tell the difference between the two.</li>
            <li>True, the real Kenneth Cole Reaction lasts a bit longer than Bod Fresh Guy, but at under ten bucks for 8 ounces, you can afford to reapply all you like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Guys i got to be honest about this spray although it is not long lasting, it really attrracts females.</li>
            <li>His father, not so much.</li>
            <li>Anyways fresh guy is a light fresh masculine scent and some people find it a slight fruity</li>
            <li>you want a consistent head turner, or female number generator to keep your phone busy and your sex life active, or just something to know for a fact you SMELL GOOD.</li>
            <li>So why spend a bunch more money for less in quantity?</li>
            <li>It reminds me of high school</li>
            <li>my personal collection I have most wanted, black, Fresh guy...</li>
            <li>believe ive gotten more compliments with this stuff, when I first wore it, than I have in my entire life wearing other colognes.</li>
            <li>I think everyone should try Fresh Guy or any other Bod Man product that is right for you.</li>
            <li>The shipping was a bit steep since I had to buy from one of the 3rd party retailers but it was worth it to give it to my dad.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s honestly crazy when a beautiful woman asks what cologne i&#x27;m wearing, and I straight up tell them I&#x27;m wearing BOD spray.  </li>
            <li>And of course I received compliments, and i think that it is similar to aqua de gio, it is a Fresh, fruity, pungent, musky smell, and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>As a 32 year old man I don&#x27;t wanna smell like the blue bottle called cool musk..</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how new the fresh blue musk bottle was when purchased...)</li>
            <li>VERY FAST DELIVERY, WILL DEFINITELY DO BUSINESS AGAIN WITH THIS COMPANY  </li>
            <li>Always love this product, but just hard to find around I live.</li>
            <li>Outside of BOD Black, this is my favorite BOD product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so similar to the real thing</li>
            <li>I have honestly never had so many compliments on the way I smell since I have worn BOD spray.  </li>
            <li>This stuff makes complete strangers want to hug you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do not have allergies, and normally I spray this on my bare chest.</li>
            <li>I purchased a few colognes from a local mall which were okay</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t go wrong with a 8 oz bottle of smell good that will turn women on just by standing in arms length of you (some will even have to FORCE themselves not to want to get closer to you).</li>
            <li>The Bod fragrance has a fruity smell an good for casual wear.</li>
            <li>I tried this on a blind buy because I have been satisfied with other Bod Man scents but this one has a strong floral smell.</li>
            <li>I am a big fan of really ripped abs body spray and ordered this (actually for my son age 7) because he likes to put cologne on like dad</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve used them for a few months daily without putting a dent in the first one.</li>
            <li>A 8 oz spray bottle will last you a little over a few months, when ever i stop by my local walmart i always buy at least 30$ worth to make sure if they ever stop making this</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s so similar to the real thing</li>
            <li> I have honestly never had so many compliments on the way I smell since I have worn BOD spray.  </li>
            <li> This stuff makes complete strangers want to hug you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do not have allergies, and normally I spray this on my bare chest.</li>
            <li> I purchased a few colognes from a local mall which were okay</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with a 8 oz bottle of smell good that will turn women on just by standing in arms length of you (some will even have to FORCE themselves not to want to get closer to you).</li>
            <li> The Bod fragrance has a fruity smell an good for casual wear.</li>
            <li> I tried this on a blind buy because I have been satisfied with other Bod Man scents but this one has a strong floral smell.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of really ripped abs body spray and ordered this (actually for my son age 7) because he likes to put cologne on like dad</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve used them for a few months daily without putting a dent in the first one.</li>
            <li> A 8 oz spray bottle will last you a little over a few months, when ever i stop by my local walmart i always buy at least 30$ worth to make sure if they ever stop making this</li>
            <li> plain rocks, nuff&#x27; said!;)  </li>
            <li> And even if you have lost sense of smell you should at least be smart enough to know</li>
            <li> I have other bod products, but this one seemed to be stronger than other (Really ripped abs/black), so be careful when using it.</li>
            <li> Suggest to use it on your clothing, and not near your face.</li>
            <li> Not much reason I can see.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not really allergic to cologne or perfume.</li>
            <li> Arrived as expected item is add described.</li>

            <li> Specific Bod products are hard to find, however Amazon has them.  </li>
            <li> It smells a little fruity..  </li>
            <li> Now I use it everyday and the compliments just keep coming.</li>
            <li> They were also were not able to stay away from me</li>
            <li> not sure what this is about.  </li>
            <li> If your a bod fan or your female is then you know you can&#x27;t go wrong with this</li>
            <li> I never really liked the stuff he used as a boy.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Guys i got to be honest about this spray although it is not long lasting, it really attrracts females. Sure i don&#x27;t own one yet but when i borrowed some of this for two days i litterally had girls complimenting me within 15 minutes. They were also were not able to stay away from me and i noticed one girl could not resist keeping her head more than a foot away like litterally. This is a good spray that last around an hour but its cheap so i wont mind applying it 8 times a day.</li>
            <li> This stuff plain rocks, nuff&#x27; said!;)  Seriously though it smells fantastic for sure! my new favorite cologne. The fresh blue musk is terrific also but the scent from this is stronger and lasts longer (at least in the bottles I bought. I don&#x27;t know how new the fresh blue musk bottle was when purchased...)</li>
            <li> I purchased a few colognes from a local mall which were okay but when I got to smell the scent of BOD Man FRESH GUY, it blew all of those colognes out of the water. The best thing is it is super cheap, and it smells terrific. And it is true that you will get a lot of compliments on how good you it smells. Also, yes it will attract the ladies ;)</li>
            <li> This is my brothers favorite scent. Even though this is for men I have to admit I use it sometimes too (I&#x27;m a female) . I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a great body spray. It has a light fresh scent.</li>
            <li> I started wearing Bod Man two years ago and Fresh Guy was my first one. When I went to school all the girls were giving compliments and just loved to smell me. Now I use it everyday and the compliments just keep coming. Fresh Guy has a light, longlasting scent to it which means more attention from the ladies. I think everyone should try Fresh Guy or any other Bod Man product that is right for you. Go on, try it! It&#x27;s no lie...</li>
            <li> Smells just as same as the smaller bottles which was what I wanted. My favorite BOB scent by far &amp; people seem to enjoy it also!</li>
            <li> Outside of BOD Black, this is my favorite BOD product. It smells good, last long &amp; is fairly strong. It has a refreshing floral smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall- Good Buy!</li>
            <li> This is a knock off of a fragrance by Kenneth Cole called Reaction. It&#x27;s so similar to the real thing, the majority of people cannot tell the difference between the two. Even though I&#x27;m exponentially more sensitive to different scents than most people, I can barely tell the difference between the two. So why spend a bunch more money for less in quantity? Not much reason I can see. True, the real Kenneth Cole Reaction lasts a bit longer than Bod Fresh Guy, but at under ten bucks for 8 ounces, you can afford to reapply all you like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compare the two yourself, and see if you can tell the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like most Bod fragrances, this is a decent copy of something popular. The Windex sized sprayer puts out a huge amount per spray, so be warned.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of really ripped abs body spray and ordered this (actually for my son age 7) because he likes to put cologne on like dad...hate to say it but this stuff smells so good looks like I&#x27;ll have to order him a different bottle...  Really good CLEAN and FRESH smell</li>
            <li> I gotta say, i have tried countless amount of deodorant sprays but none of them can even match how good this spray truly is, i always put it on after a shower and before i go out or go to school. It is an anytime deodorant for any occasions! I recommend this product over all of the other bod sprays even though most of them are amazing, especially fresh blue musk!</li>
            <li> I love BodMan because it&#x27;s really cheap and it smells good for a really long time. My dad always complimented me when I would wear \\&quot;Fresh Guy\\&quot; so for his 60th birthday I wanted to buy him a bottle of it kind of as a joke. But I couldn&#x27;t find it at any of the department stores so I had to order it on here. The shipping was a bit steep since I had to buy from one of the 3rd party retailers but it was worth it to give it to my dad.</li>
            <li> Pros- The scent lasts really long, its a good size bottle, easy to spray handle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons- It smells a little fruity..  not sure what this is about.  Also, the scent is a bit overly strong!</li>
            <li> I gave this as a gift to my husband .  Not only does he like it but I do as well nice fresh clean fragrance and is not overpowering</li>
            <li> this shouldnt be  called fresh guy it should be re named \\&quot;the pantie dropper\\&quot; cause thats exactly what it does</li>
            <li> Purchased as gift for my grandson. He loves it. His father, not so much. Must be a generational thing. I never really liked the stuff he used as a boy.</li>
            <li> Amazing fragrance, I get complimented every time I wear it, will definitely be stocking up on this stuff.</li>
            <li> Specific Bod products are hard to find, however Amazon has them.  Better price then the local drug stores.</li>
            <li> Ive been looking all around for this product and found it on amazon but didnt buy it here i found it in the cologne isle at walmart. Anyways fresh guy is a light fresh masculine scent and some people find it a slight fruity but i dont girls all ways compliment me on it and it smells awesome GET IT!</li>
            <li> I have honestly never had so many compliments on the way I smell since I have worn BOD spray.  It&#x27;s honestly crazy when a beautiful woman asks what cologne i&#x27;m wearing, and I straight up tell them I&#x27;m wearing BOD spray.  Love it! Thx BOD spray!</li>
            <li> BOD Fresh Guy body spray, is another BOD perfume for men.  The pale green fluid has mellon notes and &amp;#34;covers&amp;#34; well.</li>
            <li> All BOD products are disgusting. Any &amp;#34;man&amp;#34; who wears this garbage is obviously a douche or has lost all sense of smell. And even if you have lost sense of smell you should at least be smart enough to know this is garbage just by looking at the packaging! This, to me, is worse than Axe body sprays and the likes. Be a real man and find a good quality cologne that smells right on you. You can get a bottle of Calvin Klein anything from Kohl&#x27;s for $25 that will actually smell good and have better quality ingredients in it. I get severe allergic reactions from this and I&#x27;m not really allergic to cologne or perfume. Don&#x27;t be a douche!</li>
            <li> MAKES YOU FEEL FRESH AND SEXY</li>
            <li> for the guy that doesn&#x27;t like sissy smells ...its great and mild</li>
            <li> wake up your senses with cool colour and refreshing aroma. second on my list of choices</li>
            <li> Always love this product, but just hard to find around I live.</li>
            <li> I tried this on a blind buy because I have been satisfied with other Bod Man scents but this one has a strong floral smell. There&#x27;s nothing fresh smelling about it, it just has an overpowering feminine flower smell. I don&#x27;t suggest buying this scent if you want to smell like a guy should smell, which is not like a flower garden.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t listen to any of the negative reviews. This is great great value. Smells awesome. Get lots of compliments. Smell is better than high priced cologne. The only way to experience it is to buy it. You can&#x27;t beat the price. I definitely buy this again and again......Awesome Awesome</li>
            <li> Smells great. Had to order it here since no where around me sells it anymore.</li>
            <li> Arrived as expected item is add described. If your a bod fan or your female is then you know you can&#x27;t go wrong with this I recommend</li>
            <li> i love this product and so do the ladies!!!  VERY FAST DELIVERY, WILL DEFINITELY DO BUSINESS AGAIN WITH THIS COMPANY  THANK YOU!!!!!!!!!! NOW OFF TOO THE LADIES LOL LOL !!!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing body spray..I actuall have people from all sexes, ages, walk up to me and comment about \\&quot;how wonderful\\&quot; I smell...people will walk by me in hallways and corridors, and come back and will STOP ME!!! Even dads with kids in there arms as Dept. stores or grocery stores...amazing..that&#x27;s why I buy it buy the case..I can wear really expensive mens&#x27; cologns,,,but...nothing...wear this..I gonna be smelled, and they love it!!! me too...</li>
            <li> Exceptional product, great value</li>
            <li> the one star review needs to be ignored. not even a floral hint just very clean and fresh smelling. use it all the time over my thirty bottles of expensive cologne. very safe smell a winner.</li>
            <li> I have sworn by Bod brand colognes for years and years. They offer a nice line of great smelling cologne for men at a really cheap price. This scent happens to be my favorite. It&#x27;s really hard to explain, but, a good way to elaborate is that is does indeed smell &amp;#34;fresh.&amp;#34; It isn&#x27;t an overbearing scent, either, and I can vouch that the ladies do love it. This one is a great value for the price, I got two of the 8oz sprayers and I&#x27;ve used them for a few months daily without putting a dent in the first one. If you want to smell nice without spending a bunch, check this out!</li>
            <li> Great product from reliable source</li>
            <li> This one got the best reviews by peers, friends, and ladies. Smells great and is well priced, I liked it a lot.</li>
            <li> I like the way it was pack an came in good condition. The Bod fragrance has a fruity smell an good for casual wear.</li>
            <li> Honestly, this is by far the best smelling BOD MAN fragrance they have out right now, in terms of quality it even bumps head with some of the 100$ colognes out there (Im looking at you, issey miyaki). You can&#x27;t go wrong with a 8 oz bottle of smell good that will turn women on just by standing in arms length of you (some will even have to FORCE themselves not to want to get closer to you). A 8 oz spray bottle will last you a little over a few months, when ever i stop by my local walmart i always buy at least 30$ worth to make sure if they ever stop making this I can secure myself a life time supply of it. (it smells THAT good).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To start off, its a very light fragrance, it has a smell life span of about 5 hours before you will want to reapply some more, if you need to that is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe ive gotten more compliments with this stuff, when I first wore it, than I have in my entire life wearing other colognes. Im sticking by this smell to the grave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first bought the stuff (by accident), I had a interview lined up for me at 4:30, so I sprayed some on in store; and It blew me away. I bought the bottle, while waiting for the bus, there was 3 girls standing around me gossiping about how good I smelled.. one even asked for a hug. Yep. This stuff makes complete strangers want to hug you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That isn&#x27;t even the end, literally everyone on the bus caught a whiff of the stuff and started complimenting me, most people complimented me as they were getting off the bus \\&quot;hey man what are you wearing? it smells bomb.\\&quot; \\&quot;You smell good, I wish my BF smelled like that \\&quot;Haha\\&quot; \\&quot;.. etc. Seriously amazing first experience, I have to say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a consistent head turner, or female number generator to keep your phone busy and your sex life active, or just something to know for a fact you SMELL GOOD. Then this is the purchase for you.  You can&#x27;t beat it with a steel bat, for only 7 - 8$ a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also makes a good air freshener.</li>
            <li> When purchasing this...I had assumed from the image that this was the scent I had been searching for ....however...it was the scent that I think is okay...but not what I had wanted.</li>
            <li> This spray gets me more compliments from girls (and guys too!!!!) than any $100 cologne would. Idk what part of the brain it stimulates, but whichever part it is, it hits the spot in a good way!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a good smell. And i recommend it to a person who does not have allergy problems. I do not have allergies, and normally I spray this on my bare chest. Within two days i had a runny nose, and got sick from the smell. And could not wash it off my skin. I spray it on my cloth seats for my car as a deoderant now. But I no longer use it on my body/ Suggest to use it on your clothing, and not near your face. I gave it 4 stars because of the experience. But it is a great smelling product, and agree with other comments that you can sense a strong alcohol-like smell. I have other bod products, but this one seemed to be stronger than other (Really ripped abs/black), so be careful when using it. And of course I received compliments, and i think that it is similar to aqua de gio, it is a Fresh, fruity, pungent, musky smell, and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> This is my husbands favorite body spray and we can&#x27;t find it in any stores!  This was probably his best Christmas present!</li>
            <li> Same scent as Reaction.  Most women love it and wanna get as near you as they can.  Need I say more?</li>
            <li> My girl friend loves this on me. It makes her want to tear my clothes off. Guys get this stuff</li>
            <li> I have been using this since 2005 and still have not got tired of it. It reminds me of high school oh good times... I recommend it!!</li>
            <li> This stuff rocks my socks</li>
            <li> I just bought three bottles of three different scents and this is on of the better ones.  As a 32 year old man I don&#x27;t wanna smell like the blue bottle called cool musk.. This is far from smelling good. my personal collection I have most wanted, black, Fresh guy...I think the best one BLACK...</li>
