            <li>It always amazes me how much natural things can be in a serum, this one has a ton of natural indregients like Aloe and Vitamin K and Grapeseed Oil, Aloe is one awesome object, i&#x27;m glad it does work and its so easy to use!</li>
            <li>This is a great eye cream addressing multiple aging issues.  </li>

            <li>This is my go to eye cream for those mornings that I have to be at work super early and need to apply eye shadow, liquid liner, etc</li>
            <li>and I really did not see any visible difference.  </li>

            <li> This really helps with my dark circles and bags, a must-have for anyone with little sleep and a long day of work ahead of them!</li>
            <li> much smaller quantity than I expected</li>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to help my puffy or dark circles.</li>

            <li> You will feel the slight tingling sensation that a product with caffeine provides.</li>
            <li> eye cream hydrated, but did NOT significantly lighten dark circles...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched long and hard for an eye cream that does what it says.</li>
            <li> So, I had a very small plastic flat spoon that I received with another cream</li>
            <li> Therefore, half of the cream is wasted on the Q-tip.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t decided if I will reorder since this is very inconvenient using the small flat spoon</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this cream but ended up very disappointed, waste of money with no results!!</li>
            <li> I have lots of problems staying asleep, but this products fixes my tired eyes.</li>
            <li> that when I wake up exhausted and have brutally puffy tired eyes!!!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve searched long and hard for an eye cream that does what it says. This really helps with my dark circles and bags, a must-have for anyone with little sleep and a long day of work ahead of them! Recommended.</li>
            <li> I definitely can see the difference after a months use of this product..Dark circles under my eyes were not as noticeable.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to help my puffy or dark circles.</li>
            <li> Was hoping that this would work for my aging eyes.  My skin was very sensitive to the product and I really did not see any visible difference.  I hope this products works better for somebody else.</li>
            <li> Recently received this cream and have used it daily.  Have noticed a brightness and a reduction of morning puffiness.  I have sensitive skin, but have not had any irritation.  Happy with product.</li>
            <li> I love it. It realy works</li>
            <li> I doesn&#x27;t work very well</li>
            <li> Best depuffer I&#x27;ve found and I tried Estee Lauder cooling eye product which is about eighty dollars.  This is a great eye cream addressing multiple aging issues.  I&#x27;m so pleased to have found my morning cream.</li>
            <li> Have only been using this product a short time so it has not been long enough to evaluate its effectiveness.  It takes 3 to 4 months for a cosmetic to make a difference.</li>
            <li> The stem  in the bottle is defective. It is only about 1/2 of an inch and CANNOT reach inside the bottle for the pump to work. I have to take out eye cream with a Q-tip! Therefore, half of the cream is wasted on the Q-tip. I am contacting the seller and if I get good results from them, even if they just send me another bottle EMPTY with a working pump then I will definitely be ordering the product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE) 6/22/14- I am VERY pleased with the quick response I received from Nevonia regarding the defective pump. They sent me a new bottle and even tested it before sending it to me. They went a step further and mailed a prepaid label for me to ship back the defective bottle. I will definitely be ordering from them again! A GREAT PRODUCT BACKED UP WITH OUTSTANDING CUSTOMER SERVICE!</li>
            <li> I have another product that works as well and I don&#x27;t have to wait on it to be shipped.</li>
            <li> Seemed to look fresher and minimize dark circles and tighten. Didn&#x27;t totally remove, but satisfied with results and will reorder.</li>
            <li> Helps those morning bags and wrinkles, skin in eye area much smoother</li>
            <li> I like the cream, but the pump didn&#x27;t work the first time I bought it, because the plastic tube that attaches to the pump was not attached and is somewhere in the cream. I tried to find it and pull it out, but was unsuccessfull. So, I had a very small plastic flat spoon that I received with another cream and I use that to scoop out this cream. I haven&#x27;t decided if I will reorder since this is very inconvenient using the small flat spoon and I feel for the price it would be in a better bottle.</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with this seller and this purchase.</li>
            <li> The eye cream was soft and absorbed thoroughly without a greasy feel. However, I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant changes in the eye tissue.</li>
            <li> eye cream hydrated, but did NOT significantly lighten dark circles...it did seem to soften skin around eyes and crows feet softened as well, but as an advertisement for lessening dark circles, it didn&#x27;t deliver.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do much for me but maybe this product might work better for someone else. I like it as an eye cream but I was expecting a little bit more of a result after a month of use.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work at all.  I have not seen any results!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product every morning and night for over a month and have seen absolutely no difference in the puffiness, wrinkles and most definitely not my dark circles. I had high hopes for this cream but ended up very disappointed, waste of money with no results!!</li>
            <li> Hydrating, brightening, absorbs quickly, soothing, depuffs&lt;br /&gt;First of all I work for a spa and have tried every product we carry for dark circles and puffy eyes. I have lots of problems staying asleep, but this products fixes my tired eyes. There is a noticeable difference when I don&#x27;t use it. It helps brighten and depuffs. It feels soothing and absorbs quickly This is the best I have tried for those days that when I wake up exhausted and have brutally puffy tired eyes!!!! This is my go to eye cream for those mornings that I have to be at work super early and need to apply eye shadow, liquid liner, etc.... You ladies know those mornings when your eyes are trying to tell you no to putting on makeup!!!!! Well.... This product will decrease all of that puffiness and get your eyes ready for anything:) You will feel the slight tingling sensation that a product with caffeine provides. Don&#x27;t worry this is a good thing...This eye cream helped right away I noticed a difference . It is very hydrating without being greasy and I have also noticed a difference in the firmness in the skin around my eyes. Love the airless pump which allows this cream to just glide out smoothly. This eye cream is awesome! It does exactly what it says. I have tried a lot of different creams with results I really wasn&#x27;t happy with but this does it all.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to tell difference</li>
            <li> much smaller quantity than I expected</li>
            <li> It always amazes me how much natural things can be in a serum, this one has a ton of natural indregients like Aloe and Vitamin K and Grapeseed Oil, Aloe is one awesome object, i&#x27;m glad it does work and its so easy to use!</li>
