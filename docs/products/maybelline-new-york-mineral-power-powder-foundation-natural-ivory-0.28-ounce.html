            <li>Great powder.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a great mineral powder.  </li>
            <li>Avoid this cheap garbage!!!</li>
            <li>THIS POWDER IS AS AMAZING AS ANY OF THE PRICIER BRANDS!  </li>
            <li>I have fair, ivory skin and even the lightest shade</li>
            <li>you are looking for a good mineral foundation check out L&#x27;Oreal or Philosophy&#x27;s version.  </li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t  notice that you just powdered your nose but has good coverage.  </li>
            <li>This does not clog my pores and the color blends perfect w/ my light skin tone.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite powder, and great price.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t find this product at any store, glad I found it here!</li>
            <li>but it gives a glow on its own</li>
            <li>I use my own brush though.</li>
            <li>Maybelline&#x27;s mineral foundation gives great coverage and is so quick to apply.  </li>

            <li>I am not a foundation kind of gal and prefer a light face powder, so this works well.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>In Summer it is easier to blend but in Winter I feel I need to top it with a  finishing powder or something to lighten it up.</li>
            <li>I started wearing Mineral Power makeup when I was 16, thinking it would be better for my skin.</li>
            <li>I love the makeup, but I will not order it again because the shipping charges were exorbitant,</li>

            <li>LOVE this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Also doesn&#x27;t get cakey like many.</li>
            <li>Of all the money I&#x27;ve spent on powder.. I have to say this is the best one for me</li>
            <li>But other than that, it&#x27;s great and makes me look nice.</li>
            <li>This product fits the bill, plus it is easy to find in drugstores or online and can be purchased cheaply.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li>great ,,enough coverage when im in a rush and goes on well over my matte dream mousse cr√®me ,,</li>
            <li>As for the actual product, the price and quality is great.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great and this container was much bigger</li>
            <li>It evens out my skin tone and goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply and lasts all day but feels super light on the skin.</li>
            <li>On another note, I have very sensitive skin, gets hives easily and have NEVER had a problem with this powder!</li>
            <li>Feels very light on the skin and it does not make your skin oily, powdery or dry overall great product.</li>
            <li>Best all round makeup for a natural look.</li>
            <li>I use this mineral powder every day - the main reason I like it is because it gives me nice, natural coverage without breaking me out.</li>
            <li>is just right.  </li>
            <li>Like better than Bare Minerals!</li>
            <li>I tried Maybelline&#x27;s mineral makeup and have been using it for several years now and love it.  </li>
            <li>then I expected I was super excited</li>
            <li>Maybelline does not and for my money Maybelline had nailed the exact same formula as Bare Minerals and you get much more bang for your buck.  </li>
            <li>I really like this foundation and the color</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m disappointed that Maybelline no longer produces it, but this vendor was able to send it quickly and for a fair price.</li>
            <li>It feel normal to wear it and it comes in a shade light enough for me.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t wear very well either, by the end of the day my normal skin was oily and streaky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>My main issue with this is that the container has nowhere to put the brush.</li>
            <li>Also, I prefer the old packaging they used, the new one seems to waste a lot more powder, but if it keeps them making it, I have no problem with it.</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m older, my skin is sensitive to makeup and liquid makeups just don&#x27;t work well for me anymore.  </li>
            <li>I would say the coverage is light, so you will need to put concealer on before you apply it if you want to cover dark circles or acne.</li>
            <li>mineral powder does not contain bismuth oxychloride, which is present in some &#x27;higher end&#x27; mineral powders and gives the powder sheen.</li>
            <li>The only downside is I ordered the lightest shade but its still not light enough for my fair skin in Winter.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not looking to cover wrinkles (I&#x27;m 22 years old).</li>
            <li>The picture is for Natural Ivory-Light 3 (which is what I wanted), the colour I received is just Natural Ivory, not the colour I needed.</li>
            <li>It made my skin look dull and lifeless, and the coverage was too light.</li>
            <li>I used Bare Minerals for a couple of years and did like the product</li>
            <li>I tried also bare minerals original and it was much prettier than the maybelline, although I found it a little dull also.</li>
            <li>I have a very light skin color which makes finding a foundation that matches me difficult.</li>
            <li>: I use EcoTools powder brushes to apply this makeup, as I found that the little brush it comes with doesn&#x27;t create a very even look.</li>
            <li>The only bad things about it are, you should definitely use a different brush, the one given isn&#x27;t so good, but no big deal.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have normal skin that gets a little oily in the heat, so I was looking for a powder foundation to wear on days out.</li>
            <li> Other major brands, i.e, L&#x27;Oreal, Physicians Formula, etc.</li>
            <li> i would recommend classic ivory if ur really pale tho!</li>
            <li> I am sad that it is becoming harder to find in the stores.  </li>
            <li> so liquid and other power foundations feel gross on my face.</li>
            <li> My skin is fair/sensitive, but \\&quot;normal\\&quot; (neither oily nor dry)</li>
            <li> Only down side is this product has been discontinued by maybelline.</li>
            <li> I have tried other foundations (both powder and liquid) that have exacerbated my acne, but this one does not.</li>
            <li> The included brush is not useful, I would use a kabuki instead.</li>
            <li> No longer use it waiting to get a little summer darker to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so light that I don&#x27;t feel weird moving my face, and it doesn&#x27;t leave me looking weird colors.</li>
            <li> waste your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It needed reapplication after a few hours.</li>
            <li> At least it does not look cakey.</li>
            <li> This is the only makeup that doesn&#x27;t look bad on my skin.</li>
            <li> No matter what shade you buy the product ends up looking like a fake orange.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I used Bare Minerals for a couple of years and did like the product but you are sucked into their revolving club cost.  The containers are much smaller than the 1 oz size you&#x27;d find in a beauty supply store like ULTA.  Got fed up with the price and started searching for an alternative.  Other major brands, i.e, L&#x27;Oreal, Physicians Formula, etc. all have talc in the ingredients.  Maybelline does not and for my money Maybelline had nailed the exact same formula as Bare Minerals and you get much more bang for your buck.  I&#x27;ve not been using it for 5 years.</li>
            <li> I use this mineral powder every day - the main reason I like it is because it gives me nice, natural coverage without breaking me out. I have tried other foundations (both powder and liquid) that have exacerbated my acne, but this one does not. My skin is fair/sensitive, but \\&quot;normal\\&quot; (neither oily nor dry) so I&#x27;m not looking to cover wrinkles (I&#x27;m 22 years old). I just want to even my skin tone and cover some pimples/acne scars. This product fits the bill, plus it is easy to find in drugstores or online and can be purchased cheaply. I like it and would recommend you give it a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I use EcoTools powder brushes to apply this makeup, as I found that the little brush it comes with doesn&#x27;t create a very even look.</li>
            <li> No matter what shade you buy the product ends up looking like a fake orange.  I have fair, ivory skin and even the lightest shade made me look like I was wearing a mask.  It doesn&#x27;t wear very well either, by the end of the day my normal skin was oily and streaky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a good mineral foundation check out L&#x27;Oreal or Philosophy&#x27;s version.  Avoid this cheap garbage!!!</li>
            <li> This has great coverage and evens out skin tone. I am not a foundation kind of gal and prefer a light face powder, so this works well.</li>
            <li> Would give 5 stars if I didn&#x27;t have to pry the plastic sifter thing off with pliers. But other than that, it&#x27;s great and makes me look nice. This is the only makeup that doesn&#x27;t look bad on my skin.</li>
            <li> I really like this foundation and the color is just right.  I&#x27;m disappointed that Maybelline no longer produces it, but this vendor was able to send it quickly and for a fair price.</li>
            <li> great ,,enough coverage when im in a rush and goes on well over my matte dream mousse cr√®me ,,but it gives a glow on its own i would recommend classic ivory if ur really pale tho!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find this product at any store, glad I found it here! My fave!</li>
            <li> Best all round makeup for a natural look.</li>
            <li> Great foundation. I have oily skin so liquid and other power foundations feel gross on my face. However this foundation does great. It feel normal to wear it and it comes in a shade light enough for me. I have a very light skin color which makes finding a foundation that matches me difficult. I would say the coverage is light, so you will need to put concealer on before you apply it if you want to cover dark circles or acne. This product is a win win for me. Love it.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and lasts all day but feels super light on the skin. Doesn&#x27;t cause any breakouts and is very smooth to the touch. The only downside is I ordered the lightest shade but its still not light enough for my fair skin in Winter. In Summer it is easier to blend but in Winter I feel I need to top it with a  finishing powder or something to lighten it up.</li>
            <li> Great products which are excellent for skin coverage. Will definitely purchase again. Only down side is this product has been discontinued by maybelline.</li>
            <li> Irritation on my skin.  No longer use it waiting to get a little summer darker to use.</li>
            <li> Feels very light on the skin and it does not make your skin oily, powdery or dry overall great product.</li>
            <li> I started wearing Mineral Power makeup when I was 16, thinking it would be better for my skin. I&#x27;ve been wearing makeup since I was 6, as a dancer, so I&#x27;ve used a lot of different kinds. By far, this is the best makeup I have ever used. 5 years later, it is the only makeup line that I&#x27;ll wear. Power foundation, blush, bronzer, finishing powder, liquid foundation, concealer, &amp; illuminator. This makeup gives the perfect coverage, and lasts throughout the day. It&#x27;s so light that I don&#x27;t feel weird moving my face, and it doesn&#x27;t leave me looking weird colors. It blends well, and covers up any imperfections.</li>
            <li> My main issue with this is that the container has nowhere to put the brush. You could buy a separate powder applicator and store it in the container.  As for the actual product, the price and quality is great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m biased from the get go because I use to wear this powder all the time until they stopped selling it in stores! Does kinda take awhile to ship but hey anything good you must wait for!</li>
            <li> I can no longer find this makeup locally. So I thought I could find it on Amazon. I love the makeup, but I will not order it again because the shipping charges were exorbitant,</li>
            <li> THIS POWDER IS AS AMAZING AS ANY OF THE PRICIER BRANDS!  MINERAL POWDER GOES ON AS SHEER AS IT IS &amp; LEAVES A FLAWLESS FINISH.  SKIP FOUNDATION &amp; BRUSH MINERAL POWDER FOR AWESOME RESULTS!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite powder, and great price. The only bad things about it are, you should definitely use a different brush, the one given isn&#x27;t so good, but no big deal. Also, I prefer the old packaging they used, the new one seems to waste a lot more powder, but if it keeps them making it, I have no problem with it. Great to use over a liquid foundation for a finished look. Love it. :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the same shade as the picture. The picture is for Natural Ivory-Light 3 (which is what I wanted), the colour I received is just Natural Ivory, not the colour I needed.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great and this container was much bigger then I expected I was super excited</li>
            <li> Great powder.  Like better than Bare Minerals!</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff.  I am sad that it is becoming harder to find in the stores.  Doesn&#x27;t make me break out like the rest. Also doesn&#x27;t get cakey like many.</li>
            <li> Of all the money I&#x27;ve spent on powder.. I have to say this is the best one for me, it&#x27;s a great mineral powder.  It&#x27;s fine so you don&#x27;t  notice that you just powdered your nose but has good coverage.  This does not clog my pores and the color blends perfect w/ my light skin tone.  On another note, I have very sensitive skin, gets hives easily and have NEVER had a problem with this powder!</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It evens out my skin tone and goes on smoothly.  I use my own brush though.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m older, my skin is sensitive to makeup and liquid makeups just don&#x27;t work well for me anymore.  Someone suggested I try mineral makeup.  I tried Maybelline&#x27;s mineral makeup and have been using it for several years now and love it.  Maybelline&#x27;s mineral foundation gives great coverage and is so quick to apply.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wears makeup.</li>
            <li> I have normal skin that gets a little oily in the heat, so I was looking for a powder foundation to wear on days out. It made my skin look dull and lifeless, and the coverage was too light. At least it does not look cakey. But the finish is too matte for my taste.&lt;br /&gt;This mineral powder does not contain bismuth oxychloride, which is present in some &#x27;higher end&#x27; mineral powders and gives the powder sheen. I tried also bare minerals original and it was much prettier than the maybelline, although I found it a little dull also. I think mineral powder foundation is just not for me.&lt;br /&gt;It needed reapplication after a few hours. The included brush is not useful, I would use a kabuki instead.</li>
